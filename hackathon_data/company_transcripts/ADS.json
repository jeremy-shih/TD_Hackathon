(Operator Instructions) In order to view the company\u2019s presentation on their website, please remember to turn off the pop-up blocker on your computer.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Ms. Julie Prozeller of FTI Consulting. Ma\u2019am, the floor is yours.","Julie Prozeller ","Thank you, operator. By now, you should have received a copy of the company\u2019s third quarter 2014 earnings release. If you haven\u2019t, please call FTI Consulting at 212-850-5721. On the call today from Alliance Data, we have Edward Heffernan, President and Chief Executive Officer, Charles Horn, Chief Financial Officer and Melisa Miller, President of Retail Credit Services.","Before we begin, I\u2019d like to remind you that some of the comments made on today\u2019s call and some of the responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risks and the uncertainties described in the company\u2019s earnings release and other filings with the SEC.

Reconciliation of those measures to GAAP will be posted on the Investor Relations website at www.alliancedata.com.","With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Edward Heffernan. Ed?","Edward Heffernan","","Great. Thanks Julie and welcome everyone to another earnings call and I know everyone has a bunch of company\u2019s reporting. So, we\u2019ll try to move with pace today. Joining me today is of course our always informative Charles Horn and Melisa Miller, who is our President of our Card Group. Charles is going to discuss the operating results, Melisa will do a deep dive on private label and I\u2019ll wrap up with a discussion of our increased \u201914 guidance and the initial cut at 2015.","So, Charles it's all yours.","Charles Horn","","Thanks, Ed. Entering 2014 we expected earnings to accelerate as 2014 progress. What we saw was a building back by the business we needed to get in front of. Accordingly we added infrastructure, primarily personnel early in the years to support the growth coming later in the year. For the first-half of 2014 this human investment had a dampening effect to our profitability as we were yet to leverage the increased payroll expense. Now that the new business is ramping, we are realizing solid expense leveraging. ","For the third quarter, revenue increased 20% to 1.3 billion, driven by double digit organic growth while adjusted EBITDA net increased 15% to 376 million. And this compares to a 6% growth rate for the first half of 2014. This improvement in EBIDTA flow through combined with a 9% decrease in diluted share count drove a 36% increase in EPS and 30% increase in core EPS. We expect to see this trend to continue in the fourth quarter of 2014. ","A final note and then we can quit talking about it. The convertible notes are gone and the warrants have been settled. The 59.9 million diluted shares outstanding is a clean moving forward. Now that number is before any shares issued as part of the pending Conversant acquisition.","Let\u2019s turn to the next slide and talk about LoyaltyOne. LoyaltyOne\u2019s revenue increased 52% to 324 million for the third quarter of 2014, mostly driven by BrandLoyalty, which added $110 million to the top line. AIR MILES revenue was 214 million for the third quarter of 2014 flat with the prior year but up 5% on a constant currency basis. The Canadian dollar was down 4% year-over-year creating a $10 million drag on revenue for the third quarter. ","Adjusted EBIDTA increased 25% to 78 million for the third quarter of 2014. BrandLoyalty contributed 21 million gross or 13 million net of the non-controlling interest for the quarter. BrandLoyalty\u2019s EBITDA margin improved 30 basis points to 19% as an improved pricing on program merchandize flowed through to the bottom line.","For AIR MILES, adjusted EBITDA was 57 million for the third quarter 2014, down 9% from the prior year and down 4% on a constant currency basis. Better redemption margins did not completely mitigate the decline in breakage revenue for the third quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margins for AIR MILES remained strong at 27%. AIR MILES reward MILES issued were down 4% compared to the third quarter of 2014. The decline is primarily due to; number one, the SoBe\u2019s purchase of Safeway which negatively impacted issuance as numerous Safeway stores were closed in order to comply with government legislation. As legacy SoBe stores rolled into the AIR MILES program, we should see this pressure abate; and number two, less promotional activity by two of our largest sponsors in the third quarter of 2014 compared to the same period last year. And this is largely a timing issue as our responses tend to vary promotional periods between years.","Our expectation is now for about 2% growth in issuances for 2014. AIR MILES redeemed increased 12% compared to the third quarter of 2013 driven by the ongoing success for instant reward program AIR MILES Cash. And just a note so you remember it, redemptions were associated with AIR MILES Cash do not have any impacts to our breakage rate. We also saw a little bit of increased redemptions related to flight and other travel redemptions.","Turning to BrandLoyalty, this European based business continues to expand overseas. Most recently we moved into Canada supporting our AIR MILES plant Safeway Canada is on track to deliver over 30% revenue growth through 2014. Contributing to the growth rates, we\u2019ve been able to deliver on two way revenue synergies or by both BrandLoyalty and the LoyaltyOne Canadian business had benefited. Looking ahead, we expect a strong fourth quarter driven by promotional activities associated with the holiday season.","Lastly, looking at Dotz for quick update and the Brazilian-coalition loyalty business added another 0.5 million collectors during the third quarter, bringing the total number of enrolled collectors to approximately 13 million. And that was our target for the end of 2014, so we\u2019re ahead of schedule. Dotz is also continuing to expand its geographical footprint and will be launching in a few additional markets by year end. Let\u2019s flip over to the next page and talk little bit about Epsilon.","Epsilon\u2019s revenue increased 6% to 378 million for the third quarter of 2014, once again driven by growth in its technology offerings. Technology revenue increased 10% year-over-year driven by the ramp up of new clients throughout several verticals and increased digital volumes. Agility Harmony saw over a 20% increase in volumes compared to the third quarter of 2013, the growth attributable to both new clients and expanded programs with existing ones. As the Harmony program continues to evolve to meet client needs, it will expand on its current capabilities and enrich its multichannel approach to marketing.","While we haven\u2019t talked about the pending acquisition yet Conversant's capabilities will immediately beef up Harmony's growing display, mobile, video and social digital channels. Data offerings reversed last quarter\u2019s slowdown growing 6% compared to the prior year quarter. Growth was fuelled by increased demand in the online space from both large existing clients and several new online ones. Similar to the new wins in technology, we expect to see this momentum continue through the balance of the year as this new business ramps during the quarter. ","Agency revenue grew 3% during the third quarter of 2014. Strength within the auto sector was slightly tempered by softness experienced within a few other verticals. In addition, we are slightly behind on the rollout of two new agency clients, so we didn\u2019t flow through the revenue we expected for the third quarter. However, we expect the revenue growth rate to pick up in the fourth quarter as these two clients start on board.","Adjusted EBITDA increased 7% to 84 million for the third quarter of 2014. EBITDA margins improved by 30 basis points from last year primarily due to a shift in products\u2019 mix toward a higher margin technology offerings.","And with that I will turn it over to Melisa to discuss private label.","Melisa Miller","Thank you, Charles. Good morning everyone. I am delighted to be your wakeup this morning. Let\u2019s go ahead and turn to slide seven, I am really pleased to report that private label's continued strong revenue and income growth was once again fueled by increases in both card holder spending as well as a number of new signings. For the 11th consecutive quarter, revenue grew by double-digits increasing 17% versus Q3 of last year. The revenue growth outpaced our expense growth by 3% as Charles mentioned further widening the operating efficiencies we began saying in the second quarter.","Provision expense increased 26% as we needed to provide for the large increases in receivables. This performance really underscores the importance of making the right upfront investments, even if it upsets the apple cart a bit when it comes to quarterly earnings. Specifically you may recall that we hired nearly 1,000 new associates at the beginning of the year to handle the significant number of new client signings and the expansion within our current brand partners. This caused a great deal of pressure on our first-half performance, but was really essential to getting a number of new programs up and running both on time and with the quality delivery our brands have come to expect from us. Today we see the pay-off, earnings, EBITDA, net of funding cost jumped this quarter to over 18% versus the prior year and tripled the growth during the first-half of this year.","So let\u2019s turn now to Slide 8 and discuss some of the fundamentals that are really driving these results. Our receivables growth continued to be driven by a very balanced approach of strong organic growth within our core which we define as our pre-2012 partners, as well as new partners and acquired portfolios. In terms of organic growth, we continue to see credit sales as high as three times that of our grand partners' total sales. This performance has been and continues to be the result of leveraging rich data for deep insights across multiple delivery channels. And we\u2019re measurable; we saw an increase of tender share north of 175 basis points versus Q3 of 2013. Credit sales were up 23% overall with our core sales growth up 12%. And we continue to emphasize the core growth because it truly demonstrates our commitment to deliver a consistent value and growth to our long standing relationships.","And we would tell you we do this while simultaneously adding new partners fueling our high growth model. So, when summary this leads to another quarter of average receivables growth north of 20%. For the quarter we saw total growth rate of 22% with organic growth of 20%. And this is against the backdrop of a moderate post-recession growth rate and a low single-digit for total consumer revolving debt. So not only do we continue to drive value for our legacy partners, but we\u2019ve achieved this growth rate by also increasing our new relationships as well. You see us deliberately transition in recent years and moving from adding five or so new partners per year, which was giving us roughly $400 million vintage of average receivables and roughly a 10% growth rate, to today where we\u2019re adding around 50 new partners per year translating into about $2 billion in vintage receivables and a 20% or better growth rate.","We expect this receivables growth to continue into Q4 and 2015. We will continue to onboard a number of previously announced partners. We are delighted to welcome Meijer and BJ's Wholesale Club in addition to new partners not yet announced. Our portfolio quality improved this quarter with a principal charge-off rate of 4% for Q3 a full 30 basis points better than the comparable period in 2013. This rate also compares favourably to the 2Q rate of 4.5% reflecting normal seasonal trends. Trends are now suggesting that charge-off rates bottomed out although we still expect to see stable loss rates in 2015 due to the mix of our new partners.","Delinquency rates are down year-over-year at 4.4% versus 4.5% this time last year and looking forward, we expect to see delinquencies follow typical seasonal trends of this Q3 level and do not anticipate any pressure on our forecasted losses for the year. So now let\u2019s transition to our outlook for further growth in 2015 and beyond. By year-end, we will have north of 135 coveted partner programs generating over $10 billion in ending receivables. We believe the total market for this highly customized data intense of white-glove approach is about three times our current state or roughly $30 billion and it's represented by about 400 companies. So these stats really confirm that our proven track record of 20% plus growth over the last several years still really has tremendous runway. You\u2019ll see us continue to selectively engage new potential partners most of which neither had a program or abandoned an existing program in the past and when you combine the growth potential of these start-up card loyalty programs with our demonstrated growth across existing partners we would expect to average similar growth rates over the next several years. You\u2019ll see that roughly three quarters of this growth will come through a combination of tender share growth at our existing long-term partners and from the ramp-up of these new brands and remaining 25% will come from program acquisitions where we transition an existing program from another issuer. ","You\u2019ve asked us previously to comment on why partners are choosing us. And we would tell you the answer is still the same. Our partners today are under a tremendous pressure, shoppers are clearly more informed now than they ever have been before and are demanding the best possible value. And the old school ways of driving sales through just general promotions are simply no longer optimal for our brands or relevant for our customers. Instead partners realize that different customer segments need different marketing approaches and to understand the customer best you need deep rich data specifically first party transactional data and that\u2019s where we come in. It\u2019s not new news to anyone on the phone that we\u2019re a marketing company solely focused on driving spending in royalty. Today across our 36 million active cardholders you will find one of our partner cards in the wallets of one in 10 adults n one in five women.","And as we expanded in new markets and products and co-brand we\u2019re seeing shopping trends that point to even greater potential for penetration. For example specifically for those co-brand partners that had a previous program we are demonstrating our ability to grow the re-launched program faster than their prior experience and we are seeing that our co-brand card holders are spending more and are more engaged than comparable non-card holders.","So simply put we\u2019ve taken the best of what we know from 20 plus years of a customer first brand first private label approach and combine that with a deeper view into the card holders lifestyle via their co-brand spend outside of their favourite brands. In addition we continue to invest and innovate and expand our presence in all channels where our brand partners and card members interact.","This includes our very own mobile virtual card that allows our cardholders to access their card and all of the benefits that go with it via their smartphone. And we thought it made sense we\u2019re on the phone today to really take this opportunity to address some of the recent articles around Apple Pay and similar emerging payment tools.","We want to be very clear when it comes to presence in markets, alliance data and our partners will enjoy flexibility and choice. We will however take a more equal opportunity approach by making tools available that support virtually all iPhones and Androids and other card member tools, so that our folks can choose a solution that\u2019s best suited for them. I can tell you today we don\u2019t believe the swipe is broken. Our active card members choose to carry their cards for the unique and full suite of loyalty offerings that the card provides. That said we acknowledge that wallets really are intriguing to consumers in general, as it does create a level of security in some ways convenient telesales of value.","But our card members have also told us that they want to interact with their favourite brands beyond just to secure purchase feature. So we believe we can enhance the card member experience while combining convenience, value, security and rapid and a large bow with our signature loyalty model.","So our strategy is going to be to exist alongside wallets like Apple Pay while taking the card member experience beyond payments as we do this today.","Now to continue to do this effectively we will retain the ability to collect first party enhanced transactional data which as you know cannot be done through some of the proposed solutions you\u2019ve read about lately. And it\u2019s really this type of data that fuels the unique loyalty offerings our card members value.","So let me walk you through a verbal representation of how we view adding value in this space, while retaining access to that treasured first party transactional data. So let\u2019s turn if we will to Page 9, and imagine for a moment that Amanda is browsing through sweaters at her favourite store. She uses her mobile phone again any mobile phone, not just an iPhone 6 to scan a QR code accepting an invitation to apply for a card.","Our fast track app downloads and with very few strokes Amanda completes the application, it really is very quick. Remember these tools were all developed for retailers at point of sale. Within seconds of submitting our application Amanda receives an approval and magically her digital card is displayed and ready for shopping. Amanda can now immediately view her credit line, acceptance store customized offers and when she finishes her shopping and pays using her new mobile card she consistently spends 40% or more by using her mobile device than she will spend in any other channel.","As she leaves the store she can now view our digital receipts, her rewards points that she\u2019s earned for her purchase and begin to interact with her favourite brand. So we\u2019ve view this approach to be far more holistic representation of what our brands are telling us they need and our card members tell us have value and what\u2019s important for the team to notice, this is all in market today. So we don\u2019t have to wait for our brand partners to enable NFC technology on their end.","On a final note we received a number of inbound enquiries from some of our major partners asking about the conversion transaction. They\u2019ve really noticed that Amazon in particular move to utilize its first party transactional data for targeted display ads and our partners are really seeking ways to counter that activity and view us as a trusted third party to protect their most important assets, their data and their customers.","So we have covered a great deal here so I\u2019ll close with a brief summary. We would tell you that the outlook remains very, very bright, we have locked down funding costs, stable credit quality, strong receivables growth, we\u2019re seeing operational efficiencies and access to the golden standard of unique transactional data and a privilege to serve highly engaged brand partners.","So we would tell you that all is good within our line of business. Charles back to you.","Charles Horn","","Thanks Melisa. Let\u2019s flip over to page 10 and we\u2019ll do a quick update on liquidity. At the corporate level our liquidity increased to 1.4 billion at September 30, 2014 after we issued 600 million of new term notes during the third quarter. Year-to-date we spent about 500 million on the brand loyalty acquisition and a share buyback program. Liquidity at our banks remains strong at $3.7 billion. We continue to take advantage of receptive debt markets to lower current funding rates and lock in longer term fixed rate money. Approximately 78% of our bank borrowings are fixed rates with an average maturity now of about 22 months. No dividends were paid to the ADS period fund during the quarter as we retained capital to banks to support the on-boarding of approximately 600 million and acquired credit card portfolios during the fourth quarter of 2014. We expect dividends to resume to the parent company at the beginning of 2015.","Lastly, the buyback program was suspended during the third quarter due to pending Conversant acquisition. Year-to-date, we expensed through an 18 million of our 400 million board authorized program. We remain committed to the buyback program and will look to resume buybacks post-closing of the acquisition.","With that, I will turn it over to Edward.","Edward Heffernan","Great. Thanks Charles. I think I\u2019ll just -- before we hit \u201914 full year guidance I just wanted to sort of finish up on any final comments on Q3. To me the takeaway is in Q3. It\u2019s pretty hard to find a lot of words on the quarter. In fact I think the big concern that I think people expressed to us for the first six months of this year was all about the upfront loading of 1,000 people that we brought on board and will that eventually payoff in enhanced revenue and earnings in our card business. And clearly we saw today that that\u2019s exactly what did take place.","So, moving EBITDA growth even at business from 6% in the first half to 18% in Q3 really demonstrates the benefits of taking a little pain upfront for the big gain going forward. And so I think that\u2019s the big story that it was proven out that that was a good use of our time, energy and investment, and we appreciate those for being patience as this plays out. I would say also in Q3 I think BrandLoyalty again continues to outperform our expectations. As I\u2019ve mentioned before, they did about 55 million all-in in terms of EBITDA last year. They\u2019re going to do close to 100 million this year. That business is absolutely booming over in Europe primarily despite a lot of the macro wins that are out there. In fact, the business is the type of business that will tend to do extremely well in a slowing environment from a macro perspective because it has to do with loyalty program giving value to the consumer at the supermarket. So it actually is almost countercyclical, which is good news.","I would say the one data point that frankly I think was disappointing was the fact that our AIR MILES issued in Canada was light. And as Charles talked about, some of that was timing, or primarily timing from when we were going to get the SoBe\u2019s conversion of accounts into the system that\u2019s been delayed till Q4. Nonetheless, that was a bit of a surprise in Q3 and I think Q4 hopefully it looks like it\u2019s snapping back pretty nicely. But other than that, overall I think everything else came in where we wanted it to.","So with that being said, let\u2019s go to the page that has \u201814 guidance on it, and we\u2019ll go right to the bottom line which is we had strong over performance. We\u2019ll once again bump up our core EPS to 12.40. To remind folks we first increased guidance in February when we reported Q4 of \u201913 and we increased in Q1, increased in Q2, increased in Q3. So, needless to say, I would suggest as a trend there. And it looks like we\u2019re going to wind up the year very nicely. So, if trends continue, hopefully, we\u2019ll finish up the year with some additional good news.","That being said, we also want to call out the fact that we are bringing on a loss of new business in our card side. And as Charles has talked about in the past, the way it works which is a little bit frankly goofy as far as I am concerned, is that you have to load up your reserves and hence take expenses before you actually generate the revenues from those files that are coming on board. That will dampen a little bit what Q4, might be, from a run rate perspective. But all it does is defer the profits out until the following year. So it\u2019s once again a bit of a timing thing and a bit of headache from an accounting perspective. But the net result is you\u2019re not losing profits you\u2019re just deferring them.","That being said, we still expect our earnings to be up almost 25% to $12.40 a share from 10 bucks the prior year. Of significance to me of course is the fact the organic growth is so strong. In a weakening macro environment from what everyone seems to be saying in fact what we\u2019re looking at is an organic growth rate that is almost four times real GDP. So that\u2019s actually above our long term growth of about 3x GDP and so that bodes extremely well as we move from \u201914 into \u201915. So revenue we expect north of 20% of which 10% of that is purely organic growth rate. Also, you\u2019re seeing that the adjusted EBITDA is going to come in the mid-teens and again that was one of the areas of concern earlier in the year from folks we\u2019ve heard from regarding the single-digit growth rate. Again that\u2019s snapped back very nicely as those programs have ramped up.","Bottom line is very strong organic growth this year of 10% or more, brand loyalty again is probably get the gold star in terms of topline will be up 30% EBITDA, up over 60%. And then despite sort of the weakness in terms of the paying consumer as well as the issuance side AIR MILES itself is in fact growing this year. We expect both revs and EBITDA to be up a couple of points for the year once you adjust for the Canadian dollar. So, the business is growing and we look for a fairly strong jump up for \u201915. Epsilon is running sort of 7% top, EBITDA up around 5%. And then finally we talked about private label, topline is running around 17%, adjusted EBITDA net around 15%. So all the businesses are growing, I think one of the nice things about our model for people who have listened to me at least for 54 quarters is that our businesses cycle at different times.","And that actually lends it is up to a nice strong consistent performance, year-in and year-out. So taken as a whole we expect to finish this year very strong with consistent growth as we jump off \u201915. So, let\u2019s turn the page and talk about the initial cut at 2015. Obviously, everyone is I guess enthralled with what\u2019s going on in the world today and the macro wins and concerns about double dips and triple dip recessions and everything else from our perspective. What you find is the good news is we have very strong visibility into \u201915 the way our businesses are structured and the way things ramp-up here. As I told people in the past there are many times where we announce real big deals, real exciting deals with new clients, but they don\u2019t mean anything to the current year it's really drive the following couple of years and that\u2019s the case here.","So, what we did is we layered in the Conversant deal expecting that to close by year-end in with that we would expect revenues to be about $6.6 billion, next year up 25%. We would expect our core EPS to grow around 20%, somewhere around $14.80 to $15. Again keeping in mind that we\u2019re just putting a stake in the ground at this point in the year and obviously we\u2019ll refine it as we have in the past as the quarters play out. But this is guidance that we think is to be solid, adjusted EBITDA and we\u2019re approaching $2 billion on that, so it's really beginning to crank up from that perspective.","So, I think that that should hopefully give people some comfort in the sense of two things. One is in \u201914, we had sort of that concern in the first-half it has played out very nicely in Q3 and will in Q4 about bringing on all those folks that was a pretty good bet that we made. I think the acquisition of BrandLoyalty has performed better than expected. I think that was also a pretty good bet that we made and so as we move into \u201915, I think we can feel comfortable with these numbers as a good starting point. ","One of the things that I have here flag that Charles keeps telling me to mention is the fact that because of the very, very high growth rate in the card business and the build-up of those receivables again what you\u2019re doing is you are deferring or dampening the results of \u201915 by as much as $0.25, because you're essentially bringing on a huge book of business, you have to reserve for it and that defers the benefit out into \u201916 and \u201917. ","And quite frankly in my opinion if we can grow earnings 20% plus we can have organic growth than the double-digits and we\u2019re still setting up tremendous visibility for \u201916 and \u201917, we\u2019ll do that all day long. But I can now take the sticky off the page that Charles made me put on there.","Let\u2019s go into the specifics for 2015, for private label. As Melisa talked about, its again, it's one of those interesting businesses where in the past prior to the great recession we tended to grow a couple of points faster than consumer revolving debt which used to grow about 7%. And then consumer revolving debt tanked and has grown virtually not at all for the last five or six years, maybe a couple of points and yet we\u2019re growing the receivables 20 plus percent. So, clearly what\u2019s going on is the migration of the clients away from the general spend in brand building and towards the very specific first party data driven targeted marketing that we specialize in. And that continues to be a trend that we\u2019re going to ride for a long time. And as a result, we would expect private label to have another very strong year add a couple of billion of receivables. For 2015, we would expect with that growth rate obviously you\u2019re going to have a bit of compression on your yields as you ramp up those programs, nothing too severe, however. We don\u2019t see any reason why we shouldn\u2019t target another $2 billion of new signings. For 2015, the pipeline looks quite strong.","As Melisa also mentioned, we\u2019re not seeing anything out there that suggests a big jump on the loss rate or funding rates or anything like that. Most of our funding book is locked down. Loss rates look extremely good as we go into 2015. As we said the last couple of years, we\u2019re not going to make our money on riding losses down, or funding cost down, we\u2019re making our money on growing the business itself. And that continues to be the game plan going forward. I think we\u2019re in good shape there. Of interest I think is also something that people should know, which is in a rising rate environment actually our profits are enhanced because our book of funding is fixed and yet our assets which are the cards actually adjust upwards. So, it\u2019s a little bit the reverse of what people think. ","Overall, we would expect high double digit revenue and low double digit EBITDA growth for \u201915. In LoyaltyOne specifically we\u2019re talking about the AIR MILES program. We do see the return of mid-single digit top line growth and high single digit EBITDA growth for the AIR MILES program. From what we\u2019re seeing in the backlog it does look like we\u2019re going to have a pretty decent \u201915 on the AIR MILES side which is nice. We are seeing a build in terms of sponsors who are stepping up and wanting to get ahead of this sort of consumer weakness and spend some more. So we expect issuance to be up 4% primarily because of that and also because quite frankly the comps are a lot easier.","At BrandLoyalty, it\u2019s a little bit of who knows at this point whether they\u2019re going to slow down to the mid-teens growth. But I think we\u2019ll put a stake in the ground say we would like to see mid-teens growth in both top line and EBITDA for brand loyalty that would be a very positive thing. What we\u2019re seeing right now is we would expect a very strong jump in the first half of the year already based on what they book. So, that seems to be a business that continues to chug right along regardless of the macro wins.","And then finally in Brazil, the program keeps growing. I mean it\u2019s one of those things where it\u2019s not in the financials. It\u2019s not on the balance sheet. It\u2019s an asset that\u2019s going to be very valuable that is very valuable. We own 37% of it. And we continue to grow collectors. We would expect another 3 million or 4 million collectors to be added in Brazil during \u201915. Again, our goal is to get to 25 million to 30 million collectors and at that point hopefully the financials will begin to resemble that of the Canadian AIR MILES program. We also expect to launch in at least one of the two major regions if not both.","So that\u2019s private label loyalty, let\u2019s go to Epsilon, pretty much a lot of the same high single digit organic rev and adjusted EBITDA growth. We have a descent backlog. We continue to see sort of a balanced growth profile for Epsilon as we move into \u201915. We\u2019re getting, a lot of interest is coming out of the desire to have loyalty platforms built for the major companies across the world. Because of the fact that if it\u2019s not going to be a private label card and a general loyalty program also allows us to access the first party transactional data and then do what we do here. And so huge amount of interest in launching new loyalty programs. ","One of the really nice things also in Q3 I would say if I could highlight it would be obviously we spend a whole bunch of money on the new digital platform called Harmony. And it was very nice to see that our transactions had bumped up into the 20% growth range for the first time in many, many, many years. So it looks like the Harmony platform is being received extremely well and that\u2019s also very important as we talked about Conversant.","Speaking of which, the deal with Conversant we still expect to add about 670 million on top of 230 million revenue and EBITDA. And again we have not factored into the numbers at this point the revenue or cost synergies, we just don\u2019t know when the deal is going to close. We\u2019re assuming yearend. But again we\u2019ll update that as the year progresses; we certainly expect to get something. And we expect high single-digit organic top-end EBITDA probably the most important thing to us is to get off the mark quickly and get things set up such that we can have the Conversant folks in aggraded with especially Melisa\u2019s folks were getting a lot of interest especially from the private label client in terms of what do we do to counter what Amazon just announced which is using their own first party data to do target display. We need to offer solution to our 135 clients. And so, we want to arm them with the tool kit that's second to none. And that\u2019s a critical thing we do right out of the gate and if we can get that done, I think we\u2019ll be in good shape.","Consolidated, we\u2019re looking at over $1 billion of free cash flow before regulatory support and you can read the rest in terms of interest expense and earn outs and everything else. But the bottom line is that we expect regardless of the macro environment to have a very significant 2015 following this year\u2019s very strong performance. ","You know we\u2019re running along but I think it was important that Melisa got a chance to share with you what we\u2019re doing on the digital side in terms of the virtual cards and everything else because there was a lot of noise in that information out there when Apple Pay was announced. So, we got a pretty slip solution which I think this is going to be fund. ","So to finish up is just sort of a little look at the past, the present and the future, and what we decided to do is go all the way back before the big recession hit and theorize how were we doing, how did we do during the worst recession since the great depression and how we done during the recovery and this should give people a great deal of comfort in terms of we\u2019re not going anyway regardless of what the macro environment does. Frankly I think the macro environment in U.S. and what we\u2019re seeing on cardholder spend from what we\u2019re seeing on that credit quality would suggest that I think we\u2019re going to have a holiday that\u2019s going to be slightly better than last year, it won\u2019t be huge, but it certainly will be better than last year from everything we\u2019re seeing.","We\u2019re seeing the American consumer at least being very cautious in terms of leveraging up, which gives us a great deal of comfort in terms of the ability to continue to grow. But at the same time you can say whatever you want about the jobs being created. But still add 3 million jobs; you\u2019re going to add income to the economy. So, we think that the macro environment especially here in the U.S. is quite good. As we move into 2015 everyone would like it to be stronger, it won\u2019t be, but nonetheless this is a perfect environment for us. And you\u2019ll see that we tend to play through pretty much anything, and if you were to go back all the way to \u201907, I think what you\u2019ll find is that we\u2019re very consistent in terms of what we\u2019re printing, since 2007 and including the great recession revenues and EBITDA and earnings have gone up at an annual rate of 16%, 14% and 18% respectively. So, that compares to the overall market which is roughly 2% topline and 5% in operating earnings. So, the model continues to be a strong outperformer vis-\u00e0-vis the others in the marketplace and as a result shareholders have been rewarded with an annual return of 18% since \u201907, again versus 4% for the overall market.","So, the bottom line of all of this is we expect a very powerful combination of high growth, strong free cash flow and consistent earnings, businesses or cycle at different rates and as we look into \u201915, we expect to see another very, very strong year. ","The final note I\u2019ll mention is that there has been a lot of questions on the Conversant deal. And frankly I think there is a lot of things that will clean themselves up as \u201915 progresses first and probably one of the most common one is that they have a model that is difficult to really predict in terms of the quarters. And as a result it's been a hit or miss type approach with Wall Street in terms of guidance and so once we folded into us certainly we can take care of that very quickly as it smooths into the overall bigger entity itself. ","Also the legacy commodity type businesses there continue to burn-off; it's going to be less than 20% of the overall company. And so overall as Melisa talked about what we are focused on is the transition of that business into a business where retailers view Conversant as the trusted third party to hold their most valuable asset which is their data. We\u2019ll use that data along with the data that we have at Epsilon and at private label for those clients and use that to again have a toolkit that\u2019s second to none for the marketplace. So when you put all the pieces together, you will have the ability to have first party data, analytics, the marketing, the creative and the distribution across those old channels as well as the newer digital channel in the emerging channels in targeted display.","So, appreciate everyone\u2019s patience. Again, I understand it\u2019s been, it\u2019s a challenging environment out there in the markets but I can tell you from our perspective we feel very good about the rest of this year and we feel very good about \u201915. So that being said, we\u2019ll open it up for few questions and let everyone back to work.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. The floor is now open for your questions [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.","Sanjay Sakhrani - KBW","Good morning. I guess first question on AIR MILES, I guess you guys are expecting some pretty strong growth in the fourth quarter. How confident are you guys in terms of issuance? And then if it\u2019s supposed to be that strong in the fourth quarter, why can\u2019t it be stronger next year? Is that just conservatism that you\u2019re baking in?","Edward Heffernan","I\u2019d say there is two answers to that Sanjay, so one is we do expect more promotional activity by some of our larger card sponsors in Q4. The other part of this is we do expect some of the SoBe\u2019s legacy stores get into the program in Q4. We\u2019d hope to do it in Q3, ran a little bit late. And so I do expect to get a little lift in Q4 from that. So then the second part of your question could we get a little upside to 2015, sure, there is a way for some potential for upside.","Sanjay Sakhrani - KBW","Okay, I guess and then follow up just two questions on private label. I appreciate you guys talking about that the impact of reserve builds from inorganic growth. But aren\u2019t there additional impacts from growth like goodwill amortization, merchant incentives, et cetera, that also weigh in on results in the first year of operations? ","And then I guess secondly, Melisa, maybe you could just about because we have you online, how much of your discussion, when you\u2019re winning these deals is around price? I mean how many times are you the lowest price when you win the deal? And then secondly, are you talking to Apple about ways you could partner together? Thanks.","","Edward Heffernan","I\u2019ll take this first one Sanjay and I\u2019ll look at it from a core EPS standpoint. You\u2019re right. We were somewhat conservative in what we gave you, the fact we only isolated the provision build. Beyond it when you acquire portfolios particularly late in the year you do get a couple of negative effects. The first one you\u2019re talking about is more your FAS 91. So about fair value in your acquired portfolios, you\u2019re do not getting any revenue streams coming from the acquired file as it starts to turn.","The other piece of it is to your point the customer givebacks usually are project credit sales. So in month one and month two following the acquisition of the file you\u2019ll be paying a percentage back minus project credit sales. The AR starts to stick at your second cycle your third cycle so you\u2019ll start getting your revenue in month three and four. There is a timing disconnect there. That obviously is an additional drag on core EPS as well. But what we highlighted was pure the provision build because it\u2019s easiest to calculate.","Melisa Miller","Good morning Sanjay. I will take the two questions with respect to price value and Apple Pay. We\u2019ll tell you the criteria that we use when we embark on a journey to win a brand is really around first and foremost as the partners see this as a loyalty tool, can we get access to that cherished data that we can then use to create what we would tell you is the biggest element for us which is generating incremental sales. So across all of our brands we\u2019ve done the math a zillion times, we estimate that between 35% to 40% of the sales that we generate are truly incremental to the brand and then we work on what is the deal structure that works for the brand and for us. So that was a long one to answer to, no, price is not the driver. We\u2019ve got some folks that probably wish that would be, but that is not how we win deals. ","With respect to Apple, yes, we are talking to them about what would be the criteria or what would be involved in making general purpose cards available to be used in this new environment should card members chose to do so.","Sanjay Sakhrani - KBW","Okay, great. Thank you. And not private label though?","Melisa Miller","No, not private label, we currently have no plans to do that Sanjay. We believe the offering that we described presents a very rich experience. And our brands are simply not going to want to have their customer relationships impacted for the sake of tap and go convenience.","Sanjay Sakhrani - KBW","Okay, great. Thank you","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin McVeigh with Macquarie.","Kevin McVeigh - Macquarie Securities","Thanks. Ed or Charles, it seems like your organic growth rate toward GDP continues to step up on a multiple basis. Is that primarily the private label or is that just all businesses firing on cylinders here?","Edward Heffernan","I think it\u2019s a situation where you got very strong organic growth, pretty much across the business except for AIR MILES. AIR MILES is a bit rough this year. But if you look at BrandLoyalty you\u2019ve got 20% - 30% organic growth, strong high single digit organic growth within Epsilon, pretty much all organic. And then you\u2019re seeing a very high 17%-18% organic growth rate within private label. So the only one not there currently is AIR MILES about 2% growth this year on a constant currency basis. Clearly it\u2019s one where there is a few things going on in the market that\u2019s limiting this but overall I\u2019d say across the board very strong organic growth, just a little bit of softness to their models.","Kevin McVeigh - Macquarie Securities","And then with eBay splitting PayPal in two, how are you folks positioned to capture incremental opportunity of that split?","Edward Heffernan","","I think it\u2019s too early to tell at this point, we have a partnership with PayPal that seems to be going pretty well. So we\u2019ll continue to ride that and otherwise your guess is as good as mine.","Melisa Miller"," ","Structurally it would have no impact.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Ashish Sabadra with Deutsche Bank.","Ashish Sabadra - Deutsche Bank","","A quick question on the fiscal year \u201815 revenue growth guidance and maybe a follow up to an earlier question. Basically now you\u2019re guided to more like 12.5%, 13% organic growth which is an acceleration from 10% and with all the vintage receivables that you have signed up over the last two years and going forward. Should we see an uptick in the organic growth going forward?","Edward Heffernan"," ","Well I think again we don\u2019t want to get too far over our skews here, it\u2019s what we\u2019re looking at again as our model is let\u2019s do organic three times what the market or GDP is, what we are seeing you are correct is that it has accelerated from 3x to more like 4x. And I think a lot of that has to do with just this massive shift in clients' spend away from all the brand builds spend and into the data driven target marketing. And that\u2019s a secular trend over and above what\u2019s going on in the macro-environment and we're the beneficiary of that, and that\u2019s one of the reasons why you\u2019re seeing the pickup. But let\u2019s not get too far over our skews, we could probably say 4x GDP organic for next year but that\u2019s the best as far as we\u2019ll go at this point.","Charles Horn"," ","Everything need to pick upon as the acquired policy late in the year from an acquired policy standpoint until it turns 12 months, that\u2019s considered non-organic or in-organic. So that\u2019s where you\u2019re getting that pick up by doing the simple math at 12% is the acquired we\u2019re seeing in Q3 and Q4 this year.","Ashish Sabadra - Deutsche Bank","And just quickly on the EPS guidance, this time you have given a range traditionally you just gave a number. I was just wondering if there is a change in philosophy on your guidance, is it still the whole -- the same conservative guidance to show we expect that going forward?","Edward Heffernan"," ","We would never say it\u2019s the same conservative guidance. What we always do is, it\u2019s consistent with -- look its October. We haven\u2019t even done Q4 yet but based on what we\u2019re seeing, what we\u2019re saying is the stake in the ground is $14.80 or $15 bucks which we feel very comfortable with. And should things continue to go well as the year plays out we\u2019ll revisit that. But we\u2019re not going to go out there and stretch too far in October and let\u2019s just see how \u201815 plays out. But I think putting the stake in the ground at 20% is a pretty decent starting point.","Ashish Sabadra - Deutsche Bank","And just one final question on Conversant acquisition. You talked about and Melisa talked about the synergies between the private label and the Conversant acquisition. I was wondering if you could provide some more colour around cross sell synergies between Conversant and Epsilon. How does that help bridge the gaps that you had in your traditional Epsilon offering and a potential for cross selling Conversant into your Epsilon client base?","Edward Heffernan"," ","Sure, I mean we talked about it\u2019s interesting that a lot of the inbound interest is coming first from sort of Melisa\u2019s folks but on the overall Epsilon side obviously you have got a few 100 very large clients. And with a lot of those clients today we are the keeper of their transactional information. And it was sort of the -- they trust us with that first party transactional data. That\u2019s exactly the model that Conversant is transitioning towards which is, hey we are the trusted third party keeper of your information. We\u2019re not going to turn around and turn it into a competitive tool against you as someone else might in the digital space. And I think you put those two together then the client should feel very comfortable that we are the right solution as sort of this neutral holder of their sort of most precious information.","So you put those together, that's sort of the first step that everyone needs to get comfortable with. And then with that what we did is very simply, this is a build or buy. And with Conversant\u2019s presence in the targeted digital display and also it\u2019s emerging presence in mobile and social, in video those are all going to basically accelerate what Epsilon was building and how the Agility Harmony platform which is primarily permission based email to start with has already jumped off very nicely. ","So you put all these assets together and you\u2019re going to have a toolbox as far as we\u2019re concerned second to none and frankly we\u2019re going to go out there and arm our clients whether they are card clients, whether they are Epsilon clients, whether they are AIR MILES clients or BrandLoyalty clients with the full suite of products that can hit any channel at any time. And frankly we think it will be an offering second to none. It\u2019s a very precise way of hitting the market which is first party transactional data driven marketing. But it\u2019s our sandbox and it\u2019s what we\u2019re good at. So, we\u2019re trying very hard to get off on a good foot here.","Ashish Sabadra - Deutsche Bank","That\u2019s great, congrats on the solid results.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Georg Mihalos with Credit Suisse.","Georg Mihalos - Credit Suisse","Thanks guys. Maybe just to start off again on the private label side question for Charles and Melisa, looking at the operating expense line within private labels from pretty stable to last three quarters, certainly the last two. How should we think about that going forward into \u201915? And then maybe somewhat related to that the gross yield coming down about 50 or 60 basis points annually, is that a good way to think about it going forward as you grow your portfolio and venture into a cobranded and other things?","Melisa Miller","Good morning Georg, its Melisa, I\u2019ll take a stab at those and Charles I\u2019d invite you to back me up if I miss anything. With respect to the yield, so what we\u2019re seeing really the areas of the impact of a number of new brands that we\u2019re bringing on, and a little bit of the environment as well. So I think what you\u2019re seeing for what we\u2019ve communicated is about what you could expect. And what we would tell you about operating leverage is we really invested in two key areas. First of all, the people in order to support our new partners but also we can\u2019t ignore the growth that we\u2019ve seen in our current brand partner. So as they execute more programs, as they need greater bandwidth, we can never take our eye off the ball of those partners that have trusted us for 25 years. So, we would tell you that the expense leverage that we\u2019ve seen in particular in Q3 is something that we\u2019ll continue to be focused on, and soon we\u2019ll begin to level that out.","Georg Mihalos - Credit Suisse","Okay, great. And then maybe shifting gears to the Epsilon business. Charles, is the right way to think about that business, ex the Conversant acquisition, that revenue growth and EBITDA growth should sort of frac in line going forward and probably the upside here in the third quarter was a little bit agencies of sort of a revenue mix shift?","Charles Horn","I would say that\u2019s accurate. If we\u2019re looking for single digit growth in revenues and you would have the same expectations for EBITDA. To say it another way, do I expect that the EBITDA margins of 21.5-22 to expand appreciably over the next few years, probably not. There could be some coming through it. I think the best opportunity for us is as we on board Conversant more of a product transaction based revenue stream that\u2019s where you can get more of your flow-through better margin expansion. But with the base Epsilon business having a high element of service, service is people driven very difficult to leverage people, especially when you\u2019re in an inflationary world right now in terms of the cost of these technology employees probably consistent margins for base Epsilon but some improvements coming from the CNVR acquisition.","Georg Mihalos - Credit Suisse","Great, thanks guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Togut with Evercore.","David Togut - Evercore","Thank you. Good morning. Ed and Charles, you called for $1 billion in free cash flow for 2015 prior to regulatory capital support. Can you update us on capital allocation priorities, particularly with your stock where it is and acquisition opportunities you might have in the pipeline?","Edward Heffernan","Sure, I\u2019ll take a shot at it. I think one of the many use of having a lot of free cash flow is you do have a fair amount of flexibility here. I think our leverage rate, help me out Charles, with the Conversant deal, is still only going to be in the mid-2s. So it\u2019s very modestly leveraged even with that deal itself. So I would think that once we get the Conversant deal behind us that means we\u2019ll have done the BrandLoyalty deal in \u201913 and the Conversant deal end of \u201914 beginning of \u201915. My gut tells me right now we would then probably or most likely, turn our guns back on sort of the buyback approach because especially at these levels I would think certainly there is a good opportunity to do something.","I mean this is the time where you want to back up the truck a little bit. So we want to get Conversant done and out of the way. And then my guess is right now \u201915 and its likely you will see a big deal from us in \u201915 and more likely that you will see more of a capital return approach especially in these markets.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Tulu Yunus with Nomura Securities.","Tulu Yunus - Nomura Securities","Thanks for squeezing me in. Just a couple of quick ones, one is just on the acquired files in fourth quarter. Given that we\u2019re getting pretty close to the holiday season, can you just size any risk as far as whether those may not actually convert in 4Q and may actually be a \u201915 event, how do you feel about that converting this year? ","Melisa Miller","","We\u2019ve been working on these files for a number of months. In fact both BJ's and Meijer\u2019s in particular had working actions for year. So, we are very, very confident these files will convert.","Tulu Yunus - Nomura Securities","","Okay, great. And then just so secondly on the Conversant deal and the opportunity for revenue synergies, I mean it sounds like a big part of that could be the ability to cross sell Dotomi and their CRM services and wrap that around what you guys have with agility and sell that into your private label client base. Now the question is with a lot of your clients -- with your private label clients you already sort of do a lot targeted marketing for them with their private label cards. So what would be the benefit for those clients to actually say okay, yes, maybe a CRM solution like Dotomi makes sense?","Edward Heffernan","Well I think it's a great question. Certainly, we have very rich first party transactional data, but it's only on the private label party. So, you may be talking 30% of what goes on at the retailer with the Conversant solution, the retailer would provide us with a 100% download of their transactional information. And as a result we were getting much broader view of who shops there and what they are purchasing. So, I think what it brings to the table is that it gives you a much -- if you want to call it larger sandbox to play in versus private label. Now will you be able to offer the same type of rewards and programs like that, probably not, that would be a fair private label cardholder that takes precedence. But it gives you a second layer of what I call a birthday cake of the ability to get not just 30% view of the customer activity but more like 90% of the customer activity.","Tulu Yunus - Nomura Securities","","Makes perfect sense. Thank you.","Edward Heffernan","Okay. Well, thank you for all your time and we\u2019ll talk to you next quarter. Bye-bye.","Operator","","Thank you ladies and gentlemen.

[Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Ms. Julie Prozeller of FTI Consulting. Ma'am, the floor is yours.","Julie Prozeller","Thank you, operator. By now you should have received a copy of the company's fourth quarter and full year 2012 earnings release. If you haven't, please call FTI Consulting at (212) 850-5721. On the call today we have Ed Heffernan, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Charles Horn, Chief Financial Officer of Alliance Data.","Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on today's call and some of the responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risks and the uncertainties described in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC. Alliance Data has no obligation to update the information presented on the call. Also on today's call, our speakers will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe will provide useful information for investors. Reconciliation of those measures to GAAP will be posted on the Investor Relations website at www.alliancedata.com.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Ed Heffernan. Ed?","Edward J. Heffernan","Great. Thank you, Julie, and everyone, welcome to the early-morning edition of Alliance's Q4 Earnings Call. And joining me today, of course, is Charles Horn, our always insightful CFO. And Charles is going to talk about our segment and consolidated results, and I'll wrap up with a financial scorecard and our 2013 outlook. Also, I know a lot of folks are in the middle of earnings season right now, but will, I think, most likely go back and look at the transcripts or listen to the call. So at the very end, I am going to give a few minutes discussion just in terms of where we see the company from a longer-term perspective, give a little bit of a strategic view of looking at where we want to be as we move through '13 into '14 and into '15. So that being said, Charles, your show.","Charles L. Horn","Thanks, Ed. 2012 was another tremendous year with double-digit revenue, adjusted EBITDA and net of funding costs and core EPS growth. The growth was balanced, as all 3 segments contributed 9% or better to top line and bottom line growth to the year. Organically, revenue grew 9% in 2012 driven by 9% growth in LoyaltyOne and 12% growth at Private Label. Epsilon had a somewhat off year with organic growth of 4%. However, importantly, after negative organic revenue growth in Q3 2012, Epsilon returned to 3% growth in Q4 2012, as it played through the air ball created by the lack of new wins early in 2012.","Our Q4 results, aside from the increase in diluted share count, closely mirror full year 2012, revenue up 15% to $972 million, adjusted EBITDA, net of funding costs up 26% to $245 million and core EPS up 8% to $1.84 or 14% to $2.15 on an economic basis, which excludes phantom shares.","The acquisition of Hyper Marketing completed on November 30, 2012, added approximately $0.04 to Q4 and full year 2012. Our share count continued to move against us, as diluted shares for Q4 increased 6.9 million shares driven by a 3.5 million increase in phantom shares and a 3.7 million increase in warrants associated with our convertible debt, both driven by higher ADS average share price as partially offset by share repurchases we made. Looking forward, approximately 4.6 million of the phantom shares at year end disappear August 1, 2013, as the first tranche of convertible debt matures.","Let's turn to the next slide and talk about LoyaltyOne. LoyaltyOne had a strong fourth quarter, with the revenue up 1% and adjusted EBITDA up a notable 24%. Excluding the benefit of favorable foreign exchange translation rates, revenue decreased 2%, while adjusted EBITDA increased a robust 20% compared to the fourth quarter of 2011.","Operating losses associated with our international expansion efforts were consistent between years, creating no incremental drag on the quarter. Revenue growth, which was essentially flat in the fourth quarter, was slightly below our expectations due to a lower-than-anticipated burn rate. A reminder that the burn rate is defined as current quarter or year at redemptions over current quarter or year issuances.","Our guidance for Q4 was approximately 65% burn rate, whereas actual was about 60%. As seen on the slide, redemption activities steadily moderated as 2012 progressed. This unusual trend, which we now believe is behind us, was prompted by the announcement of a 5-year expiry program at the end of 2011. This triggered what we call a run on the bank in the first half of 2012, as certain collectors accelerated redemption activity into the first half the year, which normally would have occurred somewhat ratably during the year. The fall off of redemptions in the back half of 2012 was expected. Although in Q4, it was slightly steeper than anticipated, but it mitigated the bulk of the excess first half redemptions.","As previously discussed, adjusted EBITDA was up $11 million or 24% over the fourth quarter of 2011. Favorable translation rates added approximately $2 million, while higher gross margins on redemptions primarily drove the remainder. Adjusted EBITDA margins for the AIR MILES program was 29% for the quarter, up 400 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of 2011.","Miles issued bounced back solidly from a weak third quarter, increasing 6% in the fourth quarter driven by strong promotional activity from certain sponsors. Due to the factors discussed above, miles redeemed were down 8% in the quarter, as the burn rate for the quarter dropped to 60% from 69% in the fourth quarter of 2011. With the effects of the expiry announcement largely behind us, we project the redemption activity in 2013 will return to a more normal level of approximately 72% to 73%, which is slightly below our ultimate redemption rate assumption of 73%.","As you have probably noticed, there's something new on the slide. We are lowering the breakage rate from 28% in 2012 to 27% in 2013. Why? Simply put, the announcement of the expiry policy caused certain collectors to redeem that we previously assumed would not. Accordingly, we trued up our product liability December 31, 2012, and lowered the rate we will use in 2013. The economic impact to us really is expected to be none. The nice thing about a coalition program such as ours is that we make money from 3 ways: one, marketing servicing revenue, which is what we receive for running the program; two, breakage revenue, money we receive for miles never redeemed; and three, gross margins and redemptions driven not only by the cost of product but also how many miles required for desired redemption. In 2013, we expect to offset any loss breakage income with higher product margins.","Moving on, we did add an instant reward program called AIR MILES Cash in 2012, and it finished 2012 with over 1 million collectors enrolled. So it is starting to ramp up. We added 2 additional sponsors during the fourth quarter namely Sobeys in the grocery category and Lawtons in the pharmacy category, both in the Eastern region of Canada. The addition of these sponsors to the program increased the participating sponsor count to 7 at year end. The program continues to gain momentum with collectors enrolling daily. We anticipate adding additional sponsors and categories to the program over time and to increase the number of locations where AIR MILES Cash redemptions are accepted. The timing of the rollout is not completely within our control, as in many cases, it requires point-of-sale programming changes on the part of our sponsors. To date, miles issued under this program are not material.","Moving to the international front, dotz continues to exceed our expectations. Collectors enrolled in the program exceeded 6 million at year end, 2 million more than our original expectation for 2012. In the fourth quarter, we launched Recife, a region with a population of over 3.7 million bringing the total market count to 5 covering approximately 10% of Brazil's total population.","With many of the building blocks in Brazil firmly in place, we are now positioned for growth. While we currently do not consolidate dotz, thus we do not recognize any revenue associated with it as a frame of reference, revenues have grown from minimal amounts at the pilot in 2009 to an expected run rate that will exceed $100 million in 2013.","Dotz remains focused on expanding into new markets, increasing quality enrollments and growing its roster of sponsors with the end goal of securing a national presence in the near future. Dotz anticipates financial results to continue to accelerate, as the program grows within existing markets. We launch in new regions, we secure new partners and we gain further momentum in engagements with consumers throughout the Brazilian market.","Let's turn over to the next slide and talk about Epsilon. Epsilon's revenue rebounded back in the fourth quarter increasing 15% compared to last year. Importantly, what Ed and I really look at, organic revenue growth returned increasing 3% for the fourth quarter of 2012 primarily due to the strength in the auto and telco verticals. Revenue growth for the fourth quarter was augmented by the acquisition of Hyper Marketing, what we call HMI, which added $31 million or 12% to the top line growth.","Adjusted EBITDA increased 9% for the fourth quarter. Excluding approximately $5 million of restructuring expenses, organic adjusted EBITDA growth was approximately 10% for the fourth quarter.","Overall, it was a mixed year for Epsilon. The good, top and bottom line growth of 18% and 14%, respectively. The bad, organic revenue growth of 4%, which is below our target of high single digits. We have talked extensively in the past about what happens. In a nutshell, new client signings were soft in the first half of 2012, which meant fewer projects moving into production in the back half of 2012. As a result, we were unable to overcome weakness in the healthcare\/pharmaceutical vertical, coupled with a temporary pullback in marketing spend by one of our big clients.","This air pocket, as we call it, pressured back half revenue growth. However, it also afforded us an opportunity to make changes we have not have made during the Hyper growth phase. Accordingly, we made the decision to make an EBITDA investment in Epsilon to further bolster its long-term prospects. In 2012, we incurred over $11 million of expense restructuring and realigning Epsilon's business. These expenses should not repeat in 2013. The benefit of the actions we took should be twofold. One, the realignment of sales and client services staffing into industry verticals that deliver solutions across all Epsilon offering areas should drive additional client wins. We are already seeing results, with a backlog at year end up double digits compared to the same time last year. And two, the rationalization of underperforming product lines and the elimination of redundant costs associated with the old product structure should drive operational efficiencies and hence, margin expansion in the future.","We are already seeing benefits as even with the restructuring costs, adjusted EBITDA margins for the back half of 2012 were 140 basis points better than the same period last year. During the fourth quarter, we took another step to bolster Epsilon's capabilities with the acquisition of Hyper Marketing. HMI brings to Epsilon a strong digital presence, creating within Epsilon one of the largest digital agencies in the U.S.","Importantly, this acquisition dramatically increases Epsilon's critical mass within agency, expands our presence in key verticals such as CPG and retail, adds tremendous talent in multiple disciplines and greatly expands Epsilon's digital capabilities in key channels such as mobile, social, targeted display and web development.","During the fourth quarter, Epsilon announced several exciting client engagements to support our outlook for a solid 2013. KeyBank, an Epsilon client for over 18 years, signed a multi-year renewal with agency services. Regis, a Fortune 1000 beauty industry leader, signed a multi-year deal for Epsilon to provide database services. And finally, we rolled out the Walgreens Balance Rewards Loyalty platform supporting dynamic, realtime loyalty transactions in over 7,900 stores at the point of sale, kiosks, pharmacy and online. These wins are representative of Epsilon's go-to-market strategy where there is a healthy blend of data, agency and technology wrapped into each deal.","Let's flip over now and talk about Private Label. Private Label continued its outstanding year or what Ed would call a boomer of a year, with revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth in excess of 20% for the fourth quarter. Revenue increased 23% for the quarter driven by a 31% increase in average card receivables. The difference between the 2 growth rates is primarily due to the on boarding of new programs in 2012, which usually suppressed growth yields for a period of up to 12 months. Adjusted EBITDA, net of the funding costs was at an even stronger 38% compared to the fourth quarter of 2011, as we benefited from lower cash funding rates, which dropped to 2.1% in the fourth quarter.","Let's now turn to look at the key drivers of our performance, and there's really 4 of them: one, card receivables growth, which accelerated each quarter during 2012. Our success in signing new business throughout the year coupled with strength in the core business produced 31% growth in average credit card receivables compared to the fourth quarter of 2011. Importantly, the growth was balanced, 16% growth in the core portfolio and 15% growth from new programs. The same growth rate of 31% in ending card receivables provides a very strong jump-off point entering 2013.","Number two, cardholder spending remains strong, up 38% from the fourth quarter of 2011. Excluding new programs, cardholder spending grew 12% despite moderate retailer sales growth and the effects of Superstorm Sandy. Essentially, we are gaining wallet share. Approximately 60% of the year-over-year growth can be attributed to increases in tender share with our retail partners. We expect to continue this trend in 2013 with new partnerships, increases in tender share and underlying retailer performance driving a strong year.","Number three is portfolio quality, which we talked at length about. It improved on a year-over-year basis and has now likely reached bottom. The principal charge-off rate was 4.7% for the fourth quarter compared to 6.3% last year. Normalized for purchase accounting associated with the acquisition of portfolios, the pro forma principal charge-off rate was 5.1% for the fourth quarter and 5% for the full year 2012. Looking into 2013, we expect continued strong credit performance with only a slight increase in charge-off rates for 2013. Lastly, number four, funding costs continue to improve with cash funding rates down 80 basis points for the fourth quarter on a year-over-year basis and 20 basis points on a sequential quarter basis.","During 2012, we have steadily taken advantage of a robust asset-backed securities market to extend out maturities as long as 7 years at rates on average below 2.5%. The laddering of maturities, 1-, 3-, 5- and 7-year maturities, at record low fixed interest rates provide funding certainty for the next several years. Overall, the outlook for Private Label entering 2013 looks good.","Let's move to the next slide and talk about our liquidity. Liquidity for ADS and its bank subs is substantial aggregating over $4.2 billion at December 31, 2012, which is more than sufficient to execute our capital allocation plans in 2013. If we break it down further, corporate liquidity increased to $1.8 billion at December 31, 2012, of which approximately $900 million is cash on hand. During the fourth quarter, we raised $400 million of new 5.25% high-yield debt, which was primarily used to finance the Hyper Marketing acquisition. Our leverage ratio, which is corporate debt over adjusted EBITDA, was 2.3x at year end, which is well below our maximum leverage coverage ratio of 3.5x.","At the bank level, we have approximately $2.4 billion of available liquidity at December 31, 2012. As can be seen on the slide, we actively attempt to diversify our funding sources, as well as ladder out maturity dates. Currently, we estimate a duration of approximately 27 months on all outstanding borrowings or about 41 months on term ABS with over 75% being fixed rate. With the APRs in our cards being variable rate tied to prime rate and the related borrowings being largely fixed rate with an extended duration, it means we are positive rate sensitive.","Continuing our dividend trend, our 2 banks paid $57.5 million in dividends to ADS parent during the fourth quarter while maintaining strong regulatory capital ratios. We expect similar quarterly dividends in 2013.","I would now turn it over to Edward who will wrap up with a discussion of final discussion of 2012 and discuss our revised 2013 outlook.","Edward J. Heffernan","Good. Thanks, Charles. Let's turn to the Slide 2012 Wrap-up. Obviously, Charles has covered everything in depth, but again, stepping away and looking at what are the key messages that we take away from 2012. Obviously, the financial performance, always important. What we note is very, very strong double-digit growth across all of our key metrics. And I would say moving on to probably one of the key highlights is the second bullet point, which is 9% of this is organic growth. And in this environment of new, new and even assuming yesterday's GDP with a bit of a timing issue, if you're looking at 2%, 2.5% real GDP growth and you're doing organic growth of 8%, 9%, quite frankly, we think that is a very, very attractive model. And that's why we will continue to focus very, very intently on the organic growth rate of our businesses.","That being said, having incremental M&A activity and share buyback round out what we call the three-pronged strategy that we have.","What was also nice in 2012 was the growth was nicely balanced across all 3 of our engines. For those of you who have been around for a dozen years and have followed us, you'll notice that sometimes we have years in which we have one just blow the doors off and another segment is a little bit soft, and that also works with the model. But 2012 was notable because all 3 of the engines contributed nicely to the record results.","Same with -- on the EBITDA or free cash flow side, again, ranging from anywhere of just under 10% to 20% in the range. As you look at the individual businesses, Private Label obviously was the primary engine of overperformance during 2012 where you had record portfolio growth of $1 billion, up 20%, which is the best I've seen it in my 15 years here. Combine that with very strong credit quality, funding costs, and as Charles mentioned, we did use some overperformance and plowed that back into a higher rate but longer-term fixed-rate funding that gives us better visibility into future earnings.","A couple of notes on the Private Label business itself. For those of you who don't live and breathe this stuff everyday, the overall market in the card industry itself has essentially been a tough place to be over the past few years. The market itself peaked at about $1 trillion of receivables and has been declining ever since, all the way down to $850 billion, and this was a market that grew 7% a year. So it was a fairly dramatic swing from a nice growth market into essentially a free fall. The market had flattened out during 2012, but it's still well, well below its peak of $1 trillion.","Against this backdrop, we actually had the best growth in our file in our history. And the growth came from not only our core clients stepping up but record wins and quite frankly, high-quality wins, which is always important going forward. I mean, we're talking to Pier 1, The Talbots, the Bon-Tons, the dotz and a number of other clients that really should be solid contributors not only today but going forward.","Also, you're beginning to see why the model that we have here \"works\". And if you look at nothing other than just the folks using our cards, the credit sales number, our credit sales were up 30% year-over-year. And not only did that come against a backdrop of relatively weak overall industry growth, but if you look at our core clients, those clients who have been with us for quite some time, they had a relatively modest holiday, 3%, 4% sales growth. For those clients, we actually were growing double digits. So that essentially means that our tender share at those clients moved up very nicely, which again, would suggest that perhaps this Private Label tool is one heck of a loyalty program for our clients' customers.","So you put it all together and where do we stand right now? As we've said in the past, we do think it is a unique offering. We do think that we play in a fairly unique sandbox in terms of the clients that we focus on, and we do believe that we do have the best integrated mousetrap, so to speak, that's out there, which combines the benefits of having your own processing and network, providing the credit, the very, very high-end customer care, which is why we keep our folks onshore. And then you put it all together in a marketing wrapper where we are collecting because of the closed network, all sorts of data down to the category and sometimes SKU level, which can then be used for very, very sophisticated marketing programs on behalf of our clients. So it's been a long time in terms of getting the message across, but more and more, our clients are taking a look at the richness of the data and the uniqueness of our marketing programs and saying, \"Hey, you know what, this thing seems to work.\" And they're coming on board. So I wanted to spend just a little time on Private Label and why it seemed to work so well.","I'll move on quickly to Epsilon. Charles went through the numbs, which were obviously, from a overall perspective, very good. What I look at, obviously, is what's going on deep inside the business itself, and that means take a hard look at organic growth. We've talked at length about the air pocket. We wanted to make sure it was just an air pocket and not something more than that. It looks like that is the case. And we saw a nice turn begin in Q4. If you recall in Q3, our organic earnings growth was a minus 3% on top line. Q4, that swung 6 points to a plus 3%, and as we're sitting here looking into Q1, we expect that to continue to accelerate, as Q1 is beginning to play out pretty nicely for us.","The big move on Epsilon, obviously, has been the large bet that we've made between the Aspen acquisition and the HMI acquisition in what we call the big pivot. And the pivot is nothing more than recognizing the fact that a company such as Epsilon, which relied exclusively in the past on having the best engineering and the best systems and everything else and chatting with the CIO and CTOs. That market place has changed where the CMO, Chief Marketing Officer, has a bigger and bigger say in where the dollars are being allocated, and as a result, we did put in place operation pivot, so to speak, which again, made us very, very frontloaded in terms of digital agency assets. And as a result, we now have a presence in all the C-suites where we can sell not only digital agency products, creative products, strategy but also pull through the more traditional Epsilon services such as data, database, analytics and distribution. So we expect to see this pivot strategy play out really right away as 2013 unfolds.","Turning finally to Loyalty. Charles went through the numbers. Again, very solid year. I was very pleased to see the very strong resurgence in miles issued, which let's face it. That's how we make our money. And that looks like that's going to continue through 2013. Also very pleased to see how the Brazil joint venture has pulled up faster than we had anticipated. And always nice to start off the year with a new sponsor by the name of GM, as well as renewals of not only Loyalty's largest client but Alliance's largest client, Bank of Montreal, as well as the top 5 sponsor, American Express. So overall, very pleased with the way things are going.","The 4 takeaways for 2012, again the double-digit growth across all the key metrics, the very high level of organic running at 3x GDP, balance across all 3 of our businesses and then, obviously, very strong momentum setting the stage for 2013, which we can now move to on the next slide.","We are, of course, going ahead and increasing our 2013 guidance. There's probably 4 moving pieces here. The big ones being you have, as Charles talked about, we have additional shares in our denominator resulting from share price accretion, and that will cause a number of new phantom shares to flow in, as well as some real shares as well. We also took the opportunity, which I would do all day long, to go out and raise additional liquidity at any time. We can get long-term fixed-rate money at 5 points. We will do that all day long. And so we are bolstering again the war chest, and that came in quite handy because it took care of the HMI deal.","And finally, you've got against the high-yield offering, which will put a drag for the first part on our '13 numbers because of the extra interest charge, and the higher share count will drag it as well. We are looking at nice accretion from the HMI acquisition and already we're seeing additional Private Label overperformance. So you get a couple of drags, a couple of big pluses. The net result is an overall nice step-up in our guidance. Specifically, if you looked at just using the overall share counts, we'll increase our core EPS about $0.15 versus initial guidance. But what we look at obviously is those phantoms are going to eventually be dropped away with nothing we need to do other than having the converts mature. And excluding the phantoms, we're actually bumping guidance up $0.35. So it's quite a big bump to start the year off, but that gives you a sense of how we feel.","The guidance itself, it's all about growth this year. And again, while you'll see double-digit growth across all of the metrics, which we like to see with revenues and EBITDA and earnings and EPS, I again call attention to the fact that we are looking at organic growth rate of as much as 8% for this year. And again, we think that type of model with 8% combined with some moderate M&A activity and some share buyback activity should be very appealing to a lot of folks.","The themes, same 4 themes as 2012. We're looking at double-digit growth across all of our key metrics, very strong organic growth of high single digits and balanced where we expect all the businesses to contribute. And then obviously, where I'll spend my time is building the momentum for 2014 and '15.","I think, why don't we continue to move on? That should give you a nice snapshot for '13. I'm not going to spend a ton of time on this slide, which is the outlook. We had a prior guidance and then if you want to tick and tie and figure out how we got to bumping up our economic earnings per share by $0.35, essentially you're adding in the benefits of the HMI acquisition, which is accretive. You're taking away from that the cash expense from adding additional liquidity. You're also dinging us for the higher denominator from the share count. Then, you're adding in what we're beginning to see already, which is overperformance in Private Label. You swish it all together and you come out with a pretty decent, nice bump to start off the year.","Okay. Last page here, we go into 2013 updated guidance. Again, we do have a few moving parts, so we wanted to make sure everyone was crystal clear on what's going on. What you're basically seeing is the revenue has increased by roughly $300 million. That is almost all attributable to the HMI acquisition. That will flow through to adjusted EBITDA, which also includes some overperformance from Private Label. Core earnings will also be moved up but will reflect the cash interest from the high-yield deal. And then you look at diluted shares outstanding. You'll see those have crept up a bit because of the stock movement. And our core EPS, again as we talked about, has gone up $0.15. When you exclude the phantom shares, which thankfully will start peeling off middle of this year and completely peel off by May of next year, then we won't have as fascinating thing to chat about. You'll look at what the true earnings, economic earnings are of the business, and essentially, we're looking at an economic EPS number of roughly $11. So again, those phantoms, I can't wait to say goodbye to them.","One of the items I did want to mention, which is kind of interesting, is if you look at the share counts this year versus last year, you'll see a very interesting trend. And that is in Q1 of '13, we had 67 million fully diluted shares versus 62 million last year, so you could see a fair amount of dilution kick in. By Q4 of this year, it's going to flip flop with the first convert falling off, and you're actually going to have 63 million shares in Q4 versus 66 million last year. So what you have is an EPS accelerant here going on that starts in Q3 and really accelerates in Q4. So when we exit 2013 at 63 million shares, on top of that, you still have another 4 million phantom shares that will go away during 2014. And as a result, your economic share count is really more like 59 million. So bottom line is you got 67 million today. You'll eventually be coming down to 59 million or 12% decline, and that's a nice, nice earnings accelerator as we go forward.","Also, we don't really talk too much about free cash flow, which, of course, is something very, very near and dear to all of us here. We expect a very strong year on free cash flow. We expect to toss off about $700 million of pure free cash, and that's after taxes and interest and all sorts of other stuff. That's what's left in our pocket. And that, of course, we look to grow about double digit, 10%, 12% year-after-year. So cash flow itself remains quite strong.","And the last piece here, as I promised at the beginning, I do want to take just a couple of minutes to talk strategically about where we are, where we're going, what we worry about, what we think is in good shape. And for those of you who go back and listen to this sometime in the future, you know exactly where we're coming from. Overall, if one were to say, \"Okay, how does '13 look?\" Clearly, you can tell from the tone today that we all feel very, very good about 2013. We said the same thing last year, and sure enough, it was a heck of a good year. I think 2013 is all about execution. We have all the pieces in place. It is what I would call our year to lose, which we won't. What will be of interest going forward is things like how we end up deploying all this liquidity that we have. What also will be of interest, of course, is will we follow tradition and tweak our guidance as the year unfolds, most likely yes. Today was a good start. But overall, given the visibility that we have with our model, I really don't see anything that's going to knock us out of the box for this year, and I really feel very, very good about 2013.","That being said, I get paid to worry about '14 and '15 as well. And if you look at the bigger picture, what are we looking at? Well, what we're looking at is that if we are correct on the pivot at Epsilon, Epsilon will continue to accelerate, and Epsilon, we are counting on to have a very strong 2014 and '15. There's no reason why it shouldn't. We expect AIR MILES in Canada continue to be very strong. And against that, we expect Private Label, which has been having the gold star of the last couple of years, will obviously eventually moderate from enormous growth rates but eventually will face a moderation in terms of growth in its file and its credit sales. And also, funding costs and credit quality will eventually start creeping back up. That being said, we do view Private Label, if you look out many years, as a very solid, mid-single-digit organic growth engine for us, which means that, that combined with Epsilon and AIR MILES should give us the bulk of what we need. Along with that, Brazil will start kicking in. And Charles talked about the growth rates that we're seeing there, so we expect Brazil to be nicely additive to our earnings as we move into 2014 and certainly '15 as well. You toss in the tuck in M&A. You toss in the share counts going down, bringing our share count down 12% from 67 million to 59 million. And you can begin to see that the overall pieces of the puzzle look like they should fit together pretty nicely, not just for '13 but '14 and '15. It's just we're going to be getting the growth from different areas.  Essentially, as Private Label moderates, the other 2 businesses plus Brazil will pick up the slack. You throw in a nice decline in the share count. That should be helpful.","And what we haven't talked about is the free cash flow generation of the business, the war chest. If you look at our net debt or total debt less cash, we're right around a little bit less than 2x in terms of leverage. If we grow EBITDA $150 million, $200 million a year, that would automatically bring your leverage ratio to 1.5x. We're tossing off $700 million in free cash flow. That brings your leverage down 1x. So you're looking at a company that if we did nothing, would have its leverage ratio at 1x by the end of '13. As Charles said, we don't like to go above 3.5x, so that leaves you about $3.5 billion in the war chest, which is nice. And again, our three-pronged strategy is organic, organic, organic as the first one, but also, we do look for a moderate-sized M&A opportunity and then finally, using some of our liquidity to continue to repurchase shares.","So that's sort of the long version of our strategy, and that being said, I know everyone's got a bunch of stuff to do. So we'll go ahead and take a few questions here, and we'll let everyone else get on to their next call. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","It seems like in Epsilon, you guys have a pretty nice setup given the acquisition, some of the new relationships and some of the restructuring efforts you've taken. Can you just talk about how much of that's kind of incorporated in your guidance? It seems like there's a fair amount of tailwind? And then also just how much the restructuring charges were for the quarter? And then just on Loyalty, I was hoping you could just talk about the reduction in the breakage rate and your comfort moving forward that any impacts are manageable to the overall economics of that segment.","Charles L. Horn","On Epsilon, Sanjay, in terms of the expense we took this year realigning the restructuring was about $5 million for the fourth quarter, about $11 million for the entire year. It is not something we've adjusted out of core EPS. That is a reported number that's been decremented for those items. I think on a go-forward basis what it's going to do is help us get back on Epsilon to drive close to high single-digit organic revenue growth again. In fact, I'm looking for mid-single-digit, at least, organic growth in the first quarter of '13 and maintain double-digit organic EBITDA growth in '13. And I think that's the key focus, and then what we ladder on top from Hyper Marketing is just kind of a plus. In terms of the breakage reset, we did change it from 28% in 2012 to 27% in 2013. The key takeaways I'd want to make on that is, one, we do think it is an effect from the announcement of the expiry, meaning we triggered a run on the bank, and we had a few people we'd expected not would ever redeem redeemed, so we adjusted. What that means is we true up our balance sheet, which has not created an immediate P&L hit. What it means is we're reducing the amount of deferred revenue at 12\/31\/2012 that we would amortize into revenue over multi-year standpoint. So what that means is, in any 1 year, it's not overly material. And then three, the other point I would make is since it's a prospective adjustment, as with any coalition program, you've got multiple levers you can pull. So as we look forward, we know what the impact will be over the next 2, 2.5 years, so we can adjust our pricing mechanism in such a way so we can offset it with basically gross margin on the product. So I think from that standpoint, we don't see any impact to earnings for LoyaltyOne in 2013 nor do we anticipate it will affect our guidance for ADS in 2013.","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Just one more on Epsilon, just the restructuring. I mean, you mentioned the revenue side of it but just on the operating margin side on legacy basis, I mean, do you expect that to be accretive to the operating margin?","Charles L. Horn","I do. So if I look at the base business -- and again, you have to overlay in Hyper Marketing. Before Hyper Marketing, I'm looking for at least a 50-basis-point expansion in EBITDA margins for Epsilon. And then, of course, then you ladder in Hyper Marketing being a digital agency is going to have a little bit lower EBITDA margin. But for the base business, I'm looking for at least 50 basis points of improvement in EBITDA margins.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Napoli with William Blair.","Robert P. Napoli - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Question on the guidance. Is the buyback in the guidance and is your intention to essentially buy back the warrants from the convert when it matures? Or will you do -- be buying out during the year?","Edward J. Heffernan","Yes, there is no -- there is nothing in guidance related to buyback activity, so one could view that as, obviously, a potential plus. Obviously, we don't want to tip our hand too much. But what we like to do with the buyback, obviously, if you went back in our history, we tend to be extremely active at certain times and less active at other times. I guess when corporate America bought back the least, which was Q4 of '08 through the first half of 2010, is when we backed the truck up and loaded up. So we tend to do things a little bit differently here. Obviously, we think the price is still attractive. We have a lot of liquidity, but we're not going to be silly and just go out there and back up the truck. If it looks like we have a good opportunity, we absolutely will be there, and we will be there in size. Otherwise, most likely we'll be picking away at it throughout the year. And whether we do it through just purchasing throughout the year or taking up the warrants, we haven't really decided at this point, so...","Robert P. Napoli - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. And just on the Private Label business, are you seeing, Ed, an increased interest in Private Label cards by retailers? I mean, it seems like their -- like the Target REDcard and it just seems like to us that there's more interest than retailers using Private Label cards as loyalty programs incrementally than what there has been in the past.","Edward J. Heffernan","There is no doubt. And as we talked about earlier, the big driver behind it, right, and all you hear out in the marketplace today is data this and digital that and all the other fancy stuff. This is what we do for a living, and what the benefit of Private Label has for our clients is quite simply the fact that you have a closed-loop network. And with the closed-loop network and Alliance being a marketing company, you're capturing a level of data that is much richer than what really any other source can capture. You're down to the category level, the SKU level. And as a result, you can take that richness of the data, and now it's then worthwhile to talk about the various distribution channels, this whole omni-channel approach. Whereas before, we could put in very sophisticated, fancy, personalized messaging in the statements or inserts or at the point of sale. Well, now we're talking about using the digital channels as well, whether it's permission-based email, whether it's SMS, MMS, things like that. When you have the richness of the data, you have the analytics to segment that information, and then you have the omni-channel distribution system across, not only old school but the new digital channels. I got to tell you. It's getting people's interest. And when you then filter in the demographics, psychographic data that we have over at Epsilon to overlay the transactional data, it's a pretty fancy machine we got here.","Robert P. Napoli - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Last question. Just on your guidance for '13, what are your -- the yield that you saw in this quarter on Private Label, is that a reasonable run rate yield? Or is there more pressure on that yield? And what do you have in there from a credit loss perspective?","Charles L. Horn","Bob, from that standpoint, the yield always fluctuates during the course of the year with Q4 generally being the lowest because of what, I call, the denominator effect. You have a big ramp-up in the NAD and AR [ph] that's not income producing yet. So looking into 2013, what I would expect, obviously dependent on any onboarding in the new programs, is a gross yield roughly consistent between years.","Edward J. Heffernan","Yes. I'd also say that you have obviously seasonality in the yield itself where Q1, you will tend to have your highest yield because essentially, right, people hopefully shop till they drop in Q4. And in Q1, they go, \"Oops, we need to figure out how to pay that off.\" So folks tend to either miss or a little bit late in January or they roll the balance during Q1. And then also in Q3, you have the back-to-school seasonality where everyone's coming back from vacation, and they're, like, \"Yes, I'll get around to it.\" And some folks are a little bit late on their payments or they decide to roll it. So you tend to have seasonality on the yield itself, but as Charles said, it tends to even out on an annual basis.","Robert P. Napoli - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","And on credit assumption?","Charles L. Horn","We talked about it a little bit, Bob, that probably in '13, looking for maybe 20, 30 basis points change and a normalized charge-off rate. So if our charge-off rate normalized was 5% for 2012, we're looking in that 5%, 3% [ph] range for 2013.","Edward J. Heffernan","I would also say that it's too early to call the ball on this one, but it does seem that I think that is certainly a very safe bet. It may be even a bit on the conservative side because we really have yet to see any upward movements in some of our key forward indicators suggesting that losses are, in fact, drifting back up to the more normalized 6% level. It will happen at some point, and whether it happens this year or 2 years from now, right now, we're not really sure. But based on delinquency flows, it looks fabulous. We're actually seeing improvements in personal bankruptcy rates, and recovery rates are staying very stable. So right now, a potential source of incremental upside would in fact be if losses in fact stayed relatively flat to 2012. And right now, it's tracking to that, but we don't mind putting in 20 or 30 bps just to be safe.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Carter Malloy with Stephens.","Carter Malloy - Stephens Inc., Research Division","First off on dotz, I'm not sure how much you can speak to it on a public call, but appreciate all the data you guys have given us. When can we expect to see that actually on your P&L?","Edward J. Heffernan","Well, the -- obviously, our share of the operating losses will flow through the P&L, and that's what you're seeing. In terms of the revenue, all we can say right now is we will continue to keep everyone updated on how revenue is growing because it is taken off. And our #1 goal right now, right, it's a land grab. And our #1 goal right now is to get from -- we went from 0 million to 6 million. We want to get 10 million folks enrolled and active by the end of this year, which means some big rollouts. At that point, you're going to see the numbers looking pretty big. At a certain point, Carter, we will obviously take a hard look at is there an opportunity to recognize that more in the financial statements as opposed to just a note. That's probably all I can say.","Carter Malloy - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's fair. And then on the breakage going up a little bit this year -- I'm sorry, from 28% to 27%, what are the drivers or the triggers that could make that happen again going forward?","Edward J. Heffernan","Yes. I'll jump in and Charles can give you the -- probably the more correct answer. But essentially, when you have the run on the bank, when we announced the expiry policy, we need to reflect that in the breakage calculation, and as a result, we had to move it 1 point. As Charles mentioned, when you own the program as we do, there are a number of levers, as we have said for years, that we can pull, and those levers have already been pulled. So for example, if your breakage rate is a little bit less, then what you do is you will change your pricing accordingly and make it up in margin when folks redeem. And so to us, it really doesn't matter. We just want to make sure all the accounting is right, and we knew we had a run on the bank. That's already been taken care of through pricing mechanisms, and we feel pretty good about that. As we look forward, it's going to be real interesting. The consumer has really -- we have a bifurcated consumer in the sense of we have those who are looking really long term for that fabulous trip down to Florida when it's minus 20 degrees up there. And we have the others who want instant gratification when they go into the grocery store, and as a result, that's beginning to change the dynamics of the model a little bit. And so we need to change with it. The most important thing is to offer the consumer something that the consumer wants. And then we worry about how the pieces fit together later on. The consumer is clearly saying I want that instant rewards option. That could change the redemption model. What we will do with any change in the redemption model is that we will pull another lever that will keep us whole in terms of the margins. So bottom line of all of it is that whether breakage stays within a point or 2 of where it is now or not, it really doesn't matter from the model and the margin perspective. We'll pull another lever, as we've always said we would, to make sure that we're clean.","Carter Malloy - Stephens Inc., Research Division","And second part of that question would be related to that on the pricing elasticity. How much have you guys moved it over the last few years? And do you think there's still a lot of digital headroom there or just a little bit left?","Edward J. Heffernan","There seems to be a certain level of comfort with our consumer base. We think that the offering that we have today is a solid 20% premium in value over any other program that's out there in the marketplace when you look at not only the value of the rewards we offer but the ability to obtain those awards without, \"Hey, let's have a blackout period 364 days a year.\" That's not helpful to anyone. We don't have those things. So as a result, we've got a very nice premium built into the program today, and as a result, we think there's a fair amount of flexibility. And again, what we would do is it really will be in reaction to how the consumer chooses to redeem his or her rewards, whether it's instant or whether it's a longer-term type approach, and we'll adjust accordingly.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim Willi with Wells Fargo.","Timothy W. Willi - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I wanted to expand a bit on Bob's question about Private Label. I just wondered if you could talk about, in the context of retailers in Private Label, taking that a little bit more to the forefront around their mobile strategies. I'm assuming there's some tie in. You talked about the Walgreens platform, which I think is available as a mobile app. Could you just maybe talk about that and what that might mean for your incremental revenue take over time with your retailers as opposed to just the number of accounts you might have with retailers on the Private Label business?","Edward J. Heffernan","Yes. It's a great question. I think we're going to fall under the camp of we don't really know right now the end result of all this stuff, so -- but what we can tell you is what we've seen thus far. And when it's all said and done, do we believe mobile will be an important channel for us? For sure. There's no question about it, but let's not kid ourselves. The huge amount of accounts we're going to get as people at the point of sale in the store, in places like that, that's still going to be the bulk of our business. Now in terms of incremental growth, I'd love to sit there and say that the ability to have folks opt in to all of our SMS, MMS, in geo-fencing initiatives and all the other fancy stuff that I almost understand, it -- these things are certainly on the -- from an incremental perspective, are helpful. But I will tell you one thing that actually has worked and we can put real numbers to, which has been very helpful, which is using a web-enabled phone or smartphone in the store to secure new applications. And if you know how Private Label works, it's primarily at the point of sale. What we have found is that we went after some of the clients who tend to cater towards a younger demographic, and we offered the opportunity as they walk into the store shopping, to hey, there's all sorts of signage, Call Here. You call it up on your phone through your web, and you enter a few pieces of information. It zips up. It gets scored. It comes back. You have a virtual card right there in the store before you've even gotten to the checkout. And what we have found is that has given us an incremental lift in new active accounts that has been very significant, and we've also found -- maybe because you already have your credit line before you go up to the point of sale, we're finding that their first purchase is quite a bit larger than a traditional client. So I guess, Tim, where we're coming out at is, yes, we will be participating in all the different digital opportunities that exist out there, but right now, I can tell you flat out, we're going to make a bunch of money based on this new application or this new account app with people in the store. I mean, that's the stuff you can take to the bank. It's a nice lift that we have. That's the only thing right now I can say that we feel very, very good about. The other stuff, look, we're like everyone else. We're going to see where it leads.","Timothy W. Willi - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Great. If can just ask a quick follow-up around the balance sheet for Charles. Could you just -- is there -- if you said it, I apologize, but is there a way you can -- sort of number you can give us around sort of the average length of your funding duration? And I guess theoretically, is there possibility that if we say, some time out there within a 2- to 3-year window, if rates rose, would there actually be the potential for spread expansion on your Private Label business for a period of time?","Charles L. Horn","That's exactly how it would work, Tim. So if you think about it for all funding borrowings, for about 27 months in duration. For just the term ABS, about 41 months in duration. We talked about 75% of it's fixed rate. So to your point, in a rising rate environment, you're going to have the majority of your file fixed for a long period of time. At the same time, on your cardholders' standpoint, you have a variable rate tied to prime. So if it's a normal rising rate interest environment where LIBOR's going up, treasury rate's going up, prime's going up, it will increase in the following billing cycle for your cardholder. At the same time, on the funding cost, until you're replenishing or renewing debt, you're largely fixed for a long period of time. So in a rising rate environment, you're going to get a little bit of yield expansion, and then that will just normalize over time as the -- basically the new higher rates burn in and new debt is issued.","Operator","And we will take one more question from the line of David Scharf with JMP Securities.","David M. Scharf - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division","Wanted to just dig in a little more on the Private Label runway. Ed, I don't know if this is something -- a metric you have the top of your head. But when we look at that $7 billion, roughly $7 billion portfolio, give us a sense for what percentage of those balances reside at programs, stores in which your wallet share is maybe 15% or less? Just to give us a sense for kind of how much market share within those same programs, if we can still ride this?","Edward J. Heffernan","Yes. I would say that you start with the sandbox and say how big is the potential world for us. We think there's about 300 retailers that fit sort of our DNA of a few hundred million to a few billion in sales, right, and they tend to focus on prime-quality type customers. They tend to focus on brand. You narrow down that world, there's about 300 or so in our target universe. There's about 150 programs. Today, we have about, say, 110 of those. And so we've got about 1\/3 of the potential market. We've got well over 2\/3 of the programs that are already out there. So this is our sandbox. If you think that we have roughly 1\/3 of the total potential market for $7 billion of receivables, we think the total market for us is obviously 3x that or about $21 billion, and that's what we're shooting for. If you look, therefore, okay, how are we going to get there, it's going to be a combination of wallet share and as well as signing new clients. Typical for us, I would say right now that our wallet share varies depending on how long we have had the customer and the client and how much the client has put their shoulder into the program itself. Quite frankly, we're no good if the client is not sitting there pounding the table saying, \"Look, this is our loyalty program. We're going to support it, and we're going to push it.\" Obviously, I'm not going to mention any client specifically, but overall, what we found is that it looks like our tender share is in the 20s, maybe 25%. We do have some clients that are up around 40% of their sales, so if you were to ask me what the opportunity is, it's somewhere between that 25% and 40%. So there's a good chunk that we can still get through tender share and obviously, a huge chunk we can get through further penetration of the sandbox.","David M. Scharf - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division","Got it. So is it fair to say that maybe 20% of your portfolio resides at programs in which the -- that tender share or wallet share is well below 40%, I don't know, just as to that maybe 20% level? Just trying to get a sense for the organic wallet share opportunity assuming you never signed up another program, just on an organic growth level.","Edward J. Heffernan","Yes I'd say it's probably less than that. I would say it's less than that.","David M. Scharf - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division","Got it. Got it. Hey, switching to Loyalty. Charles, is there a figure for what the year-end true-up was in deferred revenue, just kind of the onetime true-up to account for the breakage assumption change?","Charles L. Horn","I'll put it this way, David. If you look at it, breakage in your product redemption all fall within the same liability. So really, you won't see anything on the balance sheet per se because you defer 100% of the revenue associated with the points you issue. So what we'll do is we'll refine before we come out with our 10-K what projected change in amortization will be over the following few years, and then that's what we'll talk about. But at this time, I'm just not really prepared to talk about it. So the key takeaway is you won't see anything on the balance sheet, no P&L associated therewith. What you will have is less theoretical breakage revenue amortizing over a multi-year window that we'll look to offset with margin.","David M. Scharf - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division","Got it. And with just closing with Epsilon, can you give a little update of just perhaps what your vertical concentration is as we look into 2013 and after the acquisition? Sort of what your concentration on the top line is along pharma, banking, auto and so forth?","Edward J. Heffernan","Sure. I mean, obviously, the biggies that we're looking at would be -- auto would be a very large one for us. You would look at -- I would say telecom is a large one for us. Retail CPG is a very large one for us and then financial services. So I would say those 4, auto, health, telecom, retail CPG and financial services. I guess that's 5. Those would be the vast bulk of the $1.3 billion that we're expecting out of Epsilon. Outside of that, I probably am not going to rank those 5. They're all big.","David M. Scharf - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division","Got it. Got it. Following the acquisition, are there any 10% customers now for Epsilon?","Charles L. Horn","No, not for -- for Epsilon by itself, or for ADS?","David M. Scharf - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division","No, for Epsilon.","Charles L. Horn","Oh, you've got some 10% customers within Epsilon but not for ADS.","David M. Scharf - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division","Right, right. Got it. Hey, and then just lastly on Epsilon, I -- is there any regulatory update or anything on that -- the FTC was looking into data brokers, which obviously doesn't -- it's not directly related to Epsilon since you're not selling the data. But has anything progressed since they started requesting information from a number of data miners in the fall? [indiscernible]","Edward J. Heffernan","Yes, it's a good question. I would say the regulatory environment is as clear as mud as always, and what we're doing is we're trying to make sure that the folks who are asking a bunch of questions get what they need. So we are actually proactive in D.C. basically saying, \"Hey, look, if you want to understand how all this stuff works, let us walk you through it. Let us help you understand how all these things work.\" It's -- you can't just sit there and say you click the switch and let's have a do not track because somebody's got to pay for the Internet. And so we have to make those linkages crystal clear. I would say that, not only for us but a number of other firms as well, there will be headline risks probably for quite some time. Right now, we're in the process of hopefully an education process in terms of how all this stuff works, and then we'll go from there. But investors, analysts, everyone should be aware that for this group of companies, ourselves included, you're going to see headlines that pop up. And all I can tell you at this point is it's -- from what we can tell, it's information gathering. There's no one pounding the table saying we're going to need to do this. We need to do that. It's more of here's another request, and it hits the headlines. But we're on top of it, and if anything changes, we'll certainly let everyone know.","Okay. We're going to wrap it up.

At this time all parties have been placed on a listen-only mode. Following today's presentation the floor will be open for your questions. (Operator Instructions)","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host Ms. Julie Prozeller of FTI Consulting. Ma\u2019am you may begin your conference.","Julie Prozeller","","Thank you, operator. By now you should have received a copy of the company's second quarter 2012 earnings release. If you haven't please call FTI Consulting at 212-850-5721. On the call today we have Ed Heffernan, President and Chief Executive Officer; Charles Horn, Chief Financial Officer of Alliance Data and Bryan Kennedy, President of Epsilon.","Before we begin I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on today's call and some of the references to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risks and the uncertainties described in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC. Alliance Data has no obligation to update the information presented on this call.","Also on today's call are speakers who will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures which we believe will provide useful information for investors. A reconciliation of those measures to GAAP will be posted on the Investor Relations website at www.alliancedata.com.","With that I would like to turn the call over to Ed Heffernan. Ed?","Ed Heffernan","Great, thanks Julie. Alright, we\u2019re going to get right at it today and joining me as always is the ever popular Charles Horn our CFO and also Bryan Kennedy the Head of Epsilon. Charles is going to discuss our consolidated LoyaltyOne and Private Label results. Bryan will walk you through Epsilon\u2019s results and I will wrap it up by walking you through our updated guidance for 2012. Charles?","Charles Horn","","Thanks Ed. To use an idioism it was a boomer of the quarter. For the second quarter of 2012 revenue increased 17% to $866 million, EPS increased 37% to $1.63 per share; core EPS increased 22% to $2.13 meeting the company\u2019s guidance of $1.85 and lastly adjusted EBITDA net of funding costs increased 33% to $264 million.","As noted above, the 30.8 million share increase in Phantom shares dampened core EPS for the second quarter. Excluding Phantom shares from the calculation of core EPS for both periods presented pro-forma core EPS was $2.46 for Q2 2012 compared to $1.91 for Q2 2011, a 29% increase year-over-year.","We expect the overhang from Phantom shares which is directly correlated with the average ADS share price to continue throughout 2012 and as such have increased our share count guidance for 2012. Ed will talk about this further as part of his update later on the call.","Let\u2019s turn the page and look at LoyaltyOne. LoyaltyOne had a solid second quarter with both revenue and adjusted EBITDA growing by double digits over the second quarter of 2011. Revenue was up 13% compared to the second quarter of 2011 and up 18% when excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange translation. The growth in revenue was driven by robust increases in both redemption and marketing related revenue.","Adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter was up 14% over the same quarter last year. Again excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange translation and incremental international operating losses adjusted EBITDA was up 25% in the second quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margins in the core Canadian operation were very strong and slightly over 29%.","Miles issued grew by 8% for the quarter marking six consecutive quarters of growth. In the second quarter, we saw the continuation of the strong start from our credit card sponsors and our fuel sponsor, Shell. In addition, we experienced gains in our grocery category as our sponsors increased their presence of vendor promotions in store. Looking forward, our current momentum and our recent new sponsor signings in specialty retail categories have positioned us well to achieve mid-single digit plus issuance growth for 2012.","Miles redeemed were 25% for the quarter, which is higher than the traditional growth rates been in line with our expectations. In late 2011, we announced the implementation of a five-year expiry on all existing and future AIR MILES. We experienced what we believe to be a one-time pull forward of miles redeemed in the first quarter, which moderated substantially in the second quarter.","You can see the moderation in the burn rate. The burn rate, which we define as current quarter redemptions over current quarter issuances dropped to 78% for Q2 compared to over 100% for Q1. We have a target of about 74% burn rate for full 2012. So overall, we expect the redemption activity to further moderate as the year progresses.","And one of the main reasons we expect the redemption activity for the second half to moderate is we plan to phase out certain gift certificates in favor of AIR MILES Cash. AIR MILES Cash are new entry reward program launched late in the first quarter of 2012 with four sponsors providing national coverage. To-date, we are please with the collector acceptance is over 600,000 collectors have signed up for the program.","In the second quarter, we launched our fifth redemption sponsor, RONA who is in the home improvement category. The issuance in the Cash Program continues to meet our expectations. However, to-date it\u2019s not a material part of total issuances. We plan to add additional sponsors and categories to the program during 2012 and to increase the number of locations where AIR MILES Cash redemptions are accepted. During the second quarter, we spent approximately $3 million in marketing cost supporting this roll-out.","Now a quick update on Dotz. Late in the second quarter, Dotz launched in Fortaleza, the fourth region to launch in Brazil. The region is made up of 24 cities with a total metropolitan population of 3.76 million. The launch included 12 sponsors with approximately 232 locations, including 55 Banco do Brasil branches.","Nationally, we have seen our total collectors enrolled in the program grow to 2.9 million at the end of the second quarter. That is more than five times the number this time last year. To-date, we are excited with the strong results and key metrics such as number of collectors, points issued, market penetration, cross activation rates etcetera, and anticipate this positive trend to continue for the balance of 2012.","I\u2019ll now turn it over to Bryan Kennedy to give you an update on Epsilon.","Bryan Kennedy","","Great, thanks Charles. Epsilon posted a nice Q2 with revenues up 25% to $235 million and adjusted EBITDA up 24% to $49 million. On an organic basis, both revenue and adjusted EBITDA were up 8% versus Q2 of 2011 and up a very healthy 13% after one-time costs related to datacenter relocation and infrastructure investments are excluded.","So if we break that down our database and digital offering continued it\u2019s growth trend of 7% as in Q1 and we had a number of key wins in this offering this quarter, including an exciting loyalty engagement with Canadian Tire, which is one of Canada's most shopped general retailers with over 1,700 locations as well as a solid renewal and expansion with Patagonia, a premium outdoor lifestyle brand in the retail sector.","Data, slightly down this quarter with strength in Abacus, offset by an ongoing softness in compiled data, driven by a small number of industry verticals that have experienced contraction in 2012. And then lastly, our agency and analytic offerings Aspen have continued to contribute nicely and we are seeing solid growth in the automotive industry in particular.","This quarter, we announced the global expansion with Jaguar Land Rover as we take proven data driven CRM marketing communications program here in the US that operates across a number of channels including direct mail, email and mobile and we are rolling that out internationally for Jaguar\u2019s global after sales division which operates in 177 countries. It\u2019s a great example of how Epsilon can amplify the reach of the Aspen business by leveraging our global footprint and it\u2019s a first international roll-out for auto motive solution and our agency offering.","So looking beyond Q2, I would like to provide some additional color on Epsilon\u2019s year as we hit the halfway point and we have also reached the anniversary of our acquisition of Aspen. For Epsilon 2012 has been about focusing on bringing together in an integrated cohesive way the broad portfolio of offerings that Epsilon has amassed over the last several years. That means we have hunted down on two key initiatives.","Number one, we have been aligning our offerings and our organization for growth and scalability, both through platform investments and through tuning our delivery engine. And secondly, we have been focused on achieving margin expansion after a number of years of acquisitions namely focusing on EBITDA growth.","Simply put, we\u2019ve refined our structure from a collection of divisions with complementary offerings to one that is client centric in its structure that enables our sales and our client services leaders to more effectively assemble, sell and then ultimately deliver solutions from Epsilon\u2019s deep marketing stack of offerings.","We have done that by organizing our sales and delivery structure around our clients in the industry verticals that they operate in. We believe this shift is very critical in presenting to our clients a unified consolidated front enabling Epsilon to elevate the strategic expertise we bring to help Fortune 1000 CMOs navigate the complex data driven marketing space.","And as we streamlined our organization and got more client centric, we are also pruning certain accounts and non-core products and we have been very selective in our growth opportunities allowing us to produce healthy EBITDA growth even as we continue to build our organization and wrap-up some of the core investments and platforms and infrastructure that set us up for 2013 and beyond. This streamlined approach should drive margin expansion in the back half of 2012 returning Epsilon over the next 12 months to margin levels consistent with our business prior to the acquisition of Aspen.","While we expect the expansion in adjusted EBITDA margins to continue through the back half of the year we anticipate topline revenue coming in light particularly in the third quarter. In addition to what I've already mentioned in terms of our selective focus, our primary driver is contraction in the healthcare sector.","The healthcare pharmaceutical sector which has been for a number of years a solid growth contributor for Epsilon, put the other way on us in 2012 as a large number of drugs came off patent without a corresponding pipeline of replacement medications rolling out and those are what tends to drive marketing spend levels.","And while weakness in a given vertical is to be expected at times, we would normally cover off these soft spots with one or two large new opportunities coming through our pipeline and this simply didn't happened early enough in the year to give us a coverage we would like to see. In spite of the lumpiness however we are confident that the pull back will give way to gradual ramping of growth as we head into the end of the year and there are three key reasons for that. ","Number one, our pipeline has to produce wins at a pace that exceeds our year-to-date performance at the same point in 2011 and as those clients are on boarded and as revenue is recognized they will begin to drive incremental growth on our existing revenue base. ","Number two, the structural changes that I mentioned have better aligned our products and services around our client relationships and that's the key to identifying and producing cross sell and up sell opportunities. While the current traction of growth opportunities has been promising we expect this change to improve with our refined structure. ","And then thirdly finally, the platform investments in our infrastructure and in our delivery platforms for data and for digital solutions are on track and will we believe drive incremental sales performance for our business. ","So in summary, despite the low I feel very good about where Epsilon is headed. Let me hand it back over to you Charles.","Charles Horn","Thanks Bryan. Private Label continued a strong 2012 performance with revenue up 15% and adjusted EBITDA net of funding cost of 44% compared to the second quarter of 2011. Positive trends continues to be seen in four primary areas. ","The first would be receivables growth which accelerated as average credit card receivables increased 13% compared to the second quarter of 2011 while ending credit card receivables increased 16% from June 30, 2011. ","We expect this growth to continue to accelerate for the remainder of 2012. Card holder spending remained strong up 18% from the second quarter of 2011. After years of decline credit card spending is again increasing. The on-boarding the new programs over the last 12 months contributed approximately 10% of the growth. ","Portfolio quality continues to improve as principal charge-off rate of 4.9% for Q2 2012 compared to 7.2% for Q2 2011 and 5.3% for Q1 2012, improvements is on both the year-over-year basis as well as a sequential basis. Trends are now suggesting 150 basis points to 180 basis points improvement in charge-off rates for full 2012 compared to 2011.","Funding costs continue to improve as older tranches of debt mature and are replace with new cheaper longer tenure paper. Our cash funding rates for all cargo related borrowings which excludes non-cash items was 2.7% in Q2 2012, 100 basis points better than last year. ","Overall the outlook for 2012 remains positive, solid fundamental coupled with a strong top line of potential new programs, similar to 2011our goal is five new programs for 2012. We remain confident this is an achievable number.","Let\u2019s flip the page and now I talk about little bit about liquidity. At the corporate level, liquidity increased to $1.6 billion at June 30, 2012 increasing about $300 million during the quarter. Cash has increased to slightly over $600 million while available borrowing capacity approximates $1 billion. ","Net corporate debt was approximately $1.8 billion at June 30, 2012 a moderate amount given the leverage ratio defined as corporate debt through adjusted EBITDA was 2.2X compared to the maximum loans covenant at 3.5X. ","We expect the leverage ratio will decrease as 2012 progresses and we keep our free cash flow. At the bank subsidiary level, we have approximately $2.4 billion of available liquidity at June 30, 2012. During the quarter we renewed two conduits totaling $1.6 billion in commitments at favorable times. ","The largest conduit of $1.2 billion renewed for 21 months versus the traditional 12 months. This is the longest conduit tenure ever for ADS.","Continuing our dividend trend, our two banks paid ADS parent $57.5 million in dividends during the second quarter. This was accomplished while maintaining strong regulatory capital ratios. ","Lastly, we acquired approximately 500,000 shares of ADS stock during the quarter as we took advantage of temporary dips in our share price. I will now turn it over to Ed to walk you through updated guidance and our outlook.","Ed Heffernan","","Great. Thanks Charles. Obviously, the message continues to be quite positive and as such, we\u2019re once again going to raise our guidance. First, we moved our expected top line up to a nice around $3.5 billion, which is up 10% compared to 2011 and versus what we initially had was up 9% from our previous guidance. ","So top line looks it is coming in nicely. And second, we also increased our core earnings to $542 million, which is another $6 million higher than our previous guidance and if you were to go back to our original guidance, it\u2019s $40 million higher than that guidance set in October of last year. So overall, core earnings are up a very robust 23% versus last year.","From a reported core EPS basis however, nothing changes at the moment since the continuing increase in our share prices added more shares to our share account, making the increase total earnings equal our previous per share guidance of roughly $8.45 per share. ","This of course is driven by the phantom shares, which disappeared at no cost to us, when our converts mature in 2013 and 2014. The phantom shares added an additional 400,000 shares to our 2012 diluted share count versus our assumptions last quarter. What we have essentially assumed is we increased our full year average stock price expectation from our $125 to $130 which factors in the actual $122 for the first half and then we picked our high point which was a $137 for the back half which gives us a full year average of $130. ","If you net all that stuff out the bottom line is when you exclude the phantoms our guidance increased by roughly $0.06 versus the prior call. So let's step back and look at our earnings on an apples-to-apples basis against last year. ","We laid out on the next page but here is a bottom line in 2011 we reported a $7.63 in core EPS, when you exclude the 4.6 million phantom shares from 2011 our true economic earnings or $8.29 per share showing a delta between the two of $0.66. This share as our share price has continued to advance that delta has more than doubled to $1.33 said in another way what we are looking to report $8.45 in core EPS when you exclude some of $9 million in phantom shares our true economic contribution is $9.78 per share. Lot of numbers moving around, the bottom line is when the phantoms, if the phantoms weren\u2019t there we would be looking at $9.78 versus $8.29 last year which is an 18% increase year-over-year. ","Next slide walks through the details, has a bunch of numbers on it, from a guidance perspective its easy to just walk through one column at a time we started the year expecting to earn about $9.21 when you exclude the phantoms. ","This has increased quite a bit after Q4 call, Q1 2012 and again today but that are new guidance of $9.78 is up $0.57 from our starting estimates. Obviously, we've seen some very nice over performance throughout the year and certain things also you need to keep in mind when looking at guidance for time back half of 2012. And the following items have a dampening effect on earnings. ","First of all, a lot of this has to do with where the stock is. If the stock is floating around a $137 then the diluted shares with approximate $65.5 million for Q3 and Q4 and essentially drag from the new phantom shares. The $475 million Bon-Ton portfolio which we are very excited about and we expect to close in Q3 is neutral to 2012 because of this whole fair value accounting, but the good news is obviously the accretion all flows into 2013. ","So while obviously the win is a huge one and you will start seeing some nice numbers move up in terms of the overall portfolio growth and sales growth and everything else the way the fair value accounting works is it essentially we don't see the (inaudible) on the financial side until 2013. Obviously it\u2019s a nice thing to have in our hip pocket as we go into next year.","And lastly at Private Label, let\u2019s not forget that we are driven by the retail sector which means we usually have a big surge in the Q4 as people are out shopping for the holidays and that requires a big seasonal reserve build in Q4 to the tune of probably about a $30 million increase from Q3. ","Despite declining reserve rates because it\u2019s due to hyper growth in the portfolio, it\u2019s one of those interesting things where it\u2019s been so long since we\u2019ve seen hyper growth in the file we almost forget that at the end of the year we have to have a big reserve build to cover that temporary spike up at the end of the year. ","Essentially these are all timing issues and the bottom line is they all benefit future results, so let\u2019s flip to the next slide.","In the slide titled in a nutshell sort of gives us a chance to talk a little bit about the big picture where we see this year and where we are thinking about next year and beyond. I think we have hit the numbers pretty hard at this point and suffice to say top line growth of 10%, core earnings of 23% and pro forma or true economic core earnings of 18%. ","We suggest that things continue to move along very nicely for those of you who have been tracking us for years, we always talk about our businesses cycle at different times and if we can two of the three hitting on all eight cylinders that usually is sufficient to get us a very nice year. And what we are seeing this year is effectively all three businesses are doing quite well. Obviously the Gold Star this year will go to the private label business with all the wins they\u2019ve been getting but we\u2019re very pleased with the way all three businesses are going. But that being said, let's hit what I consider the three sort of big topics.","One is, let's have a discussion about are there any disappointments that we\u2019re seeing this year? Two, we always get asked this question of where is all the over performance coming from and by the way how are we using it? And I think what you\u2019ll find is as usual, we\u2019re taking a very balanced approach of using some to flow through to increased guidance, which we\u2019ve done every quarter and that we\u2019re using a bunch to essentially lock down future growth and visibility.","And then three, how\u2019s 2013 shaping up. Obviously, a lot of folks shy away from talking about something so far away given the macro uncertainties that are out there, but as you come to know with us, we feel pretty strongly about our model and I think we already have a pretty good view in to 2013 at this point. So let's start off with disappointments. Fortunately, it looks like just about everything is working this year but there is the one area of weakness that Bryan touched upon and that\u2019s one portion of Epsilon. Now, we still expect Epsilon to post mid-teens revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth for the year. And so you can sit there and say well how can that be bad. But it\u2019s a bit more of a mix picture, if you peel things back and look at what we call pure organic growth. Now, from a bottomline perspective, we\u2019re right on track with a nice solid 10% EBITDA growth rate, plus finally getting some nice margin left.","And those are two of the critical goals that we\u2019ve set for Epsilon for the year, which is you know let's get double-digit bottomline and lets start seeing the benefits of some margin left. But the only thing left is therefore organic topline and we\u2019re hoping would run in the high single digits, but it is coming in at probably half that rate for the full-year. I had communicated earlier in the quarter that we\u2019re going to be soft on the topline for a number of reasons that Bryan talked about. We actually came in a little bit stronger in Q2 with an 8% organic growth than we had earlier anticipated. So that\u2019s good news. But obviously as Bryan said, the pharma sector is unexpectedly weak and accounts for the softness, but quite frankly, we typically have one or two of these what I call AIR Balls each year and we count on bringing in a wave or two, that is a large expansion or a new client to cover it off, but alas, it was not the case this year. So job number one at Epsilon for 2013 is to get organic top back up while maintaining this year\u2019s adjusted EBITDA growth rate.","Alright. Always getting the question of over performance and what's going through, what's not going through. There is really two major drivers this year, where the big over performance is coming from and they both happen to be in our private label growth. First, obviously good news as credit quality continues to improve this year versus both last year and versus expectations, credit quality is now at the best levels we\u2019ve ever experienced, which completely smashes the age old correlation between loss rate and unemployment.","We\u2019ll probably run in the low 5% range this year, bottoming out in Q3, which is our seasonally strongest credit quarter and second and to me the most important is the return of growth in the portfolio. If you were to look at sort of a larger macro stat which is consumer revolving debt, it was growing about 7% a year for many years and topped out at a trillion dollars. As the great recession hit and continued that dropped almost $200 billion to $800 billion and essentially what you are seeing is deleveraging of the consumer and so the concern was that it would be very, very difficult to have growth return to these files and you are seeing that some of the larger players out there who are playing the more general banker space, but that is in fact an area of concern.","However since the way we grow is by signing new retailers and working to convince them that our program is more of a Loyalty tool, what we've seen is a very, very strong snap back and it's growth rates that I think we never seen before or we are heading in that direction. Specifically we had no growth in the file last year. That turned into high single digit growth in Q1, mid-teens growth in Q2 and we are currently tracking to 20% plus growth rate going into the back half and why we are so excited about this is the credit quality, funding cost, things like that they will bounce up and down but once you have core growth in the file itself what you have is an engine that keeps picking up momentum. So growth is critical to insuring over performance this year. ","It's even more important as we look into 2013 and 2014. This year, we are ploughing back some of the over performance into locking down more visibility on our future performance. At Epsilon 2012 is what I call the year of one and done for large infrastructure investments as we pull together the disparate offerings. In other words anything that needs to be done to the different platforms to bring them together, anything that needs to do be done to make them more user friendly, anything that needs to be done to put the bells and whistles on them, they need to be done this year and because we have such over performance in private label, we feel comfortable doing this.","At private label, we are foregoing super cheap short-term funding in favor of looking to the future and we are locking down as much as we can, as fast as we can long-term fixed rate money and that would be fixed rate seven-year money as opposed to taking the short-term benefit. And lastly at LoyaltyOne we talked a lot about accelerating the Brazilian rollout and we've in fact accelerated the ramp up in the new instant reward program in Canada as well. One other item, our confidence about future growth and profitability continues to translate into additional share buybacks. It was noted in the first quarter that we sort of backed, taken our foot off the gas a little bit on the buybacks, but be assured there is no long-term plan to do that and in fact we have a very significant amount of dry powder left and in Q2 we did drop around $60 million as soon as we saw a nice opening. So as usual with us we are very, very bullish about where the future is taking us. So prices at these levels, we certainly find to be attractive and we will always be there to jump in especially as our liquidity continues to pour through.","Alright let's talk about 2013 and again I know it seems a bit early to talk about it but we are, we do have enough indicators as to where things are heading that we can at least give a pretty good view of where we are and I am reminded of the fact that this is my -- as I was counting up my 45th straight earnings call. So it's been a long, long time and we have seen everything from the 2001 recession to the great recession and everything else betwixt and between and the one thing we have learned over the last dozen years is the fact that our leading indicators are usually a pretty good signal of where the company is heading in 2013 and right now everything seems to point towards the very, very healthy 2013.","Specifically private label, we continue to see a very, very strong outlook for 2013. We talked about the fact that the portfolio is continuing to accelerate, we haven't even dropped on the Bon-Ton deal yet. There are a number of other potential significant deals in the pipeline that have a couple of those pop, it's going to be a very, very strong 2013 and into 2014. And it's again what I like best is what I call old school growth, it's not coming from credit quality, it's not coming from funding, it's coming from bringing on new business, new retailers and consumer spending. Now do we expect any big pops in terms of credit quality getting worse or deteriorating given the macro environment, all our indicators say no. There maybe a slight drift upward in credit losses, but I mean very, very slight. Nothing that would knock off the importance of the portfolio growth, it just doesn\u2019t really matter.","So we see mid teens portfolio growth will drive strong increases in revenue and earnings in that business. As we look north to Canada, we continue to see solid miles being issued which again is how we make money, as Charles talked about a very moderate burn rate and solid results. At Epsilon, the 'AIR Ball' from 2012 will be gone and the return to solid organic top and continued double-digit bottom line growth. How are we comfortable there? Well what we didn\u2019t really talk about was the fact that what we are seeing in terms of new contracts signed in the pipeline as we head into the back half and going into 2013 has snapped back very strongly and we are beginning to see a number of deals getting signed that gives us good comfort for next year.","And finally, on the convertible notes, one of the two notes mature and we will pay it off with cash and a chunk of those handsome shares will go with it. I of course will mourn terribly having to discuss them every single quarter. Free cash flow is expected to be up double digit again, over 2012 expected 600 million plus number and overall we look into 2013 and at this point I can say we are looking at a very strong 2013. I think we are taking the measures that we need to take to flow through both over performance into higher guidance, but at the same time following a bunch of it back into ensuring the 2013, 2014, 2015 will also be years that will not disappoint and that\u2019s been our mantra for quite some time.","So that\u2019s pretty much it. Why don\u2019t we step back now and take some questions for a little bit. I know everyone\u2019s on a bunch of calls, but we will try to wrap it up in the next 20 minutes or so and let everyone get back to business. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Jim Cassin of Credit Suisse.","Jim Cassin - Credit Suisse","Ed I think you just touched on it, but just want to confirm with all this phantom stuff, that your intention is to settle all the converts, the ones in 2013 and 2014 with cash?","Ed Heffernan","Yes.","Jim Cassin - Credit Suisse","And then Bryan, since you are on the call and there is a low here in the third, may be the fourth quarter, how much of it's related to the sales force reorganization. Typically you have kind of some slippage when you reorganize and restructure sales. Is that part of it? And then may be just following on to that, what portion Epsilon is from the pharma industry?","Bryan Kennedy","Sure Jim. I would not say that the low has anything to do at all with the restructuring of the sales force. The restructuring of the sales force is really about on a go-forward basis making sure that we capture all the growth opportunities that are out there and if you think about as our business grows and gets substantially bigger than it was at few years back, a higher percentage of our growth going forward comes from existing clients and making sure that we have a really sort of methodical approach to how we pursue those clients from a sales perspective. We believe really it is critical to driving incremental growth. The low of this point is not really related to that. Pharma is around 10% of our business and the math is pretty simple on something like that. It\u2019s been growing at a very healthy clip, double digit even higher than that at times. It kinds of pulls back and drops to a decline, that pull back is definitely a major driver here in the performance that we are expecting to see in the back half. So hopefully that answers your question.","Jim Cassin - Credit Suisse","And that is persistent to 2013 and some of the new business that you are adding will offset that, is that a way to think about it?","Bryan Kennedy","Yeah, first of all from a pharma perspective we see things as stabilized for now. So as we move through this phase we would expect to see growth returning to that vertical, which should be key and then as Ed indicated earlier, our pipeline is shaping up nicely, a number of very solid signings that we have in the works and our year to date wins as I mentioned earlier exceed where we were at this point last year. So as you might recall, it takes a while for Epsilon to actually get to a point in revenue recognition on new wins as we build out new platforms and then roll them out, that's when we begin to see the lift from that and that's why we are comfortable with the outlook rolling into 2013.","Ed Heffernan","Yeah, I think also Jim I mean the one thing we do want to stress is like every year in every business, you know you've got plusses and minuses and surprises here and there and you know it's just has been the case over the last seven to eight years at Epsilon that anything that comes up a little bit short for whatever reason we've had a nice wave or two come in on the sale side that has covered that off. We just haven't had it this year. It doesn't mean we are not going to have it next year and that could accelerate things, it's just you know this year we had an AIR Ball and we didn't cover it off.","Jim Cassin - Credit Suisse","And then last question for Charles, can you maybe walk through the math on the Bon-Ton deal, when would you expect it to be accretive to earnings? Is that right away in the first quarter of 2013 or does the fair value account in kind of hit the first half of next year as well?","Charles Horn","I would answer it in two ways. One, we expect to close the portfolio converted probably late in July, based upon what we've seen in the portfolio, it turns about every six months. So to get the full income production, it would be early or if not the beginning of January. So what will happen with the portfolio is, it will be a little bit of a drag in Q3 and turn positive in Q4, so it nets out to be basically zero benefits in 2012 with full benefit rolling into 2013. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani of KBW.","Sanjay Sakhrani - KBW","","So I got one question on each of the segment, so bear with, sorry. Could you on private label, could you talk about how surcharging may affect you guys. I would think it may benefit if retailers actually choose to do it, but I was just hoping you could talk about that and just on the fee income practices, that the CFPB has been looking into with Capital One and Discover, I was just wondering how it affects you guys?","Ed Heffernan","I will take a shot at surcharging, obviously it doesn\u2019t, it's not really relevant to private label itself, these are all negotiated contracts with the merchants themselves. So it's completely (inaudible) when it relates to private label. Now that being said, you know if merchants do decide to surcharge for general purpose bank cards, obviously we would like to think that there is an added incentive for folks to use private label and so I would say on the margin from an incremental basis, it's probably a little bit of [kiss], but again it's too early to tell at this point, it's certainly not a negative. I would say it's probably a slightly positive.","Bryan Kennedy","And on the second issue Sanjay remember we talked about this several months ago as it related to Discover and I think we have to break it down first as to what the issue is and what the issue is that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is looking at deceptive marketing. They are not really questioning the validity of the product, so if you look at us, specifically it's really not an issue for us and I will tell you why in four ways.","One, it's not a big number for us, if you look at our total of the revenue for private label, it's right around $90 million of which any type of credit monitoring and payment protection is just as piece of that, so it\u2019s not material to us overall. The second thing is and this is the most important piece, we do not do outbound marketing either internally or through a third party. So we are not out soliciting the product. So what happens is if we have a consumer, current customer call in to one of our customer service reps, we will bring it up and then we will walk him through a pre-prepared script that\u2019s been agreed to with our private label customer. So again no outbound marketing, only inbound, it's a very strict script. The third piece is we record every authorization; we have to make sure it\u2019s fully documented. And the last piece is we make it very easy for the consumer that if you receive fills that they didn\u2019t gave appropriate approval to cancel it and get out very quickly.","So with us not a big number for us, we do not do outbound marketing. So we are not subject to deceptive marketing or deceptive trade practices. And then the third piece of it is, we just make it very easy for consumer, if they did approve but changed their mind to get out of program.","Sanjay Sakhrani - KBW","And then may be just one on Loyalty, I was just wondering the conversions of the counts from Banco do Brazil to Dotz. I mean where are we right now and how fast can that fully ramp and I guess what I was trying to think about is for next year do you guys actually recognize any breakage?","Charles Horn","On the breakage Sanjay, we will probably look first to do that in 2014.","Bryan Kennedy","In terms of Banco, there is couple of stats. There one obviously is Banco is the dominant player down there and they have relationships depending on how you define it somewhere between 30 million and 40 million different household, of which a little less than 10 million have some type of call it credit card product. Those are the ones we\u2019re going after.","And so what we will do obviously is as we flow into each new region, we will do a very strong push to align those cardholders who are in the region, who are Banco customers with the benefits of joining the coalition. But we have to have the other members of the coalition on board. So as rolling though this different areas of Brazil, there is an installed base at Banco that once we team up with the petroleum player and the pharmacy player and the grocer etcetera, etcetera, we\u2019ll hopefully drag along the Banco\u2019s to convert over to us.","So it will be part of the roll-out and in each region it goes in, a big chunk of those converts will be the already installed Banco customers. Eventually, we will move beyond the 9 million or 10 million cardholders and hopefully move much more aggressively into just the overall general relationships that Banco has which is between 30 million and 40 million households.","Sanjay Sakhrani - KBW","","Alright, so right now you are around to?","Ed Heffernan","","We\u2019ve got about 3 million collectors at this point.","Sanjay Sakhrani - KBW","","Okay, wonderful. And then just one for Bryan; I am sorry if you touched on this before, but how much reverse inquiry are you getting on mobile payments and everything that comes with that? Thanks.","Bryan Kennedy","","I am not sure I fully understand the question, Sanjay, can you\u2026\u2026?","Sanjay Sakhrani - KBW","","Are the financial firms and other partners of Epsilon kind of looking to Epsilon to provide some assistance in terms of marketing and mobile payments environment?","Bryan Kennedy","Yes, yes they are; it gets into a fair level of complexity I described, but I think obviously all of those financial players are looking at mobile payments, mobile wallet and their conversations take place on a regular basis about the right way to provision messaging into that environment from a marketing perspective so our data comes into play in that conservation pretty frequently in terms of how that data could be helpful to personalize; any sort of marketing message that may take place in mobile environment like that.","And then of course the mobile device is a pretty natural channel extension to customer data bases that we are managing for clients so the connectivity and the integration back into the information about those consumers tends to play into those discussions that has well. So I would say there is in an awful lot of talk about there right now among some of our clients and in the industry there is less action, but we are certainly actively engaged with a lot of our clients in terms of thinking through their strategies.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller of Barclays ","Darrin Peller - Barclays","Hi thanks guys; Ed I think for you the first question, overall all three of your business has obviously performed extremely well and particularly as you said earlier Private Label has been outstanding and that contributes to more or like 16% of the company\u2019s earnings versus I think around 14% in the past. Ed can you just give us a sense as to the mix of business you are looking at for the company over the next few years especially if another nice Bon-Ton like portfolio may become available, can we just maybe more specifically around you know should Brazil be a line item and its going to help that out or you know is there any kind of deals in Epsilon or like Epsilon businesses that you can do to maybe change the mix bag or what is your goal in terms of business profile?","Ed Heffernan","Yeah, I mean obviously our goal overall is to grow organic cash flow at a very nice healthy double digit cliff. I think a lot of this will cycle at different times. There is no question that this year and next year with probably its trailing off a bit as we go into \u201914 will probably be the years of huge over performance in Private Label.","What we are seeing and you know you've got to go with the trends right and what we are seeing if pipeline right now is that there are a number of retailers who are very interested in this as a loyalty product. There is also as I have talked about in prior calls a number of disaffected clients of some of the other players in terms of how they were treated through the great recession and we are going to make hay on that and essentially the Bon-Ton\u2019s and the Pier 1\u2019s and names like that, my I guess is you are going to see a number of those continue to move over to us which would suggest exceptionally strong performance in Private Label this year, next year and into \u201914.","So therefore that doesn't really address you know mix issue and so what we need to do is we need to look at the other two businesses and I do expect Epsilon in Canada to do what they need to do, to hit their numbers and that by itself will not be enough to -- if you talk about shifting where things are coming from, what will do it, however would be if Epsilon and LoyaltyOne their Canadian business continues to do what they need to do for us if Brazil finally kicks in and pulls up the way we think it will in a couple of years that\u2019s going to be a very, very big program.","And then as we head into 2013 there is no question that Epsilon as that we talked about took this year to be one in done and get their thing ready to rock and roll for next year, you will most likely see a restart of some of these bolt-on type acquisitions in between Epsilon, Canada, Brazil and some bolt-on acquisitions what you will see that combined with as Private Label begins to moderate going into \u201914, you will see a shift back to the more traditional 50% or less so more of a 50-50.","But we are certainly not stepping away from the trend in Private Label; it is a great place to be right now and it gives us the free cash flow to build up the other businesses as well. So it\u2019s going to gradually go back the other way and I think probably as early as \u201914, you will probably see something more in the 50-50 level.","Darrin Peller - Barclays","Okay, that\u2019s helpful Ed; I mean by \u201814 we can expect probably the Brazil to be -- the Brazil opportunity to maybe become its own line item would you say?","Ed Heffernan","Yes.","Darrin Peller - Barclays","I mean just in size and scale relative to what\u2019s in Canada right now?","Ed Heffernan","Yeah, if you look at Brazil there was nothing last year. We\u2019re going to be between 4 million and 5 million by the end of this year in terms of collectors, if we double that the following year, actually being talk about some big norms given that Canada itself has a total of 15 million collectors and throws up for quarter billion dollars of EBITDA. So this thing is folding up very quickly and your point is on.","Darrin Peller - Barclays","","Just one follow-up to that, I mean, it\u2019s amazing how much opportunity there use to be forming around a Private Label from a portfolio standpoint. I imagine a lot of that like you said was sort of mystery during eight or nine other timeframes and merchants looking for a change. I am surprised there aren\u2019t other credit card issuers or other banks that recognize how amazingly profitable Private Labels become, if you imagine the right way. Can you just give us a little color as to what you are seeing from a competitive landscape in terms of going after these kinds of portfolio, like maybe what you saw with Bon-Ton, what you\u2019re seeing with maybe things coming out of GE or HSBC or others?","Charles Horn","","I prefer not to but I say a lot of it has to do with what others are offering. It is, has always been the case of us and versus the big banks. And the big banks are after what they do for a living, which is lets have big balances and make our money on finance charges and everything else. We will outsource for the most part the processing, networking, the customer care; the retailer can keep that in the marketing and database functions they can go to another vendor for that. ","Well, what you already always done is a 100% of our client must choose all four of those functions if they want to be part of our offering and so what we found, what we have found and what is accelerating and it\u2019s hitting Bryan\u2019s area over and Epsilon as well for clients who want the same stuff but don\u2019t need the credit component to it. ","What we are seeing in Private Label is more and more retailers are looking at it as a loyalty tool and when you can get down a skew level information, which now have is extremely rich data that you can segment and then market to and at the same time Private Label is a perfect platform for exploiting the various distribution types that are out there whether it\u2019s direct mail, permission based email, targeted display, social or mobile, all of those, you know are natural extensions. ","Once you have the skew level data all segmented and pooled up ready to go. So, I think a number of higher end type retailers which are target based recognized that. That\u2019s why we\u2019re seeing a lot of renewed interest in the Private Label space and I don\u2019t think to answer your question finally, why us not in it is because of the fact that I don\u2019t think others view the Private Label product itself holistically as a loyalty tool. They view it as a finance tool and that\u2019s, I think, adds to our benefit.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of David Scharf with JMP Securities.","David Scharf - JMP Securities","","Just a couple of follow-ups. When you refer to, I think you said significant yields in the pipeline that are related to Private Label. Are these pre-existing programs in house that maybe acquired or are you talking about significant retailers that don\u2019t have any program that would be sort of a green field of balances?","Charles Horn ","Both and as you've known for I mean followed us for many, many years the vast bulk of our new signings have typically been retailers who started program from scratch and what we have seen obviously this year and there is no question based on what you are seeing in the pipeline going into next year to supplement that there are number of significant size files which for us are anywhere between $300 to $500 type million that seem very attracted to our model. ","So again it's building on the fact that you go where the trends are and you go where the business is and what we are seeing is it's a combo of both although David there aren't a lot of in house programs left so this would mainly be takeaways from some of the large banks.","David Scharf - JMP Securities","Okay, just two quick ones on the other segments. On the loyalty side so now it's 25% redemption growth in the first half with the miles exploration having been put in and since that drives revenue recognition you know little bit of a sense of how we should view redemption growth in the back half of the year?","Charles Horn ","It's once your point David we do expect to redemption growth to moderate and actually drop some obviously in Q3 and Q4. So that we will put a little bit of pressure on top line growth, but it could actually somewhat stimulate profitability generally when we have lower redemptions we can generate some better surplus of gross margins. So your premise is correct you probably see a little bit of slowing in revenue growth Q3 and Q4 but I don\u2019t anticipate it will affect our EBITDA flow through.","David Scharf - JMP Securities","Okay, perfect and lastly on Epsilon, over the years listened to a lot of calls where there's a discussion of significant pipeline and kind of a two steps forward, one step back on the margins is going to have to ramp up for new assignments. It sounds like things are a little different this time, can you expand a little bit about perhaps what some of the non-core products are that maybe you've rationalized, eliminated and how we ought to think about normalized margins in that segment going forward?","Charles Horn ","Yeah sure David, I mean first of all just in terms of your comment about the pipeline and growth you think about the number of businesses that Epsilon has brought on board over the past several years and the sort of sales structure and client services structure, part of the margin focus and the margin expansion is around really getting that structure streamlined so that we have one organization that sales and services into our key client relationships. ","And that means being pretty focused on headcount and accountability and making sure that we've got the right folks lined up to serve clients and the right kinds of capacity and to the extent that we do that well which we've done over the course this year that's where you begin to see that margin expansion take place. ","I think we spent the last several quarters talking about the fact that as Aspen has come into Epsilon\u2019s overall P&L you see a little bit of dilution now that we are starting to see that bounce back to the historic trends for Epsilon overall pretty good evidence of the kind of lift that we are getting and that we believe will continue to get over the back half of this year and into next year and then around your question on non-core products and being selective you know I would say two things. One is we've been very careful not to go out and buy business, you can go out and buy new business in any point in time if you are willing to sacrifice margin and that to us is not a winning strategy.","We might get some gain in the short term but you end up with a problem in the long term, so we have been very careful to avoid that and then from an operating perspective is we kind of look across our different businesses and what we find common in our agency offering and our database and our digital offering in terms of overlap, those provide us with some opportunities to begin to streamline and cut back any of the overlaps that are redundant, unnecessary or in some cases that actually don't contribute from a margin perspective.","So without getting into much more detail, that's pretty much what we are focused on from a products perspective. If you think about how that impacts us from a margin perspective in 2011, we were at 23%, 2012 getting that to 23.5% and then getting an additional 50 basis points of lift going forward keeps us nicely in the mid 20s on a go-forward basis as we thought we are after.","David Scharf - JMP Securities","So that's helpful and just one quickly you know when we think about the mix of services at Epsilon, obviously the agency business at Aspen is the lowest margin contributor as the least operating leverage. When we talk about the pipeline and how booming it is right now versus this time a year ago, is there anything in the mix that would weigh down margins a bit, is it more weighted towards agency or is it more weighted towards traditional data and processing database?","Ed Heffernan","No, I don\u2019t think there is anything that would shift the mix. It\u2019s a good blend across all, you know frankly every pitch that we go into now is a fully-integrated pitch where we are bringing together our strategy and analytics, our agency capabilities, data, digital and database and then the ability to then execute messages across channels with a distribution perspective. So we like that mix, we think it\u2019s critical to keep it healthy. In fact it goes back to our whole rational for picking up Aspen in the first place as we believe the buying decisions really are going to be centered across a span of offerings and if you get too heavily concentrated in one area, you are going to find yourself on the wrong side of the deal. So we have got good healthy representation across the board in the pipeline today.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Carter Malloy of Stephens.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi guys, it\u2019s actually [Ben] on for Carter. Thanks for squeezing me in. A couple of quick questions on Epsilon, first Bryan can you give us some more detail on the drag and the data business?","Bryan Kennedy","Yeah, I mean we have had a couple of verticals, financial, insurance and telco in particular this year. In our compiled data business that have not performed in the way that they historically have and that\u2019s been a growth drag on the compiled data business, so this is our non-cooperative, non-Abacus data products. And that\u2019s been offset on the positive by continued growth and strength in Abacus which continues to perform very well for us as traditionally not a high growth business but solid mid-single digits growth which contributes really nicely from a bottomline perspective.","And the other thing I would say about data in general is that\u2019s also an area of our business where you've added on a number of new businesses over the past several years and the data realm, if you think about bringing together effectively new raw ingredients that takes some time to put those raw ingredients together, build new models, get those models embedded into client relationships and so as we\u2019ve gone through that process, you get a little bit of bumpiness and that\u2019s a little bit of what we've experienced over the past last year as well. So, good news from my perspective is that, that decline in our compiled businesses coming down as we go in to the back half of this year and we\u2019re rolling out a number of new product offerings with this raw ingredients if you will more fully compiled in a way that we think will drive the return to growth in that compiled business.","Unidentified Analyst","","Sorry, if you've already answered it, but do you have, can you kind of give us a sense of how big pharma is and kind of maybe your timeline, your internal timeline of when you expect pharma to kind of comeback or pick up?","Bryan Kennedy","","Sure, pharma is right around 10% of our business. I mentioned earlier, I think that, that has traditionally been a nice grower for us, double-digit, mid-teens, even north of that at different times, shifting to a decline, right around a double-digit decline for us this year. That has stabilized to answer your question. For us as we go into the end of the year, so we would expect to see a gradual resumption of growth and you know on pharma that is an unusual scenario for us. It is not typical that we see something that is systemic, that is an industry-related impact versus something that is revolving around a specific client or our business in particular. So as the industry goes to some degree that will I think dictate how our growth plays out, but we see it pretty stable at this point.","Ed Heffernan","We are going to wrap up now; we appreciate everyone hanging in there. I know you got a bunch of other stuff to do, but obviously we are pretty jazzed up and again will talk to you next quarter and sorry we couldn\u2019t get to everyone today. So have a great day.

At this time, all parties have been placed on a listen-only mode. Following today's presentation, the floor will be opened for your questions. (Operator Instructions) In order to view the Company's presentation on their website, please remember to turn off the pop-up blocker on your computer.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Ms. Julie Prozeller of FTI Consulting. Ma'am, the floor is yours.","Julie Prozeller","Thank you, operator. By now, you should have received the copy of the Company's fourth quarter and full year 2013 earnings release. If you haven't, please call FTI Consulting at 212-850-5721. On the call today, we have Ed Heffernan, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Charles Horn, Chief Financial Officer of Alliance Data.","Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on today's call and some of the responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties described in the Company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC. Alliance Data has no obligation to update the information presented on the call.","Also on today's call, our speakers will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe will provide useful information for investors. Reconciliation of those measures to GAAP will be posted on the Investor Relations website at www.alliancedata.com.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Ed Heffernan. Ed?","Ed Heffernan","Great. Thanks, Julie, and joining me today is our [indiscernible] and CFO, Charles Horn, and Charles will discuss our operating results for the fourth quarter of 2013 and I'll wrap it up with the final scorecard for 2013 and moving into 2014. And with that, I'll turn it over to Charles?","Charles Horn","Thanks Ed. It was a strong finish to a record year. Revenue increased 17% to $1.14 billion for the fourth quarter, bolstered by 14% organic growth. Importantly, revenue growth was balanced with double-digit growth in all three segments. Our profitability growth was even better. Adjusted EBITDA, net of funding cost, increased 18% to $290 million while core EPS increased a stellar 30% to $2.39 for the fourth quarter of 2013.","A higher than expected diluted share count for the fourth quarter, $66 million versus a guidance of $64.7 million, was offset by a 300 basis points improvement in the effective tax rate. Our guidance for the fourth quarter did not consider either but it was essentially a wash, a $0.05 benefit from the effective tax rate offset by a $0.04 drag by the higher share count. Fortunately, the diluted share count will drop in 2014 as the second tranche of convertible debt matures, while the lower effective tax rate is expected to be sustainable in the 36% to 37% range going forward.","For the year, revenue increased 19% to $4.3 billion, supported by very strong 9% organic growth. Adjusted EBITDA, net of funding costs, increased 16% to $1.25 billion while core EPS increased 20% \u2013 core earnings increased 20% to $669 million. Core EPS increased 15% to $10.01, exceeding Company guidance of $9.90. This was achieved despite a $0.43 drag from the higher year-over-year diluted share count.","The Company's effective tax rate dropped 70 basis points to 37.5% for 2013. The improvements for the fourth quarter and the year relates to our ongoing strategy of using international profits to invest in new international growth opportunities. Let's go to next slide and talk about LoyaltyOne.","LoyaltyOne's revenue increased 13% to $245 million while adjusted EBITDA increased to robust 19% to $68 million for the fourth quarter, overcoming a 6% decline in the foreign currency translation rate. On a constant currency basis, revenue increased 20% and adjusted EBITDA 26%. The expansion in adjusted EBITDA margin is a result of favorable operating leverage, higher margins on redemptions and a $3 million reduction in losses associated with international expansion efforts.","Importantly, AIR MILES reward miles issued increased 12% over the fourth quarter of 2012 due to a significant promotional activity in our credit card, gas and grocer sectors as well as the continued ramp-up of new sponsors. The strong second half growth in miles issued offset negative percent growth, producing full year issuance growth of 4% compared to 2012.","For the fourth quarter, AIR MILES redeemed increased 24%, approximately one-half from the ramp of AM cash redemptions, that's your [install] (ph) reward program, and [indiscernible] from better product availability. For the full-year 2013, AIR MILES redeemed were essentially flat with 2012, as we looked to manage the program to achieve a lower burn rate, 74% 2013 compared to 77% 2012. The target burn rate for 2014 is expected to be down again at approximately 71%.","Entering 2014, [indiscernible] breakage rate by 1%. The new breakage rate will be 25.6% representing 26% for the base program and 0% for the [indiscernible] reward program. The 1% change is based on the trending of AIR MILES as the program moves forward to 2016 expiration date for miles greater than five years old. We expect to offset this through lower offering expenses and higher product redemption margins.","During the fourth quarter, LoyaltyOne announced that it was expanding its international footprint by acquiring 60% ownership in Amsterdam based BrandLoyalty, one of the largest and most successful data-driven loyalty marketers outside of the U.S. BrandLoyalty is a growth company driving consistent, double-digit organic revenue growth which is really what attracted us to the company. We expect the overlay of LoyaltyOne's advanced analytics and advisory services will lead to future revenue synergies. This transaction closed on January 2, 2014.","Lastly, dotz, our Brazilian joint venture ended 2013 with 10.6 million collectors, [exceeding] (ph) our 10 million target at the end of 2013 and about double the number of collectors we had at the end of 2012. In addition to member expansion, the dotz program launched in four markets during 2013, bringing the total number of markets to nine. Importantly, [indiscernible], the biggest sponsor in the dotz program recently signed a multiyear renewal.","Let's flip over and look at Epsilon. Epsilon finished the year strong with the revenue up 28% to $375 million for the fourth quarter, driven by 14% organic top line growth. Adjusted EBITDA increased 34% compared to the fourth quarter 2012 as Epsilon achieved excellent operating leverage resulting in a 140 basis points expansion in organic adjusted EBITDA margins.","Now let's look at each line of business within Epsilon in a bit more detail. Agency continues growth leader increasing 52% to $196 million in revenue for the quarter. Organic revenue growth was a solid 20% driven by strength in the auto and telecom verticals. Recent signings from the auto vertical should help continue strong agency growth rates in 2014.","Technology revenue increased 12% compared to the fourth quarter of last year. This double-digit top line growth was driven by stellar performance in database, partially offset by continued weakness at e-nail. Database revenue increased 18% as we maintained momentum across the majority of our client base. E-mail revenue declined slightly due to customer attrition. The rollout in new Harmony platform, which is both a full-service and cloud based tax solution, is expected to drive growth opportunities in 2014.","Data revenue increased 30% in the fourth quarter primarily due to growth in our online offerings. Historically, data revenue growth is slower rate than the rest of Epsilon's product offerings and that is expected to continue but they are still an integral part of our bundled solution. Overall, we expect our online offerings to continue to increase as a percentage of the data mix.","In summary, it was a very good year for Epsilon, achieving organic revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth of 12% and 13% respectively. From a growth standpoint, we continue to work on cross-selling opportunities through a set of broad-based internal initiatives and expect agency to continue to be the tip of the sphere driving these efforts. As a result, we feel comfortable with our ability to draw a continued high single-digits organic revenue growth.","From a profitability standpoint, our focus on expense management as we fully integrate HMI, coupled with an improving mix towards higher value-added products will allow adjusted EBITDA margins to expand about 40 basis points in 2014.","Let's now turn and talk about Private Label. Once again private label delivered double-digit revenue growth during the fourth quarter of 2013 with the revenue increasing 13% to $526 million compared to a 14% growth in average card receivables. Adjusted EBITDA net of funding costs increased only 1% for the fourth quarter as it was burdened by 27% increase in provision expense related to seasonal ramp-up and the ending credit card receivables.","As you may recall, we always have a timing issue in the fourth quarter as a portion that's provision billed relates to recently originated card receivables that have not yet become income producing assets. Said another way, we record provision expense in '13 related to these new receivables that won't contribute to earnings until 2014. Private Label's ever-growing marketing capabilities which drive incremental sales for retail partners amplified this trend this past holiday season. We will talk about this more later.","It is also important we talk about the increasing operating expenses which were up 17% for the fourth quarter and 24% for the year. This growth rate which exceeds our revenue growth rate is intentional for the short-term. With a double-digit backlog of new programs to launch, our risk for 2014 is executional risk, meaning that we don't launch when a client expects or perform to the client's level of expectations. These expenses represent a deliberate, upfront personnel investment to ensure that we meet our obligations to existing as well as our new partners.","Funding cost continues to trend down as 2013 progressed. Expressed as a percent of average receivables, our funding rates were 1.6% and 1.8% for the fourth quarter and full-year respectively. For 2014, we expect a funding rate of 1.6%, approximately 20 basis points better than 2013.","Turning to the next slide and looking at the various stats on Private Label, you can see that our differentiated business model helps us drive above market rate, growth rates in credit sales and receivables. For the fourth quarter, credit sales increased 16% resulting in average and ending card receivables growth of 14% and 16% respectively. Our growth in credit sales is particularly impressive given that the overall consumer spend increased only about 4% during this past holiday season and that was largely achieved due to heavy promotional activities by the retailers.","Our retail partners results were really no different with the majority posting results at or below the overall U.S. average increase. However, our card programs were bright spot driving incremental sales for retail partners and creating [industrial] (ph) gains for us. This [industrial] (ph) gain can really be seen as it relates to our core programs and the ones of you who have no idea, that means card programs we've had for more than three years where our credit sales increased 8% compared to the fourth quarter of 2012.","Finally, delinquency and principal charge offs is trended as expected in the fourth quarter. As talked about earlier in the year, we believe that the principal charge-off rate bottomed during the second quarter of 2013 and will more closely follow typical seasonal trends on a go forward basis. Our expectation for 2014 is that the principal charge-off rate will stay in the 4.7% to 4.8% range.","To summarize, our growth strategy is working for Private Label. We're expanding our card holder base, driving [tender share through our 'no more sell more'] (ph) strategy using multiple channels and onboarding record number of new card programs. This three pronged approach promotes short-term growth but also lays the framework for long-term growth.","Before I leave this slide, it's really one more thing I'll focus on and that is the gross yields. The gross yield for the fourth quarter was down about 50 basis points. Most of that if not all of that is attributable to the onboarding of new programs. Again if we go back and look at the core file, programs we've had for more than three years, the gross yield is consistent year-over-year. So I think that's a very important consideration as you evaluate the change in yields.","Turning to \u2013 actually I want to address one more thing before I turn to liquidity and that is that I want to talk about confusion recently surrounding Private Label segment, An unusual thing happened this year and the fact that the call reports for our two banks were filed before we held this earnings call. Some people added the two call reports and thought the results represented the entire segment. It's not that simple.","The Private Label segment is comprised of three parts; one, our Utah bank; two, our Delaware bank; and three, our servicing division. The call reports do not include the servicing division while the overall Private label results do. Usually not a big difference but it was 2013 as we changed the process charge by the servicing division to the two banks to better reflect market pricing. The impact was about a [$60 million] (ph) improvement in profitability at the servicing division compared to 2012. So really it was a bit of a necessary drama.","Turning to liquidity, Company liquidity was very robust $3.8 billion at December 31, more than sufficient to execute our capital allocation plans for 2014. Breaking it down, corporate liquidity which reflects available drawn capacity and usable cash was $1.3 billion at year-end. Outstanding corporate debt at December 31 was $2.8 billion, essentially flat compared to 2012 but supported by a much stronger leverage ratio, meaning our EBITDA to debt ratio fell from 2.3 to 2.0 times.","Bank liquidity was $2.5 billion at year-end, outstanding borrowings at December 31 aggregated $7.4 billion and were comprised 40% of term asset-backed securities, 20% conduit, 35% CDs and 5% money market demand accounts. So it's very diversified funding. The average duration of the borrowings approximated 27 months with 74% turning at fixed rate.","For 2013, we used $231 million of our $400 million board authorization to buy 1.4 million shares. We were more active in the first half of 2013 than the second half of 2013 for an obvious reason, accretion. As the year progressed and our share price increased, our capital allocation prioritization shifted to M&A opportunities capable of providing superior accretion. We were successful and found BrandLoyalty. Entering 2014, we have a new $400 million authorization which will continue to be a key part of our strategy. The only question is whether it will be number one or two in terms of prioritization. Obviously the recent pullback in our stock price has opened up a very nice buying opportunity.","With that, I will turn it over to Ed.","Ed Heffernan","Great. Thanks Charles. I'm moving on to the 2013 wrap-up page and I'm glad Charles addressed some of the confusion around that call report stuff. We've been to that dance before and it's important that you look at all the pieces and obviously you seem them to get combined today in the financials. So sorry for the confusion, obviously things are in very good shape but you can always call the Company if you start hearing about a piece here or a piece there and Charles can put the puzzle together.","So that being said, on '13 wrap up, again what I focus on and what the Company focuses on primarily is organic growth. As we're seeing obviously the market results coming in across various companies, once again it looks like the top line from an organic growth perspective seems to be the one item that is struggling. And so here once again it looks like we had a bang up here as it comes to organic growth as compared to the follow-up in GDP growth rates over the past two years and likely going forward it becomes increasingly hard to grow above the nominal GDP growth rate.","From our perspective however, we would suggest that we can comfortably grow in the high single-digits which would put us at least 3x on nominal GDP, 4x on real GDP and we did so in '13 as well as in '12 and in '14 it looks like it's going to be a similar repeat. For us to be very clear, organic means that we take out or the pro forma any acquisitions, be it of a company or of a portfolio and we look at true organic growth rate.","So that was very strong for '13. Our model essentially is combining strong organic growth with modest M&A and that should drive mid-teens, adjusted cash flow growth and core EPS growth. While doing so, because the Company does have a lot of free cash flow, we've been able to maintain very modest net debt levels of around 2% \u2013 sorry, 2.0 or less and a result of this quite a bit of dry powder as we go into '14 and '15. Also I think we've done a number of things that I'll talk about in terms of shoring up visibility for '14 and beyond.","Before we hit that I think it is important that we go back and say what worked for us in '13 what didn't work for us in '13 and be very frank about you know the minuses as well as the plusses, and if you looked at LoyaltyOne, I would say three out of four was certainly positive. I would say the miles issued increasing 4% in '13 after being down 4% in the first half comes exact double-digit in the second half, very nice job for the folks at our AIR MILES program.","Again I know there was some scepticism early on in the year that we could make such a strong swing but it turns out that these folks did a wonderful job getting us there. Second, very strong year for new sponsors with Staples, Old Navy, Irving, Eastlink and Good morning, and again for a program that's been around for 20 plus years, adding big new sponsors certainly suggest that the future looks bright.","On the negative side, quite frankly the Canadian consumer is stretched and we're seeing it in the card spending nums and we're seeing it in the overall consumer spending numbers up there. Again, this is more related to the housing situation in the sense of the fact that Canadian households are allocating an increasing portion of their disposable income to servicing housing cost, which have continued to go up. They did not experience the type of hit that we had here in the States and as a result that's choking off some other spending that would otherwise flow into our program.","So again, we want to watch that. I don't think it's anything that's at crisis level but it's something that certainly we need to be cognisant of. Also the Canadian dollar has shown some weakness and continues to show some weakness and we need to watch that as we go into '14 as well.","Turning back to the positive side, the expansion of the program in Brazil came in better than expected. We now have 11 million folks wind up in the program, we launched another two relatively small markets in Q4 that was in the release yesterday, and with the renewal with Banco we're up for the races and we're going to continue to grow that thing more and more each year. Our goal is to get somewhere up to about 25 million collectors I think is a reasonable number.","At Epsilon, very strong organic growth, double-digit organic growth on top of hunting a 39% total revenue growth, and if you look at overall, we saw some margin expansion of 100 bps. Our strongest areas were strength in the auto vertical, financial services vertical, CPG and the retail verticals. Those were all very, very strong for us this year.","Again on the negative side, if you were to look at all the pieces of Epsilon what was disappointing, there's no question that our e-mail business was disappointing this year and hopefully with the launch of our new platform called Harmony, we will see that turn during the latter half of '14. So stay tuned on that one, that is probably job number one at Epsilon this year. On the good news side, the other piece is agency database and the other digital pieces were very, very strong and continue to benefit from the secular trends in the marketplace.","On Private Label, it was a boomer, no question about it. Average card receivables up $1.3 billion or 22%, and what's interesting as I mentioned before is if you look at consumer revolving debt, right, that hasn't budged for years and prior to that it was growing 7% a year before it tanked from a $1 trillion to $850 billion and then it's been essentially flat since then for many years. The industry maybe growing zero, maybe growing 1% or 2% if folks are lucky, pumping up 22% growth in that environment means something's working and we think our full-service approach is something that is unique to the marketplace and does continue to work.","Credit sales growth 22% versus nominal GDP, growth of 3%, again something seems to be working here and I would say we highlight of not only the year but of the holiday season which is so important to our retailers and Charles already mentioned is the fact that if you look at holiday spend in U.S. you know that's what number you choose, but it's about up 4%. Our retailers were up somewhere around 2.5% to 3%, so a little bit underneath that.","If you were to look at those retailers who've been with us for many years, so these are relatively mature Private Label clients, our growth rate against their 2.5% to 3% was actually 8% to 9%. So we grew three times the spend growth rate of those retailers, and if there was any doubt in prior years whether this mousetrap works, the answer I think was shown during the holiday season.","So it was the bright spot for many, many retailers in the sense that yes it does work that when you accept data and you weren't to understand the data and hence the customer, you then use that to do very, very focused targeted marketing offers through multichannel distribution that you know what you can drive that person online one extra time to make that purchase, you can drive that person into the store to make one more purchase.","And the ability to do so was never more evident than in this holiday season and I think that is behind the fact that we have had a huge number of new signings starting in '13 going into \u2013 I mean starting in '12 and then in '13 and the backlog quite frankly is even bigger in '14. So there is no question that this product that we're offering to the marketplace has hit the sweet spot of where the retailer wants to be.","On credit quality, Charles mentioned things look stable, we've flown around that 5% level where we were at in '12 we're at in '13 and we're going o be at 5% or under in '14. So no excitement at all when it comes to the \u2013 credit quality's picture looks very solid and we think that will continue through '14 and beyond.","Also probably the biggest thing in terms of looking forward was the fact that if you understand our business seeing an announcement of a new client is obviously great news but it doesn't do a thing for our bottom line in the first year. In fact it takes up to three years before that client moves up to the point where it's generating very nice revenue and earnings for us.","So in a sense every time you see an announcement you can think of that as a big investment for years three, four and five and the good news for us was the fact that as we talked about, this product seems to be selling like hot cakes and right now we're at the point where we did sign a $2 billion vintage, that means it will spool up to $2 billion in portfolio size during the 2013 year. To put it in perspective, that's 15 signings versus a typical four to five in any given year. So it's been quite a year in Private Label and we look forward to more of the same.","Let's go to '14 and talk about guidance. We've had a lot of questions over the last month or so about well, looks like '13 was a great run, '12 was a great run, '11 was a great run, '10 was a great run, can the train keep running into '14 and beyond? Having done this for an awful lot of years, I can certainly say at this point the answer is, yes. We are expecting another very strong year in 2014. We do have visibility very nicely through most of the year and we are right now investing heavily into building for '15, '16 and '17.","We have updated the guidance to reflect two things. First as Charles mentioned, we wanted to roll in the BrandLoyalty acquisition. That will add about $500 million because we take in 100% of the revenue even though we can only recognize 60% of the earnings. So pop in about $500 million in revs for BrandLoyalty over in Europe and that would add about $0.25 to core EPS putting us up about 19% or so for the year.","The softer Canadian dollar is going to hit us for about a nickel. So the net $500 million to top line and about $0.20 to core EPS, puts overall growth rate and earnings per share at about $12.20 which is about 22% growth rate versus this year, which isn't so bad. So again, very strong year, more of the same, probably not a lot of drama, just very nice solid growth going forward, mid-teens top line growth rate, high single-digit organic top line growth and over 20% core EPS growth rate.","Let's talk specifically about how the quarters are going to roll out because it's going to be different this year than the past couple of years and essentially you have a couple of big drivers. So Q1 will still come across and have very strong mid-teens top line growth. So right out of the gate, you should see strong top line growth. But our earnings will be held back and dampened down to the mid-single digit growth to reflect one big thing and that is the unique opportunity that we're seeing in Private Label.","What we're looking at right now is we're going to grow operating expenses in our Private Label group as much as 25% versus prior year which is a huge amount. We're doing that for one simple reason and that is we are building for '15, '16 and '17, and to put it in perspective, we normally bring on four to five new clients per year, in 2012 we brought on seven, in 2013 we brought on 15, and in 2014 we are going to bring up over 20 new clients on our platform. That requires ramping up expenses well ahead of the revenues.","We talked about revenues come down flow-through in the later years, not right up-front, and so we're going to go ahead and sit there and say, all right, this is the right thing to do and what does that mean, it means we added 800 people to the card group during '13, we're going to add over 1,000 to the card group in '14, most of them are already onboard and getting ready for the 20 plus new clients that we're bringing on.","So essentially the infrastructure, the people are all in place to ramp up these 20 plus new clients. That bodes extremely well for '15, '16 and '17 when the revenue pours in the door. At the same time however, it will dampen Q1 but it won't dampen the year. Business is absolutely booming. We believe we can continue to grow earnings 20% this year while at the same time really getting some nice visibility into '15, '16 and '17 for our card business, and also with our extension and expansion in Brazil and in Europe, we think we can set the table for having a very strong international footprint in future years as well. So it's a little bit of I think we can deliver some real nice nums for 2014 with high single-digit organic top line and 20% plus EPS while at the same time absorbing some huge investments for the big growth spurt that's coming down the road.","Turning to 2014 outlook, again more of what you heard us talk about forever, which is the marketing dollars continue to flow into the data-driven marketing and loyalty programs. I don't think that's news to anyone. We've been saying pretty much the same thing for about a dozen years and all we're seeing now is it looks like it's picking up which is obviously good news for us. You know the fact that our assets consist of data, consists of platforms, loyalty programs, analytics, digital distribution, we're kind of sitting right in the middle where a lot of these trends are converging and I think we're sitting in a good spot.","One thing I do want to say, because people ask sometimes about how we are different or how we compete with some of the other models that are out in the marketplace, my belief is that this is a huge and growing market and as a result there are going to be more than one model that will be successful. You could have a model that is pure software-as-a-service, you could have a model where it gets expertise in one piece of the puzzle which could be whether it's e-mail or data or something like that, or you could have the Alliance model where we are effectively an end-to-end solution, one-stop shopping all wrapped in a very, very solid 12,000 person services model.","I think all three will have a very good shot at being successful. I think if you're in one of those three, you need to be the biggest and the best and our job is to be the biggest and the best in this area that we've chosen. So again, I don't see it necessarily competing with other models. I think there are a number of large companies out there who want one-stop shopping with a lot of service attached to it and those are the folks we're going after.","Again to finish up, ADS is going to look to drive organic growth at two to three times that of the market and real GDP. Turning to 2014 outlook specifically, at LoyaltyOne AIR MILES, relatively flat revenue growth with low single digit adjusted EBITDA growth. Again, we're looking at some dampening by very soft Canadian dollar versus where it was in 2013. We think the economy in Canada from what we're seeing is a little bit weak vis-a-vis the U.S. and the consumer is stretched. And then finally, one of our verticals, pharmacy, there's a big unknown right now but there is recent legislation essentially questioning whether we can issue reward miles AIR MILES on the pharmacy sector, so stay tuned on that one. Again at the end of the day, we should have some decent issuance growth throughout 2014.","BrandLoyalty, the acquisition adds about $500 million and that should be up double-digit organically from where they were in 2013. Brazil, we're looking to add at least another 2 million members by the end of 2014 which would put membership up 20%. From a revenue perspective, I think the overall entity will do U.S. about 140 million, which is up about 50% versus where they ended this year. Again none of this is captured in our financials, so it's a very nice sort of off-balance sheet asset that's growing in value very quickly, and again we're very, very bullish on where this thing is heading.","At Epsilon, high single-digit organic revenue growth to continue. We look for a little bit of a kiss in terms of margin. Very strong 2013 signings and that can provide for good '14 visibility. And one of the things here is, for whatever reason it's kind of strange but it's really, really tough to get our clients that we signed to let us issue press releases when we're building or launching a big new loyalty platform. It's interesting to read about all the new programs that are out there in the newspapers and stayed on TV and actually go to some of these places but we are definitely not having much traction in getting our clients to let us sort of sing the praises of these new loyalty wins.","To give you a sense again about the trends that we're seeing out there, much like in Private Label, this stuff works and we had 23 wins in 2013 versus a normal rate of about 15. So normally it's pretty busy, '13 it was very, very busy. So you start in the numbers as database, went from a very soft back in Q3 of 2012 and we called it then the air pocket, and then it's finishing up high single-digit organic top line growth and based on the builds that we're looking at bodes very well for '14.","Finally, Private Label, very robust pipeline. We talked about historically we sign four to five clients, will bring on a few hundred million of growth in the portfolio when it matures after three years of seasoning. And then last year, or I'm sorry in '13 we signed $1 billion vintage, last year we signed on a $2 billion vintage, and based on the pipeline right now we are looking at signing another $2 billion vintage this year. So it is incredibly robust at this point in time.","The focus of the retailers is entirely on the ability of our closely-knit network to link the consumer with her purchases down to the category or SKU level. And again you saw it during the holiday sales lift where our card members were running at 4x, where the retailer was running at. So pretty exciting stuff and again double-digit organic revenue growth. As Charles mentioned, yields are holding up very, very nicely and the growth is there. There's just going to be an awful lot of upfront expense to get this puppy up and going as we move into the next few years but it's all good.","Principal loss rates, very similar to '13. The way the delinquencies are flowing and what we're seeing on the recovery side, I would just that first quarter is going to be slightly over 5% and the remainder of the year we feel pretty comfortable will be below 5%. So I think coming in at 5% over the last couple of years and 5% this year is pretty close and I think maybe we can do a little better than that.","Okay summing up, great '13, more of the same for '14, first making big investments in both the card business as well as in the international expansion in both Europe through BrandLoyalty and in Brazil. I think that's about it. At this point, why don't we turn it over to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani from KBW.","Sanjay Sakhrani - KBW","So a couple of questions. First just on Private Label, I appreciate the color around the yield, Charles, just as we move out to this year, you expect yields to remain relatively flattish relative to last year, is question one, and then secondly, what kind of receivables growth are you guys assuming in 2014?","Charles Horn","Couple of things there from a growth yield standpoint, combined has probably been about 40 basis points in '14 compared to '13. If you break that down, the core programs will be stable to maybe even slightly up. The onboarding of the 20 plus programs that Ed talked about will be what drives the little bit of decline in overall yields. In terms of growth, we're looking at least 15% growth in average receivables year-over-year. I think with the potential that we're seeing in the top line, that could be a very conservative number.","Sanjay Sakhrani - KBW","And then, as we look out into the future, when can we expect some operating leverage in Private Label, I'm understanding that you guys [aren't] (ph) investing this year, is it next year or is it later than that?","Ed Heffernan","It's by Q3 of '14.","Charles Horn","","So essentially what you're seeing, Sanjay, is we're getting ready for the new volume, we're getting a new call center in Q1. When you put in [indiscernible] call center, you staff up immediately, so growth is going to b coming Q3, Q4 and going into next year. So by Q3 you should see some leverage.","","Sanjay Sakhrani - KBW","Okay, great. And then just on the Loyalty division, when you guys discuss taking on the breakage rate, I guess what's really driving that, is it engagement, is it the economy, because I've heard like American Express talk about in a weaker economy people like to redeem more of their points. Is that what's happening there or is it just maturation or what?","Charles Horn","Clearly maturation is part of it I think. From my standpoint it's just another data point. Historically, we've always had an actuarial analysis that helps us determine what the rate should be. Now we have the benefit of with the expiry policy in place we can track the maturation of our miles driven five years old. So really what you have is just the ability now and have another data point that can influence where you want it to go.","Beyond that in some cases it could be a case like American Express who decided to let it move a little bit just as part of running the program. So again with all the moving pieces of loyalty program, you've got the ability to make money on the marketing upfront, on the servicing of the program, on the product redemption as well as breakage. You can make your money in different ways and maybe in case where you want to run the program slightly differently where that can influence that break rate going forward as well.","So my end of the line statement would be, one, you've got another data point here, and then two, based on the way you want to run the program can influence that to some degree.","Ed Heffernan","","Yes, I would say that if you looked at where we put the stake in the ground years ago where we wanted this thing to be, we're pretty close and right now as we are getting closer to 2016 when some of these actually start expiring we want to be even more precise and so we have the outside folks run all these models and if we tweak breakage of point here or a point there, as Charles mentioned, there are other levers that we pull and we can maintain the margin going forward. So I think we're in good shape.","Sanjay Sakhrani - KBW","One final question again on operating leverage but this time in Epsilon, obviously you guys are getting some operating leverage in Epsilon but I assume there's still investments being made, so Harmony probably is one area, I mean as we look out to next year, should we expect that you might get more traction in terms of operating leverage because I'm sure there's room for more operating leverage there, right?","Ed Heffernan","Absolutely. We've given guidance of 40 basis points in '14, could be more in '15.","Sanjay Sakhrani - KBW","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller from Barclays.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital","Nice quarter. Just want to start off following quickly on the Private Label side, I mean here with the number of signings that you're expecting this year, first of all if you could maybe deconstruct it a little bit, I think you said about 19 or 20 for the year versus mid-teens last year, I mean how many of those should we be expecting to be portfolio acquisitions versus organic, real business wins? And then just a bigger picture question, if you can help size this opportunity, I mean you've talked in the past about the number of private label retailers out there that potentially meet your profile, but we're going through 14, 15 to 20 now, and it's a great run rate, just want to know how long it could last?","Ed Heffernan","So are we and I think that right now times are good. I think that the interest and especially once the numbers get out there about the holiday season and how effective the program has been, that will crank it up even more. And I think that from an overall perspective we're probably not going to move up of our sort of original number. If you were to look at a couple of new verticals like T&E that we've been into with you know the Virgin deal and Caesar's, that opens the market up a little bit but if you were to really slice it and dice it down to what's attractive to us, we think it's probably about a $30 billion receivable market that looks doable and you know if we can keep cranking along at a couple of billion a year in vintages, I think obviously that's a real long runway if we're looking at wherever we wound up this year, 10-ish or something like that. So we got about a third done and about two thirds to go of what we think is the real market.","In terms of how long it's going to last, I don't know. I thought that frankly '12 was the high watermark and then '13 doubled '12 and as we're looking at '14 it looks like another 2 billion vintages is there. And so it's already beginning to lineup for the following year. So we're kind of running out of slots quite frankly. So that's what Charles said is, our biggest issue now is executional risk which is why we spooled up 1,000 people for the beginning of this year for programs that aren't even going to be coming on till later on. So we're real careful about that.","From the 20 that we're talking about, I would say probably three quarters, now probably 80% of those will be starting programs from scratch and there may be a few portfolios in there but by far the vast majority of them will be organic growth.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital","That's great. And the one that are not, does that includes Coldwater Creek I guess and perhaps PayPal or PayPal is sort of new?","Ed Heffernan","PayPal was a start-up. They had no program but we started it up from scratch when they came over to us, and Coldwater would be, that's an acquired file, yes.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital","Got it. All right, that's helpful. Just a quick follow-up, with the AIR MILES issued number 12%, we felt that that was a pretty impressive number and just curious to know what we should expect. I know you gave some guidance but in terms of long-term run rate with the Canadian consumer being able to more stretched, I mean just give us some idea as to how that's actually being achieved and really what we should expect over the course of the year in terms of trajectory on AIR MILES issued?","Ed Heffernan","As we continue to learn every year, trying to look at it on a quarter by quarter basis can be very painful to derive a trend from that. So on an annual basis, what do we do, 4% miles issued, I think that's a good target going forward.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital","All right. And then just quickly on Loyalty task, obviously with [profitable result] (ph) now in renewals, that was one of the big questions you had around whether or not you perceived taking majority, so what are your updated thoughts on that? I mean is that something we're closer to doing now?","Ed Heffernan","It's certainly something that [indiscernible] at some point, we'd love to take another look at it. That's all we can say on it.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital","All right, guys. If I could just squeeze one last quick one on Epsilon and I'll turn it back to the queue, Epsilon obviously performed 14% organic growth from 16% the quarter before, you guys are calling for I think high single digit growth rates now, if anything agency continues to grow really well and you know almost [indiscernible] a call option to improve, so what would drive the deceleration I guess you can say albeit still good rate?","Ed Heffernan","I think we were little \u2013 we are going in '14 being cognizant of the fact that the digital agency piece went through the roof especially in the auto sector, and so the question is, is that repeatable in '14 or not, and so until we see that we can achieve that type of growth again, we've moderated our expectations on the agency side.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital","Okay, that's helpful. Thanks guys, good quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Napoli with William Blair.","Robert Napoli - William Blair","Question on the security, as your thoughts around security and the hackers are getting, continue to get more sophisticated every year and there have been suggestions that the Private Label, the retailer Private Label portfolios they might have more risk than the general purpose credit card market. I was just wondering what you're doing on the security side, what investments you're making there, if you've seen, if you've had any issues or have seen any issues, I mean obviously I think most of those would be announced for your retailers?","Ed Heffernan","Yes, I mean actually the Private Label card itself is probably much less attractive to a hacker than a general purpose credit card, right, because you are talking about a card with a $800 credit line that can only be used to buy a specific line of clothing or something like that. So it doesn't lend itself to the type of hacking activity that you'll find in the general purpose card environment with credit lines of around 5,000 and can be used anywhere. So I don't think that concerns us.","However, obviously you know we do have co-brand products, but I would say overall our focus on the security is not only on as I call it bubble wrapping the whole company but we have an awful lot of data, right, over in our Epsilon side that is equally valuable to outside folks. And so I would say our security efforts are two-fold, it's both focused on specifically the card business and securing those cards as well as the overall data within the entire ADS organization.","We spend some incredible amount of money every year and it is a bit of an arm-stretch, right, it's the more you build up, the more defences you put up, the more sophisticated the offense is. What we have figured out and we do talk with obviously a number of other large companies out there and share information about who's doing what and where, is that it continues to be less about firewalls and getting inside and more about this whole spear-fishing stuff, seems to be the area where folks are getting in. So a lot of that has to do with educating the employee base and we spend a lot of time on that as well.","Robert Napoli - William Blair","Thank you. A follow-up on the eBay relationship, I need more color you could give on how \u2013 I mean are you now issuing or taking some credit risk under the Bill Me Later program and how are you working with them on their Wallet and then update on that because it seems like it could be a very big program long-term, and I'm still little confused on how that's working and what other services you're providing?","Charles Horn","I think, Bob, the Bill Me Later program is going exactly as we expected. I think it's going to be a good program, [indiscernible] for us. We do take some credit risk, we keep a small undivided interest in the portfolio, again it's fairly small, that we will take credit risk on the profitability that's primarily driven by the upfront merchant fee. In terms of traditional marketing support, we don't have that same level yet but that could be an opportunity for us down the road to expand our relationship with eBay.","Robert Napoli - William Blair","Thanks and just last question, the Harmony, how is that rollout going and you've mentioned some customer losses, has that rollout stand the losses and the e-mail space and are you getting traction with clients with it yet?","Ed Heffernan","It's a little too early to tell. We think the future functionality of the platform has been very attractive to our prospects that we've shown it to. Quite frankly right now it's a question of getting it rolled out and people converted on it before we can actually say, yes, this is market competitive. I would say we're two quarters away from making that call.","Robert Napoli - William Blair","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dan Perlin from RBC Capital Markets.","Daniel Perlin - RBC Capital Markets","Just a couple of quick ones. So I heard you guys talk about margins on redemptions being higher, I was trying to understand what was driving that and why that would be sustainable?","Charles Horn","Again, we have unilateral control of the programs to specify what products we offer, how we price it and then what products we give. So it's actually quite easy to control, it could be a case where you just give a little bit cheaper products so you know what are your cost to your mile or it could be a case where you just make more miles to be used with an equivalent cost of the products to get more margin. So it's a very flexible way of dynamically running the program that we have unilateral control over.","Daniel Perlin - RBC Capital Markets","Okay, so it's just your mix that you guys have been playing with it in terms of the conversion ratios for that. Okay, the other thing is, I wanted to explore this recent legislation impacting the ability to have rewards programs for prescription drugs at the pharmacy, I know pharmacy is a very big vertical for you guys, can you maybe put a finer point on what that is and then if there's the guideline that we need to be aware of to monitor that?","Ed Heffernan","It's primarily in the provinces in the Western Canada and I guess the concern is that when someone picks up a prescription getting rewarded for that prescription for reason I guess some people are having some challenges with is that the right thing to do or not. To me frankly the idea of rewarding someone to keep making sure that they're taking their required medication is probably a good thing. But then again no one asked for my opinion. Bottom line of all of it is that it's a few provinces in Western Canada, it's probably a total of a couple hundred million miles out of over 5 billion. So it's under 5% of our issuance for sure, but it's something that we need to watch because if it rolls through, we need to make sure that we have some mitigant in terms of other issuance avenues to make up for that. So it's not a killer from that perspective, it's a few points for sure but it's under 5%, and it's kind of a wait and see this year and we'll keep you posted on it.","Charles Horn","Just to be clear, it's a big vertical for Epsilon but this is not [indiscernible] Epsilon at all. It's a purely isolated Canadian market.","Daniel Perlin - RBC Capital Markets","Okay. I wanted to ask, Ed, you mentioned an $800 credit line like average credit line, is that what you guys are at now? If it is, that's a pretty big bump-up from what I remember being in, and then if that's the case, how much of that is driving your [indiscernible]?","Ed Heffernan","Actually our 800 line has been fairly consistent. We've been around 750 to 800. You may be thinking our balances, balances are more right in the 4-ish, 400, 450 range.","Daniel Perlin - RBC Capital Markets","I was thinking line, so I was [indiscernible].","Ed Heffernan","It's not there something to scale that fast.","Charles Horn","Okay, co-brand lines were a little bit higher, Dan, but Private Label lines we've not really moved very much.","Ed Heffernan","You get open to buy there usually about 300, 400 and you get \u2013 the balances take up about 50%, 60% of [line] (ph).","Daniel Perlin - RBC Capital Markets","Got it. And then just one quick last one, I want to follow-up on what Sanjay was asking, so the 40 basis points decline in gross yields, that's a mix issue that you guys are seeing right now, it's not an issue with the profitability of 5the new programs long-term and so the message is that it's coming down but that's not necessarily say drumbeat coming down, you have to say I need to break on the programs, is that correct?","Ed Heffernan","Yes, as Charles mentioned, the core portfolio [indiscernible] incentives with us for three years and more, right. They've seasoned and so their yields are flat to last year. So they are solid. But any time that you slap on 2 billion of new business that's ramping up, right, you're going to have a pool-up time and that's what's going on.","Daniel Perlin - RBC Capital Markets","Okay, understood. Thank you.","Charles Horn","We'll take one last question.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of George Mihalos from Credit Suisse.","Georgios Mihalos - Credit Suisse","Congrats on the quarter. Just wanted to circle back on the Epsilon margins just to make sure I understand you're talking about that 40 basis points improvement in '14 versus '13 yet the ad agency business continues to grow at very strong healthy clicks, so am I thinking a bit wrong that the agency business should be diluted from the overall margin for Epsilon or is something else happening to help drive the margins higher next year?","Charles Horn","No, you're absolutely right, George. Over the last two years, if you look at '12 and '13, where we bought two agencies, it definitely had that impact. Now what happens over time is as percentage of the mix gets stabilized, it will start to drop a little bit as we cross-sell, up-sell into the higher value-added products. That's part of it. Now obviously as we can integrate multiply HMI, that gives you a little bit of benefit coming through on the leverage as well.","Ed Heffernan","Yes, but let's also be crystal clear here, this event was offered as a service, right. I mean this is not, here's a bunch of software, here's the platform, go have a ball. What we are focused on is a premium level service offering and you know we've been over 5,000 at Epsilon providing that level of service. So you are not going to get the type of leverage that you know you see with some of these other, here just have the product and walk away. We're specifically going after the very deep long-term commitment with a promise of premium level service and you're going to get some leverage, as Charles said, 50 basis point is probably a good number, but that's it.","Georgios Mihalos - Credit Suisse","Okay. And then just last question, you spoke a little bit about the potential for BrandLoyalty revenue synergies, I assume that's bringing that model to the U.S., can you provide any details on that, it sounds like it's not in your numbers for '14 but when might we start seeing that start to come through?","Ed Heffernan","","It's a fair question. It actually goes both ways. So if you think of BrandLoyalty specialty are these shorter-term 12 to 20 week type loyalty programs, what we don't offer would be the longer-term large loyalty reward platforms that either Epsilon or the coalition program folks in Canada offer. So that would be something that we would be adding to their portfolio of products and at the same time let's keep on about it, we have not been able to penetrate the U.S. marketplace in the grocer segment, we just can't seem to solve the puzzle. We're doing pretty well in a lot of the other verticals but we can't solve the grocer. And perhaps these folks at BrandLoyalty have the secret sauce where maybe the grocers are focusing more on there's a lot of interest in the shorter-term, move the needle, right out of the gate type program that fits with their DNA better than these huge big loyalty builds that we've been focused on in the U.S. So if that's the secret sauce, we'll be thrilled to death, but it should \u2013 you're going to see it out of both sides.","Georgios Mihalos - Credit Suisse","Okay, great. Thanks guys.","Charles Horn","Thank you everyone.","Ed Heffernan","Okay, I think that's it. So I want to thank everyone for their \u2013 to put up with us and talk to everyone next quarter. Bye-bye.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"1361":["Alliance Data Systems Corp.

Heffernan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Steve. Welcome, everyone. Joining me today, as mentioned, is Bryan Kennedy, the CEO of Epsilon and Conversant (sic) [Epsilon\/Conversant] (1:38); and Charles Horn, our always dynamic CFO. Bryan will update you on both Epsilon and, in particular, the trends that we're seeing at Conversant, and Charles [audio gap] (1:52) the results, and then I'll finish up and discuss our final outlook for this year and then what we're thinking about for 2016.","So, with that, I'll turn it over to Charles.","Charles L. Horn - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Ed. It was a strong and balanced third quarter for Alliance Data as all three operating segments achieved double-digit growth on a constant currency basis. Importantly, organic revenue growth continued at a double-digit rate. This allowed us to drive 20% growth in revenues to $1.6 billion for the quarter, despite FX headwinds which dropped the growth rate by about 5%.","Adjusted EBITDA net increased 20% to $453 million for the third quarter of 2015, as we were able to successfully flow through the increase in the top line to the bottom line. Core EPS increased 14% to $3.95, exceeding our guidance of $3.90 for the third quarter. A higher share count, up about 3% compared to the same period last year, and FX headwinds of about 4% dampened the growth rate.","EPS decreased 24% to $2.08 for the third quarter, burdened by approximately $0.65 in charges related to consent orders entered into by Comenity Bank and Comenity Capital Bank with the FDIC pertaining to practices associated with certain credit card add-on products. These practices were principally for the years 2008 to 2013, and we believe that we have substantially addressed the FDIC's concerns.","Turning back to the share counts, you may remember the increase in share count is due to 4.6 million shares issued late in 2014 to acquire Conversant. Since the acquisition date, we have bought back 3.3 million shares or about 73% of the shares issued to acquire Conversant. We've done this for two reasons. First, we remain bullish on our stock, and Ed's always eager figure to get shares in the door. And second, we are adding financial leverage to the Conversant acquisition consistent with the manner in which we'd have liked to last year, but weren't quite capable. We have done so while maintaining a prudent leverage ratio of 2.8x.","Let's go to the next slide and talk about LoyaltyOne. LoyaltyOne had a solid third quarter with revenue up 10% or $33 million and adjusted EBITDA of 11% or $8 million on a constant currency basis. Substantial FX headwinds reduced reported revenue by $59 million to $299 million and adjusted EBITDA by $14 million to $65 million for the third quarter of 2015. AIR MILES issued increased 5%, while AIR MILES redeemed grew by 7% from the third quarter of 2014.","Additional bonuses and promotions related to our Sobeys relationship, as well as a few other grocer sponsors, helped drive issuance growth during the quarter. AM Cash, our instant reward program which is popular within the grocer vertical, is primarily driving the growth in both issuances and redemptions.","As we have talked about before, much of the strong promotional activities seen in the first half of 2015 will not likely be replicated in the second half due to the pull-forward of several programs. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect issuance growth to decline about 7% but still remain on track for mid-single-digit issuance growth for the year.","Turning to BrandLoyalty, it was another great quarter with the revenue up 30% and adjusted EBITDA of 42% on a constant currency basis. Strong program performance, most notably in Germany, and improved margins from a few core programs contributed to the top line growth and drove a 200-basis-points-expansion in EBITDA margins. The expansion into North America continues to be a key growth initiative and is gaining traction as we have already signed contracts in excess of $40 million. The initial pilot for the U.S. market is set for early 2016.","Lastly, an update on dotz, with over 60 million collectors enrolled, the program is the largest of its kind in Brazil, growing its collector base at more than double the rates of the next largest program. Market expansion remains key, and we plan to launch into a major market before year-end.","I will now turn it over to Bryan to talk about Epsilon\/Conversant.","Bryan J. Kennedy - Chief Executive Officer","All right. Thanks, Charles. Epsilon's revenue increased 41% to $532 million, and adjusted EBITDA increased a strong 60%, both helped by the acquisition of Conversant in December of 2014.","If you were to exclude Conversant, revenue and adjusted EBITDA increased 5% and 6%, respectively, for the third quarter of 2015, with margins expanding by 300 basis points, also mostly due to Conversant.","For legacy Epsilon, third quarter showed steady progress as we improved by a full point in both top-line and bottom-line growth rates compared to the previous quarter. Much of that lift came from strong performance in our Technology Services business, along with good strength in the automotive vertical where existing clients were adding on additional services. And that over-performance more than offset some of the project softness we've seen within agency.","Okay. Turning to Conversant in the next slide. I'm pleased to report that after three straight quarters of revenue declines, Q3 demonstrated a substantial recovery and came at flat versus prior year, reversing a trend which had appeared to be accelerating over the first half, but was in fact all part of the transformation process we have been undergoing the entire year. Specifically, we spent the first half of the year purposefully pruning some portions of the business that relied on more commodity-like offerings as we shifted our focus toward an intensive data-driven, people-based approach to digital marketing.","As we demonstrated over the first half, these offerings are more profitable, evidenced by the growing improvement in EBITDA performance over the first two quarters, and then punctuated by adjusted EBITDA growth of 9% in Q3 on a pro-forma basis, with margins improving about 300 basis points over prior year. But we also believe that this approach, the data-intensive, people-based marketing, and personalization approach, offers the best opportunity for top-line growth.","The turn from decline to flat also demonstrates the success of our second major focus during the first three quarters, which was to introduce the power of the Conversant offering to our enterprise Epsilon client relationships.","The backlog of $50 million of annual potential has continued to gain traction, swelling to over $70 million as we continue to add wins with newly signed clients including brands such as Patagonia, Toys \"R\" Us, Norwegian Cruise Lines, Nature's Way and a leading American automotive manufacturer.","Importantly, these wins demonstrate a few key reasons why we brought Epsilon and Conversant together in December of last year, and I want to take a second to walk through those. First, Conversant's assets are unique and differentiated in the marketplace. But they needed the benefit of access in a space that's crowded and noisy and filled with a lot of large and small companies calling on clients with a lot of bold claims. Epsilon's trusted client relationships have provided fertile ground to introduce the unique assets that Conversant brings to the table.","Second, Conversant's offering built around the power of first-party transactional data, so commerce data, is not only differentiated, but it just provides better results. Each of the wins with Epsilon clients involves a rigorous process of testing in which the accuracy and persistency of Conversant's offering has been proven with side-to-side comparisons, with the ultimate determinant being measured not by clicks or views or impressions but really looking at online and offline sales which, at the end of the day, is all that really matters to our clients.","And third, it was critical for us to continue the transformation of the business through investment in the common platform, which brings together the CRM, mobile, video display and affiliate platforms to create the most precise and reliable cross-device, anonymize identity database powered by over 2 billion transactions that we see every month. This platform allows us to understand the unique device profiles of each consumer with 95% verified accuracy, using deterministic, not probabilistic, methods to identify those individuals. And those investments now are really beginning to pay off for us.","Earlier this quarter, at Advertising Week we were awarded a Mobile Mafia Award for innovation in advertising with the best technology publishing platform for mobile. And all that is due to our rich cross-device capability, something that clients are really striving after. Our platform accurately reaches over 90% of iOS and Android users, enabling our client brands to connect to consumers where they live on mobile without dependence on device IDs or cookies.","We also launched this quarter our personalized video offering, which extends Conversant's powerful contextual video offering by incorporating 150 million individualized profiles from Epsilon data, enabling our clients to dynamically personalize pre-roll video advertising on both mobile and desktop, tailoring offers to individuals to drive relevance in response while preserving viewability and brand safety, which are super important in the video world.","As consumers continue to shift toward online content consumption and away from traditional television, we're intent on leveraging the power of our Epsilon data and the Conversant common ID platform to continue to create effective advertising opportunities for clients.","So, summing it up together, Epsilon and Conversant have a rich offering spanning data, technology, analytics, strategy, creative, and digital distribution at massive scale to allow the global 1,000 CMO to maximize the trend of data-driven omni-channel marketing. We have an online and offline data asset that together allows us to understand consumers better than any company and a delivery engine to reach those consumers, again both online and offline, with persistency, accuracy and relevance.","And our emphasis on a services-driven model that leverages the power of all that data and the deep technology IP that we have, but powered by a brilliant team of marketing professionals equipped with the expertise to really drive real measurable results for our clients, is a core differentiator for our business.","Looking ahead, we still have lots of work to do, but we are very encouraged by the trend we're on. The backlog of wins, while making a modest contribution to 2015, should give us a strong running start for 2016. In the U.S., we're on good footing with this growing backlog. And now, our focus will turn to expanding across our cross-sell program to new verticals, the clients within other parts of Alliance Data to our affiliate marketing business and to international. While it has taken longer than we thought to work through the turn, we are bullish and excited about the next several quarters as we move from riding the ship to now focusing on innovation and on growth.","Okay. That's it on Epsilon and Conversant. I'll turn it back over to you, Charles.","Charles L. Horn - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Bryan. Terrific job for the quarter. Let's go to the next slide and talk about Card Services. It was another in a long string of quarters with double-digit growth in both revenue and adjusted EBITDA net. It all starts with credit sales which were up 34% for the third quarter. Organic credit sales grew an impressive 19%, complemented by solid back-to-school season, representing just over half of our credit sales increase for the third quarter. The rest is fueled by significant new partnerships.","Our core clients, those who have been with us since 2011, saw credit sales increased 9% as card members shopped more frequently and spent more. This combination drove an estimated 175 basis point increase in our tender share for the third quarter. The value of our offering to our clients is simple. Customers with one of our cards shop more often, spend more and are more loyal than their non-cardholder peer group. An area of focus for us is digital sales are those sales which have occurred outside of a physical store. Notably, digital sales have increased to 27% of all credit sales from the third quarter in 2015.","Additionally, mobile channels now represent nearly 10% of all new credit application. These trends, driven by established Gen Xers and millennials confirm the evolution of today's shopping journey as customers leverage their smartphones as a primary tool to shop and purchase.","As such, our mobile strategy is deliberate and focused on our clients' future growth in this area. We recently announced the launch of our full mobile loyalty suite aptly called My Loyalty app. This proprietary suite provides a branded wallet solution that allows retailers to collect, connect and leverage key shopping data while using their existing technology. We are seeing that early adopters deliver nearly 30% increases in transaction sizes when using their mobile card versus their physical plastic. These impressive results were achieved by leveraging our understanding of the consumer, how they are changing, what they are telling us, and how we turn the data they provide into valuable, actionable insights.","Turning back to our strong financial performance. Average card receivables increased 30% driving an impressive 23% increase in revenue for the third quarter of 2015, marking the 15th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. Operating expenses grew at a slower rate, 20% reflecting our focus on gaining expense leveraging. The provision for loan losses increased 50% due to strong receivables growth and our expectations for about a 30 basis point increase in principal loss rates this year primarily due to the seasoning of a large 2013 and 2014 vintages. The bottom line suggested EBITDA net increased 14%. From a credit perspective, we continue to see low, stable delinquency rates. And our principal loss rates that are trending toward our guidance of mid-4s for 2015 are up about 20 to 30 basis points compared to 2014.","Looking forward, our outlook remains bullish for a number of reasons. First, we have signed a number of new currently unannounced clients. Second, a robust pipeline that will enable us to continue signing $2 billion annual vintages. Third, our ability to leverage joint opportunities across our lines of business such as with Toyota (16:17), an Epsilon client, becoming a Card Services client. And lastly, our ability to use data insights to drive further tender share within our existing partnerships.","With that, I will turn it over to Ed.","Edward J. Heffernan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Great. Thanks, guys. I'm on the slide 2015 guidance and critical goals, sort of an update on the full year, and as we head towards the finish of the year, where do we stand. Again, let's break it down by platform. And if you start with sort of the group under LoyaltyOne, you start with our BrandLoyalty business which you can think of as our European platform. That's the platform that essentially extracts data above the purchases of shoppers primarily at grocery stores and uses that information to then target and drive shorter-term loyalty programs from that platform on behalf of the grocer.","They, obviously, have done exceptionally well not only last year but this year as well. You'll also notice that there is a certain amount of choppiness in the results. So, it's very hard to predict on a quarter-to-quarter basis how they'll do. But it's pretty straightforward when it comes to the full year. So, we do caution folks to look at the full year, and that's really how we look at the business. So, you noticed in Q1, I think revenues were up about 100%. In Q2, they were down 7%. In Q3, they're up 30%. So, it's determined by when the programs are run.","The bottom line of all of it is they're having another heck of a good year. And again, if you normalize for a constant currency, that is assume that the foreign exchange rate this year was the same as the foreign exchange rate last year, we call that constant currency, you'll see that they're up strongly double-digit both top and bottom.","I think probably the biggest development there is the expansion into North America, that is pretty exciting for us. We started up in Canada, which made a lot of sense because we have some very strong longstanding Canadian grocer relationships from our AIR MILES program. And sure enough, we were very successful in selling into those sponsors this shorter-term loyalty approach along with maintaining the longer-term approach with AIR MILES. And as a result, I think we are looking at somewhere up to $40 million run rate in terms of revs just out of Canada alone. We're, obviously, looking south of the border as well, and, I guess, south of the Canadian border that is. And you'll hear more and more about some of the pilots we're beginning to get as we move into the latter part of this year and into 2016. But, obviously, if we can get the U.S. ripping, it should be a pretty large market to be additive to BrandLoyalty. So, double-digit top and bottom there, all organic.","We then turn to Canada. And again, Canada, that platform, same concept, except the fact that it's a coalition, the number of folks having a common loyalty program that is shared. But, again, the thesis is the same, which is utilizing the information from the members to then develop incremental marketing programs to drive higher sales and engender loyalty across the sponsor base.","The critical thing to look at there is how has the weakness in the Canadian economy impacted our ability to issue these miles which are based exclusively on the dollar spent. And what we found was it didn't have a big impact. And, in fact, our issuance growth, which again is the key driver of eventual financial performance, has been quite strong. And we target mid-single digits because that will eventually flow to mid-single-digit top and bottom-line growth, and we've been successful at doing that this year.","A large part of the growth has come from the grocer segment. So, perhaps, it had something to do with the fact that if things are a little bit tougher, some of the more non-discretionary spend category such as grocer and pharma and petroleum actually do a little bit better. So, regardless, we think the issuance growth is a good predictor of future financial performance. And as a result, Canada seems to be hanging in there quite nicely. So, two for two on that one.","We then turn to Epsilon and Conversant, and Bryan did a good job walking through. I just wanted to reiterate on core Epsilon itself. The big goal for this year, frankly, was let's see if, in addition to growing revenues, we can actually benefit by flowing it all the way through to the bottom line or EBITDA growth. If you recall in 2014, we had revenue growth of around 7%. But due to the very high labor cost associated with a lot of these hot skill jobs, where we're competing with the usual folks for talent, the actual bottom line growth was essentially nothing.","So, we wanted to change that and to refocus on those areas where we had a competitive advantage. And I'm pleased to report that this year it looks like we're in pretty good shape there. Mid-single-digit top line is, in fact, flowing to mid-single-digit EBITDA growth, and that's our job. So, I feel good about that.","Conversant, a big sigh of relief you're hearing from this end of the phone in the sense of it's always challenging when you're a public company and you have an asset that you bring on board that you know needs to go through some level of transformation. And in this case it was transforming sort of the Conversant model. Really, the old ValueClick model from a sort of more of a commodity-like product in today's world to really a unique product that focuses on pulling in customer SKU level information online\/offline, using it with Epsilon, and that will help drive very targeted and focused marketing across the display, mobile, tablet.","And that has been extremely successful, as we talked about, it caused a fair amount of angst I know out there for the first half of the year. It looked like the trend was not our friend in hitting, in worse shape than we have thought. But in fact, that turn has been reversed completely, and a lot of it has to do with the huge book of business that has been signed, I think, our backlog of signings is now up to 70 million on an annualized basis and still growing, and the year isn't out yet, which suggests this thing works.","We think that the ability to marry the sort of unique SKU level platform with the access that Epsilon can provide to the CMOs out there has in fact worked. So, therefore, we're feeling very good about where Epsilon is, where Conversant is heading as we close out this year, and a great running start for next year.","But again, as a public company, we don't want to do this too many times. It wasn't the most fun that we've had over the years. It's, basically, trying to change a tire on a moving car while under scrutiny. So the tire has been changed. The car's in good shape. We've turned the corner. And also, we've actually expanded margins on top of it, which in ad tech, it's tough to find folks who actually make money, let alone make the type of margins that we have.","So, I think we can finally put this one to bed. This should be a good contributor, not only to the Epsilon client base, but as Bryan said, we're equally excited as we roll it into our Card Services group, our Canadian AIR MILES business, those clients, as well as our European platform partners. So, we get a long, long runway to sell the Conversant offering into the massive client base we have here.","Okay. So, that's that. And we certainly don't want to be light on the Card Services group. People are beginning to just sort of take it as a given that they have a tremendous quarter. But we do want to call out the fact that they had a tremendous quarter. Once again, you have a marketplace where probably traditional card services is growing maybe 3%, something like that. And our portfolio was actually up 25%.","The reasons behind that start primarily with the core clients that we've had for many, many years. We continue to see very strong growth in tender share, meaning the percentage of dollars that are spent at that retailer that are placed on our card continues to grow. And so, if a retailer is doing 3% or 4% sales growth, we're actually doing closer to 9% to 10% at that retailer. So the first 10% of growth comes from these folks who traditionally you would think have maxed out, and they haven't. And a lot of that has to do with, once again, to beat the drum, the ability to take SKU-level, purchase-level information and flip that around into very focused marketing information, targeted marketing across multiple channels.","So, the tender share gains are driving probably 10 points of growth. And then Charles talks a lot about the $2 billion vintages. And what are those? What that essentially means is each year we want to sign about $2 billion worth of business which really means that we can sign a bunch of clients, primarily clients where we're starting from scratch. And over the course of, let's say, three years, at the end of three years, the combined portfolio size for all of those clients for a given year will be roughly $2 billon.","So when we say $2 billion vintage has been signed, that essentially means that three years from now, we'll have added $2 billion to the portfolio itself. And again, this is $2 billion this year, $2 billion last year, $2 billion the year before, we expect another $2 billion next year.","Again, there are a number of non-disclosed clients that we've signed, but just a sample of some of the others included Toyota, Cornerstone, Wayfair, Hot Topic, Farmers Insurance, Red Roof, Univision. It gives you a sense of the breadth of this offering across multiple verticals, and we do see a very strong demand based upon our pipeline for this to continue, strong double-digit revenue and EBITDA growth for this year for sure. Very strong demand out there in the marketplace as, and Bryan alluded to this in Epsilon and Conversant, as ad dollar shift from traditional channels into the data-driven targeted marketing channels, which is what we do on the private label card business.","And then finally, obviously, delivering the full digital suite, all these different mobile apps and all that we continue to roll out. It should be noted that a typical client for us actually has \u2013 almost 30% of their sales are online at this point, which is quite high. So, it's, I think, overall, in the U.S. retail space it's more like 10%.","So, being at 30% means that we need to be on our game when it comes to offering the latest on the digital side, whether it's an online purchase or someone is applying for the card while they're shopping in the store, being able to do it as they're shopping over the phone, having a virtual card pop up, having their loyalty points and their rewards and coupons and everything else handy in their mobile device. Those are all critical items we see going forward.","So, again, we're pretty excited about it. And overall I know that, from a macro perspective, there's a lot of noise out there in terms of lack of revenue growth. We have a long-term model that essentially is -- we expect to grow three times the rate of growth of GDP. And I think this year we're running north of that, probably around 10% or 11%, and then in constant currency actually around 14%. So, we're in the right markets for sure. And then with the Conversant deal, we'll do 20% plus. We got a $1.3 billion of free cash flow. And I'd say, overall, we had two big challenges this year, one being the Conversant one that we talked about. We'd like to think that is in the rearview mirror at this point. And then the second is the foreign exchange headwinds that have dinged us for about $250 million top and probably $0.50 on the bottom line. So, those were both a bit unexpected. And hopefully, we don't have that level of excitement next year.","So, that's where we are for this year. If we turn to the actual dollar guidance. As we talked about, we're going to stick to our guidance of roughly $6.5 billion top, up about 23% in core EPS. Looks like we're going to make that 15 number which also looks pretty comfortable at this point. That includes a drag of $250 million on the top due to FX, and another $0.50 drag on the bottom. But again, the organic revenue growth for the overall company is 14%, which is well above our model.","Before we move on to 2016, talking just briefly about our use of capital, probably three areas. The first being our European platform, BrandLoyalty, taking our ownership stake up another 10%. We're at 70% today, and we'll move that up to 80% as we move into next year. So nice, sort of steady progression for that great business in Europe.","The second is, of course, we need to set aside capital as the portfolio grows in our card business. And so, if we're looking at this year, almost $3 billion of portfolio growth, obviously, that needs to be backstopped with capital down in the business itself.","And then, third, it sort of was a twofold play this year on the buyback, and that was the fact that, when we did the Conversant deal, we did it for roughly $1 billion in cash and $1.3 billion in equity. Obviously, we would have preferred to do it all in cash at these cheap rates, but we didn't. We did what we thought was prudent at the time. The weaker, soft stock price this year has really given us an opportunity to take advantage. And we have taken out over two-thirds of the equity that was issued in the Conversant deal with low-priced debt. So, in terms of our cost of capital for that deal, it has dropped significantly, which should make the return in the accretion quite a bit higher.","So, despite being somewhat disappointed at where the stock has traded this year, we have taken advantage of it, nonetheless, and that should pay dividends going forward. So, that's really the game plan for where we stand on 2015. Let's turn to 2016.","I guess, as a general statement about 2016, you've got a lot of the noise that's out there and a lot of headlines about sort of the slowing global macro environment and what does that mean and are people going to still be able to grow their businesses. We've looked across all of our businesses, and frankly, we think we are going to have another very strong year and look no further than probably revenue. On a purely organic basis, we're thinking our goal of three times the GDP growth rate. We think we're going to be north of that, again, somewhere around to 4x GDP or maybe around 11% growth.","So we're not really seeing the impact of a slowing global environment in our businesses. And a lot of that, of course, has to do with the continuation in the shift of the massive dollars being spent in marketing shifting away from general and into data-driven targeted marketing. So, clearly, the trend is moving in our direction again, and we stand to benefit from that.","From initial 2016 guidance, I know it's very early. And we'll clean it up a little bit when we release Q4. But we'd like to set some base expectations. At BrandLoyalty again, our European business, we look for another year of double-double top and bottom when it comes to constant currency growth rate there.","In Canada, we actually are looking now for mid-single top and bottom growth there as we begin to see the benefits of the positive issuance start flowing to the financial. So, on a \u2013 when you factor out any fluctuations in foreign exchange and look at the businesses themselves, we should have a very strong year out of both BrandLoyalty, very solid year out of the Canadian business.","We then turn to Epsilon, and again, we've been running somewhere around 5%, 6% top and bottom. At core Epsilon we'd like to continue that trend, and then this time, let's actually have contribution from Conversant in terms of, at this point, we're just going to say high-single top and bottom throughout 2016, which will be a very nice add. It will also really, if you were to look on a pro forma basis of where the combined Epsilon and Conversant will come in this year, you're talking three-ish, probably top and bottom combined, we expect that to double next year to 6% to 7% top and 6% to 7% bottom.","So, we want to double the performance which essentially means that Conversant's turn has to be real, and we think it is as we look at Q4 and going into next year. So, hopefully off to the races there, cards, we don't really see any major headwinds out there. We expect, once again, to sign a $2 billion vintage. We expect the portfolio to, once again, grow at about eight times faster than sort of the overall market, and another 25% growth on the card receivables.","As Charles mentioned, from a loss rate perspective, you've got these massive vintages are beginning to sort of mature, and that means that, their losses are beginning to creep up to a normalized run rate. That will continue to push up the overall losses, 20, 30 bps, so call it a 5% for the overall file as just sort of a placeholder which is fine. We think, long term, the run rate is probably around 5.5% if we were to look out into 2018. But in the interim, it'll creep up as the vintages normalize. But, overall, again, very, very strong growth in the Card Services space, double-double, top and bottom.","Overall, double-top organic, double bottom or low teens bottom, all in terms of earnings per share. Organic revenue, we talked about probably forex, GDP, lots (39:58) free cash flow. And the FX, I will talk about in a second. I don't know where the currencies are going. So, we're not even going to pretend to try to make sense of it. So, if you go to our actual 2016 guidance page with the nums, what you'll see is we're going to put a placeholder in at about a $7.2 billion in terms of revenue, which is, again, all organic. It's 11% revenue growth. Earnings per share, we'll put a placeholder in it at $17.00, and that's up about 13%, again, all organic. And that I think it's a good place to start.","When we talk constant currency, it gets so muddled up out there. We try to make it real simple. The guidance is based on where the Canadian dollar has traded on average for this year and where the euro has traded on average for this year. So, we're trying to do apples to apples. The Canadian dollar has been trading around $0.79 for the full year, and the euro, around $1.09.","So, you look into next year, and you say, where's everything going. Who knows? I can look at the spot rates right now and say the Canadian dollar is a little bit weaker at this point, but the euro is a little bit stronger at this point. So, the initial gut would say that you're certainly not going to see anything too dramatic next year on the FX, nothing like this year. But it's going to chop around. And so, if everything just were to hold to where spot is today, you'll essentially have, we'll be right on target.","So, that's where we are. I think that's probably a good metric. And in terms of \u2013 as we said from a macro perspective, we're not seeing it. I think our \u2013 the businesses that we're in tend to be less impacted by the overall macro and more impacted by the secular trends, which, in our case, are all the movements of dollars into areas of marketing that use data. And that's what we're benefiting from and then that (42:23) far away is the macro that's out there.","We didn't really address use of capital. At a high level, probably you're going to have some that will go towards acquiring the next 10% of BrandLoyalty to get us to 80%. If we continue to see 25% growth in the portfolio, we'll need capital to support that. And then our guess is some combo platter of buyback and maybe a small tuck-in if we find something out there. I'd certainly like to take out those final shares that we issued on the Conversant deal. And we're always hunting for something on the M&A side. Essentially, we don't have anything lined up right now, but that's where we would look to do it, that we keep our leverage around 2.5 times, and we'd like to keep it somewhere around 3 times or less.","So end of the day, finishing up the elevator speech for folks is simply this, that all of the lines data consists of a number or a series of platforms, whether it's specialized for the grocery segment or coalition or one-off or something with a liquidity function attached to it. All of these platforms extract purchase-level information, both online and offline, which is then brought into the pipe where it is analyzed to look for certain trends and what makes people tick. We then have creative folks that then come up with the various marketing programs. And now with the Conversant platform that will spread across all of the divisions of Alliance, we have a means to then reach out to all our consumers, whether it's the more traditional channels like point-of-sale, in-store, direct mail, permission-based e-mail, and now across all the digital channels as well.","So, that's pretty much it. And especially as it relates to Conversant, our expertise \u2013 look, we're not going to dominate using social information. We're not going to dominate using search information. But when it comes to specific merchant SKU-level information, that's our bag, and that's where we're good at. That's our sandbox. That's where we're going to stay and play.","So, that's it. Why don't we go to Q&A?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Dan Perlin with RBC Capital Markets.","Daniel R. Perlin - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. Good morning. I just have a couple follow-ups on Conversant. As we're mapping out, kind of the growth rate on expectations around next year, I want to make sure I understand this kind of roll in of new business versus the pruning and exit of the legacy business. So, it looks like you're calling for around $70 million or so, but I think the indication is that it could be as much as $85 million or better for the year of new business cross-sells. But it looks like the pruning was going to cost you guys about $40 million this year. Is that the right amount, and is there continued pruning expected? I thought there was kind of some indications that they might continue to be down on the display side some $10 million to $20 million next year.","Charles L. Horn - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So, Dan, your estimate for 2015 is pretty close. It's about what we're looking for. If you look into 2016, we wouldn't expect it to be near to that level on the display side of it. We'd expect to see good double-digit growth on the CRM side. We'd expect to see low-single digit, mid-single digit on affiliate, and then any pressure coming through on agency, we'd expect to mitigate it with growth in mobile and video. So, that's really what we're looking for in 2016. You roll it up, and you get high-single-digit growth in revenue.","Daniel R. Perlin - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Got it. And you now \u2013 I think you said 16 deals that you guys have won. How many of those are Epsilon? I think, inter-quarter, you had talked about 12 and 10 were, I think, from Epsilon. How does that stack up when we look at the total 2016?","Bryan J. Kennedy - Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I think on the wins that we've had, first of all, a good number of Epsilon clients are shared clients with ADS Retail. So, sometimes, when we talk about them, they are actually both. But I think our penetration at this point is something like 70% Epsilon, 30% private label. And obviously, there's a lot of headroom in both of those businesses as we continue to move forward. About 80%, I would say, of the cross-sell wins that we've had are retail, and 20% in other verticals. So, those are expansionary for us as we look at next year, both deeper penetration into retail and then penetration into new verticals","Daniel R. Perlin - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. And then, Ed, I just wanted to check something you said, this conversion of buying back two-thirds of the stock and then converting it into debt, low cost debt. It sounded like you were talking up the accretion that you maybe had originally given in year two, which I think, I want to say was $0.75 for Conversant. It sounded like you were kind of lifting that a bit. Is that correct?","Charles L. Horn - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","It depends on how you look at it, Dan. If you look at the buybacks on a standalone basis, the answer would be no. If you look at the buybacks being directly to change the capital structure of Conversant, then the answer would be yes.","Edward J. Heffernan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Said differently, don't start creeping up our guidance before we even finish this year.","Daniel R. Perlin - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. And then just one last one on Conversant. The \u2013 we get a lot of questions around the ability for Conversant with Epsilon combined actually to compete with Google and Facebook in terms of capturing the intent at the time of purchase. What's your response to that, I guess? And I'll hop off. Thanks.","Edward J. Heffernan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I mean, Dan, from my perspective, Google is all about search. Search is all about intent. We're really focused, and it will sound like we're beating the dead horse here. But we're really focused on commerce data and what people buy. And from our perspective, that is always going to be the best predictor of future behavior. So, certainly, all of those other channels, whether it be search or social, are meaningful to our CMOs when they think about marketing. But the landscape that we play in is really around what am I buying, who am I, and increasingly, where am I from a location perspective, which we can get at with our mobile footprint. So that's the piece we focus on.","Daniel R. Perlin - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Brendler with Stifel.","Christopher Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks. Good morning. Kind of focus on the Card business for a second. Just your comments around credit reserve, provisioning expense this quarter, and the expectation for probably higher losses next year. The delinquency trends, though, look really good to me in this quarter. I just wonder if you could comment on what you're seeing in the early-stage delinquency buckets and how you feel about credit. Because from my perspective, it looks like things are actually improving, not declining.","Charles L. Horn - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","We would agree with you, Chris. We're really not seeing it come through the delinquency buckets. Really, what you're seeing is just that natural maturation of a portfolio that you start up in 2013. These loss rates could be 1% in 2013, 3% in 2014, and then 6% in 2015, and then dropping into a more normalized level the following year.","So you don't really see that creep through your delinquency trends. It's basically just that aging with that trailing charge-off rate you charge off after six months. Surely, for the first couple of years, you outrun it. Catches up with you in year three. And then by year four, you see it decline a little bit into its more natural state.","Christopher Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Great. Thanks. And then on the Payment Protection product and the charge you took this quarter. Can you just give us a sense of what the run rate of revenue is in those products today and how quickly it will decline?","Charles L. Horn - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","It's a small piece of what we do. Really, what we agreed to with the FDIC doesn't affect 2015; it really didn't affect 2014. So the overall revenue stream we have from it, if you look in our revenue bucket, it's very small. So it's really not a big number to us. But, really, what happened there is we were \u2013 it was a retroactive look at practices that we thought were legit at the time, not necessarily believed so by the FDIC, so we trued it up, and we believe we've addressed all the issues going forward.","Christopher Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. So, it won't be a material drag in 2016 then.","Charles L. Horn - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No.","Christopher Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. And then, one final quick one, I may have missed it. Did you mention at all the performance of BrandLoyalty from a revenue perspective this quarter? I know it was really big in the first quarter, flattish in the second. Where was it this quarter?","Charles L. Horn - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","We did. So, if you look at BrandLoyalty for the quarter, very strong. Again, if we look at it on a constant currency basis, its revenue was up 30%, and its EBITDA was up over 40%.","Christopher Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Fantastic. Thanks, Charles.","Charles L. Horn - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Chris.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Napoli with William Blair.","Bob P. Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC","Thank you. Good morning. Just on Conversant, Bryan. Just to be clear, what do you feel like is the biggest differentiator that bringing Conversant on, adding it to Epsilon and the other products, what really differentiates your capabilities versus the market?","Bryan J. Kennedy - Chief Executive Officer","Sure, Bob. I mean, I think it goes back to what we were attracted to when we started talking to Conversant initially, which is a business that really is based on first-party transactional data. If you think about Epsilon and our business, we are, for the vast majority of our clients, managing in a lot of their consumer data and using that to drive marketing programs. What we did not have is significant scale in its channels. And as I think everyone is fully aware, so much of the spend is shifting out of traditional channels into those digital channels that we were missing out on the opportunity to sort of capture some of the potential value for our clients by leveraging the data that we were already managing to make that work in terms of driving return in the digital channel, specifically display and mobile and video.","So, when you put Conversant and Epsilon together, you have a very natural match there: a Conversant platform, that's already built on first-party transactional data, an Epsilon relationship that's managing client data. So, those are sort of the critical ingredients for us to then begin turning on those marketing programs for clients in digital channels.","What that effectively means is we're able to demonstrate to our clients a better return than they were using \u2013 than they were getting from buying from other vendors. So, it's a consolidation play where we attract more of that spend, and frankly, get better results for the clients.","Bob P. Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC","Was Conversant important in signing Wayfair or to the Toyota deals?","Edward J. Heffernan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Not for those two specifically, but there were number of shared clients that we have signed with Conversant that were shared between Epsilon and the Card Services group. So, now you've got Card Services, you've got Epsilon and you've got Conversant all engaged with a single client. And that again drives a relationship deeper and stickier.","Bob P. Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC","Great. And then you've mentioned, Ed or Charles, I think that BrandLoyalty had $40 million of signed contracts for North America. Does that mean \u2013 that's revenue, I mean I know these are short-term marketing programs. So, is that like $40 million of revenue that you have signed up in the U.S. for BrandLoyalty and you're just getting started or is that \u2013 how should I think about that?","Edward J. Heffernan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","It's $40 million revenue annualized in Canada.","Bob P. Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC","In Canada. Okay. And nothing in the U.S. yet.","Edward J. Heffernan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Right. These are the big grocers in Canada. That's our first step into North America. And then we pivot South, and we've got a couple of pilots lined up which will hopefully turn into programs as we progress to 2016.","Bob P. Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. And then do you still expect to bring on Zale, and do you have a shot at the Signet portfolio?","Edward J. Heffernan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Zale is set to go, that should come on in Q1. So, that's all set, wrapped up, ready to go. I can't comment on the Signet thing. Obviously, best thing we can do is knock it out of the park with performance on the Zale file, and then we'll go from there.","Bob P. Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you very much. I appreciate it.","Edward J. Heffernan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yep.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ashish Sabadra with Deutsche Bank.","Ashish Sabadra - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Congrats on the solid results. It's good to see the turnaround with Conversant, as well as good momentum coming back into Epsilon. My question was more around Epsilon. Bryan, you talked about improvement or solid growth in technology, as well as the auto vertical. I also believe you had one large client which had pulled back. Can you just talk about how that's trending, and then how should we think about Epsilon growth \u2013 the core Epsilon growth going forward?","Bryan J. Kennedy - Chief Executive Officer","Sure. Yeah. I mean, we have seen good growth in technologies, as we mentioned earlier this year, and that's been a major driver. I think, it has always been kind of a legacy strength for Epsilon. Data has also been strong for us over the course of this year and the softness that we had to play through is in the agency vertical where we did have one significant client pullback. We've slowly been clawing our way back to growth with that client, and that's our plans. We roll into 2016 which should drive continued the mid-single performance for Epsilon.","Ashish Sabadra - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","That's great. A quick question for you, Charles, was around the reserve rate. The reserve rate in this quarter was 5.7% versus 5.6% last quarter. The spreads there between the reserve and charge-off has gone up 230 basis points compared to your normal 110 basis points. Is that just conservatism, building up a reserve as the receivables growth accelerate?","Charles L. Horn - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I think it's more of a situation we are getting ahead of the 30 basis points increase in loss rates we talked about. And then what you'll see in Q4, Ashish, you'll probably come down a little bit as the reserve rate as you have more transactors in Q4 versus revolvers. So, you always narrow the spread, the differential in Q4 a little bit over Q3. So, I think all you're really seeing in Q3 is we got ahead of that additional increase in the loss rates we talked about.","Ashish Sabadra - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. That's great. And, Ed, just maybe a quick comment on the 2016 guidance. Usually, when you first come out with the first guidance for the next year, there is some conservatism baked in, and I just wanted to confirm, there is no change this time around. There is still conservatism baked into the guidance?","Edward J. Heffernan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, we feel that this is a very good base case, and we'll tweak it as things go, but we feel very comfortable putting these numbers out this early, and that means we feel pretty confident about it.","Ashish Sabadra - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","That's great.","Edward J. Heffernan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","How's that for a non-answer?","Ashish Sabadra - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","No, no, I think it answered my question, but thanks, and congrats once again.","Edward J. Heffernan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks. Take one more?","Operator","The final question comes from the line of George Mihalos with Cowen.","George Mihalos - Cowen and Company","Great. Thanks for squeezing me in, guys. Bryan, just wanted to go back to Epsilon and sort of approach it more from a margin perspective. You've been growing EBITDA about a point ahead of revenue growth for the last two quarters. How should we think about that relationship going into 2016 for the overall business and then specifically for sort of legacy Epsilon?","Bryan J. Kennedy - Chief Executive Officer","Sure. I mean, this \u2013 Ed covered it earlier, has been a major focus for us this year, and that's our goal going forward is to kind of maintain that relationship. We have a significant offshoring initiative that we've talked about, I think, several times over the course this year that provides us opportunity in future years to continue that trend. And obviously, as we look at Conversant which has a nice margin profile, there's leverage in that business. So, we're planning to continue the same trend that we're on.","Edward J. Heffernan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. I would say that if we're successful, you're going to see core Epsilon, whatever the revenue growth is flow to EBITDA growth, I wouldn't expect a real expansion there because what we're getting from some of the labor plays that we're talking about is being offset by a very expensive hot skills set that we're bringing in. But we certainly don't want to go back to grow top line seven (1:00:13), grow nothing on bottom line.","So, think of core as whatever we grow top, we should grow bottom, won't be much leverage after that. But the Conversant piece, as that starts getting bigger because it is growing faster than overall core Epsilon has much larger margins, and so the combined Epsilon\/Conversant business should show margin expansion as we move forward.","George Mihalos - Cowen and Company","Okay. Thanks for that. And just a quick follow-up for Charles. How should we be thinking about the gross yield modeling that going into 2016? And maybe talk a little bit about the opportunities you see or maybe don't see on the cobranded side going forward? Thank you.","Charles L. Horn - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I think you'll see a little bit of gross yield compression next year, obviously as we do a few renewals and obviously as we do a little bit of a change in mix in the co-brand versus private label. I wouldn't expect it to be as much as what it is this year. And I would expect that we'd find a way from an operating expense to mitigate a large portion of it. So, I'm not looking for big compression in EBITDA net margins in 2016 compared to 2015.","George Mihalos - Cowen and Company","Great. Thank you.","Edward J. Heffernan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","All right. Thank you, everyone. Appreciate your time. And we'll talk to you next time. Bye-bye.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That concludes today's call.

Heffernan","Great. Thanks, Michael, and I would like to say welcome to our 50th earnings call, which are 50 quarters since going public. I've had the privilege of being on all 50 and look forward to many, many more to come, so welcome.

Melisa will go through the cards results. And I'll wrap up discussing our revised guidance, our outlook and our first cut at '14. Okay, Charles?","Charles L. Horn","Thanks, Ed. It was another terrific quarter for Alliance Data with the revenue increasing 20% to $1.1 billion, bolstered by 9% organic growth. EPS and core EPS increased 9% and 13%, respectively, dampened slightly by higher share count. Core EPS beat guidance by $0.07 for the third quarter. Adjusted EBITDA net of funding costs increased 14% to $328 million driven by double-digit growth at Private Label and Epsilon. Excluding the effects of unfavorable FX rates, LoyaltyOne also had a solid quarter with adjusted EBITDA of 8% versus last year.","Diluted share count increased by 1 million shares to 66 million for Q3 2013 due to incremental dilution from convertible notes. This trend of increasing share count should be over with the maturity of the first tranche of convertible notes in August of this year. Ed and I spend a lot of time talking about share count. To make life easier for everyone, we have attached to our forecast of diluted share count for both Q4 2013 and by quarter for 2014 on Page 11.","Let's flip over sort of looking at the business units. LoyaltyOne's revenue decreased 1% to $213 million, while adjusted EBITDA increased 30% to $62 million for the quarter, both hindered by unfavorable exchange rates. On a constant currency basis, revenue increased 3% and adjusted EBITDA, a robust 8%. The adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 29% for the quarter driven by operating efficiencies and less drag from international expansion efforts.","Miles issued increased 11% compared to the third quarter of last year due to increased promotional activity within our credit card and gas sectors, coupled with the ramp-up from new sponsors added earlier in the year. Miles redeemed remained relatively flat versus last year, as program management implemented during the quarter softened redemption activity. AIR MILES Cash added as a program option in 2012 continues to build momentum with over 1.7 million collectors enrolled. Currently, 8 sponsors have opted into the program, and we'll continue to focus on high-frequency retail sponsors. We expect AM Cash to account for slightly over 10% of our 2013 issuances.","Lastly, dotz, our Brazilian venture, added another 1.5 million members during the quarter, bringing the total enrolled member count to 9.6 million, slightly below our 10 million target for the year. In addition to member expansion, the dotz program had expanded into 2 new southern markets, both of which are strategically important for the rapidly expanding loyalty program. This expansion was facilitated by the signing of grocer, Angeloni, which is a large regional chain and one of Brazil's 500 largest companies. Our plans are to enter 2 additional Brazilian markets by year end.","Let's now turn and look at Epsilon. Epsilon had an excellent third quarter with 48% revenue growth and 22% adjusted EBITDA growth. Organic revenue growth was strong at 16%, while organic adjusted EBITDA growth of 6% was dampened by new business, which had not produced revenue yet. In essence, we incurred the front-running of expenses before revenue recognition or basically a timing issue between Q3 and Q4.","Now let's look at each line of business within Epsilon. Agency continues to be strong with revenue increasing 121% to $187 million. Excluding HMI, revenue growth was about 29%. Agency, especially Aspen, has had great success this past quarter with new business wins.","Technology revenue was up 10% compared to last year. Top line growth was largely driven by over performance in Database, as digital remained soft for the quarter. Database revenue increased 14% driven by record number of wins coupled with the launches of several new clients.","Digital or email revenue declined slightly due to some softness in project work. Importantly, our new Harmony platform was successfully launched during the quarter, which should drive revenue momentum entering 2014.","Our Data offering turned to positive revenue growth of 6% during the third quarter due to strength in the Abacus catalog and online survey offerings. Overall, the Data business is exceeding expectations for the year supported by a very strong pipeline.","Looking ahead, the continuation of strong macro trends, as well as increasing global opportunities should bode well for several of Epsilon's verticals, especially auto. Increased emphasis on loyalty programs and an ongoing expansion into new verticals, such as the restaurant space, should also benefit growth. Recent big wins within Agency positions the growth well to meet 2014 growth expectations of high single-digit organic growth and provides for substantial revenue up-sell, cross-sell opportunities next year. A strong backlog of double digits compared to the same time last year should provide momentum for the remainder of '13 and most of 2014.","I'll now turn it over to Melisa Miller to talk about retail's results for the quarter.","Melisa A. Miller","Thank you, Charles. Good morning, everyone. I am delighted to give you an update. Private Label continues to drive strong revenue and income growth with revenue increasing 16% and adjusted EBITDA net of funding costs up 17% compared to the third quarter of 2012. Now these results are driven by very strong cardholder spending, up 15%, and that's translated into average card receivables growth of 15% and ending receivables growth of 14%. All this performance while maintaining portfolio quality and leveraging competitive funding costs. So some of you may be asking how we are able to achieve these results, and why we're so bullish that we're able to maintain our confidence in our 2013 targets and strong performance into '14.","Well, certainly some of this growth is attributed to the success in new -- in signing new partners during the year. We had notable successes such as Caesars Entertainment, PayPal and Barneys. We expect this growth to continue into 2014 as we onboard a number of recently announced new signings, including Coldwater Creek and a number of new signings not yet announced. And thanks to this combination of core growth and new signings, our cards are now active and in the wallets of 1 out of every 10 employed adults in the U.S. That compares to 1 in 12 just 2 years ago. And so while this clearly represents growth and a bit of cause for celebration, it also highlights what we believe is the tremendous opportunity we have to further increase our consumer penetration.","Beyond our new signings, our core business saw a strong growth of 9% driven by improved cardholder retention and steady levels of spend per account. And although this environment is still very discount focused, our card members are shopping more often and frankly, putting more items in their shopping basket. And despite this promotional environment, our cardholder loyalty, as measured by retention, continues to improve. Our customers are shopping, and they're shopping in large part because of our marketing efforts and close partnership with our brand partners. These efforts have been key drivers in attainting that 1-in-10 consumer penetration I mentioned just a moment ago.","So frankly, by leveraging our brand partners' growth and helping them identify and nurture their best customers, together, we continue to drive consistent improvements in our program. You've heard Ed and Charles say this call after call. We believe we're best at leveraging the rich data analytics and the multiple channels to promote our programs. We continue to deliver on our promised to be a high-touch, marketing-oriented organization. So we say that we do many things with a single focus, and that is to drive loyalty for our clients.","By way of example, our wallet share, which is the percentage of spend on our card, averages in the mid-20s overall. But in our most-established, well-engaged partnerships, we see wallet share north of 40%. So far this year, we have successfully increased our wallet share 100 basis points, and that translates into roughly $300 million in sales. So yes, we see our growth as being sustainable. We have opportunities certainly within our existing programs to gain share of wallet. There are a number of relevant partnerships in the marketplace today, meaning our prospect pipeline is rich, and the opportunities are there for us to win. And we would also tell you that as our partners are pressing into this omni-channel approach, we do see trends in digital that represent growth opportunity for us as well. Within our major brick-and-mortar relationship, digital sales represent roughly 1\/4 of their total credit sales, and it is the largest growth channel with double-digit increases year-over-year.","In comparison, we're seeing physical store sales growth in the low-single digits with physical store count growth essentially flat. So with this consistent shift to digital, those clients that have mobile capabilities are going to continue to really press their shoulder into mobile applications, and in fact, we are seeing our approval rates dramatically increase year-over-year. That signals to us that the initial credit seekers have been replaced by highly credit-worthy, mobile-engaged customers. So with the appetite for mobile growing, you'll see us become more assertive in this channel. We'll pilot some new location-based, geo-fencing campaigns, mobile couponing and gifting.","Finally, I want to chat just a bit about what holiday 2013 may suggest. Candidly, we're still very optimistic. Our brand partners are generally expecting modest improvements over last year, somewhere in the range of 3% to 4%. But year-to-date, our card programs are consistently outpacing that of our brand partners by a factor of 2. So overall, the outlook for '13 remains very positive with strong receivables in revenue growth, low charge-offs and stable funding. With a strong pipeline of new prospects, we are confident in once again overachieving our 2013 targets and delivering very, very strong performance into 2014.","Charles, back to you.","Charles L. Horn","Thanks, Melisa. Now to the riveting topic of liquidity. It remains very strong at September 30, 2013, with $1.7 billion at the corporate level and $3.3 billion at the bank subsidiary level. Leverage levels at both the corporate and bank level remain very modest. During the quarter, we entered into a new upsized $2.4 billion credit facility. Incremental liquidity from the credit facility plus cash on hand was used to retire $805 million of convertible notes in August. Also, we renewed our $440 million Master Trust III conduit on favorable terms, including all bank financing needs for 2014.","From a dividend perspective, our 2 banks paid $107.5 million to the ADS parent during the quarter while maintaining strong regulatory ratios. Cumulative strong earnings allowed us to increase the size of the dividend this quarter. With a steady momentum in our stock, we did pull back some on our share repurchase program during the quarter, but year-to-date, we have still spent $231 million of our $400 million authorization.","With that, I'll turn the call back over to Ed for an update on '13 guidance and the initial look at 2014.","Edward J. Heffernan","Okay. If you could, everyone, pull up the Slide New Guidance. I think it's Slide #10 or so. Yes, New Guidance, Raising All Key Metrics. Again, if you were to look across sort of what we view as our key financial drivers, you'll see that revs, we bumped up; core earnings we bumped up; and core EPS, we bumped up. I think we were at $9.85 before. We're looking more like $9.90, and again, that's versus the $9.50 we had initially set out at the beginning of the year. So we continue to see nice growth across the business. We continue to see a bit of over performance each quarter, and so we're hopeful that this trend will continue into 2014. I think one of the things to highlight, as Charles mentioned earlier, is that we're beginning to see the flip in share count. So again, in Q1, where you had total share count of 67 million versus 62 million last year, obviously, it makes it a bit more challenging to grow. And we had high single-digit growth in Q1. Then, we moved into sort of the mid-teens growth in Q2 and 3. And then as we move into Q4, you're beginning to see the flip where we'll actually have fewer shares in Q4 of about 65 million versus about 66 million last year. And again, that will be the beginning of what we call the slingshot where you're going to have a strong growth in the business itself combined with a share count that lowers as we move into 2014. The combined effect, obviously, is a nice little zing on the earnings per share.","So turning to the next page, 2013 highlights. I think Melisa and Charles, obviously, went through most of these. But if you put it all together, there's not a lot of areas where we're disappointed at the performance. I think overall, it's been a very strong year. Probably of note, obviously, is in the Private Label group. We've never seen a year like we've had thus far. Typically for us, if we sign a business that would ramp up to maybe $300 million or so of new receivable growth after 3 years, that was typically a decent year for us. And then last year, we saw a jump to over $1 billion. And this year, we were hoping to get another $1 billion as well, and it's October, and we're already north of $2 billion. So it speaks volumes about what we're seeing in the sector. It speaks volumes about where the trends are going. And I think what we're basically seeing here is a real adoption by retailers of this overall package of bringing to bear not only the traditional Private Label card but all the data and marketing elements that allow us to do very, very focused, targeted marketing, trigger marketing that, again, as Melisa talked about, enhances retention rate and engenders loyalty and drives sales. So it does seem to be playing out. As she also mentioned, '14 looks quite strong as well.","And Loyalty, as we've been alluding to in the first half of the year, reward miles issued, which is basically how we make money, was negative 4% in the first half as we've -- those of you who followed us for years know that's a very, very choppy stat, but it was a little bit lighter than even we had anticipated in the first quarter. And so we were -- wanted to make sure that this thing would rebound pretty significantly in the back half, and sure enough, it actually came in better than we had anticipated at plus-11% issuance in Q3, and Q4 looks quite good as well. So overall, a big shout out to the folks up there in terms of getting this metric turned very nicely, a lot of it from promos, a lot of it from the new client signings. And it looks pretty nice for the rest of the year.","On Epsilon, again, no major changes other than we had talked about before that the Agency piece, of course, was killing it and continues to kill it this year. Data though has come in quite strong in Q3. And then what we're seeing now is the big, big database builds are really beginning to drive very significant revenue growth as we enter the back half of this year. So you've got -- the big pieces are really cranking along. The one piece that's weak and has been weak for a while has been our email platform. And with the rollout of Harmony, we should start seeing that -- the turn there hopefully in the latter part of the first quarter into second quarter of '14. So the rollout went well, and now we need to just see if we can bring on the new clients.","Consolidated, strong organic revenue growth. Again, as everyone seems to be focused on, this new, new environment of very modest GDP growth of roughly 2%. It's very hard for companies to post big organic top line growth. However, we are looking at 4x overall GDP growth rate. We should come in about 9% organic for the year, and we'll also end the year with share count beginning to decline. And so that should give us strong momentum going into 2014.","Speaking of which, if we move to the initial guidance for '14. Again, we do try to give it as early as we can. The initial guidance for 2014 shouldn't come as much of a surprise. We're basically saying, look, we continue to look to grow our organic top line as much as 4x GDP. Our goal is somewhere between 3 and 4x, but we figure about 8% seems to be a good number, high single digits for revenue. Again, that's organic. We will get some leverage down to the core earnings line. That should be up double digits. And then as we talked about when you toss in the fact that the shares are finally coming down now that these phantoms are going away, you get the slingshot, and you'll see earnings up over 20%. So we're going to peg $12 as our starting point for 2014. And you'll also note that we used the current spot price of $2.25 a share. When we made this in the past, as you know, when the share price went up, it tended to obviously bring more shares into the share count. You're not going to run into that issue as we go into '14, as the share price hopefully goes up. There's not much sensitivity. In fact, I think it's like 30,000 shares for every $1. So it's really a round off at this point, which is good news. And again, as Charles alluded to, you'll see down below our share count from 2012, we ended at 66 million. '13, we ended at 65 million; and then '14, we'll be down around 60 million. So it's a nice story to tell along with very, very strong organic growth across the board.","Turning to the 2014 outlook. There's not a lot of things that are of major concern at this point. I think being as straightforward as I can, it's basically, I think the numbers are in good shape. I don't think we're going to have a lot of issue on the financial side or posting these numbs. I think the issue is going to be more of we need to make sure we don't have any hiccups when it comes to bringing on board 15, 16, 17 new Private Label clients. That's a tremendous amount of work that needs to work precisely at our Private Label shop. And that's a big one. We need to make sure that our Harmony platform is successful in its rollout. We need to make sure at LoyaltyOne, that the issuance of our miles continues, and we don't find ourselves in a hole in the first half of next year as we did this year that we had to dig out of.","And then finally, I think overall, there aren't a lot of things that are keeping us up at night on '14. I would say from -- if you were to ask me what are the 2 or 3 things that could go wrong or that could really impact the financials, right now, I don't see a lot. I would say it's more external than it is internal. I would say, obviously, we're keeping a very close eye on the swirling privacy debate that's going on in Washington. And obviously, we want to be part of that discussion. But other than that, other than are there any other regulatory type issues that we're not seeing right now but could pop up in '14, again, those are the things I'm talking about. Obviously, the regulatory side is kind of an unknown, I guess, for everyone. And then also, obviously, on the security side, we need to make sure that we are buttoned up here and that our systems are -- have the best of breed out there in the marketplace.","So again, nothing major here. I think I'll leave everyone to sort of walk through the slide we put together for 2014. Overall, we are setting the bar high. We're setting the bar high for -- in terms of expectations. And I think the $12 a share number we've established is a very firm number, and I think it's a number that's a great place to start.","Okay. I'd rather spend just a few minutes on the big picture, so to speak, in terms of as we move into a new year, and it's fast approaching. And I know everyone's running around because every company seems to be releasing in today and a few other days. We don't really spend a lot of time on strategic viewpoints of the marketplace, and so I just thought I'd take this quarter and maybe 5 minutes just to talk about what we see going on from the big-picture perspective, and then we can move on to Q&A.","We start with one big data point, which is $400 billion. That's the amount that's currently being spent on all forms of what's called marketing. And the decision-makers behind this spend are the CMOs or the chief marketing officers.","The first trend that we're seeing is that CMOs today are under increasing pressure to justify their spend. More and more, they're being asked such things as, \"How do you know this stuff is working?\" or, \"Hey, show me the return on the dollars being spent.\" That pressure is increasing if I were to compare it to 3, 4, 5 years ago to the point where most of the conversations begin with, \"Hey, I better be able to measure this stuff.\" And to address the first trend, we're seeing more and more interest in the use of data, analytics, targeted marketing and omni-channel distribution networks to optimize marketing budgets. To address the second trend, many CMOs are looking for a solution that integrates across all of these disciplines. I think the point here is the markets for these services that I just mentioned, it's huge and it's growing. It's likely that multiple business models will be successful. For example, some clients may only need to access a portion of this value chain while others may desire one-stop shopping like we offer. Perhaps, Software as a Service works for a some, while fully integrated, heavily services-focused offerings, such as ours, are required by others. Perhaps a pure online solution is what's needed for some, while others require more omni-channel approach like our offerings. Doesn't really matter. Regardless, we believe that the market opportunities are significant, that multiple business models can and will be successful and that the winners will capitalize on the largest trend dominating today, which is the confluence or the flowing together of data, marketing and distribution.","I say this because there's so much smoke and noise out there that it's sometimes hard to distinguish between fact and fiction, and I thought it might be helpful to offer up our view of how we see the pieces fitting together and to do so in plain English. You can call it Edge Crayon version or my Fisher-Price special. But the bottom line is there are 3 pieces to the puzzle. The first is data. This includes transactional, as well as demographic and psychographic. It includes offline and online. It includes structured and unstructured. All this must be brought together, cleansed, sorted and constantly refreshed. Hundreds of data elements end up populating a single record. People today refer to this as big data. Seems like a cool buzzword, but for us, it's just the first piece. Big data is of little use unless one gains insights from it. Thus, the second piece of the chain is broadly defined as marketing. The most critical part of marketing comes well before any campaign has ever run. Marketing today first takes the massive data assets I just talked about and applies models and algorithms to infer and develop additional data elements, which are the key data elements that provide the insights into past and hopefully, future behavior of hundreds of thousands of small clusters of consumers. With these insights, highly targeted campaigns are created, which are relevant, customized and appealing to these clusters.","And now the last piece, no matter how good the data are or how good the insights and campaigns are, it's not worth anything if the message never reaches the desired audience. So it's critical to apply additional insights when determining how the audience should be accessed, thus, the term omni-channel. Again, simply stated, some people are more likely to open a direct mail piece, while others prefer communication at the point of sale or through permission-based email or via mobile or social or targeted display.","Okay, that's it. Everything should be clear as mud by now. I guess the takeaways are this: The size of the prize is huge. The areas getting the dollars are in data, targeted marketing and omni-channel distribution. That alliance, obviously, we play in all 3 and offer them via a service model. Over the past decade, we've seen these pieces begin to flow together and believe the future holds even more promise. So that's the sum total of our whole strategic thinking. And we'll get back to the numbers for the quarter and open it up for questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","This one's for Ed or Charles. Great quarter, very solid guidance. Could you just talk about how you intend to manage capital in 2014, kind of what the uses of excess cash will be? And then I got a second one for Melisa. I guess, historically, ADS has shied away from co-brand loans, but recently, it seems that that's changed a bit. Could you just talk about the opportunity there and kind of what the puts and takes are? And how big you expect that portfolio to get to?","Edward J. Heffernan","Sure. I'll take the first one. In terms of use of capital, I think obviously, with our leverage ratio being quite low, there's no real strong desire to go out and pay off additional debt. So you're really left with 2 uses, one being on adding incremental growth to the business through M&A or additional share buybacks. I think I would prefer that we put our shoulder into the former first. If there's anything that hits our -- catches our fancy. I think right now, there are a number of properties out there again, less so in the U.S., more so in Europe that I think would provide a very exciting footprint that we're looking at. If those don't pan out, then we would probably put more of an effort into our share buyback.","Melisa A. Miller","Sanjay, it's Melisa. So with respect to co-brand, our previous strategy was less about shying away, and our current strategy is really more about acknowledging that the marketplace has changed a bit. So you'll see us continue to selectively enter into co-brand. We don't chase after every opportunity. Our driving principle is helping our brand partners know more about their customers to sell more, and that's really the brilliance of this co-brand model. So when we find the right brand partner and we find the right consumer, we drive outside everyday spend, gas and groceries, so he or she can accrue points that puts them back into the hands of the retailer or the client we're serving. So if you take Caesars as an example, that outside spend for everyday activities drives them back into Caesars property for more gaming and hotels. In terms of penetration, so again, as I said, you'll see us selectively growing our portfolio somewhere in the neighborhood of 10% to 15% in total over the next several years.","Edward J. Heffernan","Yes, I think co-brand is important as you go into certain verticals that we haven't been in before, Sanjay, like T&E. And as Melisa said, this will still be a small piece of our overall business. As she mentioned, somewhere between 10% and 15% of the file would be co-brand. So the vast bulk will still be Private Label.","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","And I'm sorry, just one follow-up. What are the -- what's the difference in economics versus the core Private Label business?","Edward J. Heffernan","Yes, I think overall what you'll find is for a given client, we'll make roughly the same amount of dollars of profit. However, the balances are quite a bit higher on co-brand and hence, the lower yield. So what you'll have is a balance that's probably 3x or 4x what a Private Label card balance is, but it's yielding less. The net result would be gross profit dollars being the same between the 2 clients.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller with Barclays.","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I want to start off with Epsilon. It obviously showed material strength across the board with around 16% -- I think, it was 16% organic growth, being about 5 points above our estimate, probably just about the highest level we've seen in terms of growth rate year-over-year. I think on all 3 segments showed sequential growth as well. Can you just, I guess, touch further on the drivers there? And with permission-based email set to accelerate with Harmony, is that -- is this growth rate sustainable?","Edward J. Heffernan","I think that what you're seeing this year is you're seeing extreme over performance in the Agency space, primarily in auto and telecom. I don't know if that is sustainable. I mean, it's just -- they're shooting the lights out. So what we've done for 2014 is we said let's moderate the expectations for the Agency piece. But you're right, I mean, the big database builds are back. Data is looking stronger. Harmony won't really show the big financial results until the back half of next year. But what we're basically saying right now is we're assuming that the Agency piece will begin to return to more normal levels, which would be 8% to 10% type organic growth, and then that will be helped along with database and data between 5% and 10% growth. That's where we come up with the high single-digit organic growth for '14. But we could be surprised if Agency keeps ripping it right into '14. But right now, that's the assumption.","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. I mean, is there any big items that will anniversary? And I'm talking organic items that will anniversary in the next couple of quarters that would drive that 16% growth down materially or even in the Agency business.","Charles L. Horn","Darrin, I wouldn't say it's a case of anything anniversary-ing, but obviously, clients can flex up and down their marketing spend. We had a little softness in 2012 with telecom and strong in 2013. So that's helping drive some of the over performance in the Agency business.","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division","All right, that's helpful. Just quickly on the EBITDA side of that business though, I mean, that was obviously a lot slower this quarter in the sense of versus revenue growth. And I think you mentioned expenses around helping some clients on board. So when should that normalize? And when would you -- when can we expect to see more of the margin flow-through?","Charles L. Horn","I think that's purely a timing one between Q3 and Q4. So I think you'll see that we onboarded expenses in Q3, and you'll get the revenue recognition in Q4. So you'll get some substantial margin expansion in Q4.","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Great. Just one quick follow-up for Private Label now then I'll turn it back to the queue. But Charles, your allowance ratio or Melisa, also, your allowance ratio was flat sequentially, and you actually looked like you had a reserve build here. Credit trends still look pretty stable. I mean, I know delinquencies have picked up a bit as some of it's seasonality, I think. But what do you think is the -- should we expect to model for your allowance level going forward versus the charge-off level that's been relatively flat?","Charles L. Horn","You're right, Darrin. It has been fairly consistent. And if we see in Q4 the same level of performance, then it's very possible that you could see the reserve rate come down some.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dan Salmon with BMO Capital Markets.","Daniel Salmon - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","I had a question that I think goes across all 3 of your businesses, but I'll use an example from AIR MILES. You added General Motors over the summer, and it strikes to me that bringing them into the program to help drive test drives to the lot is more a bit of a customer acquisition strategy more than a customer retention one, which we normally think about with loyalty programs. So are there any other examples across any of the 3 segments where you're starting to see more of a shift in how they view these currencies to customer acquisition in addition to or as well as customer retention?","Edward J. Heffernan","I'll take the first stab at it. What you're seeing is -- I think, you're dead on. It's a combo. If you looked at LoyaltyOne and the AIR MILES, what really drove the Q3 turn was a big push on the promo side. So if you want to call it customer acquisition or customer activation, we kind of use the terms interchangeably here at times. But what we're seeing is you're seeing the big clients looking for a balance between engendering loyalty with sort of the ongoing loyalty programs where you're getting rewarded every time you show up. But what you also are seeing are the quick hits, so to speak, which I think you're referring of how do I get out there and really blast the market to get the results I need for the quarter or for the back half or something like that. So it seems to be a balancing act on the card side.","Melisa A. Miller","Dan, this is Melisa, and I hope I'm addressing the question that you're answering. We focus a lot of our effort with our brand partners first on finding new potential prospects to the brand. We do that often in concert with Epsilon. Certainly, we analyze our clients' customers to see if we can help them find more that look alike their best customers. And then we get them into the brand and then over time, either work with our brand partners to either help inspire spend at the brand even if it's not on the card or welcome them into the card program. And then so they get inserted into the circle of life. But most of our brand partners right now would tell you their #1 priority is to get new incremental customers to their brand.","Daniel Salmon - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","And then I guess maybe as a -- just a quick sort of follow-up, when you think of, like, a category like auto where it's an infrequent purchase, a major purchase but an infrequent one. And General Motors, are there maybe specific categories like that where you're seeing more adoption of programs like yours?","Melisa A. Miller","Well, I wouldn't use the auto analogy for Private Label but maybe something else.","Daniel Salmon - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Yes, sorry, across the company.","Melisa A. Miller","That would furniture for example. And so then our #1 priority once we get someone in to buy that $3,000 leather couch, is to get them back in for add-ons, the pillows, the other things that we can use to decorate it. So that is really the whole premise, Dan, behind our program, is how we take everyday life events and try to turn them into a shopping event.","Edward J. Heffernan","Yes, for auto, to answer your question directly, we have not only the focus on the OEMs but the focus on the dealers. So specifically, again, this would begin to move into Epsilon's area. But the whole work with the dealerships, the goal is if I can get Dan to realize that it's about time for his oil change, then I need to get in front of that and get a targeted communication to him ASAP that will allow him to say, \"Hey, you know what, I think it's time to get my oil changed, and I'm getting this coupon to go into my local GM dealership.\" And if you can swing only a fraction of people into that dealership as opposed to going a mile down the road to the local oil and lube shop, then what you've done is you shifted hundreds of millions of dollars of profit because that's where the profits are over to the car dealerships. And that's exactly what we're seeing in our marketplace.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ashish Sabadra with Deutsche Bank.","Ashish Sabadra - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Melisa, I was just wondering when you look into fiscal year '14 and that sustainability of 15% growth, how do you think about what percentage of the growth comes from core clients versus the new wins? And as we look at the new wins, are there any callouts in terms of any big jumps during the year? Or it'll be relatively smooth 15% throughout the year?","Melisa A. Miller","Ashish,several questions there, so I hope I get them in the right order. We would tell you that we would expect to see core growth next year similar to what we're seeing this year, 9% to 10%. You'll see us, as sometime around midyear, you'll see us onboarding the Coldwater Creek files, so you'll see a significant speak -- spike there. The other announcements that you've not yet heard about are primarily start-ups. And what we love about start-ups is they grow over time. So virtually, every one of our open slots next year will insert a new brand partner, and we will be ramping them up. Does that answer your question?","Ashish Sabadra - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes, it does. That was great. And just a quick one for Ed. Just when looking into the fiscal year '14 guidance considering that you're ending the year almost with 9% organic growth and you've guided to 8% for fiscal year '14, I was wondering is it just conservatism built in considering all the segments are on a pretty solid footings here. So I was just wondering if you could let us know if there's some conservatism built in and similar to what we've seen in fiscal year '13 and prior years, we would see the guidance move up as you get more comfortable with the economy and the businesses ramping up.","Edward J. Heffernan","Sure. It's a fair question. It's -- we try to serve up guidance early, and it's all of October. And what we try to do is we try to serve up guidance where the investor community can feel comfortable that this is our base case. And I think that coming out at 8% organic in a 2% GDP climate, 20-plus percent EPS to us is a very achievable base case. And if history is any guide, as 2014 plays out, hopefully our businesses will do incrementally better than that. But it's a bit too early to say right now. It's really just establishing the base from which to grow.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust.","Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Ed, you referred to some of the mobile offerings that you have especially in Private Label, and certainly, the Holy Grail of payments these days, especially as we move into digital wallet type world, is -- are data and SKU level data. And it seems like Alliance is uniquely positioned given both the architecture of your platform, as well as your marketing DNA to really take advantage of SKU level data particularly in a more digital and mobile environment. Can you elaborate a little bit on when you might quantify for us in a more specific way the kind of lift you're getting from mobile? I think you alluded to it a little bit, whether that's on the yield side or on portfolio growth. How can we start to think about that and maybe put some value around it?","Edward J. Heffernan","Yes, it's a great question. And there is so much -- obviously, as you know, there's so much smoke out there about mobile and what's working, what's not working. I'll let Melisa take the first half, which is a very concrete example of where mobile is working for us, and that would be on the new account side. So go ahead.","Melisa A. Miller","You bet. So a couple of interesting statistics on mobile, we are seeing our application volume on mobile relatively small in comparison to our overall business. It represents currently about 7% of our application volume, but it continues to be up double digit year-over-year. And what's interesting about applications that come to us through a mobile device, when we're able to welcome someone to the brand, their first purchase is consistently 20% to 30% higher than it is in a brick-and-mortar environment. So said differently, the volume is still relatively low. It's under 10%. We'd expect to see it grow to about 10% next year. But the first purchase transactions are significantly higher, and it gives us an opportunity then to welcome that card member into the brand with the telephone number that they have said expressly is how they want us to communicate to them.","Edward J. Heffernan","Yes. So if you think of it, a lot of this is away from the store, but for those who are in the store, especially as it skews towards the younger demographic, normally you'd be getting your -- you'd apply for the card at the point of sale as you're checking out. Now you're wandering around the store. As you're shopping, you slap the phone against a QR code, and you pop in a few pieces of information, and you'll get scored, and you'll get a virtual card as you're shopping. So by the time you get up to checkout, that's where we're getting the big lift in terms of the first purchase that Melisa was talking about. So that's a real world example on the data side. Obviously, you appropriately called it the Holy Grail. It's having the SKU level information combined with Epsilon's demographic, psychographic data. It's something that the CMOs today just can't seem to get enough of. So Melisa, do you have any specific programs or...","Melisa A. Miller","Well, certainly, we do. We have a number of programs where we communicate not only through the mobile device, but that is one of the ways that we get the card member alerted to a unique offering specifically for them. They can either click on a link on their mobile device and actually purchase that merchandise immediately or we sometimes find that it drives them to the website or back into the store. So it is a very inexpensive catalog, if you will, for many of our brands.","Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. So thinking about 2014, that might be the year where we start to really see meaningful traction as you get north of 10% of new accounts originated by mobile.","Melisa A. Miller","You bet. Virtually every client that has the mobile capability is building a strategy now for '14 and beyond.","Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And Charles, a question for you. I understand that there is -- there are some timing expenses within the Epsilon data ramp and how it pertains to margins. Can you just opine a little bit on what you think the long-term sustainable profitability of Epsilon should look like?","Charles L. Horn","It's a situation where if you go back several years, the EBITDA margin for Epsilon was about 24.5%, 25%. Over the last several years, we have reduced it by doing the acquisitions within the Agency space, first, with Aspen first and then second with HMI. I think long term, this is still a business that will do about 25% EBITDA margins. It's going to be achieved primarily through revenue cross-sell, up-sell because Agency is not going to be that high. But if you get the foot in the door with the CMO and then you cross-sell the data and the database offerings, that's how you're going to get that lift. If we look at this year and we just factor out HMI, we're going to get over 100 basis points of organic EBITDA margin lift just based upon that opportunity. So down the road -- I still think 2, 3 years down the road, this will return back to 25% EBITDA margin if we don't keep lettering in the new offerings, which can somewhat reduce it on a short-term basis.","Operator","And your last question comes from the line of Tim Willi with Wells Fargo.","Timothy W. Willi - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Two questions. First was on dotz in Brazil. Firstly, give a bit of an update on how you're thinking about the crossover and the profitability. And then you made a comment about some upside there if you get that into, I think, it was S\u00e3o Paulo and one other market. Just sort if you could maybe handicap how you feel about those markets being opened up next year or what are the big mile markers to make that happen. And then I had a follow-up.","Edward J. Heffernan","Sure. I think overall, the key metric at this point in the program is the ability to enroll as many people as possible, right? I called it before a land grab. This is a people grab in terms of can we get as high as 10 million people enrolled by the end of the year. It looks like we're running ahead of that. And to put that in perspective, in 2010, when we started it, we had 400,000. Then, we did 1.6 million, then 6 million in '12, 10 million this year. If we can get to at least 20% growth next year to 12 million, that would be sort of where we would set the bar. To the extent we have big rollouts in Rio and S\u00e3o Paolo, then that would be a cause for upside to that as well. So right now, all of the efforts are going into expanding this program as quickly as possible. That means we're incurring, obviously, a lot of marketing expenses. We've made the decision to let's really put our shoulder into getting this thing up to 20 million, 25 million folks over the next few years where it could be the size of the Canadian business. In terms of profitability, that's going to be way down as a function of how fast we're expanding it. But Charles?","Charles L. Horn","Yes. Ed's exactly right, Tim. So if you look, we've talked about this before. In '13, it's really not a drag on us, and '14, it won't be a drag on us. Lastly, with the growth profile, we're looking for the new markets, the number of collectors coming through. The front-running of expenses compared to that deferred revenue model, we're probably looking at accretion in 2015 or '16 based upon how we roll out the markets.","Edward J. Heffernan","Yes. What we're trying to do right now is we are very fortunate in the sense of the core businesses are all doing extremely well, and our outlook for the next year or 2 is very, very positive, so we can afford the luxury of really going after, building up a huge base in Brazil. And frankly, when the time is right and the other core businesses perhaps take a pause in a couple of years, then we'll be ready to step in with Brazil. So that's the sort of strategy right now.","Timothy W. Willi - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, great. And my follow-up was on Private Label, just 2 quick ones. First, is there a way to think about the marketing dollars that issuers are devoting to Private Label cards, whether that's true hard costs around reaching out to consumers or the cost of maybe discounts, rebates, offers to get them in and keep them coming? Just sort of thinking about how that, I guess, cost of ownership of a program. Is it growing pretty rapidly with retailers if you can sort of think about it that way? And then my second question was just around the data. Any updates or thoughts as to your ability to get data? And you said it's not coming from the retailer branded card that's being used at the point of sale, whether that's check or Visa, MasterCard, AmEx that's incremental to the program?","Melisa A. Miller","Let me answer the first question by -- with one word, which is huge. The marketing budgets continue to be large, and they're growing year-over-year. Our clients are no longer seeing it as that drag, and that margin compression that they once complained about, they're releasing it as an investment in this really, really competitive environment. And that's, in large part, that realization has, in large part, driven some of the continued improvement and investments that we see on our programs. So said differently, we put in a great deal of money toward the programs, and our brand partners often match and exceed the investments that we make. We see it continuing to grow. They want to know as much their customer as they possibly can from us, from Epsilon and from their own data acquisition resources. And then in terms of just data acquisition in general, what we are finding is that our clients find that the information that they have about their internal experience matched up with what we know about that customer and what Epsilon knows about that customer, really sort of that triumphant of great things coming together, right? So we take their purchase behavior with the brand, everything we know about their purchasing cycles and then often partner with Epsilon to augment that data. We don't find that they often are going to other areas such as MasterCard or Visa except to know where else they may be shopping. And that's simply to provide a bit of competitive insight.","Edward J. Heffernan","So what we're looking to do is sort of think of in addition to the core Private Label information, we're looking to expand in 2 areas. The first would be developing a multi-tender loyalty platform where Private Label would serve as the anchor and the key piece. But we would also, through Epsilon, be able to provide a loyalty program for any tender type, and that would cut across all the different payment vehicles that are out there. But again, if you use your Private Label card, you would get a bit of a kiss on top of that. So that's one trend we're seeing. The other trend is, as Melisa talked about, at Epsilon, you've got 235 million adults that we have information about, and that information is everything from demographic to psychographic. And that allows us to overlay with the SKU information or category information that Melisa has and can be very, very effective in micro targeting the consumer to help drive her into the store or over the web to make one more purchase on any given year. And if we can get that done, that's where the return is on the bucks.","Melisa A. Miller","That's right. Tim, we have an -- I'm sorry. We have an opportunity to influence when she shops and what it is that we inspire her to look at when she's either on the website or in the store. And that's really how we help our brand partners.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of Bob Napoli with William Blair.","Robert P. Napoli - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","And Melisa, just a question on the card business and this potential growth of that business, what -- how do you view the market size? And has that changed over the past few years? Are we doing a lot more start-ups? It seems like your pipeline is more vibrant than ever. I mean, you have a $7 billion portfolio, which has grown a lot, but it's not real large relative to, I think, what might be the potential opportunity. So I'd love to know how you think about market size and market potential long-term growth.","Melisa A. Miller","Well, it's nice to meet you, Bob. Thanks for asking the question. In terms of market growth, you've heard Ed and Charles say this coming out of the Great Recession. The overall market declined by about $200 billion, right? So it was up to us to really think about how we expand our horizon. We would tell you right now that our active pipeline has about $26 billion to $28 billion worth of opportunity that, for us, still allows us to deliver on that through value selling opportunity for us. They are start-overs. They are start-ups, as we mentioned earlier, and then they are earn away. So it is a vibrant portfolio. It's in all the sectors that we support, which would be specialty retail. We have some select co-brand prospects in there, some furniture and certainly some hard goods.","Edward J. Heffernan","Yes, I think that as we've sort of cast the net a bit wider these days to include T&E, and you'll see other areas that we're dipping our toes in like with PayPal and stuff, if we have a -- what's called an $8-billion-or-so file by the end of the year, normally, we'd say that's about 1\/3 of the marketplace. And so we would put the total market at, as Melisa said, around $25 billion. We would probably extend that now to more like $30 billion.","Melisa A. Miller","$30 billion.","Edward J. Heffernan","About $30 billion at this point.","Robert P. Napoli - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. And then just on PayPal, which was kind of my follow-up, I'd like to understand a little bit better, if I could, what you're doing exactly for PayPal and Bill Me Later. I mean, are you controlling the underwriting? And when do you start actually taking on some of the Bill Me Later loans?","Melisa A. Miller","So we would tell you, Bob, that our PayPal relationship is one that we are really excited about. For us, we think this is an example of 1 plus 1 equaling 3, maybe 4 over time. So what we're doing with PayPal today is what we would tell you just the beginning of working with this payment powerhouse. To answer your question directly, currently, we are accountable for the credit policy in connection with the Bill Me Later activity.","Robert P. Napoli - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. Great. And then let me give you one more, just one last one in a smaller item. The Coldwater Creek -- I guess I mean, you have a lot of new customers, just that one, I just find a little bit interesting. Where you had Zales, Bon-Ton, Pier 1 companies that are growing, This one looks -- looked more -- a little bit more like a turnaround, and I just wondered how you manage your risk in that type of situation, if Coldwater doesn't -- I mean, if they don't do as well as you hoped?","Melisa A. Miller","Yes, that's a great question. And certainly the risk in the financial health of any organization does factor in to the overall structure of the deals that we have, Bob. What we are enthusiastic about, as it relates to Coldwater Creek, is that is a cardholder that's very mature, high income, high FICO score. And all of our contracts are assignable. So if there would be some sort of activity in connection with Coldwater Creek either prior to or after we receive that file, we are still the ongoing issuer. Frankly, we are a large part of their turnaround efforts. And we have seen these circumstances before and believe that we can get this card penetration into the high 20s, high 30s and ultimately, in 40% like we have some of their peer groups in the marketplace.","Charles L. Horn","And Bob, if you think about the risk, ADS is very small. Basically, it's your upfront premium, which the payback period is just a few months. So in terms of high credit quality, very short payback on the upfront premium, the risk to ADS is very small.","Edward J. Heffernan","All right. Thank you, everyone, and we'll let everyone get back to work.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's Alliance Data Third Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call.

At this time, all parties have been placed on listen-only mode. Following today's presentation, the floor will be open for your questions. [Operator Instructions]","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Steve Calk of FTI Consulting. Sir, the floor is yours.","Steve Calk","Thank you, operator. By now you should have received a copy of the company's fourth quarter and full year 2015 earnings release. If you haven\u2019t, please call FTI Consulting at 212-850-5721.","On the call today, we have Ed Heffernan, President and Chief Executive Officer of Alliance Data; Charles Horn, Chief Financial Officer of Alliance Data.","Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that some of the comments made on today's call and some of the responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties described in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC. Alliance Data has no obligation to update the information presented on the call.","Also, on today's call, our speakers will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe will provide useful information for investors. Reconciliation of those measures to GAAP will be posted on the Investor Relations website at www.alliancedata.com.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Ed Heffernan. Ed?","Edward Heffernan","Great. Thanks, Steve. Joining me today is Charles Horn, our always informative CFO. Charles will update you on early results and then I'll give a wrap up for 2015 and then talk little bit about what '16 looks like.","And with that, Charles, it\u2019s all yours.","Charles Horn","Thanks, Ed. It was a strong finish to 2015, as revenue increased 18% or EPS increased 20% and adjusted EBITDA net increased 18% compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. Impressive growth considering the FX headwinds we have faced all year long.","For the fourth quarter, the US dollar reduced the reported revenue by about $67 million or a 4% hit to the growth rate and quarter PS by $0.12 or a 3% hit to the growth rate.","Organic revenue growth remained strong in the fourth quarter, a 14% on a constant currency basis. That compares to 15% constant currency growth for the full year, reflecting balance growth throughout 2015.","From a capital allocation standpoint, we spent $952 million during 2015 acquiring 3.4 million shares under our repurchase program at an average cost for about $280 per share. We have now required about 80% of the number of the shares issued to acquire Conversant at the end of 2014.","Looking to 2016, we expect our capital allocation to shift to M&A first probably in the $400 million to $500 million range and then to share repurchases up to the $500 million board authorization. Essentially we'll look to deploy our free cash flow, while maintaining or lowering our leverage ratio of about 2.7 times.","Let's flip over to page 3 and talk about LoyaltyOne. On a constant currency basis revenue increased 6% to $421 million, while adjusted EBITDA decreased 13% to $99 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2014.","A shift in sponsor mix, which lowered the average price per mile issued, coupled with increased support of our sponsor promotional programs pressured AIR MILES financial results for the quarter. The strengthening US dollar was a year-long headwind and will likely again be in 2016.","AIR MILES reward miles issued decreased 8% compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. This was expected as several sponsor promotions happened earlier in '15 than in 2014. For the year, AIR MILES issued increased 4%, up from 1% growth in 2014.","The improvement in annual growth is due to the onboarding of a national grocer, continue promotional activity, and growth in the instant reward program. For 2016, we expect issuance growth in the 3% to 5% range with promotions time similar to 2015.","AIR MILES reward miles redeemed decreased 2% compared to the fourth quarter, largely as result of the decrease in AIR MILES reward miles issued. The instant reward option, AM Cash, continues grow accounting for 21% of miles issued and 29% of miles redeemed for the fourth quarter of 2015. This option is growing in popularity as the instant gratification resonates with our collector base, especially in a tough economy.","Turning to BrandLoyalty, revenue increased 18% and adjusted EBITDA increased 2% on a constant currency basis for the fourth quarter in 2015. Growth and adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was dampened by expenses associated with our North American expansion efforts and incremental bonus expense tied to the overall strong annual performance.","Overall it was a tremendous share for BrandLoyalty as constant currency revenue increased 31% and adjusted EBITDA 15% from 2014. Importantly, we made substantial strides in our North American expansion effort ending 2015 with a signed backlog in excess of $45 million in Canada and a pilot set to launch in the US during the first quarter of 2016.","Looking ahead to 2016, AIR MILES faces a weakening Canadian economy, particularly in Western Canada which could create headwind issuance growth and further drive a shift in sponsor mix negatively impacting our profitability.","Let's turn the page and talk about Epsilon, Conversant. Epsilon's revenue increased 38% to $608 million, and adjusted EBITDA increased 54% to $157 million for the fourth quarter of 2015, both helped by the acquisition of Conversant in December 2014.","Organic growth was strong, as revenue increased 7% and adjusted EBITDA increased 5% for the fourth quarter of 2015. Notably is shown on the slide, organic top line growth accelerated as the year progressed.","Also adjusted EBITDA margins increased by 270 basis points, driven by strong performance to Conversant where margins increased to approximately 37% for the fourth quarter of 2015.","For Epsilon, our main priority for 2015 was to control increases in human capital costs, allowing revenue growth to flow through to adjusted EBITDA. We were successful as organic revenue and adjusted EBITDA both increased 5% compared to full year 2014.","Strength in the auto vertical coupled with double-digit growth within Epsilon's digital experience offerings contributed to the positive revenue momentum. Our new facility in India became operational during the fourth quarter. We ended 2015 with about 300 associates in India and hope to increase the headcount to about 1,000 by 2016 year end.","We believe the higher percentage of headcount in India versus US will allow a solid flow-through of revenue growth to the bottom line again in 2016.","Of note, Epsilon was named by recent Forester report as a market leader within loyalty space, highlighting the businesses ability to further integrate its loyalty capabilities for the multi channel marketing solution in order to provide more useful customer insights.","Turning to Conversant, as shown on page \u2013 slide 5, this was a year of two halves. The first half was about much needed change within the existing business model and the second half was returned to growth story, led by the cross-sell efforts and onboarding of the backlog.","The quarterly progression of the turn wrapped the year with strong growth in the fourth quarter, as revenue grew 6% and adjusted EBITDA grew an impressive 14% compared to pro forma Q4, 2014.","A methodical pruning of lower margin price offerings early in the year and refocusing on the more profitable, data driven, cross-device offerings resulted in margins growing close to 300 basis points versus pro forma Q4, 2014.","Success with the cross selling efforts continues to ramp up as Conversant's rich offering is introduced to the Epsilon client base, beginning with the retail industry as our primary focus in 2015, we are now expanding into key verticals such as automotive, CPG and media.","As a result, the backlog has nearly doubled since mid way through 2015, increasing to over $90 million in annual contract value with new logos such as Toys \u201cR\u201d Us, Cornerstone Brands, Staples, and a leading telecom provider.","Now that the holiday season is over, a time when many clients\u2019 budgets tend to be frozen, a half dozen new tests are already queued up and underway for the first quarter of 2016, seeding the next wave of cross-sell activity.","Finally, Coversant's offerings continues to gain market recognition with a recent Gartner Magic Quadrant report highlighting a small from a niche player to a challenger in its digital marketing hub report, specifically emphasizing Conversant's high match ratio [ph] immediate targeting in reach and unique ability to personalize one to one interactions with every consumer across device, media and channel.","Let's go to the next page and talk about the nice growth we saw in Conversant. If you look during the second quarter, Ed and I came out and gave guidance that we would see a turn in the back half of the year. Fortunately, we saw in Q3 and we actually exceeded Q3 and Q4 expectations. So the turn that we talked about earlier in the year has definitely manifested and we expect to see that continue into 2016.","For Card Services, it was the 16th consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth and strong finish to the year. For the fourth quarter of 2015 revenue increased 20%, while adjusted EBITDA net increased to healthy 16%. A nice flow-through of revenue growth, given the substantial provision build for quarter and full year as a result of strong card receivables growth and the needs to get ahead of the uptick and loss rates.","Notably we achieved substantial expense leveraging for the fourth quarter and full year, mitigating the decline in our gross shield from a higher percentage if co-brand receivables.","These outstanding results can be attributed to our proven ability to drive credit sales which increased 22% for the fourth quarter even without the onboarding of Zales which slipped to January of 2016.","If you remember, we onboarded about 600 million of acquired portfolios during the fourth quarter of 2014, creating a difficult comparable which is why the growth rate dropped a little bit compared to earlier in the year.","As we mentioned before, our credit sales growth rate at three times STAT of our overall brand sales and that\u2019s usually what we try to track to. Core credit sales from brand with us before 2012 were up 11% driving tender share growth north of 200 basis points for the quarter, a strong endorsement of our collaborative tailored approach loyalty.","Our card members continue to shop more often, up nearly 6% to last year and spend more per trip, up about 5% to last year confirming that our brands best customers were in the stores, online and engaged digitally.","From a digital perspective, about 10% of our credit applications came through web enabled mobile channels and about 40% of our credit sales were online for the fourth quarter of 2015.","Retailer\u2019s online sales trended up this holiday, but our strong results substantially outpaced that performance. In addition, we continued to rollouts of our MyLoyalty app with several brands during the quarter. This is our proprietary, retailer-branded mobile app built to serve the needs of our card members value most.","Our continued and very purposeful investment in mobile and digital engagement provide great momentum to position us for further strong growth, as customer engagement continues to evolve.","Average card receivables increased an impressive 25% for the fourth quarter. From a credit quality perspective, principal loss rates were 4.7% for the fourth quarter and 4.5% for the year, both consistent with our original guidance.","The 30 basis points increase for '15 is due to normal seasoning of new programs, as well as slightly lower recovery rates. Delinquency rate trends have been consistent and stable throughout 2015 trending up slightly from 2014.","Looking to 2016, momentum remains strong. We signed another $2 billion vintage in 2015 and believe we can do the same in 2016. Our unique and demonstrated strategy of bringing a collaborative, targeted approach to loyalty, provides card services with a very vigorous top line of potential new brands to sustain these growth rates.","With that, I will turn it over to Ed.","Edward Heffernan","All right. Thank you, Charles. If everyone can turn to the slide 2015 wrap up, this is where it gives me chance to talk about the year, what went well, what could have gone better and how the overall model continues to evolve, as we continue down the path into '16, '17 and '18.","And again, the best way to start this off and to look at it is that Alliance's model continues to move towards if you think of it a series of platforms, whether its for a coalition, a private label card, a one-off loyalty program.","But a series of platforms depending upon what the customer wants. That are used really as a capturing device. The ability to capture the clients, customer and what he or she is purchasing down to the SKU level both online and offline.","So its really a platform to capture this very important unique information, which is then all funneled down to the same type of analytics to gain insight into what purchase behavior was in the past few years is saying about this consumer and how we can read into that and reach that consumer on a personalize basis.","We believe the model will continue to move from a mass marketing approach to a segmented approach, where it really is today to where we're heading, which I think is the one-to-one personalized approach, which is beginning to manifest itself today, and will over the next 18 to 24 months.","So taking that information, gaining the insight, figuring out what makes them tick, and then reaching them with a relevant message or communication from our client, again, personalized to their taste and habits and reaching them through the right channel. Because it\u2019s as important to have the right message, but it\u2019s important to actually reach the folks through the right channel, whether it is from personalize message to direct mail or permission based email, mobile social targeted display, you wrap it all together and a big services wrapper and that\u2019s really where we are on the model.","So often times I am asked where are we in five years and five years you're basically looking at one massive platform. But today what we're looking at are a series of platforms and what we want to do with sort of probe and tweak and pick and choose the platforms that are growing and those that maybe less relevant.","So with that being said, let me dive into the first couple of platforms. One would be our correlation program, which is where we have one platform, where a number of clients come together, pool their marketing dollars and it\u2019s called the AIR MILES Reward Program in Canada.","The reason I gave that introduction is because the critical metric there is the number of points, the number of miles, whatever you want to call. The number of units that get issued, they are issued based upon the consumer spend. And that\u2019s our key metric, that\u2019s how we get paid.","And last year, I am sorry in 2014, that metric had fallen to a troubling sort of flattish to 1% up, and that is not something that we think is inappropriate run rate for that business. So we put our shoulder into 2015, right as the Canadian economy hit a massive headwind.","And so the net result was the team managed to play through the macro environment and actually grow their key metric 4% and our goal is to grow at somewhere 4%, 5% a year. If we can do that eventually you'll have the revenue and earnings to follow.","It is a deferred model, so that - just because you earn it this year it takes couple of years for it to actually flow through. I've never quite understood the accounting, but that\u2019s why we have Charles.","So the 4ish type percent was I think something that was outstanding, given the macro environment and that was our goal. Our goal was to get this thing back in a growth mode and demonstrate that there is a long runway left in this program.","On the negative side, we have - it didn\u2019t yet translate into the type of growth that we really want it longer term. From a revenue and EBITDA perspective, again there is sort of lag there that takes place. We would expect in 2016 to see slightly better numbers, both on top and bottom, as we look for positive growth to return on the EBITDA side as well.","The key driver of that as Charles talked about was the mix due to sort of the macro factors that were out there. A lot of the growth that we had came through a ton of work promotional programs that are big grocers in Canada. We're pushing, and a little less through the somewhat more, I guess beneficial spend on our big cards that are up there through Bank of Montreal and American Express.","Nonetheless, our key metric is back where we wanted and we need to make sure even in a very, very difficult Canadian economy, while its in a recession, I mean, there is no other way to say it, we want to see that thing grow again this year and that will ensure the long-term growth.","Turning to a little bit of different story, is our other platform which is the BrandLoyalty platform which focuses on much shorter term, largely promotional type programs, grocers that essentially will hit the consumer hard over a 20 week period to really entice them to spend a little bit more visit, a little bit more often.","And what we do is again, we're taking all that information and the data from what they are buying and shopping for in the grocers and moving towards a personalize approach of getting them excited about coming into the \u2013 that grocer one extra time or to spend a little bit more there to achieve that targeted reward.","Needless to say, similar to 2014 BrandLoyalty had a very strong year with revenues up over 30% and EBITDA, despite spending a whole bunch of money and getting North American cranked up was up mid teens. So we think that the BrandLoyalty approach has a long runway and we expect another very solid year in '16 as well.","The North American approach is kind of interesting in the sense of you know, this is primarily European platform and now its moving to the Americas for the first time, and specifically what was kind of exciting for me anyhow was the fact that we could use the relationships that we developed in Canada over the past 20 years with AIR MILES program to introduce them to a different type of targeted marketing approach to the BrandLoyalty program and showing up it went extremely well and we are lined up, I mean, we'll probably do as much as $40 million or so in revs just from Canada next year.","So as you think about the pilot that\u2019s also kicking off in the US in '16 and the size of the US, if Canada is any indication, this could be a fun business to be in going forward.","Then finally, we have our coalition program again down in Brazil called dotz and you know, it continues to grow. I mean the membership is up 20% to just under $18 million. We've successfully launched in Rio, which was our big goal for the year. And it\u2019s growing. It\u2019s moving along nicely, and that is in spite of really challenging environment there.","So we're kind of going to sit back and just hopefully watch this thing continue to move up at a double-digit pace, and as things stabilize down there the next couple years hopefully we'll really start to see the flow through. But so far so good there. I think overall the businesses, the platform within LoyaltyOn had a very strong year.","Turning now to Epsilon. Again, I remind folks of what was the goal of Epsilon for the year. The biggest one at the sort of the core business itself was to find a way to have a sustainable model that slowed top line growth, down to earnings or EBITDA, cash flow.","And that was a challenge for us over the past several years, as we continue to see nice growth on the top line, but because of the hot skills and everything else required in our labor force and heavy services aspect of the business it got to be challenge to actually flow that through the bottom line.","So for the first time I think we feel comfortable that we have a sustainable model, long-term that will allow sort of the core Epsilon offerings. And again these platforms are primarily these massive data base and loyalty platforms that you see out there you know, the Citibank thanks yous, and the Hilton Honors, and the Walgreens and stuff, that will allow us to show organic growth rate at about 2x or so GDP or roughly 5ish, 6ish percent.","But actually have that flow down to earnings, as well. And part of that solution was opening up our new office in India and our new associates over there will be joined with an ever growing group within North America as well and we should have I think a nice balance on the growth side. So that was our number one sort of goal.","The next one was this sort of trail off that people have noticed over the past couple of years in terms of revenue growth at Epsilon tended to start out strong and then sort trailed off at the end of the year. We think also that this year was we had a very good momentum build as the year progressed. So Q2 was up 4% that then moved to 5% in Q3 and we exited the year at 7% all of which I think is - it bodes well for 2016.","We talked a little bit about our new associates that are joining us over in India. And then on the Conversant side, on the negative for sure, I think on a full year basis we were too optimistic that we could manage to transform the existing business and get the book of business with the cross-sell sign in, get it all up in running. We certainly got over our skis on that one.","However, after of really tough first half of the year, we started to see the results of this effort and I couldn\u2019t really be more pleased with how the year has turned out in terms of Q4 and how we're stepping off into 2016.","As I said before, I have likened it to changing a tire on a moving car, it\u2019s hard to do and the teams did a wonderful job at finally getting it done. We took the pain early to make it right in the second half and for '16. And as Charles showed you the revenue went from minus 6 in Q1 to minus 9 in Q2, it bounced all the way to back to flat in Q3 and we stepped up the year at plus 6.","On the EBITDA side, again it was a minus 6 in Q1, that bounced back a little bit faster, we got to flat in Q2, and plus 9 in Q3 and exiting the year at a plus 14. So in terms of the turn or hockey stick that we've all seen out there, just want to actually played out which was kind of nice.","And as importantly as Charles also mentioned, the book of business and what does that mean, what it means is that, when we sign a deal with Conversant, where we're going to beat the \u2013 going to a, let's say retailer and they are going to start supplying us with all their SKU level information and we're going to be using that SKU to continue to develop models to go out and reach their consumers or others across the various digital channels.","It\u2019s important that if we look at it and we basically say, okay, where have we come, where are we going, what's the next step. And the critical thing here was, I think it was a very good marriage of the two.","Epsilon was a little bit light on having the scale as needed in the digital side, I think Conversant on its own would have had some challenges, trying to compete with some of the larger players out there, you put it together and it seem to actually have worked very well.","And as a result, the book of business that we're looking at here, the vintage when you sign these clients is not unlike what happens in our card business, where it takes two or three years to fully realize the full run rate of these relationships.","And as a result, we signed up a book of up to $90 million of potential top line, that would be additive to Conversant as these clients rollout over the next couple of years. We managed to see a lot of that start to come through in Q4.","And what was very gratifying was the majority of this came through a collaboration between Conversant and big Epsilon enterprise clients, where we were allowed able to get the Conversant folks into the Epsilon clients and between the two of them created the sale.","I think we're very early in the game in terms of what we're looking to do. We believe across Epsilon, AIR MILES BrandLoyalty and Card Services there are about 500 enterprise clients where we have a very good in with the CMOs and that\u2019s where we're going to be spending a lot of our time and of those 500 we probably hit like 25 or 30 at this point. So long way to go, anyhow, feel good about Conversant.","And finally, Card Services, which continue to just have just a tremendous year. I kind of keep saying that and seems like this - keep it saying every year. But it continues to happen not only because of the offerings we're putting out there, but also because of again the macro shift or the secular shift it\u2019s going on and how folks are spending.","Again think of this as another platform that also offers a liquidity tool and what we did here is we continue to have a huge amount of demand from retailers, both traditional bricks and mortars, as well as pure online, who are very interested once again in understanding who their consumer is and reaching out to them on a personalize basis.","And to do that we are the folks they trust to hold the SKU level information, both online offline, purchase level SKU. And again are you going to come to us to spend your digital dollars on search, probably not or social probably not, but based on SKU level, you bet you. That\u2019s who we are and that sort of the uniqueness of the model that we have here.","So our credit sales and that is actually using, consumer IS using our card and spending on the cards was up over 30% driving the portfolio of receivables up 30%, translating into revenue up 24%, and finally to the cash flow of about in the mid teens, obviously a tremendous year.","One of the things that continues to be very important in this business is tender share. We can have all sorts of great signings with new clients and everything else. But if you can grow the core the folks who have been with you for many years, where you thought that we've kind of plateaued in terms of how much of each dollar spent at the retailer will go through our card and. We used to think it was somewhere in the high 20s, maybe 30%, now we think that ceiling has been raised quite a bit.","Our ability to reach out and personalize messaging to the various consumer groups out there has allowed us to continue to grow our share of spend at these retailers. And when you can grow a 150 basis points at these core retailers you know, you are essentially along with their growth going to get your first 10% of growth in the portfolio, which used to be for us what everything together could get us.","And then you throw in the new vintages that have been signed. That are the new clients of the past several years. They take three years to ramp and that\u2019s where you get your next 10% of growth.","And so that\u2019s why a 20% type growth rate here, which if you ask me a few years ago, I would have said I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good long-term growth rate, probably more like 8% or 9%, but I've been proven wrong fortunately for a number of years here.","We signed another $2 billion vintage of new clients from Toyota Lexus to Cornerstone to Wayfair to Farmers Insurance, Red Roof and Univision. Again, good names, and we have those folks up and running.","And then finally from the credit quality perspective, all we're seeing is the typical seasoning you would see, as you bring on a large amount of new business it was also of note that the original guidance that Charles gave of mid 4% for the year, which was made well before we even started the year we came in right on the button on that one.","So you will continue to see these vintages normalize and we are not seeing any evidence whatsoever of any type of distress on the part of the consumer.","To wrap up '15 revenues, EBITDA, EPS all up 20%. We know a tough macro environment organic, which is the thing that I really focusing on. We try to do 3x GDP as our long-term model if we could do like 8% 9% a year that be great. This past year we did 11. We're actually on constant currency basis 15%, which was really gratifying to see.","The dollar which I think everyone under the sun is probably getting sick of hearing about, but just to put in perspective, we grew the 20% or 11% organic despite being hit with about a quarter billion dollars of FX top line headwind and about $0.50, so it knocked about 4 points off of growth.","All that being said, let's now move into '16. We say good bye to '15 and here we go. 2016 outlook, high single digit growth in revenue and adjusted EBITDA on a constant currency basis, that incorporates both BrandLoyalty and it incorporates our Canadian business.","And if you would break it down on a constant currency basis, you would look for BrandLoyalty obviously to be the one that shows the higher growth rate, we would expect another year of a double, double top and EBITDA type growth rate for PL and obviously something less than that for the Canadian business. But we do want to see the Canadian business turn the corner and continue to start its growth mode.","The big initiatives will be BrandLoyalty. The North American expansion we think we are very well placed in Canada. We want to see how that pilots go in the US and we want to really make some headway in the US and start that process going.","That\u2019s a huge for growth for us, again, despite really challenging macro environment in Canada, we do want to continue to see that mid single digit issuance growth because that is what drives the success to long-term in the program","And in Brazil, as we talked about we want to see double-digit growth in both membership and constant currency revenue. It continues, its not part of our numbers that you see in our financials, we own 37%, but we continue to see it moving along.","At Epsilon, if you were to sort of mix again, Conversant and Epsilon, together you would see mid to high single digit growth in revenue and adjusted EBITDA. EBITDA I would say Epsilon should look a lot like this past year was sort of mid single digit top and bottom, Conversant will be different, where we expect to start seeing the high single digits growth rate that we had being expecting long-term.","So everything looks pretty good there. We want to drive a minimum of another $70 million in cross-sell revenue at Conversant. And again as we penetrate into Epsilon's core client base, as well as into our card group and elsewhere.","All right. Turning to card Services. Well, we expect another big year, up to 25% growth in the portfolio. We don\u2019t expect to slow down. We see things looking quite bright for the business for another year.","Another year of double digit revenue and EBITDA growth rate, net of funding. We look again to sign another $2 billion vintage and again with that means is we sign a bunch of new clients. And over the course of three years their portfolios, their combined portfolios would aggregate up to about $2 billion in new portfolio growth.","So they are big numbers, but if I went back and I looked at the good old days of $300 or $400 million used to be a big year and then 2012 we signed our first $1 billion vintage and then it was $2 billion in '13, $2 billion in '14, $2 billion in '15 and we expect $2 billion in '16. So I certainly like the outlook for this business.","All right, getting questions about credit quality to help, the health of the consumer. Obviously, with some of the noise out there in the market place, what we can say, we stay very close to all of this. We have roughly 40 million active households that are in our programs and we are seeing again no distress on the part of the consumer. So it looks like that\u2019s in pretty good shape.","If you look at the actual loss rates, that were going print, what you're looking at is you saw it go from roughly 4% to 4.5%, it will be about 5% in '16 and then in '17 we expect to start to level off at about 5.5%, which we believe is the new normal.","And so, again, I think we're going to be right on target in terms of this sort of 5% for '15. Question being asked is why, why is this drifting upwards. Its primarily - it\u2019s kind of interesting, it\u2019s primarily due to the fact that when you had the great recession in '08, '09, you had massive amounts of charge-offs and it took until to 2014 to really clean up the backlog in terms of recoveries. And in our business, which is different from general purpose cards, recoveries are a huge part of what constitutes our loss rate.","And in the post-recession time period, as people were getting back on their feet, we were actually recovering almost $0.35 on the dollar. And that from a net loss perspective is what kept the losses at normal. Though we sort of half of that point at this stage and its beginning to normalize from 35% to more in the 20s, probably low 20s, it\u2019s where we'll net out.","And if you moved from last year to this year, you will see the recoveries are coming down about 5 points, and as a result that turns into about 50 basis points less recovered on the losses.","So its not really the actual loss rate from a gross perspective going up 50 basis points, it means the net loss rate, that is lower recoveries that have normalized, that is really driving the new loss rate up about 50 basis points.","So we don\u2019t see anything alarming there. Its normalization process that happens in the private label business in a high growth mode. The remainder tail of any type of drift up will be the continued seasoning of the big vintages.","The net story here is that, we believe our long-term normalize loss rate, before the great recession was about 6.5%, today we're very comfortable that we're going to level out around 5.5% probably some time in '17 going into '18.","The reason why its little bit lower, is the fact that, over the past half dozens years or so we've attracted a bit higher from a credit perspective quality type consumer, you know, when you bring on the Barney's and the Talbots and the BonTons of the world, and then you have some co-brand mix in, which carries a lower loss rate.","So we think the 5.5 it\u2019s about right. We're slowly marching towards that level and we feel comfortable with our '16 guidance. I do want to address how it will play out sequentially, I think that\u2019s important because you have seasonality in our business, which again is different from traditional cards that are out there.","Q1 will tend to be our highest quarter if you looked at last year 2015, you jumped off from Q4 of '14 to Q1 of '15 and your loss has jumped up about 70 basis points on a seasonal basis. We expect that exact same type behavior to take place in 2016.","So you're going from sort of your high fours at the end of or mid fours at the end of '16, to sort of somewhere in your low fives as a starting point. And then from a seasonality perspective that starts to actually get drift down as the year progresses and then flattens out in the back half. So that\u2019s how the seasonality works and so no one surprised. And as we talked about, we expect full normalization at around 5.5% as we move into '17.","From a guidance perspective to wrap up, we are maintaining our guidance for the full year. We're not going to change that, despite I think peoples outlook that has gone a little bit more negative on the macro. We think we're in pretty good shape here. So constant currency basis, look at about 72 on top and 17 bucks on the core EPS, that\u2019s a 100% organic growth rate, we're using FX rates to 78 and 111 for the year.","As it relates to Q1, we're looking at about 8% constant currency growth rate and about 5% from an actual print perspective. So that includes the FX headwind of about a dime. I think it will be probably little bit less then there right now.","We used FX rates of about a buck in $0.60 [ph] million, for the euro in Canadian respectively, right now euro is more like 109 and the Canadian dollar is 71. So I think that gaps closed somewhat. But look for those types of numbers in Q1 before we get asked the question. The big difference between this year and last year, is the fact that last year Q1 is when BrandLoyalty their programs all hit in the first quarter, and they are earnings were up over a 100% in Q1.","And then we're down 50% in Q2 and that caused quite a bit of questioning in terms of how do you actually flow this thing out. Its tough on a quarterly basis, but we're looking at here is rather than up a 100% in Q1 and down 50% in Q2, you're going to see more like flat performance in both BrandLoyalty in Q1. The big program seem to be hitting in Q2. They've been signed up, we expect over a 100% growth in Q2 this year.","So like Q2 you should see that mid teens growth return to earnings. So that\u2019s the pretty much it. You've got some \u2013 to watch bouncing balls in terms of the quarterly stuff, but on annualize basis it looks pretty good. From a quality perspective it looks pretty good. And I know the sentiment out there is fairly negative on the macro side. But we're seeing the businesses we're in would suggest another double-digit organic growth here for us.","So that\u2019s it. I am going to actually let Charles now talk and. We'll wrap and take questions. Questions, operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Darrin Peller with Barclays.","Darrin Peller","Looks like Epsilon is back on track and Conversant is obviously growing very well now. When we look at the last quarter, your fourth-quarter, your constant currency, it looks like we're calculating your constant currency organic growth rate to be still like almost 13% or low double-digits. I guess, first of all, do we have that right? And then that's pro forma for Conversant.","And, again, I think you mentioned first quarter's guide of 8% was really a step down because of the timing year-over-year versus of where the BrandLoyalty results come in, right? First quarter or second?","Just make sure that's the only difference. And if that difference did not exist, what would your first quarter growth rate look like? I'm just curious. We're getting a bunch of questions on Q1 already.","Edward Heffernan","Yes. I mean, I'll take the BrandLoyalty thing, I mean, last year it \u2013 like I said it grew over 100% in Q2, it was down 50. This it\u2019s going to be flat and then up a 100% in Q2. If you would have put two together, what you would have \u2013 you would have double-digit growth right out of the gate and in Q1, probably low teens.","In Q1, what you're going to see is, little bit lighter in Q1, little bit heavier in Q2. That\u2019s strictly grocer programs and they roll on. So it\u2019s pretty straight forward there. And then Charles you can take the first question.","Charles Horn","So that was about organic revenue growth for Q4 Darrin?","Darrin Peller","Yes. Pro forma for Conversant basically?","Charles Horn","So you'd be up about 14% on constant currency, about 11% without adjustment for FX.","Darrin Peller","Okay. That's helpful. I guess what I was just trying to figure out, though, had it not been for the BrandLoyalty timing shift, we would've probably been similar, right? I mean, back to the low double digits, again, I guess, for first quarter?","Charles Horn","Sure.","Darrin Peller","Okay. Let's just hone in for a moment for me and then I'll just as a follow-up on the AIR MILES business. I understand there's macro challenges there. And just in terms of the mix and what we should expect. The AIR MILES issuance was somewhat worse than we expected for the quarter.","When we think of that and what's happening on instant rewards also, how do we really have confidence it's going to be that low to mid single digit issuance growth again through the year I think you suggested it should get back to?","And especially if you comment a little more of what the impact should be of the instant rewards or rather the rewards expiration in the middle of the year. I guess that's already reflected in your guidance. What kind of impact does that have?","Edward Heffernan","Yes. I'll take the first part and Charles and take the second. The issuance, obviously, we had three huge of quarters of issuance and Q4 was I think down. But that\u2019s you know, you've tracked us for years. You know that it's an annualized-type budget spend from the sponsors.","From what we're looking at right now, the commitments from the sponsors and again its primarily coming from the non-financial services side of the house. You're seeing the non-discretionary spent type budgets looking pretty good. And so, that\u2019s why I think we can continue to 3% to 4% type growth rate in the issuance side.","Charles Horn","And Darrin, on the expiree, it\u2019s a little bit of an unknown at this point. We've not seen any type of change in consumer or collective behavior at this point. And lastly, we wouldn\u2019t see anything until the Q3 or Q4.","So in terms of guidance, we really have not considered it. If something does happen, you could see a little bit higher revenue growth. You'd see us make some modifications to the program, but it's just too soon for us to know. So in terms of guidance, we've not really considered it. We'll evaluate it as years goes on and frankly I wouldn\u2019t expect to see any trend until as early as Q3, as late as Q4.","Darrin Peller","All right. Just last question for me, guys. It seems like every year you start off and you take your time with guidance, which makes a lot of sense. In terms of conservatism here, the BrandLoyalty business, obviously, is going very well in terms of pipeline in North America especially.","Is that an area you've completely included in your guidance? Just give us a little color on that. And just portfolios on the private-label side. Zales hasn't come on yet. Any other opportunities this year? And other than that, I'll leave it at that. Thanks.","Edward Heffernan","Yes. I mean, it\u2019s always a delicate balance of course. I think you nailed it in terms of - look, we don\u2019t know how quickly North Americas are going to roll out for BrandLoyalty, but if the US is 10x, Canada and we got 40 million booked in Canada, you know, you draw the line for me to be and it\u2019s like this could be pretty exciting here.","I am reticent, Darrin, to start putting what quarter will be primarily after the beating on Conversant from having that lag a couple of quarters. But that\u2019s certainly an area that\u2019s going to be pretty exciting.","On the card side, yes, I mean, we - look, we're at the point now where the book is just full and we're continuing to see more interest, as people are shifting their dollars more and more to the platform.","So you're \u2013 there is bunch of other opportunities there. The question is you know, do we have the capacity, do we have the desire to grow even faster, which we could do or do we think that where we are right now is a good place. So we'll make that call as the year folds\u2013 unfolds.","Darrin Peller","It makes sense, guys. Thank you.","Edward Heffernan","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Josh Beck with Pacific Crest.","Josh Beck","Thanks. I wanted to ask a couple of questions on Card Services. It looks like you had tender share gains of 200 bps in Q4 and I think that was probably above the full-year average. Seemed like a really large contributor to the 11% core growth.","Could you give us just a little bit more color on the sustainability of high single to low double-digit core growth, despite a lot of these mixed retail and same-store sales headlines that we're seeing in the marketplace?","Edward Heffernan","Yes, I mean, it\u2019s a great point. Its \u2013 we looked at our book of retailers 145 or so brands that we have out there. We think Q4 holiday rolled all up. They probably did about plus three year-over-year and we were more like plus 8 to 10 at those core \u2013 at those retailers.","So the tender [share stuff, adds anywhere from 5 to 7 points of growth over and above what the retailers grow at. So if the retailers grow at nominal GDP, plus the tender share, we feel pretty good that 10%, first 10% of growth in the business is going to come from the core.","It really seems like this tender share thing is for real. We've seen it now the past several years. And again, the more and more personalized we make the outreach to the consumer, the more effective it is, the more sales that are created, the better the retention of the consume is.","So I think we've got tender share at some of our folks that are over 50% and if we're somewhere around 30ish today, we got a long way to go.","Josh Beck","And I wanted to ask a follow-up on credit quality. It sounds like the majority of the 50 bps increase in loss rates are for next year. Is it really due to a normalization of the recovery rates? Is there any way to quantify or break out the impact of seasoning? Is that material or is it mainly about this recovery dynamic that we should be focused on?","Edward Heffernan","I'd say three quarters of it is the recovery position and then the tiny piece left is just the normalization.","Charles Horn","That\u2019s over the last three years Josh, we've seen our gross losses moved and this over three year window 20 bps and that 20 bps is all due to seasoning.","Josh Beck","Thanks, guys.","Edward Heffernan","Yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim Willi from Wells Fargo.","Timothy Willi","Hi, thanks. And good morning, guys. Two questions. One was back on card and then something about capital. Regarding the card business and your comments around sort of mobile and digital and the board omni-channel, I guess as you think about the RFP process, I think some people feel like it's become a competitive environment just based upon pricing that banks are willing to offer retailers for the receivables.","But could you talk about, just in the last 12 months, if you've noticed any kind of shift in the priorities of retailers in terms of pricing versus sort of digital versus tender shares? Is there anything that has been shuffled there, in your opinion, around the competitive and the RFP environment?","Edward Heffernan","Sure. I think that - and you'll see that in the fact that we're 20% private label, 20% co-brand. The shuffling or the competitive pressure that you're seeing is really on the co-brand side.","That\u2019s where \u2013 let's face it, you're running into the buzz of the big banks who are looking to grow balances, and the best way to grow to balances is certainly not through private label, right, there are tiny balances, but through the big co-brand balances.","And so what we're seeing out there is the pricing on co-brand deals, the big \u2013 these are master cards balances, which are five times, six times what our private label balances are. It\u2019s getting incredibly competitive, and as a result we've backed off in that area because we don\u2019t really need it.","What you'll find is most of our co-brand stuff is an added product to an existing private label client. So to answer your question, the co-brand space is not an area where we think that the pricing make sense.","In terms of the private label stuff, that\u2019s where you get a lot a more focus on the card being viewed as surely the loyalty tool, which gets into the data and the digital and that\u2019s where you get the Conversant discussions beginning to come in and the Epsilon discussions. That\u2019s sort of our sweet spot and the more assets we bring on the digital side, like a Conversant, the better off we are with those businesses.","And frankly, the sale on the private label side is more a sale of developing a loyalty program with all the digital channels attached to it. And that\u2019s where we don\u2019t really run in the type of pricing issues that you run elsewhere, and that\u2019s where we're going to stay.","Timothy Willi","Great. And my follow-up is on the buyback. I apologize if I missed it, but did you make any commentary around your thoughts on the buyback 316 [ph] relative to your guidance, whether it's included or not included, and any color on using that program through the calendar year?","Charles Horn","Yes. We'll continue to be active with it Tim. We will slip it to our second priority versus our primary in 2015. So we'll slip behind M&A. So it will be somewhat consistent with what we've done in the past M&A first buyback.","Second it does incorporates some, as you can see we gave a range on share counts, obviously with the market conditions being where they are, we've already been active during the course of the year. It does not assume the entire share program being used. It just assumes basically what we've already done for the most part.","Timothy Willi","Okay. Sounds great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dan Salmon from BMO Capital.","Daniel Salmon","Hey, guys. Good morning. Ed, I might have missed this in the prepared remarks and the commentary, but could you give us some insight into Epsilon's database pipeline, in particular? It sounds like there are some smaller players there that are reevaluating some businesses and maybe an opportunity. But I know we spent a lot of times on Conversant. I would love to reel it back to the core Epsilon business for moment.","Edward Heffernan","Yes, I mean, I think that what we're seeing is the demand is coming much more heavily for loyalty platform build and a little less from sort of the more traditional, just customer data base builds.","Said differently, the desire of the client to offer something up to the consumer in return for having insights into their consumer and their behavior it seems to be the play of the day here and the way to get the consume to share that information and share those insights is to obviously offer something up from a loyalty perspective.","So the big news in probably the data base build side of things will be on the big loyalty build and that\u2019s where we're seeing a fairly strong level of demand.","Daniel Salmon","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","And your final question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Thank you. Obviously you guys are operating in a choppy backdrop. And I know you did a great job turning around Conversant and the margin trajectory in Epsilon.","I guess to ask the question previously a little different, as we look towards 2016, where are the biggest risks and opportunities to the downside and upside respectively?","Charles Horn","And you are talking about overall business?","Sanjay Sakhrani","Yes, overall business across all the segment?","Charles Horn","I think its going to be fairly consistent with what you saw in '15, where card services always had the ability maybe to grow a little bit quicker, you're getting good traction with Conversant. We were assuming basically high single digit growth for '16, could do a little bit better based on the developing pipeline. BrandLoyalty if we get some traction in the US that could be beneficial to us.","On the down side, we talked about it. Canada looks rough as the mix shifts reduces the revenue per mile, redeemed, ergo, it reduces our profitability. Epsilon, I think we gave pretty good guidance, mid single digits, revenue and EBITDA growth seems solid. Could be a little opportunity there, as we get traction in our marketing technology, but I think that sort of middle of the road.","Upsides are always if we deploy the buyback program, take our share count down. Upside would be we deploy our cash flow and we buy small tuck in acquisition that\u2019s immediately accretive. That\u2019s kind of the way I would look at it.","From a guidance standpoint what Ed and I always try to do, is do is do something middle of the road, recognizing there could be upside, there could be downside, but we usually try to leave enough there to make sure if there is few unknowns, we have the ability to cover it off in our guidance.","Sanjay Sakhrani","And I guess the second question is just on the backlog in Conversant? How long does it take to convert that backlog?","Edward Heffernan","Think of one-third, one-third, one-third. It's not head-on like the vintages and private label, maybe it\u2019s a little bit faster. But you're going to see \u2013 you're actually - if you sign it in 2015 you'll actually get about third of it, up and running in 2015. So current year you'll get a third, the next year you'll get up two third and then couple of years out you'll get the final one.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Final question, M&A, you guys talked about tuck-ins. Where, exactly, are we thinking about opportunity? Thanks.","Edward Heffernan","We really don\u2019t have anything burning at the moment. Sanjay I would say we're probably just using some of the capital and if we find something broadening the footprint in Europe, I think it\u2019s an interesting time over there. We've seen with BrandLoyalty that that\u2019s been a very helpful area for us.","So something in that side of it to help bulk up core Epsilon. And then we'll just see how the year plays out and if there is \u2013 I think there we'll go more heavily on the buyback.","Sanjay Sakhrani","And just to be clear, if you do M&A, you'd look for something that's accretive in year-one?","Edward Heffernan","Yes.","Sanjay Sakhrani","All right, cool. Thank you very much.","Edward Heffernan","All right. Thank you, everyone. Bye-bye.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today.

And then, I\u2019ll add some color and update our 2018 outlook. We plan to keep the prepared remarks to about 20 minutes, so we can dedicate more time to Q&A. Charles?","Charles Horn","Thanks, Ed.","Let\u2019s turn to slide four and talk about the consolidated results. Pro forma revenue increased 8% to $1.97 billion for the second quarter 2018, led by double-digit growth at LoyaltyOne and Card Services. EPS increased 59% to $3.93 for the second quarter of 2018, aided by onetime foreign tax benefit, which reduced the GAAP effective tax rate to approximately 14% for the second quarter. Core EPS increased 31% to $5.01, using a core effective tax rate of approximately 24%, which excludes the one-time foreign tax benefit. Lastly, we spent approximately $100 million on share repurchases during the second quarter while dropping our corporate leverage ratio to 2.5x compared to our covenant of 3.5x, and the end of Q1 2018 of 2.7x.","Let\u2019s go to the next slide and talk about the hot topic of the last few days, delinquencies. Even though delinquency trends improved during the quarter, as shown on the chart, the delinquency rate of 5.5% at quarter-end was above our expectations. The miss was primarily due to the influence of TDRs, modified accounts and during the first quarter 2018 primarily from FEMA-designated disaster areas.","What is the TDR? It is essentially our hardship program which is designed to help card holders with extenuating circumstances get back on their feet after an event, such as a hurricane. The program reduces minimum payment rates, lowers interest rates and suspends late fees. The maximum timeframe an account can stay in the program is 12 months and the accounts are not allowed to bounce into in out of the program. As you saw in the first quarter 10-Q, we added a number of accounts into the program following the natural disasters like last year.","It is important to note the TDR accounts are not removed from delinquency calculations which can create noise in the delinquency trends. Why? Because there are three outcomes. The first, the account makes the payment and stays in the existing aging bucket; second, the account makes three consecutive payments and returns to current status; and third, the account misses two consecutive payments or three payments over 12 months is removed from the program and ages to charge off.","As accounts are added to the TDR program, a higher reserve rate is applied to these balances, assuming there\u2019s a higher probability of later default. Reserve rate for TDRs is currently at 28%. We feel good that our allowance for bad debt reserve is adequate. For June, we were wrong about the timing of the recidivism. It was a little faster than expected. TDR accounts in the mid to late stages of delinquency who have not met the payment requirements have begun to roll to charge-offs and will do so in the next several months. Past program experience suggests the majority of the drag should resolve by the end of the third quarter.","In summary, there are two important takeaways. The first, the high reserve rate for TDRs covers off any future P&L risk; and second, any pressure to net loss rates from recidivism in our TDR program will be mitigated by improving recovery rates. Accordingly, we remain confident that we\u2019re tracking to approximately a 6% net loss rate for 2018.","Let\u2019s go to the next slide and talk about our segment results. Starting with LoyaltyOne, pro forma revenue increased 12% to $315 million. Breaking down the quarter, AIR MILES pro forma revenue increased 1% from the second quarter of 2017. Importantly, AIR MILES issued increased 2% compared to the second quarter of 2017, benefiting from increased promotional activity by the Bank of Montreal. BrandLoyalty\u2019s revenue increased 34% from the second quarter of 2017 as customer bookings were up double digits from the prior year. As we have talked about before, some bookings are event-driven and the FIFA World Cup helped the second quarter.","Turing to Epsilon. Revenue decreased 5% to $514 million. Similar to the first quarter, agency revenue dropped more than 20% due to client losses in the CPG sector from consolidation and budget cuts. Importantly, strong expense management and the favorable shift in revenue mix allowed us to increase EBITDA margins and maintain the same level of adjusted EBITDA as the second quarter 2017.","Lastly, Card Services revenue increased 14% to $1.15 billion, consistent with the growth rate in average card receivables. And adjusted EBITDA in that increased 10% to $336 million. Net loss rates improved sequentially by 30 basis points as the recovery rates improved from high single digits in the first quarter to mid-teens in the second quarter. The second quarter reserve rate remained at 6.8% and should drop over the remainder of 2018 as the net loss rates improve to the high-5% range in the third quarter and to the mid-5% range in the fourth quarter.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Ed.","Ed Heffernan","Thanks, Charles.","If everyone could turn to slide 7, I guess, I would comment that the second quarter is probably the best quarter we\u2019ve posted in terms of operational effectiveness in quite some time. Unfortunately, it was a bit overshadowed by the noise that Charles just talked about on the delinquency front that hopefully we can help over communicate today and in the future.","So, first on LoyaltyOne, it\u2019s been a long road back ever since we had the issues in the program couple of years ago up in Canada where Parliament decided to change the laws around how we run the program. And so, we\u2019ve been building, building, building really over the past year and a half. And finally, in Q2, we saw a return to double-digit pro forma revenue and EBITDA. And LoyaltyOne includes both the Canadian AIR MILES business as well as our European-based BrandLoyalty businesses. And so, the first return to double-double in quite some time and it was really probably the big news, was the key expansion by our largest client or sponsor in the AIR MILES program in Canada, which is Bank of Montreal, which essentially really decided to put their shoulder into it and added a real kicker in terms of additional incentives for people to use the card and use the program. So, that was a big vote of confidence from BMO and we appreciate it.","And then, finally, the key metric AIR MILES issued since we get paid based on the number of miles that are issued, which has been struggling ever since the model came into question, couple of years ago. And it\u2019s been a long battle back. And we finally did in fact break above water in Q2 with a couple points of positive issuance for the first time in a year and a half, and that\u2019s a very good sign. More importantly, as I look at it -- the outlook for Q3 and Q4, the momentum is beginning to pick up. And that suggests that we are past sort of the rebuilding stage and have returned now to growth, which is good news. We also announced an additional sponsor of Telus, one of the big telecom players up in Canada and then in BrandLoyalty a deal with Kroger to take a look at seeing if our grocery loyalty programs would be effective in the U.S.","Okay. For the second half guide, we don\u2019t see things slowing down. We see a continuation of strong results from both AIR MILES and from BrandLoyalty that we saw in the second quarter. And actually, we expect the key metric AIR MILES issued to actually accelerate in the back half. So, overall, I would suggest that LoyaltyOne is back on its feet and doing quite well.","Epsilon, as we\u2019ve guided to, we knew the first half would be soft. Revenue was down in the first half. But again, as Charles mentioned, this is primarily pass-through, low-margin agency business. Frankly, we\u2019re deemphasizing those types of areas. And as a result, you saw the softness there. The adjusted, however we held for the first half, up 4% and tracking to sort of that mid-single-digit guidance that we want for the year. We\u2019re using some additional dollars from the tax windfall, as we mentioned last year, for additional development in our various digital channels.","Second half, we do have a decent visibility on mid-single-digit revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth. Both are probably big growth engines, the auto and the Conversant CRM revenue are tracking to double-digit growth. And that\u2019s approximately half of Epsilon and the other businesses relatively stable or flat, and that\u2019s where we get our mid single digits. And so, we\u2019ll be talking more in Q3 as Epsilon begins to contribute along with the other two businesses.","All right. Let\u2019s turn to slide nine, Card Services. Obviously, it\u2019s been another very strong first half of the year, 14% revenue growth. EBITDA growth started soft due to the higher loss rates and then moved from a minus 4% in Q1 to plus 10% in Q2. And that\u2019s really being driven by the loss rates continuing to tick down as we move throughout the year. We\u2019ve got almost 20% average receivable growth for active programs, and 12% reported. I\u2019ll get into that a little bit. And then, we also are spending significant dollars in the innovation funds to support various consumer, as we call them bells and whistles, on both the frictionless mobile initiatives, as well as building out our consumer deposit platform.","Our second half guide is going to be very familiar in terms of the revenue and receivable growth because it looked very similar to the first half. The adjusted EBITDA again, which includes the cost of funds and the cost of bad debt, will continue to ramp up. So, we did minus 4 in Q1, plus 10 in Q2, and we should be in the 20% range in the second half. The net loss rates, which again is the ultimate driver of the credit expense, we guided to a high-6 in Q1; we came in at 6.7. We guided to a mid-6 in Q2; we came in little better at 6.4. And we are currently tracking nicely to high-5s in Q3 and mid-5s in Q4. And as Charles mentioned, that will give us approximately 6% for the year. We believe the noise from the first half is largely gone. And the delinquency rates which caused the hubbub over the last week or so in fact did decline. They were up 60 basis points in April and they declined to up only 40 basis points in June. Importantly, the early stage delinquencies have narrowed to up 25 basis points in June, which bodes well through the future.","I do want to take two minutes to talk a little bit more and circle back to the June delinquency concern that Charles covered. We did guide to a significant improvement in year-over-year delinquency rates during Q2. The actual results did show improvement from 60 basis points over prior year in April to 40 basis points in June. While that was a significant improvement, we had in fact guided to even better results. We do not factor in those hardship accounts that still remain, neither cured nor written off. This overstated the June delinquency number by roughly 30 of the 40 basis points. And thus, the normal run rate would have been only about 10% higher -- 10 basis points higher than the prior year.","Why do we make the distinction? Well, probably, the simple reason is, these accounts are placed in hardship back in the first quarter of this year. And importantly, they were fully reserved for in the first quarter of this year at a 28% reserve rate versus our less than 7% rate for the entire portfolio. So, they were completely covered off in Q1. This means that the P&L hit was already taken in Q1. And whenever some portion of these accounts flow to write off and out of delinquency, it\u2019s already been covered in expense. So, internally, when we carve out these accounts, when we do our internal analyses, since they\u2019re viewed as noise, since it\u2019s hard to compare a 28% reserve versus the 7% reserve for the portfolio, you get a little bit of apples and oranges. Our internal analysis continues to support loss rates stepping down nicely from the high 6s, as predicted to the mid-6s as predicted to the high-5s and then to the mid-5s in Q4 when recoveries are fully ramped. Frankly, I do apologize for the poor communication and will try to over communicate going forward on these complicated items. The bottom line, however, is that the credit quality within the portfolio looks quite good and losses are trending down nicely to plan.","All right. Page 10, bunch of credit metrics that you can look at, at your leisure. What I\u2019d like to do is get into little bit more detail of what we\u2019re trying to do strategically with the business, which is starting on page 11.","Let\u2019s talk about the first half credit sales. And when you look at the active clients, those are clients that are not in liquidation or bankruptcy or have been terminated. And if you look at just those active clients, our credit sales are up a very healthy 12% during the quarter. Even though the printed credit sales growth was only 2%, it was masked by the liquidating files of Bon Ton, Gander Mountain and Virgin America. So, what\u2019s left is obviously doing quite well.","Probably the most important item, frankly, that we focus on here is the whole strategic shift off-mall. And essentially the new clients, and that\u2019s really represented by the new clients of the new vintages, those who signed between 2015 and \u201818, they are up approximately 70% year-over-year, now represent over quarter or roughly a quarter of the entire credit sales of the business, which if you think of the size of it is fairly remarkable. And what this means is we have made a strategic decision to shift very heavily to where the growth is, and a lot of that is off-mall. We do think that with this shift in place that this will account for probably over half of the file within two years. And as a result, the concerns over the concentrations in our traditional soft good apparel should dissipate at this strategy unfolds. So, we\u2019re making for a much stronger business going forward. And you can see it behind the numbers.","Turning also now to receivable growth, same story for those accounts that are not in liquidation or bankruptcy. You\u2019ll see our active accounts are almost up 20% year-over-year. And that is from the newer vintages; again sort of that off-mall strategy, they are actually up 110% versus prior year. So, again, the strategy is shifting to where the growth is. I think, it\u2019s something that you will see an acceleration in that as we move forward. Okay. And so, now, we will move to finally loss rates since we are getting near the end here.","Finally, this long process of normalizing loss rates, I get the question all the time of what do you target, what is the right loss rate. And what I would say is, if you went back a long time to sort of pre-great recession, we have found that sort of the optimal level to run the portfolio at to generate the sort of 30 plus percent ROEs and above-industry averages in terms of our ROAs et cetera that we like to run the file at about a 6% overall loss rate, plus or minus.","During the great recession era, that trended up to about 8%, and then, post-recession is this sort of over-earning space where losses went below trend as there were frankly fewer and fewer people who qualified for credit. As people returned to the marketplace, you saw this normalization, which started to take place at the end of \u201815, \u201816, \u201817, and we finishing it out this year. And all we\u2019re doing is we\u2019re just returning back to the trend that we had for the last 13 years.","And so, we\u2019re at the end of that thankfully. And from a guidance perspective, when we talk about that, we expect pro forma revenue to be up 10% to about $8.5 billion; core EPS, we expect up somewhere between 16% and 19%. Growth rate by quarters, you will see the big jump from Q1 to Q2 as earnings move very quickly from 13% to 31% and revenue doubled as well. We expect, as we move into Q3, another very strong performance. If you think of it, earnings in the first quarter were about 4.5 bucks and then we move into second quarter have 5 handle, as we move into the third quarter, have a 6 handle. And again, that\u2019s the acceleration that we\u2019ve been talking about.","On the revenue side, couple of things going on there. We are running a bit softer than original thought. But, we expect zero impact to profits or cash flow. Essentially, two factors Card Services, Bon Ton, which was an $800 million file. Usually, these accounts go into bankruptcy and then they\u2019re prepackaged, can come back. Bon Ton went into liquidation, which means everything must go, and that severely obviously, the runoff and in the accounts occurs much faster and that hits our top line. We\u2019ve already offset it in the expense line. So, it shouldn\u2019t really change anything from the cash flow or profits.","At Epsilon, we\u2019re taking a proactive approach there. There are certain verticals in the agency business, frankly, primarily the CPG or the packaged goods vertical that are just real tough verticals right now that we are deemphasizing because there is just no margin there. And as a result, you don\u2019t have a cash flow impact but you do have some low margin revenue that won\u2019t be flowing through.","Overall, I think, the move at Epsilon is a good move in the sense of we\u2019re focusing on where the good margin is. And obviously, from a core EPS perspective, unlike the past couple of years where we\u2019re looking at a really big back-end right now in the first half, our core EPS is already up 22% and our full-year guidance is only 16% to 19%. So, we don\u2019t have the big backend bet that people would get concerned about in prior years. And so, I think Charles and I would say, we\u2019re increasingly comfortable with the visibility of the guidance and we will probably tweak it to the good, hopefully in Q3.","And with that, I think we\u2019ll go ahead and open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Thanks. Good morning. Charles, on the TDR noise, can you clarify how we\u2019re thinking about the provision impact going forward? I respect that you guys said that you\u2019ve taken most of the provision hit already. But, I heard you also talk about the offset from higher recovery rates. So, looking ahead, when we think about your charge-off rate averaging about 6% for the year, is it true that then the provisioning impact going forward would be less than that because you\u2019ve already provisioned for some of those losses?","Charles Horn","Yes. So, there is a couple of ways to look at it. I will start off with what you\u2019re saying, which is, yes, the provision is already set up. As Ed and I both talked about, we put up a 20% reserve against those accounts. So, we feel more than comfortable that\u2019s going to cover us. The second point to really think about with the TDR is we have good experience estimating how many fall out where we\u2019re sometimes off, and how quickly they will fall out of the program which is what caught us little bit off guard. So, history would tell us that we\u2019re in good shape in terms our estimates for Q3 loss rates. We\u2019re guiding to high-5s for Q3, that\u2019s up 40 basis points year-over-year that should more than accommodate the noise coming through from the TDRs and then you see the further improvement in the fourth quarter. On recovery rates, we talked about high single digit recoveries, Q1; mid teens, Q2; should drop -- go up to close to 20%, Q3; and could be north of that in Q4. So that\u2019s part of the reason we\u2019re comfortable with our loss rate guidance as they could put little pressure on your gross principal loss rates, but the better recovery rates mitigate it and keep us on track for that 6% approximate loss rate for the year.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Okay. And then, second question is on leverage. You mentioned, it fell to 2.5 times and I think should drop to the 2s by the end of the year. I guess, when you think about the go-forward expectations on leverage, how much -- or what\u2019s the level that you get to where you maintain all the optimality you need for a variety of different reasons, but also can be more aggressive on capital management? Maybe you could just talk about the go-forward expectations on capital management, and especially next year?","Ed Heffernan","Yes. It\u2019s Ed. I think, that as you mentioned, we will continue to participate on the buyback front, also supporting capital in the Card Services area. So, even doing that, yes, we\u2019re going to get close to about a 2% leverage -- 2 times leverage by the end of the year. That\u2019s pretty conservative for us. We tend to fluctuate between 2 and 3. What we want to do is we want to keep, as you called it the optimality, going forward for whether there may be a significant file out there that requires additional capital or any other items that we want to deal with. So, I think Sanjay, I don\u2019t see us really heading back to 3. I think, the 2 and 2.5 certainly seems very reasonable and gives us the type of dry powder that we could put to work very quickly, either on capital management, as you call it, or if there is a couple of big files out there.","Sanjay Sakhrani","And I\u2019m sorry. Are there a couple of big files out there, as you\u2019re looking at the pipeline?","Ed Heffernan","Yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Meuler with Baird.","Jeff Meuler","Yes. Thank you. Just trying to -- love to get a number just to better clarify the hurricane impacts versus the non-hurricane impact. Outside of the FEMA zones, roughly what are the delinquencies up on a year-over-year basis, in either Q2 or in June, if you have that?","Charles Horn","So, that\u2019s what we tried to provide you on that one slide, which is 30 basis points of the 40 basis points, is attributable to the FEMA zones, which went into the TDR. So, we would tell you that the natural migration or a run rate as Ed would call, it\u2019s about 10 basis points up year-over-year. You can really see it in a couple of ways, as Ed talked about the improvement in the early stage delinquencies. If you look at some of the new account information and the trust, you will see the new accounts for \u201818 are aging to loss or moving to loss lower are slower than what they were in \u201817 and \u201816. The natural trends are beneficial in terms of delinquency. You\u2019ll get little bit of noise from the hardship program, as we talked about. That\u2019s the overall -- the profile is meeting up to the expectations we had coming into the year. So, about 10 basis points would be what we said it would be at June.","Jeff Meuler","And I guess the 25 basis-point early stage, I get that that\u2019s improving, but on a 6 percentish rate, 25 basis points sill sounds somewhat material to me. Is there -- I wouldn\u2019t think there would be a TDR impact in there. Is there, or just any color on what\u2019s going on that it\u2019s still up 25 basis points?","Charles Horn","Well, I\u2019d put it this way. There\u2019s substantial improvements from what it was. I wouldn\u2019t attribute very much of that to TDR. It just takes a certain period of time for things to work through, but we\u2019d tell you, it\u2019s heading in the right direction.","Jeff Meuler","Okay. And then, just finally, can you just clarify what tax rate you\u2019re assuming in the full-year guidance, since there was a Q2 benefit? Thank you.","Charles Horn","So, for the first half of the year on core, it was a 24.2% rate. We guided initially starting year around 25. So, it could come in favorable which would definitely push us toward the higher end of our core EPS estimate. Did I say, 25? I meant 24. My bad. We guided to 25. It could come in around as low as 24 for the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ashish Sabadra with Deutsche Bank.","Ashish Sabadra","My question was about the recovery rates. The consumer is a bit more levered today than he was two years back. Does that affect any of your assumption around the recovery rate, even with ramping up in house recovery? ","Ed Heffernan","The recovery rates themselves, much like how we spool up the various vintages, all has to do with the way the curve works Ashish is once we brought it in-house that took time. Then, you needed to get your hundreds of collectors ready to go and train them up. And then, obviously, they become more and more productive as time unfolds. And that\u2019s why we were in I guess high single digits in the first quarter. We ended the second quarter around 15%. And the way the curve looks compared to what we did right after the great recession, it\u2019s almost bang on. So that as we head into Q3, Q4, it\u2019s really less to do with the consumer and more to do with having the internal group reaching full productivity and run rate. And so, our recoveries should continue to creep up, even without factoring in the consumer.","Ashish Sabadra","That\u2019s helpful. And maybe a question on Epsilon. So, headwinds in agency that effected the first half of the year. But as you look at the second half, are there anything else to watch out for? So, you have -- the auto and CRM is definitely areas of strength, but are there any potential unexpected things that could crop up, which could affect the growth profile in the back half or going forward.","Ed Heffernan","Well, that\u2019s certainly a good question. I mean, we\u2019ve been surprised in the past, as everyone knows. So, we\u2019re being fairly cautious in our commentary on Epsilon back half. What we\u2019re looking at is really the book that\u2019s built right now. And right now, it looks like the softness on the CPG side and agency is passing -- or sorry, it\u2019s going to hit its anniversary. And as a result, just based on that, that should pop us back to that mid single digit growth rate. Other than that, you know, we\u2019re not going try to figure out, hey, if everything goes great, we could be higher than that. We\u2019re just saying, just based strictly on what hit their anniversary levels, and it should pop back to sort of mid single digit by Q3.","Operator","You next question comes from the line of Jason Deleeuw with Piper Jaffray.","Jason Deleeuw","Thanks for taking the questions. The receivables growth for the file, it looks like it\u2019s now going to be about 12%. So, I think it was originally mid-teens for the year. Can you just walk through kind of the details for why the growth\u2019s come in a little bit slower?","Ed Heffernan","Yes, sure. I think that again we tried to lay out the difference between sort of the true business itself, the active clients. What you\u2019re looking at is almost 20% growth in the active client portfolio itself. The difference between 19% and the 12% is nothing more than the liquidations that are taking place as we said. Bon Ton is a big one. Bon Ton was $800 million. And initially, based on what most retailers do, we assumed a prepackaged bankruptcy, they come out, and it would be a very slow attrition in the file. They went into liquidation, and -- as did the other two. And as a result, those files are going from $1.5 billion in receivables to $800 million by the end of the year. And that causes the reported number to be different from the active number.","Jason Deleeuw","Thanks for that. And then I just want to touch on the strategic shift off-mall and just seeing the credit sales and receivables growth for the new clients, the 2015 to 2018 signings; and then, just seeing kind of the active clients category, strong growth there. What should we think about the receivables growth for portfolio after this strategic shift is complete? And is there any help you can give us on the addressable market opportunity, is it bigger or smaller than what you had before? And just any commentary on how ADS competes there; do you feel like you compete there as well or better or worse just any color on that? Thank you.","Ed Heffernan","Sure. No, it\u2019s a good question. And the shift in the strategy is again, we have targeted a 15% growth rate in the file for the next several years. We believe the addressable market which would be the traditional market, plus frankly a lot of new verticals that are shifting dollars out of traditional TV spend and radio spend and everything else, and into this data-driven, personalized marketing, essentially trying to get a handle on the individual customer. We found that the addressable market in our opinion has actually grown. So, if you have the traditional sort of sandbox that we play in, and then, you add into that certain verticals that didn\u2019t even exist before, the big pure ecom players that are growing so fast and want us to take all that SKU level information and slice and dice it and run a million marketing programs, the Wayfair.com, the Build.com, you\u2019ll see a number of more -- of those announce more in the fall. That\u2019s a whole new market for us which I think is good. Additional verticals such as the IKEAs of the world and the Viking Cruises of the world which frankly we never had before, it wasn\u2019t really something that they had a huge interest in all this personalized marketing. And so, those are new verticals as well that are coming in.","And then, finally, with the so-called, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d call it the death of the department store, but certainly the trouble that the department store is you\u2019re having a number of these very prominent brands that use the department store as their base and therefore were captured in the department store cards, which as you know, those department store card portfolios are way too big for us. And so, these brands are now not needing that base anymore and they\u2019re establishing boutiques with a big ecom play. And so, there\u2019s probably 12 or 15 clients there. And then, finally, another sector would be the beauty sector, such as Ulta Beauty, which frankly they weren\u2019t even around before when most people were going into the department stores into the beauty counters, and those things are growing like crazy.","So, I think the overall market, which we initially thought was somewhere around $35 billion is probably more in the $45 billion to $50 billion at this point I think, which sounds surprising. But the fact of the matter is, dollars -- everyone needs to replicate a certain business model that exists out there at a very, very, very large player, which is, I need to know who you are and what you bought down at the SKU level. And unless you have that ecosystem, you can\u2019t do it. And so, that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing for all of these retailers.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust.","Andrew Jeffrey","Just as a follow-up on Jason\u2019s question, it\u2019s helpful to see the active portfolio performance, and thank you for that. Can you compare that to what you have seen in the past, in past vintages, as far as how those -- how newer customers pool up? Is this is a faster ramp, and this mobile, and do weather initiatives contribute to that, or is this about right for say prior three years\u2019 vintage performance?","Charles Horn","I guess, the way we would answer it, Andrew, is you\u2019re correct in your assessment that the new programs we\u2019re adding are much quicker in ramp. To go back eight, nine years, Ed and I would say you that a new private label program would go from 0 to 50 million receivables over three-year period. We now are adding private label programs that are going from 0 to 200 million plus and receivables over three-year window. So, we\u2019re definitely bringing in a different group of retailer. It -- have the same soft goods bias. It\u2019s ramping much quicker. So, the growth profile is much nicer than what we historically would\u2019ve said for a new private label startup.","Ed Heffernan","Yes. I would also say, Andrew, and it\u2019s a great question. And this cuts across all the verticals. So, it\u2019s not just the clients being somewhat different. There is a sense of urgency out there, like you wouldn\u2019t believe, right? It\u2019s the fear of I\u2019ve got to catch up, I\u2019ve got to get this ecosystem of my own where I can recognize who it is down to the individual level, what they purchased online, offline and find that price points that would trigger one extra sale per year than otherwise. So, the sense of urgency, which probably comes with the shrinking life or sort of career life of the various execs, probably has something to do with it as well.","Andrew Jeffrey","And just as a follow-up, if an investor asks me or asserts, hey, it looks like Alliance is seeing greater impact from the hurricanes, from some of the forbearance in the TDRs than other lenders, and what\u2019s going on there? How you address your -- the impact you\u2019re seeing versus maybe what other card-based businesses maybe seeing in those FEMA zones?","Ed Heffernan","Yes. I think, frankly, I think, it\u2019s a fair question and it\u2019s -- a lot has to do with how we approach our clients. We take everyone who is in that FEMA zone, and the big question is why we\u2019re still talking about hurricanes this way in the game. And what we did is we took everyone in the FEMA zone. We froze those accounts October and November last year; we started to unfreeze them December and January. And then, once we could reach out to these folks, those who needed it were put into the hardship programs which was first quarter, reserved against it, and now they\u2019re going to ping pong around between curing or writing off. To us, it\u2019s a tail that exists out there that needs to bleed off. Does it change our P&L? No. Does it change what we\u2019re going to expense? No. It\u2019s already been taken care of. So, it may be that we\u2019re all private label, and private label got hit a little bit harder as opposed to co-brands, or general purpose cards, but -- or it could be the way that we do a blanket freeze on these FEMA-related, if you want to call, a bit more consumer friendly. But at this point, it\u2019s noise that\u2019s in the delinquency numbers already been reserved for. So, it\u2019s really a nonissue at this point.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Togut with Evercore ISI.","David Togut","Could you quantify same-store credit sales in Q2?","Ed Heffernan","Well, you have in there, David, a lot of the ramp-ups of the newer advantages as well. So, as you know, when we\u2019re starting a program, the retailer could be doing 2% growth but we\u2019re ramping up a card program. So, it could be 20% growth at those retailers. And then, some of the more mature retailers, they\u2019re probably doing -- we\u2019re probably doing I would say 2% or 3% comps on that. You throw in the new retailers that are ramping up very, very quickly, and you\u2019re moving into the -- probably into the high single digits, something like that.","David Togut","Got it. And then, just as a follow-up with the all important holiday retail season around the corner, are there any specific online marketing initiatives you can implement at let\u2019s say, your more traditional mall-based retailers to help them get through Q4 successfully?","Ed Heffernan","Yes. That\u2019s a great question. Yes. We are -- I can tell you, there is a huge amount of interest, obviously from that client base, to make sure that the holiday season is a good one. And so, we are loading up and we\u2019re getting in front of it now a lot of these programs that are, if you want to call them, follow-up digital type campaign, so that if you went into the store or you bought a significant item for a couple of hundred dollars, we will use the SKU level information and behavioral information and we will find a way to come back to you most likely in an online capacity with an offer for an accessory, at the right price, reach you on the right channel. Right now, our retailers run about 20% of their sales are still are online. We are running over 40% of our sales are online, meaning that the vast bulk of what we do are these follow-up type campaigns that\u2019s driving the incremental sale to the retailer. So, expect, if you haven\u2019t been flooded yet during last holiday, you can assume that we\u2019ll be flooding you this year.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research.","Darrin Peller","Just the first question is on -- just to be clear, there is no new non-core or problematic portfolios you see right now that will become non-core or non-active, as far as you can tell right now? I just want to clarify that first of all.","Ed Heffernan","That\u2019s correct. I think Bon Ton is by far the big one in the 10.","Darrin Peller","And then, the timing that we should expect -- everything to be really clean with CDRs pass-through at this point, your opinion would be late third quarter into fourth quarter that we get clean results. I just want to make sure we all know what to expect exactly. ","Charles Horn","Yes. Darrin, history would say that by the end of the third quarter, it should pretty well have cleared through.","Darrin Peller","And then, let me shift to a more of a strategic question. On the Epsilon side of the business, I think there is some assets there that aren\u2019t performing as well as you would have expected going back couple of years ago. And so, when you start with Epsilon, are there any strategic areas that you could potentially prove or think might need restructuring further that could either be sold off, just if you could touch on that? And then maybe follow-up with just revisiting the timeline in your mind and the Board\u2019s mind around how long you\u2019d be giving yourselves and the stock and -- before you decide to actually execute on other strategic initiatives for the whole Company?","Ed Heffernan","Yes. Obviously, I need to be careful in how position it. But needless to say, I think that Epsilon\u2019s overall performance has been softer than anticipated over the last several years, frankly. And I think that there have been discussions at the Board level that started a couple years ago. I can tell you right now, they have picked up fairly dramatically over the last year. And so, from that perspective, we are not sitting around with hope as our strategy. And we are looking at all the assets of the Company on now a more intensive basis. And I think that by -- as we move into the back half and we look at the performance. If the performance is there, that\u2019s great. If the performance is only modest, my guess is, there will be more pressure to do something. That\u2019s probably about as far as I can go.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Vincent Caintic with Stephens.","Vincent Caintic","Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys. And I also want to thanks for the details on the card sales for the new and total active clients. That\u2019s very helpful. And I noticed you\u2019ve been getting some account wins and then, conversely that there\u2019s been some issues with peers in terms of retailer accounts and lots of switching of retailers with new card partnerships. I was just wondering if you could discuss the competitive environment. And then also when you win accounts or when you renew accounts, how are the margins upon renewal and for accounts that might win going forward? Thanks.","Ed Heffernan","Yes. It\u2019s fair question. I think, that there is really sort of two markets that are out there. One is the store cards that are co-brands, and that means the Visa, MasterCard, big programs. There is probably, what, two dozen very large portfolios that are multibillion-dollar portfolios that are out there. And they are kind of up for grabs every time there is a renewal talk. And frankly, those are the ones that sort of the big players, the big banks are buying for on an ongoing basis. And my suspicion would be that the competitive level is quite high. What we have done is we have sort of confined ourselves to almost exclusively private label, which is less attractive to the big banks because the balances are so small. If it\u2019s a $500 balance versus a $3,000 balance, that\u2019s of less interest to a big bank to move the needle. And that has proved to be very effective over the years. Also 90% plus of our new clients are starting from scratch, which means that you need to have had a number of vintages that you signed every single year to keep that ramp going. And that requires a lot of patience and it requires bringing a client from nothing to significance over a longer period of time. Again, that doesn\u2019t really move the needle at the big banks. And that\u2019s our sweet spot.","If it\u2019s if it is a co-brand, most likely, I would say 85% of our co-brands are accommodations to clients who already have a private label card. So that maybe there\u2019s an extra 5% or 10% of the customer base that would like the co-brand option as opposed to just private label. But since that\u2019s the case, we already have the private label, we\u2019re going to get the co-brand, we don\u2019t run into the tough competition that I think is out there in the general purpose card arena. So, long story short, as long as we can stay in our sandbox and focus on what we do, then I think we\u2019re in good shape. As soon as we start venturing into these multibillion dollar co-brand files, frankly, I just don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to be competitive. It is just our uniqueness is more about nurturing an account from zero, getting it going, getting the data going, getting the campaigns going, layering on the conversant product which allows us to do prospecting on behalf of the client et cetera et cetera. So, it\u2019s just a different world right now. I don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s better or worse, it\u2019s just different.","Vincent Caintic","And just to put a finer point on that. So the economics that you are getting off of the renewals on these the new relationships, those are relatively unchanged, what would you say?","Ed Heffernan","Yes. I mean, I would say -- obviously, I can\u2019t get into specifics. But what are we running Charles, on our ROEs, 35? About 35% return on equity, that would be a good figure to use.","Vincent Caintic","And just maybe switching gears, but a quick one. So, this conversation about the TDR is related to the hurricanes. Could you actually size actually how big of an impact -- or how big of your portfolio is this actually, because if it\u2019s all of the TDRs for these hurricanes but it\u2019s only, I don\u2019t know, 1% or 2% of your portfolio might not be a big deal. So, if there is -- if you could size up just how much of an impact this is to the actual portfolio that would be great. Thank you.","Charles Horn","So, what you can do, Vincent, you can go to our first quarter 10-Quarter, there is I think page 17 where we discuss the modified receivables, it delineates the number of accounts and restructuring, it delineates the amount. We\u2019ve not put it out for Q2, but in the first quarter it was less than 3% of our overall AR. That\u2019s where you can see the dollars quantified and you can see the reserve rate at the end of Q1 was 24%. We have disclosed that it\u2019s now 28% at the end of Q2. But that would give you the best information surrounding that, Vincent.","Operator","At this time, we have reached the allotted time for questions. Your last question will be from Dan Perlin with RBC Capital Markets.","Dan Perlin","So, my first question, Ed, is just what are the reconciling items for you to only do mid-teens in the in the third quarter? Because when I look at it and hear everything you just said, and you just put a 31%, and I appreciate some of that is tax, but a lot of it was actually outperformance in a couple units. And all you\u2019re saying is charge-offs are going to get better, loyalty sounds better, Epsilon sounds better, tax is likely to stay similar to better. I\u2019m just trying to understand what pressure is this in the third quarter, to make sure I understand the cadence how this year should play out.","Ed Heffernan","I think that -- and I\u2019ll let Charles jump in, but directionally you\u2019re right in the sense that you started with Q1; you had the acceleration in Q2, as losses came down and the LoyaltyOne segment hit the ground running. As we move into Q3, going to have losses come down again and you are going to have LoyaltyOne continue to contribute, and now you are going to Epsilon. So, it would seem that Q3 should even be faster. The fact is from a dollar perspective, you did about 4.5 bucks in Q1; you did 5 bucks in Q2; you will do a 6 handle in Q3. So, from a dollar perspective, you\u2019re certainly getting that type of acceleration. The only difference is that loss rates last year in Q3 were lower than Q4 whereas this year Q3 will be higher than Q4. I think, in Q3, Charles, jump in, I think we had a number of sales that we did that helped lower the Q3 rates last year.","Charles Horn","Correct. So, last year, the loss rate was 5.5 in Q3, went up to 6 in Q4. So, it really comes down to reserve methodology. This year, we\u2019re saying high-5s in Q3, mid-5s in Q4. So, you just kind of flipped the reserve pattern from the prior year.","Dan Perlin","Okay. So, that cadence is a little bit off from what we saw last year, so a good model that up, we have to make sure that the third quarter is trued up for that provision expense. Is there optionality for you guys to have a reserve release later in the year, given maybe over provisioning, given the results from the hurricane stuff, or is that just locked in and that doesn\u2019t change?","Charles Horn","I wouldn\u2019t necessarily call it a reserve release because you\u2019re still growing your receivables and you\u2019re putting up an allowance for. You could see though the allowance rates fall. So, we were 6.8 in Q1, 6.8 reserve in Q2. Based upon the trends we see in loss rates, I would expect the reserve rate to drop Q3 and to drop a little bit further in Q4. So, you\u2019re still putting up a bill, it just would be a lesser bill than what you would have had otherwise.","Dan Perlin","And then just one last one for sake of time, I know. The operating expense leverage on your ARs in the fourth quarter, my suspicion is that could be pretty significant but I just wanted to quantify that a little bit. If you help that would be great.","Charles Horn","Yes. That\u2019s what we probably need to talk about offline, Dan. We can just work with your model at that point. ","Ed Heffernan","Okay. I think that\u2019s it. So, thank you, everyone. And we\u2019ll catch up to you next quarter.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference.

At this time, all parties have been placed on a listen-only mode. And following today\u2019s presentation the floor will be open for your questions. [Operator Instructions]","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Edward Sebor of FTI Consulting. Sir, the floor is yours.","Edward Sebor","Thank you operator. By now you should have received a copy of the Company\u2019s first quarter 2017 earnings release. If you haven\u2019t, please call FTI Consulting at 212-850-5721. On the call today, we have Ed Heffernan, President and Chief Executive Officer of Alliance Data; and Charles Horn, Chief Financial Officer of Alliance Data.","Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on today\u2019s call and some of the responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risks and the uncertainties described in the Company\u2019s earnings release and other filings with the SEC.

Reconciliation of those measures to GAAP will be posted on the Investor Relations website at www.alliancedata.com.","With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Ed Heffernan. Ed?","Ed Heffernan","Great. Thanks, Ed. We\u2019re going to follow a similar format that we did last the quarter that people seem to like which was focusing on a shorter commentary period and more questions. And so with that we\u2019re just going to jump right in here. I\u2019m going to have Charles go ahead and walk through the first quarter results. And then I\u2019ll talk about trends and our full year outlooks. So Charles, go ahead.","Charles Horn","Sure. Thanks, Ed. Let\u2019s start with Slide number 3, and if you look at our start to 2017, it was better than expected with revenue of 12% to a $1.88 billion and core EPS of 2% to $3.91. Both exceeded guidance for the first quarter, which is a very good start.","Adjusted EBITDA net was flat at $440 million compared to the first quarter of 2016. A $72 million reserve billed at Card Services and a $17 million decrease in adjusted EBITDA at AIR MILES due to the breakage reset at the end of 2016 dampen the growth rate for the quarter.","As delinquency trends moderate over the course of 2017 consistent with a wedge the quarterly reserve billed will moderate while the year-over-year hole in AIR MILES adjusted EBITDA should close this program changes or implemented over the course of 2017.","Starting the year, we knew we need to deliver on three major assertions. First, that Epsilon could return to positive revenue in adjusted EBITDA growth and that we could stabilize the technology platform offering. We would say we\u2019re on track; especially I view it as very strong Q1.","Second, the credit normalization will conclude by the end of 2017 with a check as we\u2019re definitely tracking to the wedge on Slide 11. Third, that we can retool the AIR MILES model to replace loss to EBITDA from the breakage reset. We\u2019d say that still in the process, but we do expect EBITDA margins to increase appreciably especially in the back half of 2017.","Turning to capital allocation, we were active with our repurchase program during the first quarter, spending $415 million of the $500 million board authorization to acquire 1.7 million shares.","Let\u2019s go to the next slide and talk about LoyaltyOne. We\u2019ll start with AIR MILES, and AIR MILES revenue decreased 6% to $181 million for the first quarter of 2017. The decrease is largely due to a 4% decline in AIR MILES redeemed which was expected given the elevated redemption activity in 2016. The burn rate which were miles redeemed divided by miles issued was still elevated during the first quarter of 2017 due to a backlog that carried over from 2016. But we expect it to normalize at about a 78% burn rates for full year 2017.","AIR MILES adjusted EBITDA decreased 32% to $35 million or a 20% EBITDA margin. The decrease was primarily due to the lower breakage rate entering 2017, as you recall it\u2019s now 20% versus historically it was 26% and that knocks about one cent or one penny off profitability per mile redeemed. This is the whole we\u2019ve talked about before. We are focused primarily on lowering the cost per mile redeemed by negotiating better vendor pricing and we started to see results in March.","From a collector standpoint, our active collector statistics overall are down from last year but on par with 2015 levels. Our promotions in market such as a recently completed cruise promotion where every mile earned during the qualifying period was an entry into one of 1,300 cruise packages are stimulating issuance per transaction which is positive news.","BrandLoyalty revenue and adjusted EBITDA decreased 6% to $152 million and 14% to $24 million respectively compared to the first quarter of 2016. The declines are largely due to program timing between years as well as unfavorable FX rates been a 3-point drag on both. There\u2019s really nothing new to report on the North American expansion effort at this time, but there were several high potentials for 2017.","Let\u2019s flip to the next slide and discuss Epsilon. It\u2019s the first quarter in some time that I actually enjoy talking about the Epsilon results, as we started the year very strongly with revenue up 7%, adjusted EBITDA up 5% a very nice flow through the top line growth to adjusted EBITDA. And there was a better balance of revenue growth in the key product categories than we\u2019ve seen in some time.","Epsilon agency, auto and CRM were all at double digits with the CRM\/Direct at a robust 47%. Data and affiliate product offerings increased in low single-digit range, to acknowledge in your platform which is about 25% of Epsilon\u2019s revenue decreased 7% which was a sequential improvement to the minus 13% in Q1 of 2016 \u2013 Q4 of 2016, sorry. This offering turn quickly in 2016 as growth rates went from plus 5% growth in Q1 to flat in Q2 to minus 4% in Q3 and then minus 13% in Q4. The change in 2016 was due to the loss of a few key clients midyear, importantly the client base has since been very stable.","Lastly Conversant Agency was down 28% compared to the first quarter of 2016. This offering has been a consistent drag now for about nine quarters, but it\u2019s now reaching a level where at less than 5% of Epsilon\u2019s revenue, it appears to be stabilizing.","Let\u2019s turn to Slide 6 and talk about Card Services. Revenue increased 22%, just slightly over $1 billion for the first quarter of 2017 driven by strong gross yields which increased 80 bps compared to first quarter 2016.","Operating expenses increased only 3% to $360 million for the first quarter and expressed as a percentage of average card receivables decline to 120 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2016 that is a very strong start to the year in terms of expense leveraging.","Adjusted EBITDA net increased 8% to $331 million for the first quarter of 2017, despite a $72 million billed allowance for the loan losses and as we talked about before that number should drop in Q2 and Q3. Credit sales increased 6% to $6.6 billion for the first quarter aided by tender share gains to about 100 basis points. Over one-third of credit sales for the quarter were through digital channels reflecting the change in retail landscape. Web mobile applications increased 13% while traditional channel applications such as in-store increased 6% during the quarter. Web mobile applications now count for over 30% of all applications.","Recognizing the shift to digital sales, we recently introduced a Frictionless mobile acquisition capability which reduces the application process to only a few keystrokes reducing the abandonment rate of over 95%. These capabilities will allow us to continue to add etailers such as Wayfair and its clients.","Lastly to clarify the topic of raise in interest rates, yes the benefits Card Services made interest margin. The APR we charged is variable rate tied to primary, an increase in prime rate will reset the APR to the card holder within 2 billion cycles. Conversely funding costs which are about 70% fixed rate will reset over a two-year period.","Now with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Ed.","Ed Heffernan","Great. Thanks Charles. If you will turn to Slide 8 just a quick summary of the first quarter of 2017, as we mentioned that a consolidated basis top line was up 12% and we had a couple of points of growth on our core EPS against guidance, the guidance was less than that for \u2013 and was looking for high single-digit top line and flat core. So little bit better than guidance which is always a good way to start the year. What I think was a nice change as we began 2017 was we\u2019re beginning to see balance a return to the model, obviously Card Services continue to have a very strong performance. But now we had Epsilon produce one of its best quarters since 2015. And it looks like a lot of the initiatives we took in play \u2013 we put in place last 15 months finally beginning to take route, so that was positive there.","And then finally on the LoyaltyOne which is the final piece to add balance to the company, we all knew that we had a hole to dig out in the first part of the year, we are on track to return back to a nice healthy margin in the back half. And then BrandLoyalty, that jumps up and down by quarter depending upon when the big grocers want to launch their campaigns. This year it looks more like it\u2019s going to be back half as opposed to front half but those things are beginning to screw up as we had hoped for.","And so as we exit the second quarter and into the back half, you should have the third engine also contributing very nicely and that that would restore the full balance that we\u2019ve been lacking in the last year or two. So, that\u2019s where we stand right now if you move to sort of the full year outlook by business, Epsilon, as we talked about very strong start to the year. In the full year guidance, we\u2019re going to keep unchanged at this point which is $2.24 billion, up 4% and $0.5 billion of EBITDA up 4%. So given the start to the year, we think this is a reasonable target set for the year.","Furthermore on the piece of the Epsilon that went south on us last year which was the big technology platform business about a quarter of Epsilon Conversant. The move that we\u2019ve been trying to make is changing the model such that the pricing is more competitive with some of the SaaS-based solutions out there, where someone could bring it in-house and then hire a bunch of analysts or come to us. We think with our initiatives at the office, we have the pricing in the control. And we\u2019re beginning to see some momentum on the pipeline in terms of selling a more standardized product into the market. So our goal is to move from sort of that negative comp to basically flat by the end of the year, which will obviously raise the overall growth rate at Epi.","Turning to LoyaltyOne, again similar to Epsilon full year guidance remains unchanged in Canada, we expect the $760 in revs and about $180 million in EBITDA that\u2019s versus a couple $100 million in EBITDA prior year that\u2019s the hole the Charles talked about that we need to fill-in in order to make up for the breakage change that was made.","We expect this model to be fully retooled by the third quarter and I expect to see 25% margins return starting no later than the third quarter compared to sort of the 20% this quarter. We\u2019re making good progress on what we need to do there. Overall issuance as we expected also would be a little bit like till we get through some of the lingering noise from the Q4 change in law up in Canada.","We are beginning to see is the activity level is beginning to return on our collector side. And what we really need now as for the sponsors to really put their shoulder into the big promotional activities that account for a large chunk of the miles issued up there. And then as we talked about BrandLoyalty, the big programs will be launching in the back half.","All right, Card Services Slide 10. We still expect to see very nice receivable growth of roughly 15% almost $2.5 billion of growth, the pipeline remains robust and we certainly expect to sign another $2 billion vintage meaning signing a number of clients such that as they move from startup into full run rate after about three years. All these clients combined will add about $2 billion of portfolio growth.","Growth yields certainly stable and we expect an ongoing benefit from operating leverage. Credit normalization, which is of course the big thing everyone was concerned about over the last year or so, it is very nicely on track. It\u2019s obviously nice to see that Q1 came in precisely where the wedge said, it would come in which was 50 basis points over last year, so that big hurdle is done.","And right now, we\u2019re looking at Q2 to Q4, the gap looks like it\u2019s going to narrow as we expected. So you know, we have at this point a very good visibility into pretty much the rest of the year in terms of the delinquency flows and it\u2019s everything we\u2019re seeing now it\u2019s no longer a guessing game of two years ago. This is now in the gun sights, and we can see it happening as we speak. So the gaps going to close and that essentially means that loss rates will follow and that gives us a very high level of confidence that the 2018 loss rate is going to be flat to 2017, so good news there.","On the principal loss rate side, we won\u2019t go into all the stuff about denominator effects and timing and all that other stuff. Suffice to say the guidance that we gave on the prior call remains consistent, which is we\u2019re going to have a six handle on the losses in the first half. And I expect that to drop 100 basis points as so as we are in the back half. And so we think we\u2019re in good shape with the losses.","And then finally full year guidance double-digit revenue growth and importantly, I think the one tweak we\u2019ve made is we expect 10% growth on adjusted EBITDA and again it\u2019s kind of a funny term to use in the card business but adjusted EBITDA for us does include all the expenses associated with losses as well as all the expenses associated with funding. We just happen to call that EBITDA to keep it consistent.","What that also indicates is we had an 8% to 10% range to start the year, we\u2019re now firming it up at the high end and so even if loss rates or other variables jump around a little bit here or there, we feel very comfortable that the higher end of the range is achievable this year, which is good news.","Finally, you\u2019ll see the fabulous delinquency wedge and tracking very nicely and I will look forward to retiring this charge sometime in October, when it is no longer relevant and then talk solely about no need to build up those big reserves for 2018 because we\u2019re going to be flat to 2017 and that will though of course drive the slingshot.","Okay. Finishing up, 2017 outlook full year consolidated guidance remains the same $7.7 billion, on revs and core EPS roughly 10%, $18.50. In terms of how it should flow out, guidance it was high-single and flat in Q1, we came a little better on plus 12% plus 2%, Q2 we still want to keep it at mid-single and flat until we see the LoyaltyOne businesses being AIR MILES and BrandLoyalty kick into full gear by Q3.","And then by Q3, you\u2019re going to have the LoyaltyOne businesses along with Epsilon continuing to produce as well as lower loss rates start the acceleration process and start moving us in to mid-teens earnings growth. And then by Q4, your right in the teeth of it and we\u2019ll be looking at low-teens top line mid-teens core EPS. And then the fun begins as we move into 2018. And right now the visibility on the slingshot of very significant acceleration into the back half and into 2018 remains right on track. I would say the only change is that it\u2019s we have much better visibility as each month goes by and it\u2019s certainly increasing our confidence each month that takes by.","So that\u2019s sort of where we are, it\u2019s a good quarter for Cards, it was a very good quarter for Epsilon. And then the businesses in LoyaltyOne are tracking to add to the balance in the back half and that being said, we should be in good shape this year and very good shape going into 2018. And we\u2019ll keep it short and sweet, that\u2019s it. We will open up for questions, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of David Togut with Evercore ISI.","David Togut","Thank you, good morning. Nice to see the continued growth in tender share in card. My question really focuses on operating expense discipline. You closed out 2016 with 1,000 associates in India. What are your plans to continue to build out the India office and low-cost locations generally? And what impact should that have on margins over the next year or so?","Charles Horn","It\u2019s a great question David. Again, that\u2019s primarily focused around the Epsilon division. We are not doing any off-shoring with Card Services. You\u2019re right, we ended last year with about 1,000 associates in India. We\u2019re now up to about 1,300, I believe. The target will be to continue to grow that within the Epsilon division. I would not expect to see any EBITDA margin expansion. Right at the moment from it, what it does allow us to do, David, is be more price competitive on that core Tech Platform offering that we have, where, as Ed talked about, we\u2019ve seen some pressure coming through from some SaaS products and cloud based.","So what I\u2019m looking for is to allow us to really grow the top line, sustain EBITDA margins but not necessarily be incremental to EBITDA margins until at a future day.","David Togut","Got it. Just as a quick follow-up, the rewards propositions on traditional Visa and MasterCards continue to increase. I recognize this is more at the mass affluent end of the market, which is not necessarily your core in Private Label. But can you just talk about what you\u2019re seeing in your demographics in Visa and MasterCard as a sort of a competitor for the Private Label business and how you think about tweaking the value proposition to your consumers?","Ed Heffernan","Sure. I\u2019ll take that one, David. It\u2019s no question on the general-purpose cards. We know that the reward portion are getting more robust than they have in the past. From our perspective, again we view the Private Label product as a specific loyalty product for an individual brand and not necessarily catering to the mass spend. And so the ability for us, I think, to keep at the sort of current level of rewards, I think, is reasonable. Where we\u2019re getting the juice, so to speak, is our ability to target the offers much more precisely than we have in the past.","So in the past, if we were out there offering a third of the base 10% off and a third 20% off, et cetera, et cetera, based upon their buying behavior, what we can do now is we can essentially go down to personalize targeting, which allows us to be much more efficient with the marketing dollars and get a higher lift. So as long as we continue to have the ability to target a lot better than sort of a general-purpose card, we should be \u2013 I think our reward structure is about where it should be.","David Togut","Understood. Thank you.","Ed Heffernan","Yep.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller with Barclays.","Darrin Peller","Thanks guys. Just a quick follow-up on the private \u2013 on the Card Services business. The growth that you\u2019re calling for, it does account for any weakness there might be on the \u2013 certain types of retailers that you guys have as clients, I mean, in terms of same-store sales growth. Can you remind also which buckets it\u2019s coming from? I know there\u2019s not a lot coming from portfolio acquisitions. And then just a quick follow-up on the provisions side. It did come in higher than we thought. Can you give us a little guidance? In other words, there\u2019s a nice cushion now, it looks like, versus charge-offs. I think you ended up where the reserves are around 6.5% or 6.6% maybe. Where should we be versus charge-offs by the end of the year. Thanks guys.","Ed Heffernan","Sure. I\u2019ll take the first and Charles can take the second. In terms of retailer sales, for sure I \u2013 or the sort of traditional customer that we have out there, our traditional client, probably is looking at negative comps as they were during holiday season as opposed to a more traditional plus 3%. And recall that if they do plus 3% because of our tender share gains, we get our first 8% to 10% of growth just from that.","Now if they\u2019re looking at minus 2%, we\u2019ll still get our tender share gains. But rather than getting up to plus 8%, we\u2019ll probably do like plus 3%. That essentially means that if we want to see our 15% growth in the file, we\u2019re going to have to have good performance out of the more recent signings, and we are seeing that, as well as continuing to sign a $2 billion-type vintage to keep those numbers up. Essentially, we\u2019re going to have to put more in the funnel in terms of number of clients to get the same level of growth that we had before. And that\u2019s effectively what we\u2019re looking at right now.","Charles Horn","On the reserve side, Darrin, the reserve was 6.6% in reservable AR at 12 \u2013 sorry, at March 31. What I would expect is the provision build, that reserve build, which was $72 million in Q1, should drop probably below $50 million Q2 \u2013 below $50 million Q3. Q4 is really going to come down to growth and whether we see any type of bulk acquisition coming through. So I think that your question\u2019s right. Based on the trends we\u2019re seeing, should it be lower than 6.6% at year-end? I\u2019d say based on trends now, that would be an accurate assumption.","Ed Heffernan","Yes, and just to finish up, Darrin, on the question about the organic growth, all the growth we\u2019re talking about here, the plus 15%, is organic, which is a combo of the core clients plus the spool-up of the recent signings over the past 3 years. There\u2019s no large portfolio acquisition or even modest portfolio acquisition put in there.","Darrin Peller","All right, that\u2019s helpful. And just a quick follow-up, guys, on the AIR MILES side of the business. Just to be clear, I mean, are you actually seeing sponsors willing to come back and provide more in the way of promotions again? I mean, I know it was a little bit of sour spot for some of them last \u2013 at the end of last year. You\u2019re saying collectors are now looking like they\u2019re coming in again. I guess to compensate for what\u2019s probably going to be a slightly lower reward percentage in terms of the cost to redeem a reward helping your margins, it\u2019s going to make your sponsors are all on board for that and the program should still be very much intact.","Ed Heffernan","Yes. I mean it\u2019s \u2013 look, no one had a lot of fun in Q4, I\u2019ll tell you that. It \u2013 with the change in law up there threw everything into \u2013 everyone into a tizzy. And right now, the noise has fortunately abated. What we\u2019re looking at is the number of \u2013 the volume levels to the call centers into the online reward redemptions and everything else has stabilized. It\u2019s come back, virtually all the way back to where it was pre-noise, if I could call it. And so I think from that perspective, that\u2019s good. We are comfortable with the sponsors. There was a lot of noise. But right now, most of the \u2013 or in fact, all the sponsors have basically said, hey, enough already, let\u2019s get back to driving sales.","So everyone is looking forward at this point. We don\u2019t expect to see any fallout from the sponsor side. The big questions right now and what we\u2019re doing is to get the 11 million collectors fired up again, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re spending a lot of money on sort of a relaunch and lots of marketing in terms of the benefits of the program. And we expect sponsors who have been on the sidelines for the last quarter or so to start putting their marketing dollars into the big promotional programs really starting in Q2. If I look at issuance level, I would say this would be the bottom in terms of the growth rate. I would expect to see about halfway back to flat in Q2, and I would expect to see healthy positive growth in issuance Q3, Q4. That seems to be how the promotional spend is beginning to fall out this year.","Charles Horn","And Darrin, the only thing I\u2019d add on the cost-to-mile, the reason we\u2019re attacking the cost-to-mile is it does not reduce the value proposition to the collector. So if we can go through and negotiate better pricing for the same product, we basically fill the hole and the lost EBITDA without affecting the experience of the consumer, which is really the reason why we\u2019re attacking it in that approach.","Darrin Peller","Okay. All right, that\u2019s great to hear, guys. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Scharf with JMP Securities.","David Scharf","All right, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. First is, and I know this is sort of a difficult topic to discuss in much detail on this call. But can you remind us, as it relates to big AIR MILES sponsors, what sort of the forward 24-month calendar looks like for renewals? And curious whether or not the events of the last year are likely to impact some of the pricing discussions you have as it relates to the value of those miles to your sponsor.","Ed Heffernan","Sure. No, it\u2019s not uncomfortable. It\u2019s a reasonable question. I\u2019d say obviously, we\u2019re not going to talk about specific names, but we have a handful of renewables that we\u2019re looking to get done this year. We\u2019ve got 2 of the 4 done so far, which is good news. We have certainly had our heads filled with a number of comments about what are we going to do about getting this brand going again. And I think where we\u2019re coming out, it\u2019s going to be less about any type of pricing pressure.","I think we\u2019re going to be okay on that perspective. What it is going \u2013 where it\u2019s going to show up, David, is we\u2019ve agreed to fund some fairly robust spend in the first half of this year to reengage the collectors. So a lot of the marketing dollars that normally wouldn\u2019t need to be spent to get people fired up again, we\u2019re going to take \u2013 we\u2019re going to shareholder that, and that\u2019s what\u2019s reflected in guidance.","David Scharf","Got it. Got it. And as a follow-up, just switching to the card business, you partially addressed this in the discussion of retailer sales. Can you give us a sense for the 6% credit sales growth, how that tracked relative to your expectations, and whether there\u2019s any type of rule of thumb we ought to be thinking about for the relationship between credit sales growth, tender share and, ultimately, the mid-teens portfolio growth assumption?","Ed Heffernan","Yes, I mean, you\u2019re going to have \u2013 I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a good rule of thumb. I think over the long haul, things seem to \u2013 growth rate should be roughly in line with each other, but it\u2019s going to vary year-by-year. You\u2019re going to have years where credit sales growth is higher than portfolio growth and vice versa. I think the 6% in terms of sales versus the 15% or whatever we did in the portfolio is \u2013 you\u2019re not going to see that big of a discrepancy going forward.","My guess is you\u2019re going to start seeing that credit sales, we think, is probably going to be back maybe 8%, 9% in second quarter and will be double digit Q3, Q4 based on what we\u2019re looking at in terms of trends and in terms of comps. And then you\u2019re going to see the portfolio, right, will start trending in that sort of mid-teens level. So they\u2019re going to \u2013 the gap should close this year. They\u2019ll never be one-to-one. But look for the credit sales number to move from 6% to sort of 8% to 9% and then probably 11% or 12% in the back half.","David Scharf","Got it, helpful, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim Willi with Wells Fargo.","Tim Willi","Thank you, good morning. Hey, there. Two questions and first one on Epsilon. Could you just talk a little bit around your, I guess, industry exposure? You highlighted auto being strong. But it seems like every day, there are more stories about \u2013 of auto sales peaks, funding being cut off for borrowing, et cetera. Just, I guess, how you think about auto and your discussions about vertical. But just any other industry verticals you would highlight as potentially strengthening or didn\u2019t have as great of a quarter but could bounce back. Just anything along those lines?","Ed Heffernan","Sure. Yes, one of the interesting things, obviously, if auto sales fall off a cliff, we\u2019ll certainly be impacted because there\u2019ll tend to be sort of across-the-board cut. However, if auto sales sort of level out at, what do we have, about $17 million or so a year, that\u2019s actually just fine because what will happen is the OEMs and the dealers will certainly be very focused on reaching any and all incremental buyer out there. A lot of the work that we do with the dealerships, which really drives the auto vertical, doesn\u2019t necessarily have to deal with just the new car sales. It has to do with the communication of ongoing services.","So as you know, dealers make a bunch of money on the services side. And so a lot of our work is predicting when someone needs that oil change or someone needs the new tires and things like that. And those are the communications that will be ongoing regardless of where new sales are. And then if new sales soften a bit, that means that the sort of one-to-one personalized marketing becomes more and more important.","So the long-winded way of saying, Tim, that I think from the auto vertical itself, we are looking at another record year in terms of growth there, and it\u2019s mainly due to the dealerships signing up for the data-driven, personalized marketing that we\u2019re doing in communications. So I think unless auto sales fall off a cliff, we should be in pretty good shape. Otherwise, the other verticals look to be fairly healthy.","Tim Willi","Great, thanks and my follow-up on card, you referenced what you\u2019re seeing in the digital channels both in terms of spend and applications. And you also, I think, mentioned Wayfair as a customer. I\u2019m just curious, as online has obviously evolved and maybe hit an inflection point around consumers\u2019 shopping behaviors, has that at all expanded what you view as your addressable market of potential customers versus how you might have thought about your addressable market of retailers a couple of years ago?","Ed Heffernan","Yes. I mean, it\u2019s a good question. I think you\u2019re seeing some of the splintering of the retail space, much like we saw in TV when cable channels came along 1,000 years ago and splintered it and now it\u2019s being splintered even more. So the name brands that use to need the floor space in a big department store don\u2019t need that anymore. They can have their own e-commerce site.","And so our game plan going forward is you may not get the huge sales growth from signing a big brand or big department store, but we can scoop up those individualized brands as they develop their own e-commerce sites. So our focus is going to be very, very heavily on helping our existing customers grow their online presence and their ability to more precisely target the customer as well as look at some of these newer e-commerce players.","Tim Willi","Great, thanks very much. That\u2019s all I had.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of George Mihalos with Cowen.","George Mihalos","Great. Good morning, thanks for taking my question guys. Wanted to start off with the first quarter being as strong as it\u2019s been and, obviously, several catalysts in the back half, faster Card Services growth, better growth in Loyalty. What keeps you at this juncture from increasing the guidance? What could sort of worry you in terms of eating into this buffer that you built in?","Ed Heffernan","Too many years of doing this, I guess, is probably a good starting point. I think what we traditionally do, George, is we\u2019ll take a look at everything on the July call. And on the July call, if we see a continuation of what we expect to see, which is Card Services being strong and actually loss rates or the wedge closing and loss rates beginning to head downward again into the 5s, that will be check the box number one. If we see Epsilon continuing to deliver solid mid-single or higher growth rate, that check the box number two.","What we still need to check the box on is making sure we get all of our margin back at LoyaltyOne in the Canadian business. And we won\u2019t know that probably \u2013 we\u2019re on track \u2013 we\u2019re tracking to it, but we\u2019ll have a much better sense in July. So July is where we sort of say, okay, here\u2019s what we thought, here\u2019s where we are and what\u2019s it mean for the rest of the year and for 2018. So all we can say is it\u2019s a good start, but we\u2019ll talk again in July.","George Mihalos","Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. And then just as it relates to Epsilon, Charles, I know you\u2019re talking about revenue growth and EBITDA growth sort of converging at the 4% range for the full year. In the first quarter, revenues sort of outpaced EBITDA by 2 points. Just curious what drove that, if there\u2019s any anomaly there and why that would reverse over the course of the year.","Charles Horn","I\u2019ll tell you what I look at most, George, is what did payroll do. What did the fully burdened cost of payroll do? And it was up less than 6% in Q1 versus 7%. You always have some other operating expenses if you onboard a new program, such as the rollout of some new auto programs we have in place where you get some other expenses behind the scene ahead of it. But what you\u2019re really trying to do with the Epsilon model is always make sure the revenue growth rate is better than the payroll growth rate, and we definitely did that in the first quarter.","And I think that\u2019s really the trend we\u2019ll look to continue at the back half of the year. Like we said, we had a couple of new programs within the auto we\u2019re rolling out. We incur quite a bit of costs up front before they come functional, and that\u2019s part of the pressure why you didn\u2019t see a one-for-one flow-through. But really, it\u2019s the comparison of revenue to payroll that\u2019s relevant to us.","Ed Heffernan","Yes. And I think, just to follow up from Charles comment, look, we are not immune to the commentary that is out there regarding guidance we give on the Epsilon\/Conversant businesses and being disappointed the last couple years. So while we think we\u2019re in good shape and it\u2019s been a very nice start for Epsilon\/Conversant and it looks like the visibility is there, we want to be very disciplined in our guide as the year close out. We want to basically let the results get 2, 3 quarters in where we can finally say, okay, we\u2019re beginning to really reestablish the credibility that we \u2013 that frankly, I think, we lost some in the last couple years.","George Mihalos","Fair enough. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities.","Eric Wasserstrom","Thanks very much. I know we\u2019ve touched on this a couple of times, but I just want to circle back to the issue of the health of retailers, because several have not just indicated same-store sales comps, if I looking to restructure balance sheets and maybe just doing some of the things that signal the beginning of a broader decline. So can you just remind us how you deal with a potentially stressed partner and how that process works if they end up having to go into a bankruptcy process?","Ed Heffernan","Sure. To quote our fabulous President of Card Services, retail is not dead. Retail itself continues to grow, albeit a bit more modestly than it has in the past. But the overall category itself isn\u2019t dead. 85% of sales are still taking place in the store. What\u2019s happening is you\u2019re having a reallocation of where \u2013 of who is getting those sales. And as we talked about, with the splintering of sort of department stores into their individual brands creating their own e-commerce sites to the Amazons of the world and the Wayfairs of the world and everything else, you\u2019re seeing a redistribution take place, which is causing an upheaval.","So on an aggregate basis, the pie is still growing. On an individual basis, it remains to be seen who the winners and losers are going to be. That being said, to your point, you\u2019re dead on. There are a number of clients of ours who are being stressed right now. And traditionally, what happened in the past, as you mentioned, is that there\u2019s some type of prepackaged bankruptcy or something like that, that takes place.","Really, the last thing they want to do is shut down the sales pipeline. For us, you\u2019ll remember, we don\u2019t lose money if a retailer goes bankrupt. What we do lose, however, is we don\u2019t have that growth the following \u2013 we don\u2019t own that portfolio the following year. That just collects out. So from our perspective, the fewer that show stress, the better off we are. The more that shows stress, that just means we\u2019re going to have to pedal the bike a little bit harder with a couple more names in the pipeline than we had before, which, I think, is our go-forward approach, frankly, is we\u2019re going to need to sign another 2, 3 names a year above what we used to in the past to make up for that weakness. Fortunately, a lot of the marketing dollars continue to flow over to the data-driven marketing that we do. So you\u2019ve got a push-pull going on.","Charles Horn","Yes, the only thing I would add, and I think this is a very important piece, historically, when we\u2019ve had a retailer just basically go out of business, going through liquidation, the loss rates in that portfolio are no different than the overall portfolio experience. So to Ed\u2019s point, you lose the opportunity. They can\u2019t go on to the store and spend. But the good cardholder does not and of itself they\u2019re going to walk away from this account. I\u2019m going to charge it off and run the risk of basically cross-defaulting a different credit card. So our experience in the loss rate is basically similar to what the overall portfolio experience is.","Eric Wasserstrom","Thank, you anticipated my next question. And is there anyone in your portfolio, not by name, but are there any retailers that you\u2019re particularly concerned about at the moment and engaging in discussion on their outlook?","Charles Horn","I\u2019d say there\u2019s none in particular. We had two small retailers go into liquidation, but they\u2019re very small portfolios, really aren\u2019t affecting us. In terms of any material client, there\u2019s none that have given us any pause at this point.","Eric Wasserstrom","Thanks very much.","Operator","You\u2019re next question comes from the line of Moshe Katri with Wedbush Securities.","Moshe Katri","Hey, thanks. Thanks for taking my call. Guys, good performance on Epsilon. One of the things that I remember that we kind of struggled with besides the cost structure was actually re- competes for \u2013 especially with a couple of clients last year. Where are we on that front? And are there more large re-competes for Epsilon this year? Thanks.","Charles Horn","I\u2019d say, Moshe, I think that the three clients we lost last year midyear definitely affected us. They did shift to a little bit different model than what we\u2019re providing for them. As part of what Ed talked about, how we had to shift to a little bit more of a packaged product to lower the costs, lower pricing, what you have seen us do is as we\u2019ve had renewals since then, we had come down a little bit on the pricing. We had to offset it by lower operating costs primarily in parallel with our off-shoring to India. So we\u2019d say that base is stable. As Ed talked about before, we\u2019re expecting it to basically return to flat growth year-over-year probably as early as Q3.","So we think that we\u2019ve addressed the salient issues with the technology platforms. We\u2019ve not seen any further client attrition. And we think the changes we\u2019ve made have really put this back in place frankly to return it to a growth offering versus where it declined over the last three quarters.","Moshe Katri","Fair. And then given where we are on the cost structure of Epsilon, are you at this point feeling that you\u2019re competitive in this market? Because that was also an issue last year, especially in terms of pricing. Thanks.","Ed Heffernan","Yes, absolutely. We\u2019re now at the point where pricing \u2013 we are out there selling, and the pricing levels that we\u2019re at are deemed very competitive by the chief marketing officers versus an alternative like a SaaS-based and hiring 100 analysts. So we\u2019re there. We\u2019ve got the packaged solution in the pipe, and now it\u2019s execution. So we\u2019ve got a labor force structure for Epsilon\/Conversant which basically calls for, in total, a stable headcount in the United States and then somewhat growing at our India office. But most of the surgery is over at this point.","Moshe Katri","All right, guys thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ramsey El-Assal with Jefferies.","Ramsey El-Assal","[Audio Dip] is on the Tech Platform side. Also, your Epsilon business. How material is the difference in economics that you guys capture for the SaaS implementation versus the fully outsourced model? And do you have any visibility as to how that mix is evolving with your new kind of more nimble offerings?","Charles Horn","I\u2019d say, Ramsey, it\u2019s a little bit early. We\u2019re just now introducing the packaged offering to the market. I would expect that \u2013 the EBITDA margins to be fairly consistent with the full service, maybe down a little bit. But it\u2019s too early for us to really know what the answer is going to be there.","Ramsey El-Assal","Okay. Could you give us a little more granularity on the cadence of BrandLoyalty revenue this year? Do you have visibility as to whether there will be a quarter later in the year where that business just really pops like it has in the past? Or is it something more and it\u2019s just going to fall at some point, you\u2019re just not \u2013 quite have that kind of visibility to it yet.","Charles Horn","Q3, Q4.","Ramsey El-Assal","Yes.","Charles Horn","Both would be strong.","Ed Heffernan","And Q4 is always the strongest for BrandLoyalty.","Ramsey El-Assal","Okay. All right, fair enough. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jason Deleeuw with Piper Jaffray.","Jason Deleeuw","Thanks and good morning. Just hoping to get a little bit more color on the OpEx leverage in Card Services, just kind of the drivers there. And can we expect this to be a sustainable level?","Charles Horn","Obviously, Q1, it was extremely good. I don\u2019t expect it to be quite that good for the full year. As Ed talked about, probably 20, 30 basis points versus a very strong start to the year. I\u2019d say it\u2019s coming from pretty much all angles. So it\u2019s the growth in the portfolio. Obviously, it\u2019s the influence of co-brand that we put in there over the last few years, which has a little bit lower OpEx. But it gets into the way we do collection activities, whether we source within our own operations or we allow people to work from home.","I would say there\u2019s really no one silver bullet. It\u2019s a combination of different factors that really allowing us to drive that operating leverage.","Jason Deleeuw","Great. Thanks for that. And then just following up on the other discussion around how retail the landscape is evolving more e-commerce, maybe different players, maybe a bigger addressable market for you guys. Is that just simply a Card Services, Private Label offering? Or is that also open up opportunities for Epsilon? Like how do you think about those opportunities as the retail space continues to evolve?","Ed Heffernan","Yes, it\u2019s a good question. It\u2019s Ed. The biggest opportunity within the Epsilon\/Conversant family is actually over on the Conversant side, the CRM product, which, as you know, is when we\u2019re out there, we use all the data from the SKU level information and the various demographic, psychographic information about the customers. And we can reach out and touch you across device multiple times every single day and do it in a very targeted, personalized basis because we do have the ability to identify your own unique device.","And so from a retailer perspective, that is becoming sort of almost table stakes at this point that they have to participate in that. And that\u2019s something that is one of the reasons where CRM this quarter grew what, Charles, 40%?","Charles Horn","47%.","Ed Heffernan","47%. Retail is going to be a huge growth driver for that as the retailers are shifting toward identifying their customers and offering them a different deal depending upon who they are. It\u2019s almost like pricing airline seats \u2013 everyone has a different price \u2013 and then also using sort of that anonymized profile to then go out and prospect and find new customers. So the net result of all of it is that the way marketing was done in the past has changing \u2013 in the retail space, it\u2019s changing even faster, which fortunately means that our type of product is pretty attractive.","Jason Deleeuw","Great, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust.","Andrew Jeffrey","Thanks for taking the question. Lots of talk about retailer health and same-store sales and changing consumer behavior. Ed, can you just address how big that you think the TAM is for Card Services, how penetrated you are, and whether the market has changed in a meaningful way, either having expanded or contracted over the years?","Ed Heffernan","Sure. I think \u2013 and clearly, I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll find anyone out there who thinks we need more stores. I think we\u2019ve all realized that we\u2019ve been \u2013 it\u2019s been overbuilt and needs to come down to reality. But again, the overall market for retail is a growing market, again not quite as fast as it used to be, but it is growing. You have different players shifting. In terms of the TAM from our perspective, we believe that we are roughly half-way through what we believe is our comfortable sandbox.","So if you think of $15 billion, $16 billion portfolio as roughly half penetrated, that would be about right. I think we\u2019re probably \u2013 the last cut I saw, if you included e-commerce \u2013 sorry, pure e-commerce players, would be \u2013 we think overall, our sandbox is about a $35 billion portfolio. And so the delta between where we are today and where we\u2019re going surprisingly is not filled by a bunch of folks who have an existing program.","A lot of these folks are just now beginning to shift their dollars away from the traditional marketing spend channels and into \u2013 really getting into the personalized one-to-one data driven targeted marketing. And, we all think that everyone has already done all that, and the answer is they haven\u2019t. It\u2019s a trend that\u2019s well under way, but there\u2019s a long, long way to go. And based on our pipeline, we feel comfortable that our sandbox is certainly not shrinking and perhaps growing just a little bit more.","If you think about some of the folks that weren\u2019t in our sandbox had these massive $5 billion, $6 billion, $8 billion files, which frankly were too big for us, but if those are some of these massive department stores where you have the name brands within those stores now cutting out on their own to become e-commerce players, they\u2019re much smaller and more bite-sized, and we excel at bite-sized.","Andrew Jeffrey","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks. And then when you look at \u2013 I think you said about 47% CRM revenue growth in the first quarter.","Ed Heffernan","Yes.","Andrew Jeffrey","That\u2019s pretty encouraging. Can you talk a little bit about the pipeline and how much of continued growth in that business is coming from existing customers taking share within their marketing budgets versus new customers signing?","Charles Horn","Sure. You\u2019re going down the right area, which is the way that CRM signings work is almost like a vintage, where in the first year you\u2019ll sign a group that maybe they do $50 million of revenue first year, $75 million second year, $100 million third year, and we are definitely benefiting at the same time that we are definitely benefiting from new clients. Last year, we added about 33 new clients with CRM. This year, it could be an estimate as high as 50. So it\u2019s the combination of both the ability to leverage a new client for three to four years, get revenue growth, plus we\u2019re continuing to onboard new clients as people see \u2013 companies see the value of the proposition we bring.","Ed Heffernan","Yes, it\u2019s a pretty cool business in the sense of much like the card business, it\u2019s \u2013 you have clients that spool up over two to three year periods. So you can \u2013 you build these vintages, and so you can have pretty good visibility into the next year or two based upon the number of client signings. But for sure, existing clients are spending more and the market for new clients is getting deeper.","Andrew Jeffrey","Terrific. Thank you.","Ed Heffernan","All right, one more.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Ashish Sabadra with Deutsche Bank.","Ashish Sabadra","Thanks for taking my question. Congrats, I really saw the results. Quick question on gross yield expansion. I understand you benefit from higher interest rate, but we saw some pretty solid growth there. I was just wondering what drove that. And how should we think about it through the rest of the year?","Charles Horn","The way we look at it, Ashish, we knew that we had a little pressure early in 2016 that will play through starting this year at 25.5% gross yield is consistent with the average we had last year. So we would tell you there could be a little positivity to it based upon, obviously, any changes with the Fed raising rates and so forth. It could pass a little bit through to gross yield. The thing that always creates noise within your gross yields is if you do find a bulk file and you acquire it, it puts temporary pressure. So there\u2019s a lot of moving parts. But we would say steady state. 25.5% feels good for the year. It could up maybe 10, 20 basis points given further interest rate increases coming through.","But really, it goes back to mid-2015. If you remember, we\u2019ve put some changes in place that were cardholder friendly. We had to burn through those issues in the temporary pressure we put. And we would tell you at this point, we\u2019re past that.","Ashish Sabadra","That\u2019s great. Maybe one quick follow-up would be just the free cash flow expectations for this year. And how do you think about the capital allocation through the rest of the year?","Ed Heffernan","Yes, Charles can hit the free cash flow. I think from an allocation, I\u2019m going down the spending side of it. Certainly, we instituted a dividend, which is couple $100 million. Then you\u2019ve got buyback. We\u2019ve had authorization for $500 million. Obviously, we had the opportunity to go back to the well if we so choose. So at a minimum, that gets you to $700 million. There\u2019s probably $400 million or so we\u2019re setting aside for growth, the capital required to grow to $2.5 billion.","If I\u2019m doing my math right about $1.1 billion or so. And then that leaves a little room for either maybe a tuck-in deal if there\u2019s something attractive by the end of the year. We\u2019re not going to do anything until we\u2019re sure that all three businesses are \u2013 have executed and are all contributing and the balance has been restored. So that would be one thing. It wouldn\u2019t be until late in the year. Or we could certainly go back to the well for additional buyback if we so choose. So I think that would chew up. The goal is to basically get through the free cash flow. But trying to keep the leverage multiple under three, which is what we traditionally do. So Charles?","Charles Horn","No, nothing to add to that.","Ashish Sabadra","That\u2019s great. Thank you.","Ed Heffernan","All right. Well, thank you, everyone. And we kept it exactly to an hour, and we\u2019ll talk to you again in a few months. Bye.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s conference call you may now disconnect."],"1204":["Alliance Data Systems (NYSE:ADS) Q2 2013 Earnings Call July 30, 2013  8:30 AM ET","Executives","Amy Pesante","Edward J.

[Operator Instructions] And it's now my pleasure to introduce your host, Ms. Amy Pesante of FTI Consulting. Ma'am, the floor is yours.","Amy Pesante","Thank you, Kayla. By now, you should have received a copy of the company's second quarter 2013 earnings release. If you haven't, please call FTI Consulting at (212) 850-5721.","On the call today, we have Ed Heffernan, President and Chief Executive Officer; Charles Horn, Chief Financial Officer of Alliance Data; and Bryan Kennedy, Executive Vice President and President of Epsilon and Alliance Data Company.","Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on today's call and some of the responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risks and the uncertainties described in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC. Alliance Data has no obligation to update the information presented on the call.","Also, on today's call, our speakers will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe will provide useful information for investors. Reconciliation of those measures to GAAP will be posted on the Investor Relations website at www.alliancedata.com.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Ed Heffernan. Ed?","Edward J. Heffernan","Great. Thanks, Amy. And everyone, welcome to our 49th edition of quarterly earnings as a public company. And as mentioned, joining me today is the always engaging Charles Horn, our CFO; and also our always insightful Bryan Kennedy, our President of Epsilon. Charles is going to first discuss our consolidated result, LoyaltyOne, Private Label, Bryan will walk you through Epsilon and then I'll wrap up by discussing our updated guidance and outlook for the balance of '13, as well as our thoughts as we take a look at 2014. Charles?","Charles L. Horn","Thanks, Ed. Alliance Data continued to beat expectations with revenue, again, topping the $1 billion mark, aided by 7% organic growth and adjusted EBITDA increasing double digits to $338 million. Both Private Label and Epsilon contributed to high double-digit increases in both revenue and adjusted EBITDA for the quarter, while LoyaltyOne faced revenue headwinds due to unfavorable FX rates and reduced redemption activity, but still managed to increase adjusted EBITDA by 9% versus last year.","Core EPS beat guidance by $0.16, increasing to $2.41 for the second quarter of 2013, up 13% compared to last year; while net income per diluted share increased to $1.71, up 5% compared to last year. Core EPS for the second quarter of 2013 included a $0.03 benefit from the release of previously reserved tax liability.","Diluted share count increased 4.4 million to 68.2 million versus Q2 2013 due to incremental dilution from convertible notes. Approximately half of the share increase was related to our phantom shares, which are shares we never have to economically settle. And convertible note warrants, which we do have to economically settle, accounted for the remaining half of the increase.","Starting in the third quarter of 2013 and continuing through the second quarter of 2014, we should benefit from a declining share count as our convertible notes mature and the related phantom shares vanish.","Let's move to the individual business segments, starting with Epsilon. With that, I will turn it over to Bryan Kennedy.","Bryan J. Kennedy","All right, great. Thanks, Charles. Epsilon surpassed expectations again this quarter with 41% top line growth, 30% bottom line growth. Organically, we achieved 9% top line and 11% bottom line growth compared to the second quarter of 2012. So I have to say, it's nice to see high single-digit organic revenue growth again.","Breaking down the individual businesses. First, on technology, revenue was up 1% compared to last year, but is showing signs of accelerating revenue growth, especially in database, which is trending towards double-digit growth in the back half of the year. The \"slow to grow\" trend we saw last year is behind us as key wins in 2013, so far, along with a very strong backlog, support accelerated growth through the rest of the year.","Additionally, there's a lot of optimism around the positive response with the launch of our new email platform, which we believe will help alleviate some softness in the digital product offering. And that rollout is still scheduled for Q3 of this year, with the P&L impact primarily occurring in 2014.","On the data front, revenue was essentially flat with prior year. Notable, our online survey offering continues to exceed expectations as it emerges post restructure in very good form, but it's being mitigated by overall continued softness in the consumer demographic data offerings.","And then finally, on the agency front, agency continued to outperform this quarter, increasing revenue 115% to $179 million. And if you exclude HMI, organic revenue growth is about 25%. So agencies record of converting pipeline items in the key wins has really nicely positioned Epsilon to meet full year growth expectations, as well as negate any potential softness in the back half of 2013. HMI has also been expanding their vertical footprint and adding depth to the current product offering with a variety of innovative new offerings as part of Epsilon.","Overall, pipeline remains very strong across the business, especially in agency and database, and we continue to expand relationships with clients like AT&T, who recently signed a multi-year renewal with us, while onboarding new clients like Dunkin' Donuts, where we are engaged recently to drive technology for their new loyalty program called the DD Perks program.","Stepping back, the strategy of selling a full suite of integrated service offerings across our client base continues to pay dividends for Epsilon. The first half of the year, fueled by double-digit increase in customer wins and verbal commitments, has given us the momentum needed to stay on track for high single-digit organic growth by the end of the year. And as we actively ramp up for this year's top line growth, cost containment efforts are also being directed towards actively managing our bottom line growth. This proactive approach, coupled with last year's restructuring efforts, are really setting the stage nicely for steady continued momentum into 2014.","So that's Epsilon. With that, I'll turn it back to Charles for LoyaltyOne.","Charles L. Horn","Thanks, Bryan. Let's flip to the LoyaltyOne slide real quick and what you'll see is similar to the first quarter. LoyaltyOne's revenue declined 4% for quarter due to headwinds from a 9% decrease in miles redeemed and the 1% drag from a softening Canadian dollar. Despite this currency weakness, we expect full year revenue growth to be in the low single-digit range as we anniversary the highest wins comps that we saw in the last half of last year.","Adjusted EBITDA increased 9% compared to the prior year despite unfavorable Canadian exchange rates, which we reduced adjusted EBITDA by approximately $1 million. A combination of operating leverage and the $3 million reduction in losses associated with our international expansion efforts drove a 400 basis point improvement in EBITDA margin for quarter.","As expected, miles issued for the second quarter remained light, due to softness with our credit card sponsors and the timing of promotional spending. We expect to ramp up from these sponsors added during the first half of 2013, coupled with promotional spending by several of our top sponsors, will stimulate issuance growth in the back half of 2013. For the year, we are striving for a 3% to 5% increase in miles issued compared to 2012.","The residual effects from the run on the bank, which occurred last year as consumers responded to the announcement of expiration policy, were felt during the quarter, as miles redeemed dropped 9% versus the prior year. This impact had dissipated by the third quarter of 2012, so we should see a slight increase in miles redeemed during the back half of 2013, which should drive revenue growth.","2013 continues to be a record year for new signings as we added Irving Oil and Eastlink as sponsors during the quarter. Both are key wins as Irving Oil deepens our reach within the high-value, high-frequency spend category and Eastlink grows our presence in the telecoms sector.","Turning to our dotz joint venture in Brazil. Our focus continues to be on market expansion. dotz now has 8 million members, up over 170% last year. It is on track for 10 million collectors by year end. In addition, we are looking to add 4 new markets during the back half of 2013, bringing the total accounts to 9.","Let's flip to the next page and talk about Private Label. Private Label continues to excel with the revenue up 19% and adjusted EBITDA net of funding costs up 13%, driven by 27% increase in average card receivables. The growth was balanced, it's approximately 16% of the AR growth which is organic and by 11% acquired.","Gross yields dropped to 110 basis points during the quarter, primarily due to the onboarding of new programs over the last 12 months. Some of this compression was mitigated by a 30 basis point improvement in principle charge-off rates and a 30 basis point improvement in our portfolio funding costs. The end result is approximately a 50 basis point decline in that spreads versus last year.","Loss rates continues to be at historically low levels and it feels like we have likely bottomed. As such, we should see a more normal seasonal trend on a go-forward basis, basically meaning, the rates should be up in Q1, down in Q2, down in Q3, which should be the low point, and then up again in Q4.","During the quarter, we continued to lock in long-term competitive financing rates by issuing $500 million of new 3-year term asset-backed securities below a 1% coupon. Cost of funding, expressed as a percentage of average card receivables, was approximately 1.8% for the quarter. We will talk more about our funding strategy on the next slide.","Before we do so, we need to talk about the continued success and the onboarding of new programs within our new Private Label operation. 2012 was a record year for Alliance Data in terms of new signings, but we are in a pace in 2013 to potentially exceed it. Just halfway through the year, our new signings should ask about $1 billion in steady-state card receivables as the programs ramp up over the next 3 years.","Let's flip to the next page. As you can see in the debt maturity schedule, we tend to be fairly conservative in our funding approach, giving up some rates for longer-term certainly. Currently, 83% of our funding is fixed with the duration slightly over 36 months. What that means is in a rising rate environment, this approach should be beneficial to us. Or as Ed would say, we should receive a kiss to earnings in a rising rate environment.","Why? Simply, if you look at the slide, we are asset positive in Private Label. The APRs on our cards are variable rate, tied to prime rate plus an adder. In a normal royalty rate environment, prime rate should increase in conjunction with key rates such as fed funds. An increase in prime rate would raise the variable APR in the very next billing cycle.","Conversely, on the funding side, you can see from the chart that we have staggered out maturities until 2020, meaning that we will stair step increase in funding costs. Until the increase is fully burned in, we should see a slight increase in our net interest margin.","I've been asked many times over the last month, what if only long term rates go up and your APRs don't reset? The answer is pretty simple. As the debt matures, we go shorter on the o-curve, minimizing any impact our net interest margin. Essentially, we move closer to a matched book.","Let's turn to the next page and look at our liquidity. Liquidity for Alliance Data remains very strong at about $5 billion as of June 30, 2013. Breaking down our liquidity further, at the corporate level, liquidity remains strong at $1.7 billion, of which approximately $750 million is cash on hand as of June 30, 2013. Our corporate leverage ratio of 2.2x remains well below our maximum leverage covenant of about 3.5x.","Subsequent to quarter end, we entered into a new credit facility, which increased corporate liquidity to approximately $2.1 billion. Approximately $770 million will be used to repay the convertible notes coming due August 1, 2013, leaving over $1.3 billion to execute our capital allocation plans.","At the bank level, there's approximately $3.3 billion of available liquidity as of June 30, 2013. During the quarter, one of our Master Trusts issued $500 million of fixed rate, term asset-backed securities. The fixed-rate coupon of 0.91% is the lowest coupon ever achieved for any duration in Alliance Data's 17 years of capital marketing issuance.","Also during the quarter, ADS renewed its $350 million trust for a conduit. We continued to take advantage of this low interest rate environment by extending maturities and adding liquidity as we execute our strategy of building long-term visibility into our earnings.","During the quarter, our 2 banks paid $82.5 million in dividends to the ADS parent, while maintaining strong regulatory ratios. As of June 30, 2013, community banks' regulatory ratios were substantially above minimum well-capitalized levels and are basically the highest in the card industry.","Lastly, we continued to use our share repurchase program to take advantage of market opportunities during the quarter, spending over $150 million. For the first half of 2013, we've spent $208 million of our $400 million authorization.","With that, I will turn it over to Ed for an update on 2013 guidance and the business outlook before we open up the call up for questions. Ed?","Edward J. Heffernan","All right. Thanks, Charles. I want to move to the page titled New Guidance. And I guess, at a very high level, we're raising -- bumping up the -- all of our key metrics from where they were before revenue. We're bumping up a little bit and we're looking at about 17% revenue growth versus prior year.","The thing that I focus on is organic growth. And in this environment of really sluggish GDP growth and hard-to-get organic top line, our goal is to run organic growth about 3x real GDP. Right now, organic growth is actually running above that. We're running at about 8%. We think, on a full year basis, again, it's probably a 2% or less real GDP number. So it's a very strong showing on the organic growth on the top line. So far, so good there.","On core earnings, also we're looking to do about 17% increase, which is up from prior guidance. And the core EPS is going to be up a little bit less than that, about 13% to $9.85. We've bumped it up $0.10 from the prior guidance. And we are inching our way towards the $10 mark as the year unfolds. But for now, we'll keep it at $9.85, up in the low teens.","Economic EPS, obviously, is coming in around $11.28, that's when you exclude the phantoms. So overall, the way things are flowing out, it's pretty nice. I think that we had good core earnings in the low double digits through the first half of the year. We ran into the headwinds of actually higher share count in the first half of the year that dissipates in Q3. And then in Q4, you're going to have this nice earnings increase, but you're also going to have finally a share count that is down versus Q4 of last year. And that, when you combine the 2, essentially is what we call our slingshot as we exit 2013 and move into '14, where that slingshot should continue throughout the year.","Turning next to business outlook. I'm going to talk a little bit about the rest of '13. And then I think, probably as importantly, or more importantly, how we're looking, how we're shaping up for 2014. Obviously, we'll start with LoyaltyOne and AIR MILES.","I would say, if there was a one weak spot that the business is seeing so far this year, it's the key metric of miles issued, which is certainly soft during the first half of this year. We do, however, as we've been saying, expect a very strong bounce in the second half and we can get into what's driving that during Q&A if you want. But it's primarily driven by the spool up of the big new sponsors that have been signed this year. It's been a very strong year for new sponsor signings. They're cranking up.","And then we have definitely gotten some commitments in terms of big promo spending in the back half, especially from our financial institution partners, as they're looking to grow spending on their cards. So I think that this metric should turn very nicely in the second half and -- but that's something that we are clearly, keeping our eye on.","As we talked about, I'd say the high point for LoyaltyOne or AIR MILES so far this year has been, it's been a very strong year for big new sponsors signings. GM, Staples, Irving Oil and EastLink on the telecoms side. We usually do about 2 big signings a year. This year, we're looking at 4, there may be 1 or 2 more out there as well as the year unfolds. So that's very, very good news going forward, in terms of our issuance metric.","Turning to Brazil. It continues to grow and grow quickly. Members are up to 8 million, which is up 170% from 3 million a year ago. We're hoping and expect to get to 10 million folks by the end of the year. Again, how -- the question being asked is how do we compare that to our Canadian business? And a good rule of thumb that Charles and I use would be, we would need about probably 25 million enrolled to roughly equate to the Canadian program, where we have 10 million households enrolled. So that's what we're shooting for, and if we could end of this year at the 10 million, that would be superb.","Full year organic revenue growth will be a couple of points when you include Brazil. And the grow over that Charles talked about from the run on the bank in 2012 is really driving flattish revenues. We'll get a couple of points, as we said, from Brazil that's not in our numbers, obviously. But we're going to put it off to the side here and let you know how things are going. What is a big plus is the organic growth in EBITDA is very nicely running in the high-single digits, which is what we'd like to see as it did last year as well.","So turning to 2014. What's key? What do we need to see? We need to get that issuance turn strongly in the back half. And again, our financial institutions partners had committed to some big promos. We've got the big new sponsor ramps. The watch that's going on right now is the Canadian consumer.","Specifically, the Canadian consumer is running at very high debt levels in terms of debt to income. And the concern is that there's a housing bubble up there. What we are seeing is, in fact, that the debt levels, while high, have not turned into a route in the housing market. And in fact, the housing price increases have been moderating over the past quarter or 2. So we think the Canadian consumer is stretched, but probably not overly so.","Brazil, as we've talked about, we're in the midst of a multi-year landgrab, so to speak, which is essentially pushing as hard as we can to get as many collectors sign up and onboard as quickly as possible. And that is going to be the focus for the next couple of years.","Overall, if I were to sum up LoyaltyOne, clearly, the one area we're watching is miles issued. We want to make sure that, that turns smartly in the second half. Against that, we have probably the big pluses of the big new sponsors. Organic cash flow growth, that's in the high-single digits. We have margin expansion that's up 200 basis points and Brazil seems to be growing nicely. So I think that's about it for the LoyaltyOne.","When we turn to Epsilon, I think Bryan did a nice job covering it, which is good since he runs the division. The division will obviously cycle differently, depending on the various areas within it. And I think the thing that is most comforting at this point is we've seen a 12-point swing in the organic growth number from minus 3% towards the latter part of last year to plus 9% so far this year. So that's very, very encouraging.","He talked about the book of business being exceptionally strong. We've never seen it this strong. So that's good news. I think that, again, looking for what could go wrong as we move into '14 or what we're watching, I think overall, we can say that the pivot that we made to digital agency, starting a couple of years ago with Aspen and then HMI, it's certainly beginning to pay off big time for us. Having a digital agency leading our overall offering is driving our organic growth. And now what we're beginning to see is it's pulling through some very large commitments on the technology side and database sides. So we're going to see some big nums on the database build side as we go into the back half of this year and going into next year. So that's very good to see.","What are we watching? Probably 2 things. One is, as Bryan mentioned, the rollout of our new digital email platform and that's called Harmony. And so far, the initial reviews have been very positive, but we want to make sure we have an extremely strong rollout as we go into '14 and make sure that we're considered best of breed in the marketplace. And then second, obviously, with the huge overall growth at Epsilon, obviously, making sure that we onboard and don't stumble when we bring on the these big new clients is of paramount importance at this point.","Okay, let's turn a little bit now to Private Label. Obviously, Private Label is -- it's certainly continuing on with record signings and we talk in vintages here, which means that when we talk about the 2013 vintage, that means if we were to take those clients that we signed in 2013 and then most of them are starting from scratch, some of them are existing programs. But we look out 3 years and say, \"Okay, will this vintage ramp up to about $1 billion of incremental new business for ADS?\" And we did $1 billion in the 2012 vintage for the first time since I've been here. And this year, so far, as Charles mentioned, we have signed the $1 billion for 2013.","I will say that there are a number of deals that have been signed that you will see released over the next, I guess, quarter. And I think that it is safe to say that this year, rather than the $ 1 billion vintage, we are probably looking at closer to $2 billion. That's how strong it is out in the marketplace. It is absolutely unreal, the amount of interest that we're having in this data-driven target marketing product that we call Private Label. So very, very strong and hopefully, this is a trend that will continue for quite some time.","What's behind it? Again, it continues to be this huge desire on the part of the retailer to link category or SKU transactional data with an individual consumer. And what's driving a lot of that is the fact that it's very, very hard, obviously, to get the consumer in the door and spend. And what we try to do is we try to make sure that we can offer up an appropriate message or an appropriate offer for each individual consumer.","It's something that has grown in sophistication as we layer in demographic and psychographic information on top of transactional information. And it is, as we said, very compelling when you link it to the ability to communicate through what we call our omni-channel approach, which is everything from direct marketing -- I'm sorry, direct mail to permission-based email, mobile, social, targeted display, whatever it may be.","Okay, funding. As Charles talked about, it's mainly locked down. Credit quality is very stable, call it 5%. We are not seeing anything out there and we have a good view through delinquency flows through the end of this year and the beginning of next year. There is nothing out there that suggests that there's -- that it's going up or is going down. So I think what we're looking at here is you've got funding locked down, you've got credit quality relative -- essentially stable, and so growth is going to be coming from top line.","Overall, full year organic growth, we're looking at about 10%, which is about 2\/3 of our total. And if you look at Q2, we talked about roughly 12% organic growth versus a card market that is essentially flat. And we get the question over and over again of why is the organic growth so strong? Why is it growing so quickly? What's very interesting that were seeing is it's less about new accounts flowing in the door when it comes to the organic side because that plays in later. It's more about our growing tender share within our existing client base and new client base.","Essentially, over the last quarter, we have picked up tender share of almost 100 basis points, meaning that traditionally, if 26% of all the dollars that are being spent at the retailer flow onto our card, now it's 27%. It may not sound like a lot, but it's big numbers when it comes to organic growth. You throw in the new ramp ups and that's where you're going to get, 12% organic growth.","And what we're trying to do with the retailer is we found that it's extremely profitable for the retailer to spend a little less time about just driving new accounts in the door and more about activating the inactive or low active accounts. And that's all through these loyalty programs, which is called triggered marketing. And so very simply put, it could be someone who hasn't been shopping all that much at the store. We notice that and we communicate with her and let her know that \"Hey, you're only $30 away from the next award here,\" and we send out that little communication or we send out a coupon or something like that. And what you do is you trigger a reaction and it's extremely, extremely profitable for the retailer.","Basically, it's all about timing, messaging and merchandising, and that's where we are today. So I think overall, we're in very good shape when it comes to Private Label for '13 and for '14. It's a little early for '15, but '14 certainly looks quite strong.","Consolidated. At the consolidated level, we're looking at high single-digit organic top line growth, greater than 3x for GDP. Again, we talked about roughly 12-ish percent for Private Label, 9-ish percent for Epsilon. If you adjust for FX, it's probably relatively flat for LoyaltyOne. And overall, that should give you about 8% organic growth for the year.","I think as we move ahead into 2014, we talk about what exactly are we worrying about right now at the Private Label. Obviously, the credit sales looks strong. Portfolio growth is strong, funding is fixed, losses are flat. I think Private Label is in good shape for next year. Epsilon, what we're looking for is a bit of a cycling where the big, big database builds start ramping up heavily in Q3 of next year, which will drive a lot of the organic growth as we go into '14, which is kind of nice. It takes the pressure off of the digital agency piece a little bit. But overall, Epsilon should be in very good shape for '14.","In Canada, obviously, we are looking for a turn on the miles issued. Our focus is making sure that key metric turns for 2014, and it's a little bit of a wait and see at this point until we actually bring in the numbers in Q3 and Q4 of this year.","In Brazil, as we talked about, we're going as hard as we can to ramp up. We've gone from no collectors to less than 2 million to 6 million last year, hopefully, 10 million this year. We own 37% of this entity. It's obviously very appealing to us. We're looking at double-digit free cash flow for next year. And then sort of the nice kiss that we get is our share count is going to drop off quite dramatically going from 66 million shares to closer to 59 million. So if you just do simple math, which is if earnings in general grow 10% and your share count is going down by 10%, that suggests that you're going to have pretty nice earnings per share growth of 20% plus.","So we feel pretty good about the rest of this year. We feel pretty good about next year. Our goal is to be 7% to 8% organic for next year, double-digit core earnings for next year and as we said, with the lower share count, you're going to have a slingshot on earnings per share.","That's it. Why don't we open it up for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","In the press release that international expansion is something that you're looking at, could you just talk about what exactly you're looking for within Loyalty and Epsilon, especially within loyalty, because you guys just talk about the fact that you might take -- not take up the ownership in Brazil?","Edward J. Heffernan","Sure. On the international side, I think that the LoyaltyOne group up there is well positioned from a management and organizational perspective that they can handle a little bit more. And so we are casting our net for other Loyalty-like programs outside of Canada and Brazil. And there are a handful of attractive ones as we look out in places such as Europe or the Far East. So if we could establish a Loyalty program elsewhere, then we'd certainly like to do that. Probably the best way to get in is through M&A. And again, not saying it's going to happen, but that's something we're looking at. Here in the States, we think the pricing on some of these deals are just nuts. So we're going to stay away from that for now. We're not going get in the middle of these pricing wars that are going on. But there are opportunities out there. I think Epsilon will probably focus entirely on organic growth for the next year. It has more than it can handle in terms of new wins and verbal agreements, so they're going to stick pretty close to their knitting over the next year. And as far as Brazil goes, again, we don't want to upset the apple cart down there. So as far as we're concerned, it's basically go as hard as they can to drive this landgrab that's going on.","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","So just -- and in terms of Brazil, not taking up the ownership, does that change your view of the growth potential there and the ability for Banco do Brasil to renew?","Edward J. Heffernan","No, what we need is -- it's a question of what is Banco going to do. Hopefully, we will have that completely resolved as the end of the year approaches. I don't think we're all that concerned about whether they're going to renew or not. It's a question of, are we looking at an extension or renewal? We don't really know right now, Sanjay. But our focus is entirely on getting that core base customers from 8 million to 10 million to 15 million to 20 million, and not distract management within some type of other financial transaction right now. So when the time is right, we'll be stepping in. And we'll see if we can't get something done there that's attractive to both sides, but right now, all eyes are on the landgrab.","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And one final question for Bryan. I guess the big announcement in the marketing world was the merger of Publicis and Omnicom. I was just wondering if there were any implications as far as that Epsilon is considered.","Bryan A. Pearson","Yes. Sure, Sanjay. I mean, I don't see any immediate or even long-term significant implications for us. I think, from my perspective, the fact that a merger that size happened just validates the thesis that we've been pursuing for the past several years, which is there's a sea change in the world of advertising and data and technology and analytics is really what's driving the future of this industry. I think we've been way out ahead of that with our strategy and with operation pivot, and are well down the path with our own integration of all those kinds of capabilities. So it'll be interesting to see where that one goes, but other than maybe some disruption that creates some opportunities for us from a growth perspective, I don't see any major impact on us.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Carcache with Nomura.","Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","I wanted to kind of go back to some of your comments on tender share and you threw out 26% as an example. Is that kind of a reasonable level to think about traditionally that now, it's up 100 basis points to 27%. I guess I was hoping you can kind of give a little bit of additional perspective around that? How long does it typically take to get there? I guess, maybe what's the high? How high could it go overall? Maybe just some commentary around that. And maybe how also it differs by vertical, furniture, electronics, apparel, home products, et cetera.","Edward J. Heffernan","Sure, you bet. Yes, I mean, it's one of these trends that, frankly, it's really beginning to pick up. We have programs where we have tender share in the high 40s. So 45%, almost 50% are half of all the money spent that the retailer has put on our card. And obviously, we have a number of programs that are below that and others that are ramping back up. But I think a tender share of around roughly 30% is something that's extremely comfortable. We are at about 27% today and we can grow these programs to about 40% as we work on them throughout the year. What we are seeing, which is very different from past years, is what we talked about in terms of the focus on getting the less active or virtually inactive accounts back into the game. And in the past, we didn't have all the tools that we have today. So a lot of this stuff is focusing around retention. And right, there's 2 ways to grow. You can just chunk in a bunch of new accounts to the front end, but you're going to have folks going inactive in the back end and hopefully, net-net, you're up. What we're seeing is, yes, we're bringing in the accounts on the front end, but we're doing a much under job of keeping our shopper interested on the back end, so that she is more willing to come in, let's say just one extra time per year or make one additional online purchase. And a lot of that is focused around the data and the ability to identify all these micro-segments. We will then do all this trigger marketing as I talked about. You're only 30 bucks away from the next reward. You bought these pants. How about you try this top and we'll give you something off? So it's one of those things that if we can drive tender share, you're talking probably 8 points of organic growth just coming from driving your tender share up a little bit. So that's where we're going. Obviously, the big, big drivers of our tender share growth would be in our more traditional areas, such as soft goods. But also, furniture and jewelry are also very big in terms of very strong tender share.","Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","That's really helpful. Switching gears, you guys had -- I think you said 12% of the increase in your credit sales came from higher core cardholder spending. Can you relate for us how much of the strength in your credit card sales volume growth is really kind of tied to wealth effects that kind of -- I hadn't really heard you guys talk about wealth affects as being much -- or I guess, specifically being a driver, but I wondered if you could comment to what extent you see that specifically in your customer base.","Edward J. Heffernan","Yes. I mean, it's a good question. I think it's more of an incremental benefit, Bill. I think we talked about -- of our revenue, 2\/3 of our revenue or 12% was coming from this organic growth that we talked about, the other 1\/3 from the acquired side. And on the organic growth side, what we're seeing is that our shopper, she is not going nuts in terms of huge increases and spending. We're seeing our average card balance probably going up 5% or 6% for the year, which is not a huge number when you're talking about a $450 balance. So what we're seeing from the consumer side is a continuation of the last couple of years of elevated payment rates, meaning that she is shopping, but she is paying off a big chunk every month and a very moderate increase in balance size, probably going from $450 to probably $480, $490. So we're seeing a lot of discipline out there. What we are seeing also is that we are beginning to see the start of those folks who had challenges during the great recession. It has taken now almost 4 years for them to get back in the game in terms of being really attractive to us from a credit perspective. And so that also is the new trend that's beginning to cycle in.","Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","That's great. And finally, if I may, one for Charles. Charles, can you try to square the commentary you guys had in the release about there being a moderate provision build this quarter? But from looking at the monthly credit data that you guys put out, it looks like there's -- there were $80 million -- about $80 million of charge-offs during the quarter and you had a $58 million provision, so that it would seem to imply a release, but you guys said there was a build. Can you help me understand what I'm missing there?","Charles L. Horn","It's on a year-over-year basis, Bill. If you look at our reserves Q2 last year, it was $432 million. This year, at the end of Q2, $448 million. So it's [indiscernible] for the reserve build.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Darrin Peller with Barclays.","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Let me just start off on the Private Label side. The portfolio yields, it seems like overall, this business is obviously performing extremely well. But even with that said, it's probably underperforming in some regard, given that the portfolio yields continued to be negatively impacted by some of these new portfolios you're onboarding. So I think Charles, I think you mentioned this -- you've mentioned in the past that it could improve over time. When do you expect the portfolios to actually generate yields that are more in line with ADS' core portfolio? And what are the key factors that would drive that?","Charles L. Horn","I think you'll see a little bit of lift to come through in Q3 and Q4 of this year. As we talked about in Q1, of our earlier call, we're looking for probably 27.4% gross yield for the year, which is down slightly year-over-year, it was 27.7% last year. So I think you'll see a little bit of lift in Q3, Q4, for the year round, 27.4%, so a slight compression year-over-year, but that's due to the onboarding that Ed talked about. So what I'd be looking for, Darren, is a little bit lift in Q3. For the year coming and basically what we signaled in Q1, around that 27.4% level.","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And that's just basically the -- as you have the opportunity to really provide your services and your expertise around the portfolios that you're acquiring?","Charles L. Horn","That's part of it. Also just obviously, with Bon-Ton onboarding in Q3 of last year, some of the effect will start going off in Q3 of this year. So some of it's just timing as well.","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And just another question, a follow-up on the private label side. Opportunities for additional portfolios beyond maybe sales, for instance, which I know really doesn't probably come on until even -- or at the earliest, 2014. What else is out there? And then, I think Ed, you mentioned in your prepared remarks around the vintage, you're seeing now so much strength that a new vintage of $2 billion is more likely than $1 billion? Is that right? Did I hear that correctly?","Edward J. Heffernan","You did.","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division","All right, so that's -- I mean, that's a pretty significant number obviously for a 1-year addition over time, even over -- with 6 months left of the year. What else is out there? Is that -- how much of that organic? How much of that is actually acquired?","Edward J. Heffernan","There's probably at least one more announcement coming out of a fairly significant file or portfolio that we would expect to acquire. The rest of it, quite frankly, is coming from -- starting from scratch. And what we're seeing is, again, Darrin, it's one of those things right now where we're right in the sweet spot of every retailer and it's now expanding into the T&E market like with Caesars. But all these retailers out there are so focused on, \"Hey, tell me about the customer, tell me what works, the trigger marketing, how can I get that her to repurchase just one more time this year,\" and that essentially will make their year. And so what we're finding is the offerings that we have just seem to be extremely attractive today. You sprinkle on top some of the Epsilon dust in terms of, for example, also providing a whole bunch of potential prospecting names for the retailer on a go-forward basis. That's also something that is turning out to be very attractive from an offering perspective. And you factor in the fact that we can reach the consumer through direct mail, permission-based email, mobile, social, targeted display. All those abilities that we have in-house today, I think, are really driving the signings. I mean, it's, look we've been doing the same thing for -- it seems like forever. And the last couple of years, there just seems to be a massive shift towards this data-driven targeted marketing. And so that's why think you're looking at -- it's going to be a biggie this year.","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division","All right, that's amazing. Just last question for Bryan and then I'll turn back to the queue. And Epsilon obviously performed well, a little better than our expectations in the quarter. A lot of it seems to be driven, as I think you said, off the agency business. Is it possible for you to give us a little bit of a breakdown or at least some color on the size of each one of those segments, agency versus data versus technology? And then what's driving the 20-plus percent? It sounds like it's organic growth. You back out HMI, I think, in the agency side of the business.","Bryan J. Kennedy","Yes. Sure, Darren. I mean, for sure, the agency -- digital agency, as Ed said, is the driver right now for our growth. And I think if you were to break it down between existing clients versus new clients across the board, not just in agency, but I would say we're seeing a little bit higher contribution from new clients coming onboard as we go into the back half of this year and into next year. Then we are -- from existing, which is, for me, a very good sign for this business because typically, we rely on existing clients to drive growth and then new adds a little bit on top of that. So when you see that number flip, it typically signals a pretty good longer-term trend ahead because we're continuing to drive growth of existing clients as well. And I think if you think about our agency offering, just to distinguish it from much of the broader advertising market, it is very data-centered, very technology-enabled agency services that we tend to deliver. And just like Ed was saying in the Private Label, we're seeing the same thing among our client base that there's high demand there. So that's a bit of what's driving that growth of our 3 largest verticals, which should be automotive, financial services and insurance\/telecom are all growing strong double digits. That's with good agency offerings and increasingly, as we get in the back half, you're going to see a ramp up on the technology side.","Edward J. Heffernan","Yes. And I think also, just to say, as you recall, last year, health care got dinged a little bit on our calls in terms of going backward. So it's only appropriate to say that, that has not only stabilized, but has turned positive this year as well, so that's good news.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question is from the line of Dan Perlin with RBC.","Daniel R. Perlin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Can you guys maybe talk a little bit about what's going on with EMEA and CIBC and then TD? In Canada, it seems like there's some questions around what's going on, that kind of coalition marketing program as a competitor? And is that -- do you think that's opportunistic for you guys or has it been disruptive?","Edward J. Heffernan","That's a fairly loaded question, Dan. I would say, at the highest level, the easiest way to think of it is it's typically not our customer. It tends to be the business traveler. So it's, again, recall it's an airline program where ours is after the mass consumer. And so it's -- they're very different programs, they never really overlapped in the past. I don't really expect them to overlap in the future. I would be remiss if I didn't say that, \"Look, there is a fair amount of disruption in that program that's going to happen as you have the 2 largest sponsors cycling in and cycling out,\" meaning the banks. And as a result, could that be an opportunity for other financial institutions to, let's say, take advantage of that displacement in the marketplace? And that's a long-winded way of saying that our folks in our financial institution category are probably viewing it as an opportunity to perhaps pick up some incremental growth if they do heavy promotions in the back half. And that's one of the reasons why we think miles issued is going to flip pretty nicely in this back half.","Daniel R. Perlin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Great. Can you also just remind us -- I mean, it's been a while since we've talked about rising rates. And I know Charles, you talked about the fixed funding and how that kind of falls through. I'm really more interested in your commentary around kind of price elasticity for the consumers that revolves in your portfolio. What would you expect them to tolerate? And then can you just remind us to the extent that there are any caps on the cards rates? I think they're running at close to 25% today, and I'm pretty sure they're all variable up to that. You talked about the way that they get pushed forward. But I'm just wondering, are there any caps that we got to be mindful of at some point in the future?","Charles L. Horn","No caps in place. I'll answer that one first. So we do have programs, we have some at a 23% rate, some up to 25%. I think frankly, revolving rates will not be affected adversely if it moves 1%, 2%, 3%, 4%, I really don't. If you look in the Private Label industry now, there are programs out there over 30% APRs. And so I don't think you would see any appreciable change in the consumer behavior. I think many people at the income levels were going after about $65,000 a year, work more toward a payment and that's what the most important part of it. So frankly, and I think we've talked about this before, Dan, I don't think small changes and rates will affect the revolving behavior. And the way we are structured, we are true variable rate. So if prime rate moves, we do get that flexing through in the next billing cycle. Again, we do not have any caps on our programs, the way we're structured.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of David Scharf with JMP Securities.","David M. Scharf - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division","I wanted to follow up on the last question. Just to clarify, all of -- are all of your programs variable, Charles?","Charles L. Horn","I believe so, yes.","David M. Scharf - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division","Okay, got it. And shifting to provisioning, I know you had mentioned in the year-over-year basis. Just based on the growth of the portfolio, obviously, your overall provisioning is up. It looked like at about 6.2% provisioning rate on ending balances. At June 30, it came down quite a bit. I haven't run the numbers. But I mean, effectively, was there any -- well, put another way, it looks like it's 50 basis points down from March 31. I mean, is this a planned step down in the provisioning rate as you kind of assessed the forward charge-off outlook? I'm trying to get a sense for just how low a level and what spread over loss rates we want to provision at.","Charles L. Horn","So 2 points there. The first one is our rate in Q1 always drifts up, because you get a lot of transactors that basically go into the -- to our stores, buy in the fourth quarter and then pay off in Q1. So you always see the rate drift up in Q1 and drop in Q2. So you're right. They went from 6.7% at the end of Q1 to 6.2% at the end of Q2. Probably, target in end of year, around 6%, 6.1%. And basically, what that means is we'll be drawing into it based upon the growth profile I had talked about, not necessarily releasing reserves. But we'll somewhat key base spread differential. We've talked about it could be 120, 130 basis points over the trailing charge-off rate. When we do the provisioning, we're always looking forward 12 months, 15 months. We're not looking necessarily backwards on us. So in that situation, you get a little flex into a quarter. So what I always try to get people to do is target end of the year and look at an end-of-year spread. So let's say, roughly, for the year, we're at 4.8% charge-off, right, then you'll see us reserve at around 6% at the end of the year.","David M. Scharf - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division","Got it, that's helpful. Actually, one other clarification. The comment about the 2013 vintage, ultimately comprising potentially $2 billion of receivables. I mean, over what timeframe are you thinking about when you've put that $2 billion figure out?","Edward J. Heffernan","Yes. It's -- all our vintages, a good assumption is 3 years. So since the majority of this advantage will be programs starting from scratch, it takes about 3 years before we'll hit that $2 billion dollar mark. And you look back to 2012, 3 years to hit that $1 billion mark, so you'll see it coming in chunks. The net result is you're going to be in a very strong growth mode for the next 2, 3 years for sure.","David M. Scharf - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division","Got it. And lastly, you commented in the context of sort of consumer health and behavior that payment rates are kind of still at elevated levels. There seems to be more discipline, less willingness of households to relever as much. Are there any trends you can discern in that though? I mean, are the payment rates pretty much holding steady? Is there anything about recent vintages that maybe tell you that may go up a little in the next couple of years or...","Edward J. Heffernan","Yes. It's a good question. I think what we're seeing across roughly 30 million active households on an annual basis is that you had payment rates right during The Great Recession trend way down as people were stretching to probably 14%, 15% well below where we usually run, which is probably 18%, 19%. And then post recession, as you really cleanse the pipes, so to speak, in terms of folks who are somewhat on the margin, you move towards more of a prime or super prime file and you saw payment rates jump up to like 21%, something like that, which is quite a bit higher than our historical average. What we've seen is that has stabilized. So the last 2 years has been very flat in terms of any movement in payment rates. The net result seems to be that, right now, we are in an environment where the consumer is a bit more comfortable paying off more than she did historically, but at the same time, is still out there shopping, which is good. And I would say, overall, if for example, you had 10 new folks apply for the card on any given day at one of our retailers, you might have had 7 get approved, pre-recession, during the recession, and maybe more like 2 or 3. And right now, we're probably back up to 5 or so. So I still don't think we're all the way back to the level that we could be at because those the folks who had difficulty during The Great Recession, it has taken 4 years for them to finally get back into the flow. So I think going forward, there's no reason for us to believe that payment behavior will be any different from what it is right now, which is fairly conservative, but spend is still strong.","David M. Scharf - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division","Got it, got it. And then lastly, in that context, can you give us a sense at these levels of payment rates, 20%, 21%? How many basis points of your gross yield, your roughly 27% gross yield, is now derived from late fees on an annualized basis?","Charles L. Horn","I think we're still fairly consistent on the collected yield, about 2\/3, slightly over 2\/3 from APR, slightly under 1\/3 from late fee.","Edward J. Heffernan","Okay, I think that's it. So thanks, everyone, and we'll let you get back to work. Bye.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude today's conference call.

[Operator Instructions]  It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Ms. Julie Prozeller of FTI Consulting. Ma'am, the floor is yours.","Julie Prozeller","Thank you, operator. By now, you should've received the copy of the company's first quarter 2013 earnings release. If you haven't, please call FTI Consulting at (212) 850-5721. On the call today, we have Ed Heffernan, President and Chief Executive Officer; Charles Horn, Chief Financial Officer of Alliance Data; and Bryan Pearson, President and Chief Executive Officer of LoyaltyOne.","Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on today's call and some of the responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risks and the uncertainties described in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC.

Reconciliation of those measures to GAAP will be posted on the Investor Relations website at www.alliancedata.com.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Ed Heffernan. Ed?","Edward J. Heffernan","Great. Thanks, Julie. Joining me today is Charles Horn, our always insightful CFO; and hailing from Toronto, Canada, is Bryan Pearson, President of LoyaltyOne. Charles will first talk about our consolidated results, as well as Epsilon and Private Label. And then, Brian will walk you through LoyaltyOne. And then, I'll wrap up by discussing our new guidance and outlook for 2013.  Charles?","Charles L. Horn","Thanks, Ed. 2013 is off to a great start, with the revenue increasing 18% to just north of $1 billion and adjusted EBITDA also increasing a robust 18% to $357 million.","As mentioned in our press release, this was a milestone quarter for ADS, as we exceeded $1 billion in quarterly revenue for the first time. Private Label and Epsilon contributed high double-digit increases in both revenue and adjusted EBITDA for the quarter. Of note, Epsilon's organic revenue growth bounced back during Q1, increasing by about 7%.","LoyaltyOne, on the other hand, experienced a 7% decline in revenue, which we had expected, but still delivered a 7% increase in adjusted EBITDA. Core EPS beat guidance by $0.05, increasing to $2.55 for the first quarter of 2013, up 7% compared to last year. While net income per diluted share increased to $1.92, up 3% compared to last year.","Both calculations were dampened by a 9% increase in diluted share count.","Our diluted share count increased by 5.5 million to 67.3 million for Q1 2013 due to incremental dilution from convertible notes.","Phantom shares, which are shares we never have to economically settle, increased by 2.5 million while convertible note warrants, which we do have to economically settle, increased by 3.6 million. We were able to partially mitigate the share dilution by spending over $50 million on share repurchases during the quarter and over $120 million year-to-date.","At the current ADS share price, approximately $5.1 million of the phantom shares will drop from our diluted share count on August 1, as the first tranche of convertible notes mature.","Let's now look at the segment results with a bit more detail.  With that, I will turn it over to Bryan Pearson to discuss LoyaltyOne.","Bryan A. Pearson","Thanks, Charles. LoyaltyOne's revenue declined 7% or $17 million for the quarter as redemption revenue fell $28 million or 15% versus last year. As you may recall, Q1 of last year had an unusually high redemption rate due to the announcement of our 5-year expiration policy at the end of 2011.","This run on the bank, which inflated revenues as miles were redeemed, makes a true year-over-year revenue comparison difficult. This effect will be seen throughout 2013 and, coupled with a slightly unfavorable Canadian dollar exchange rate, will pressure top line growth throughout the year.  Even with such headwinds, however, we still expect full year revenue growth in the 2% to 4% range.","In contrast to revenue performance, our adjusted EBITDA increased by 7% or about $4 million for the quarter. We're very pleased with this growth in light of a tough year-over-year comparison, and we are also quite pleased with LoyaltyOne's margin performance, which was up almost 300 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2012.","Full year adjusted EBITDA is tracking up about 8%, and that's consistent with our previous guidance. As we believe, we can cover off any bottom line impact from the unfavorable Canadian dollar exchange rates.","The first quarter burn rate followed typical seasonality trends but came in a bit hot at about 93% due to the decrease in miles issued. Again, last year's run on the bank, in addition to typical seasonality, drove up the burn rate for the first half of 2012, with a predictable tapering down into the 60%s by the back half of the year. And we expect to see exactly the same behavior this year as well, with a full year burn rate projected to be somewhere between 70% and 75%, which by the way, also approximates our reserve rate.","A reminder for everyone that burn rate is defined as the current quarter or year redemptions, divided by the current quarter or year's issuances.","Issuance growth was below expectations for 2 reasons: First, the softness in general consumer spending negatively impacted the credit card vertical; and second, we have reduced promotional spending in the gas vertical compared to Q1 of last year.","As we've said many times in the past, we look at full year issuance as the key metric in the business since the timing of large promotional activities can significantly skew results in any given quarter. Our full year issuance goal remains mid-single digits, with the first half being negative and the second half swinging solidly positive.  Our emphasized focus will be on ensuring that it does flip strongly positive in the back half of the year.","During the quarter, we also announced several large national deals with companies such as Staples and General Motors, as well as having renewed long-term deals with BMO, our top sponsor, and AmEx, a top 5 sponsor.  These early new wins have laid the groundwork for our record year of new sponsors added, with a coming focus on the telecom, specialty retail and petroleum verticals. Coupled with renewals of the 2 of our major anchor sponsors, we have a very solid foundation for the rest of the year, as well as for the future.","Importantly, we believe that the continued ramp-up of new national sponsors increased promotional activities that are aimed towards additional spend on cards, and easier year-over-year comparisons will all contribute to issuance growth during the second half of the year.","Now turning quickly to dotz in Brazil. I'd say we are pleased with Brazil's continued growth over the last quarter. dotz is on track to exceed $100 million in revenue this year, and this is clearly not in our financials. As we strengthen our presence in both existing markets and look towards expansion into 5 additional markets, including 1 large market in the country.  With over 50 sponsors currently committed to the loyalty program, the number of dotz enrolled collectors has increased to 7 million versus only 2 million at this point last year or an approximate 225% increase over last year. With the full year goal in the ballpark of $10 million enrollees, we're looking forward to great results out of our program in dotz.","With that, I'll turn it back to Charles to review Epsilon's results for the quarter. Charles?","Charles L. Horn","Thanks, Brian. Epsilon revenue increased an impressive 39% or $90 million for the quarter. Excluding the impact of HMI, organic top line growth increased approximately 7% compared to Q1 2012.","Now let's look at revenue by major product offerings.","If we look at technology revenue, it was essentially flat with Q1 2012, but we expect steady improvement as the year progresses. Based on the current backlog and the planned launch of our new email platform in Q3, we are anticipating an increase to mid-single-digit growth in technology revenue for the full year.","Data revenue dropped 2% due to continued softness in our consumer demographic data offerings, which offset growth in both Abacus and our online survey offerings. Our outlook is for no growth in data revenue for 2013.","Agency impressed with a revenue increasing 110% for the quarter, aided by a substantial [indiscernible] from the acquisition of HMI back in the fourth quarter of 2012.  Excluding HMI, agency revenue still grew a robust 21% driven by strength in the telecom vertical. We expect that agency will continue to be the leading driver of revenue growth at Epsilon for the remainder of 2013.","Adjusted EBITDA also increased a remarkable 37% for the first quarter. Again, excluding HMI, organic adjusted EBITDA increased over 15% as a result of cost saving measures implemented in mid-2012.","Adjusted EBITDA margins were flat between years but excluding HMI, and just looking at the core Epsilon, adjusted EBITDA margins increased a stellar 140 basis points from Q1 last year.","During the quarter, the Epsilon team focused on merging the recent HMI acquisition into their current integrated agency offering. Thus far, there's been a tremendous amount of traction as HMI's suite of offerings have been introduced into Epsilon's client base, resulting in several cross-sell successes. These early wins are strong indicators of the strength of the combined offering and a validation of HMI's tremendous talent in multiple disciplines that will greatly expand Epsilon's digital capabilities in key channels such as mobile, social, targeted display and web development.  Epsilon remains very positive about HMI's fit and the opportunity to further drive growth across the combined businesses.","Overall, Epsilon's backlog remains strong, up about 15% over the same period last year. The realignment into industry verticals completed in mid-2012 has not only provided operating leverage but has helped secure big new wins for Epsilon's database business. In addition, a prediction 2 years ago, the future revenue growth would increasingly be driven by agency rather than technology offerings, appears to have been correct, with double-digit organic revenue growth in our agency business.","Visibility for the remainder of 2013 is very good, and it appears that any residual effects from last year's air pocket heavily dissipated. Accordingly, we remain confident in our ability to achieve high single-digit, organic top and bottom line growth for the year.","Let's flip to the next slide and talk about Private Label. Private Label had an extremely strong start to 2013, with revenue jumping by 22% and adjusted EBITDA, net of funding costs, increasing over 16% versus last year.  This is particularly impressive given the record year we had in 2012.","Average credit card receivables increased 31%, driven by new programs over the last 12 months and increases in core cardholder spending. Overall, it appears that customers are ignoring some of the economic uncertainty that has been advertised and are increasing their average spend per card.","In 2012, we signed a record 12 new clients. During the first quarter of 2013, we continued on that pace, signing Barneys New York and Caesars Entertainment, among others. Our partnership with Caesar's is a multi-year agreement that enables cardholders to accelerate their loyalty point earnings through a co-branded credit card program. It is an extension of our travel and entertainment vertical. New signings over the last 12 months helped credit card sales up 32% versus Q1 of last year.","Even without the wins, or basically the ads over last 12 months, core sales increased over 11% compared quarter-over-quarter. This continued success proves Private Label's multichannel approach to program growth is a winning strategy.","As expected, gross yields dropped to 27.4%, down 90 basis points compared to Q1 last year. The decrease is almost exclusively related to the onboarding of new programs over the previous 12 months. We expect that gross yields will remain in this range for the remainder of 2013 due to this moderating influence.","Loss rates continue to be at historical low levels. The Q1 net principle loss have improved almost 1% to 4.5%, indicative of an overall improvement in portfolio credit quality. Even so, we flipped to a substantial reserve bill during Q1 as the provision expense increased by $17 million year-over-year, driven by a 31% increase in credit card receivables.  The strengthening of the reserve did moderately impact our adjusted EBITDA margins for Q1.","Overall, a terrific first quarter for Private Label, and all the trends remain favorable. As such, our outlook for 2013 has improved as reflected in our new guidance, with expected top line growth in the 12% to 15% range and bottom line growth in the 10% to 13% range. Additionally, the top line of prospects remain robust with a potential for another record year at double-digit new signings.","Let's now move on to liquidity. Liquidity for ADS consolidated remained strong at about $4.6 billion as of March 31, 2013. Our corporate leverage ratio at 2.3x continues to be well below our maximum leverage ratio of 3.5x.","Breaking our liquidity down further. At the corporate level, liquidity remains strong at $1.7 billion, of which about $800 million is cash. At the bank level, there's approximately $2.9 billion of available liquidity as of March 31, 2013.","During the first quarter, one of our Master Trust issued $375 million of fixed-rate term asset-backed securities. The fixed-rate coupon of 1.61% is the lowest coupon ever achieved for any duration in Alliance Data's 17 years of capital markets issuance. We will continue to take advantage of this low interest rate environment by extending maturities and adding liquidity as we execute our strategy of building long-term visibility into our earnings.","On the dividends front, our 2 banks paid $82.5 million in dividends to ADS parent during the first quarter while maintaining strong regulatory rations. As of March 31, 2013, Comenity Bank's regulatory ratios were substantially above minimum well capitalized levels.","A few weeks ago, we announced our intention to settle the $805 million convertible senior notes due 2013 via cash payment. The cash outlay from ADS will be $805 million. In addition, as part of a hedging arrangement entered into in 2008, we owe 2.9 million shares based upon today's ADS share price to counterparties related to this debt. These shares are included in our diluted share count and considered in our 2013 guidance and thus, will have no dilutive impact when issued.","I think at this point, we're all sufficiently whipped discussing this convertible debt.","Last point I will make is we did hit the gas in the buyback program during the quarter and immediately  following the quarter, spending, at this time, over $120 million out of our $400 million authorization.","With that, I will turn the call back over to Ed for an update on 2013 and guidance before opening the call for questions.","Edward J. Heffernan","Great. Thanks, Charles. The slide I'm looking at is new guidance and with the title, raising all key metrics, I think that sort of is the overall message here. Again, let's sort of have a general discussion about the year and where we see things going and what items we want to keep our eye on and also have a little discussion about visibility into 2014 as well.","Overall, as we've been suggesting over the past few months, we think '13, obviously, is shaping up to be another very, very solid year. I don't see","a lot of items that will knock us out of the box right now. And so, it's one of execution at this point. The backlogs are very, very strong. And so what we're looking to do now is, obviously, execute for '13 and continue to gain visibility into '14 and '15.","That being said, back to the issue at hand, we are raising guidance. Revenue, we're bumping up to $4.25 billion, which is a 17% increase over last year and is up $50 million from our prior guidance. And while that's certainly a nice number, I think more importantly is our focus on organic growth. The organic growth of the company right now is running somewhere between 7% and 8%, similar to last year, which, in the old days, I guess, would not be overly impressive. However, in this","new environment, where GDP is running at 60% of the rate of the old days, doing 3x GDP, I think, is certainly a very, very attractive model. So our focus is on maintaining that high-single digit or 3x GDP organic top line. That will then flow into adjusted EBITDA, which we are increasing by $10 million to $1.375 billion.  And then down to core earnings of $640 million, which is up also from prior guidance.","Core EPS, we're bumping up another dime to $9.75 and that's up 12% from prior year, and $0.25 from the initial guidance that I gave a while ago. So overall, the improvements continue. The over-performance continues, and we're gradually walking up the year.","I would like to spend just a second on the earnings per share and what I think is pretty interesting. At Q1, our core earnings were up 17%, but you noticed our EPS was only up 7%. Obviously, that was due to the number of shares that Charles talked about being up quite a bit and specifically, up to 67 million shares versus 62 million in Q1 of last year. What's interesting is starting in Q3, also as Charles mentioned, one of the converts comes due and you'll start to see what I call the slingshot effect begin to kick in. In Q3, you'll see double-digit core earnings growth continuing while the share count will now be even with the prior year and therefore, no longer a drag, which will give you double-digit earnings growth.  In Q4, it reverses, and you've got the slingshot where you're going to have double-digit core earnings plus a 5% decline in shares. So we'll be running at about 63 million shares versus 66 million. And so for example, if core earnings are up 15%, your earnings will go up 20%. That carries us right into 2014 where you'll have another stepdown in the spring, with shares declining another 8% or another 5 million shares. So it's going to be a little bit of fun watching the slingshot starting in the end of Q3 and into Q4 and 2014.","So I just wanted to make sure everyone was aware of that. I know there was some confusion over the converts and obviously, with the accounting being as clear as mud. Hopefully, this helps clarify things a bit.","Okay, let's talk about the business itself, next slide. I want to stick to just the messages. As Brian pointed out, we had -- in LoyaltyOne, we had some time comps on the top line but we did have very nice high single-digit organic growth on the EBITDA.  So obviously, some good news there. Obviously, the thing that we're really focused on right now is ensuring the future growth of the business, which means ensuring that the key metric called miles issued or issuance flips in the second half of the year. We do feel comfortable that the way things are shaping up right now, it does look like we're going to go from a slightly negative issuance growth rate in the first half to strongly positive in the second half. And as a result, I think we're going to wind up the year right where we want it to be, which is up about 5% on issuance growth.  So until it actually happens, we're going to keep it in our sites.","One of the things that jumps out in terms of LoyaltyOne this year is going back, I don't know, 15 years or so. This is by far the strongest year in memory in terms of new sponsors. So for a program that's over 20 years old, the fact that you're signing up national sponsors with great names like GM and Staples suggests that the future of the program is very bright. Also, I think that we're going to be looking at probably announcing 1 to 2 new sponsors in addition of these 2 big ones already before the year is out. So it is a very, very strong year for new sponsors, which suggests growth forward should be solid.","As we turn to Epsilon, as Charles talked about, the famous or infamous air pocket that we talked about last year, I think, we can finally put to bed. It was the concern last year. It is absolutely gone as organic growth swung from minus 3% in Q3 plus 3% in Q4, plus 7% in Q1. The way I do the math, that sounds pretty good. And so if you have a 10 percentage point swing in a couple of quarters, I think we can put the air pocket to bed.","That being said, we need database to really start cranking out the growth. It's been signing a number of very large new clients and it's beginning to crank back up. Again, it was the cause for going negative in organic growth last year in Q3. It's now running flat. We expect mid-single-digit growth as the year progresses.","Overall, Epsilon is running 7% organic growth. And as we talked about, the pivot that we made with our strong focus on the digital agency as sort of the tip of the spear, leading the rest of the product line into our client base, looks like it's been a decent bet so far.","Private Label, again, I guess we could sum it up by saying, it's all good. Funding is obviously very attractive, and we are doing our best to term this thing out as long as we can and lock that down. Credit quality continues to remain pristine at right around 5%. The big question is will it drift back to our more normalized 6% level? When will that happen? Quite frankly, from what we can tell on our forward-looking indicators, there is nothing that suggests that, that's going to happen in the near term. It looks like things are very, very stable where they are right now, and so, so far, so good.  What was interesting about Private Label this quarter is that when you heard about some softness in consumer spend from a macro perspective, what we actually saw was very, very strong organic growth in the use of the card. In fact, we saw credit sales actually going up organically in the high single-digit rate. And I guess it really attests to the fact that the whole loyalty concept behind the card does, in fact, work. Because the only way it does work is we're getting more market share.","I think the takeaway from Private Label is that similar to last year, the book of new business is huge. Last year, we signed at least twice the number of signings that we had in the past. Those signings equated to a vintage, as we call them, of almost $1 billion of receivables. And again, that's on a file that's only $6 billion in size. This year, with Barney's, Caesar's and a number of others that have been signed that we have not yet announced, we are very comfortable saying that this will be another year where we're going to close in on a vintage of about $1 billion of AR once these things blew off.","So again, very, very strong year in terms of signings. I think we'll sign probably a total of 10 new clients this year, and that, again, would be a record for us. The backlog going into '14 also looks strong. I keep getting asked the question, \"What happened? Why so strong? \" And I think again, we are all familiar with the secular shift in the change in spend from general-purpose spend on marketing and advertising into very specific ROI-based targeted marketing. And you just don't get that type of information out of the blue. And with Private Label in linking into the customers' systems, pulling out SKU level information, adding demographic and psychographic information, it works.  And that's where the money is going. So we're getting a lot of folks interested in harnessing that data collection platform, which is called Private Label.","All right, let's finish up with the 2013 outlook from a financial perspective. We talked about the businesses, let's talk about some of the numbers. We raised guidance on rev, EBITDA, core earnings, core EPS, double-digit growth across the board. We talked about share repurchases. We had a $400 million authorization. We said we would be in and out of the market as appropriate. It was relatively modest in the first quarter from a calendar basis, as things were running pretty solidly in the market.","As soon as things begin to drift a little bit, we came in much heavier, and I think at this point, we spent about $120 million year-to-date. That will continue to be our plan going forward. So we will be extremely supportive of the stock and be opportunistic when we feel it is a good opportunity.","So, so far, so good there.","One of the key things is free cash flow. We're running approximately $720 million of free cash, and everyone seems to define free cash flow differently. I keep it real simple, which is how much is left in the bank account at the end of the year, which means how much after you pay for CapEx and interest and taxes and working capital and bank capital and everything else. At the end of the day, the bank account will have $720 million more dollars, which is up 15%. And it's approximately an 8% yield on our shares. So I think very, very attractive from that perspective.","Also, balance growth, I expect to continue throughout the year. All 3 engines, once again, are contributing. And then EPS momentum, I think, will be a very interesting story as we move into the back half of the year where we're facing pretty strong headwinds on share count in the first half, and yet still growing 6%, 7% in terms of earnings growth. That's going to start cranking up big-time in the back half and then crank up again in the spring of next year.","So that's pretty much where we are right now. Why don't I just sum it up with maybe half a dozen quick comments. And that is, as we mentioned, it's really nice to see all 3 businesses will grow this year. And we think it will range from sort of low single-digits LoyaltyOne up to 30% plus at Epsilon. EBITDA high single digit at LoyaltyOne, up to 30% at Epsilon.  Additionally, the question always is out there of what keeps us up at night, what are our big worries for the year. And I think at this point, there are less worries but more of there's probably 3 critical things that we're going to keep our eye on to make sure we execute. The first would be, of course, at LoyaltyOne, making sure that the issuance growth is, in fact, on track to flip strongly positive in the second half to ensure that we have strong visibility going into '14 and '15.  The second thing we're watching very closely is we are rolling out a brand-new digital platform called Harmony [ph]  at Epsilon. That rolls in Q3 and should drive a good chunk of growth at 2014 revenues. We believe this platform will put us right at where we need to be in terms of feature functionality within the industry on the e-mail side. And so, we're anxiously awaiting that rollout, that's critical for '14 and '15 as well.","And then finally, while Brazil is going like gangbusters, we still need to execute on a very aggressive plan of 5 regions that we want to rollout, including 1 big one. And while things are looking pretty good, we want to make sure we execute on those.","So those are the 3 areas that, really, are the focus of the rest of the year for us in terms of making sure things get done.","Overall, strong 7% to 8% organic revenue growth if you add in the acquisition of HMI, and we're looking at teens growth of revenue and EBITDA and core earnings. And we talked about the EPS growth moving from 6% to 7% into double digit into very strong double digit as we exit 2014.","Again, as I focus on '14 and '15, very strong signings and pipelines at all the 3 businesses and therefore, beginning to firm up '14 at this point. For the rest of '13, I know that's the purpose or most of the purpose of this call, we have raised guidance, as far, twice and, along with strong new business signings, no flags in credit quality and plus declining share count and certainly, some buyback activity, we do feel comfortable that '13 will continue on a very solid path and that '14 is shaping up to be a nice year as well.","So that being said, why don't we go over to questions. Thanks.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of the Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","It seems to me like Epsilon and Loyalty are really going to be strong second half stories. And I was wondering if you guys could dimension that for us a bit. I think Brian helped on Loyalty, but maybe for Epsilon, is it signings plus seasonality? And I guess for Bryan, what's kind of the risk that the second half issuance doesn't materialize?","Edward J. Heffernan","Yes, let me take Epsilon first, Sanjay. I think Epsilon had a very, very strong first quarter. I think you're not going to see a huge increase in that type of organic growth, high-single digits is what we're looking for, for Epsilon. And overall, we're looking at plus 30 top, plus 30 bottom with the acquisition. And so what you see in first quarter, you're going to see really play out through the rest of the year. The only difference will be you'll probably see a little bit stronger or you will see stronger organic growth now coming out of the big database builds, given the signings that we have. So I think Epsilon will continue what you saw in the first quarter, the mix will be a little bit different. Bryan?","Bryan A. Pearson","Yes, Sanjay. So I think the reason why that we feel strongly about the back half is what we're seeing just brewing. So you've -- I talked about a couple of things, the new sponsor signings that are coming along and the opportunity for consumers to get engaged with those accounts. We're just ramping up. And Staples just launched a little over a month ago, and so it takes a few months to see the activity begin to ramp in those customers and the customers start to get used to how to use the currency. So as we roll through the back half of the year, we'll see those partners ramping up. We've also got our existing  partners who have shifted sort of the timing of some of their promotional activity. But what we see in the pipeline, in the plans, with our major retail partners would give us comfort that we've got a strong sort of Q3, Q4 on the hustings[ph]. And then the last piece would be there are some good things happening on the financial services partners side and that we just launched a new card with AmEx. It's a premium-based card called the Reserve card. And we're just on the acquisition run, right now, for those. So both acquisitions and then the ongoing spend on those cards should help that sector as well. Remember that we, as we said before, always look at the full year and not quarter-to-quarter, and the shifting of these promotions has a material effect sometimes on the issuance growth on also because they grow over from a high quarter versus a more normalized quarter, the following year could look like it's negative. So we're very comfortable that we've got a layering of activity, which should lend itself nicely to growth. The last thing I'd just say is I think if there's a risk in there, Sanjay, it would be really substantive downturn in consumer spending on credit card. And the reality is that we've seen softness in the beginning of the first quarter, but we don't anticipate that as we roll through the back half of the year, that, that will continue to be an issue. And our credit card partners are equivalently very focused on ensuring that there's growth in their business, and so we're very aligned in creating the right kind of activity in our financial services partners.","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","That's wonderful. One more, just obviously, very strong showing on the share repurchase to date, and I was wondering how you guys feel about kind of executing on the authorization you have in offsetting some of that warrant dilution? And also maybe if you could remind us, Charles, kind of that -- those share counts that you disclosed at the end of the slide deck on Slide 10, what those would be if you are able to offset most of that dilution on the warrant side?","Charles L. Horn","Well, for the first tranche of debt, Sanjay, you have about, at current prices, about 2.9 million shares that we would owe to our counterparties. So that is in those numbers. If you look at our authorization and what we've done so far, we bought about 800,000 shares so far. So I think Ed and I are focused on taking a very big bite out of it. To your point, it's already in our share count, so if we do so, it's going to be incremental to -- or will provide upside to our overall 2013 results.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Darrin Peller with Barclays.","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Charles, just quick first question on the portfolio yield. I mean, the profitability across the board has obviously been very pretty stable. And I think this quarter in particular, we saw the early signs of a portfolio yield coming out of some portfolios you have added, so the yield itself was down year-over-year. But -- and I think you mentioned earlier, it should be stable through the year. However, typically, you guys have done a very good job of creating more profitability out of the portfolios, including the yield. Can you just touch on that? I mean, what are the opportunities to really improve on what you have now, given the new portfolio you brought off probably could start off with a lower yield?","Charles L. Horn","Yes, I think the key there is, Darrin, we have had a little pressure this year, but if you break it down, it's pretty much all from the onboarding of the new programs over the last 12 to 15 months. If you look at whether it's a startup program or a portfolio we acquire, it can take us up to, really, up to 3 years to get into the same gross yield we can achieve on the core portfolio. So it's really going to come down to, bottom line, our acquisition activity. If we continue to grow with the new signings 10, 11, you'll probably going to see that continue the dampening effect and keep it in that 27.5% range. And so really, we're going to keep it at the lower rate as we keep onboarding these new programs. So we'll get the benefit of the previous ones ramping up as we're onboarding new. So I'd say it's going to be pretty static in the mid-27%s, which is why we gave that guidance.","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. So it's really having to do with more with the new additions, because without that, from organics, based on what you have today, I mean, it would really -- the yield should actually improve through the second half of the year?","Charles L. Horn","That is accurate. But as long as we keep onboarding, to Ed's point, up to 10 new programs this year, we'll keep that dampening effect on gross yield going.","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. All right. And then just a follow-up question. This is really more in your wheelhouse. One of the big differentiating factors for Epsilon and Private Label is you're accessing your ability to work with merchants of SKU level detail data, which we continuously hear about across the industry. Just touching on that for a minute, can you talk a little bit about some potential strategies you're working to really exemplify what you have there and how does that differentiate you in terms of winning business? We often get the question of how you keep winning Private Label business. Does that help? Is that one of the factors? And then going forward, any partnerships that might be possible related to that type of relationship you're able to merge in? and then, just before I wrap it up, the big -- the recent news around Chase and Visa. The partnership that they have creating Chase Merchant Services, seems to potentially give them more access and more direct actions with merchants. Does that have any impact on your model, you think, long term?","Edward J. Heffernan","Okay. I think there are about 18 questions in there. I'm going to sort of start at the end and work back. On the Visa Chase Merchant Services, again, this is one person's opinion. I think it's a very positive announcement for Chase in the sense of having anonymous type network is something that's very attractive because it provides an ability to lower their operating expenses, right? You're going to have Chase merchants and you're going to have people coming in with Chase-issued cards. So my belief is it seems like a very positive announcement on a cost savings perspective. The big question is who benefits from those savings? Is it going to be used to help have a more attractive program for -- to onboard more merchants versus the competition? Is it going to go back to Chase to their bottom line? Or is it going back to the issuers in terms of more rewards, I don't know. I do think a lot of noise is out there, but what type of data you can get just by having an on-us [ph] network. The data doesn't get any better just because you have an on-us [ph] or a closed loop network. You have to be also taking the second step, which is tying into the merchant system itself, going into the guts of the merchant, meaning their t-logs and their inventory systems and everything else. Otherwise, you don't get the SKU or category information, and I don't believe that, that is going to be the purpose of this venture. So I look at it more as an expense benefit, which would be, I think, a nice one, but certainly, not from the data side. So from our perspective, regardless, it doesn't make any difference whatsoever. From Epsilon, Epsilon really comes down to a big bet, which is that because so much of the money in marketing and advertising is now solely at the discretion of the Chief Marketing Officer that having a C-suite presence is absolutely critical. And so the pivoting that we did towards digital agency means that the uniqueness of Epsilon is the ability to have an existing C-suite relationship or develop one to walk in and talk the same language, develop the creative side of customer acquisition, customer retention, customer communication, customer loyalty, develop those campaigns, design those campaigns, and then at the same time, where the digital agencies that are out there typically handed off to some other vendor or some other provider, we bring the full package to bear. So we can then say, \"All right, now, we can build it for you, and we have the demographic and psychographic data, we can do the analytics. And then we can do the distribution through everything, from digital print, all the way through to mobile, social and targeted displays.\" So the whole bit on Epsilon and what makes Epsilon so unique is the bet that being able to be the one throat to choke, so to speak, is going to be increasingly important going forward because the CMOs out there are just getting absolutely buried with all these different opportunities that are out there. Our job is to just make it easy and just say,\"Come to these guys\", and if there's a problem, I pick up the phone and I know who to call. And so that's was happening. It's really just starting now. I think it's clearly heading in the right direction. And it's going to be, I think, Epsilon itself, even if it doesn't work perfectly, is a very strong high single-digit organic growth machine, maybe 10% EBITDA. And then once you bring all the services together, you're going to step that up another notch.","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division","But just really quick, on the Private Label side, you really aren't the only company that's offering SKU level detail -- analytical capabilities on Private Label as well? Is that right, because of the closed loop nature?","Edward J. Heffernan","Yes, because again, it's not necessarily just because it's closed loop, right. Amex and Discover also have closed loops. What we do differently, however, is because we don't have that hundreds of thousands or millions of merchants, we have 110, you have to take that second step, which is to insert yourself via your systems into the back-office, the t-logs, the inventory systems of the merchant itself to actually pull out the category or SKU level information. It doesn't come just because it's a closed loop.","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. Just quick last one for Bryan, and I'll go back to the queue. On the dotz, the discussions you're having with Banco do Brasil, how has that been trending and maybe just talk about majority ownership?","Bryan A. Pearson","Yes. I mean, the 2 sides would be of this. First of all is on the Banco side, we've had tremendous success with them. We've just launched some program enhancements, which I think they're very pleased with. And as we measure the metrics that they're looking at for a successful program, it feels like we're kind of green light across the board. So we're progressing there well. And then on the other discussion, which is around consolidation, I mean, those are ongoing discussions, and we will find a way to daylight on that. And we're looking forward to being able to make announcements in the future on that.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Kevin McVeigh with Macquarie.","Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research","I wonder if you could give us a sense -- it sounds like, Charles, if I have it right, the average base is about $150 on the buyback. Is there upside to the $400 million, given the $120 million you've done year-to-date?","Charles L. Horn","I think there's always upside potential. I mean, I said this before. Ed never thinks we're overvalued. He's always going to think our price is too low. So if we do see good opportunities, would be willing to go back to the Board and get increased authorization? Sure. But I think even if the $400 million, if we beat away at it at the price you threw out, I can pick up over 2  million, 2.4 million shares, big bite out of the 2.9 million would be converts. And from my standpoint, that convertible equity is already in our share counts, so if we nip away with our buyback, it's just I'll use another as gravy, and we're just, again, saving this up for the future.","Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research","Great. And then, and I apologize if I missed this, but what should we use for the kind of the Q3 share count? I know there's a lot of moving parts and then it started to run off, I mean, clearly on Q4, but what should be kind of the Q3 share count based on where we are right now with buyback and assuming things are -- don't move at all?","Charles L. Horn","I would say in the 63.8 million range. SKU and you've got the convertible debt in there of the phantom shares for 1 month, out for 2 months. So you'll have -- probably be in that 63.8 million range versus the 67.3  million we currently sit at.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of David Scharf with JMP Securities.","David M. Scharf - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division","Ed, the first is on Epsilon. The agency side of the business, which is obviously kind of the lower margin, more labor-intensive, as that continues to sort of increase in mix, can you give us a little better sense for how to think about the long-term maybe margin upside in the Epsilon segment...","Edward J. Heffernan","If you look at it year-over-year, if I strip out HMI for Q1, we were","[Audio Gap]","22, 8, 9 in that range. I still believe long-term, with the cross-sell, upsell and the integration on that side, you can get this business back to a 25% EBITDA margin.","David M. Scharf - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division","Okay. Getting up to 25%, I mean what are the implications on mix? Is that the current mix of data, tech and agency?","Edward J. Heffernan","I think you will always assume you're getting your foot on the door with the agency side and then you're cross sell, upselling the higher value-added products in your technology and data. So a lot of it can come from if we can get data from being flat year-over-year to get some good growth coming through on data. Data is one of your highest EBITDA-margin products, so its ability to cross-sell into these higher-margin products will help us get it that way.","David M. Scharf - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division","Got it, got it. And just reflecting on the increase in organic growth in this quarter, and you mentioned the telecom vertical, agency is a little lumpier than the other 2 businesses, which had been more transaction-oriented. Should we be thinking about Q1 and kind of the backlog going forward as a lot of large project-oriented business that came in on the agency side? Just trying to get a sense for sort of thinking about the visibility and recurring nature of the business versus a year ago and even pre-Aspen.","Edward J. Heffernan","Yes, I think -- I'll take that. Well, I think using that sort of 7% to 8% organic top is a good number to use throughout the year, exactly to your point. We're pretty comfortable that what we're seeing on the, as you call it, the older Epsilon business, has turned very nicely and has gone from negative to flat to -- with the backlog. We expect that to be running at about a plus-5% organic as the year unfolds. So you're going to see more and more coming from what used to be called the big iron builds. But the big database builds as the year progresses, because those are the stuff that we signed towards the end of last year and in the first quarter of this year, that'll start flowing in as the year progresses. So the visibility, I think, for that type of organic growth of 7% to 8% overall is pretty good for the year.","David M. Scharf - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division","Got it. And lastly, on Epsilon, can you talk a little bit more about the new e-mail platform, Harmony? Is this replacing kind of the legacy -- the old DoubleClick server or is this a new product?","Edward J. Heffernan","Yes, absolutely. It's a complete redo. We, years ago, right, you're correct, we bought the DoubleClick, and we have the Bigfoot platforms. And we've been sort of trying to combine and add this and upgrade that. And what we eventually decided to do was a complete redo and come out with a sparkling new platform. We looked at everything in the marketplace, obviously, at the competitors. And quite frankly, I think at where we are right now, the competitive landscape is such that we frankly  were not competitive with the offerings that were out there. So with the Harmony rollout that should be coming later on this year, we should be at, if not above, all the feature functionality that exists in the marketplace today. That's the goal, and our job is to be perfectly blunt with everyone, which is we weren't there. And I think this will get us where we need to be. But it's not going to show up until the first part of '14.","David M. Scharf - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division","Got it, got it. And then lastly, just switching gears to Private Label. With respect to the provisioning rate this quarter, which is obviously a pretty meaningful spread above your existing loss rate and even your LTM loss rate. I understand kind of provisioning in advance for the big buildup. Given the fact that you're, I think, you commented you're anticipating bringing onboard at a vintage basis, the equivalent of another $1 billion of receivables. Is the provisioning rate going to resemble what we saw at March 31 for most of this year? Should it be coming down at all just given what we see on delinquency trends? How should we model that throughout the year, Charles?","Charles L. Horn","I'll put it this way, David. If the trends we see now continue as a reserve rate, it will drift down over the course of the year. But conversely, with the growth that Ed's talking about, you will still see a big provision or reserve build. So even though the rates' drifting down, the expense will be recognizing year-over-year or will be substantially higher than what it was in 2012. So to your point, I do think the rate will drift down. It could drift down 40 basis points from where it is now, if we see the trends continue. But even with that, with the additional AR we're putting on the books, you're going to see a big reserve build, which will increase our expense on a year-over-year basis.","Edward J. Heffernan","Yes, I mean, it's one of the interesting things about having that type of business in the sense of, right, the market itself overall and the card industry is stagnant. And so there's really no growth out there in general purpose cards. And as a result, the pristine credit quality that really everyone's seeing, any type of growth is coming through reserve releases, which eventually will end. In our case, it's the reverse. Because we have so much growth, we're not having a bunch of reserve releases dumping through earnings. I mean, it's a good problem to have and eventually, when things slow, obviously, that will reverse itself and would be a nice mitigator to slowing growth. But at this point, it's all about cranking up the growth, and we'll get the reserve release somewhere down the line.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Bob Napoli with William Blair.","Robert P. Napoli - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","A question on Brazil, I guess. You gave a number of about $100 million of revenue this year. And with the number of collectors growing from 2 million to 7 million, I would imagine that growth rate's very strong. I mean, as we think about 2014, I mean, are we -- I mean, is that business -- is it growing in line with the rate of growth of collectors?","Edward J. Heffernan","Bob, they'll actually grow quicker. Again, think back the deferred revenue model we have with L1,  where we issued [ph] to a point now that may not redeem for 42 months, so we don't recognize most of the revenue until 42 months down the road. If you think about the dotz program, it's really came into existence in '09. So you've get issuances '09, '10, '11, '12, and now they're starting to come through on the revenue stream. So if you think about LoyaltyOne in Canada, about 65% of the revenue stream is from miles redeemed. So now, the collectors are accumulating Brazil. Now, they can start to redeem, so which is going to give us a little bit of a hockey stick effect. So if you go back in time in 2011, it was about $15 million of revenues. About $60 million of revenues in '12, jumping up to $100 million revenues in '13. You're going to see another big jump coming through in '14 as that hockey stick plays out. And now the consumers in the markets have accumulated sufficient points to get to that point of redemption.","Robert P. Napoli - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","And then I guess, what are the -- what do you think the margin -- EBITDA margin environment is like, the business model there? And I know you're doing a lot of investing, but what -- over the next couple of years, where do you -- is that a higher-margin business, lower-margin than Canada?","Bryan A. Pearson","Yes, I mean, at the end of the day, it's very similar. I'd say that the margin structures that flows through may be a little tighter at the top end of the gross margin level, but because costs are lower in Brazil to run the business, you end up with an EBITDA margin, which approximates what we see in Canada.","Edward J. Heffernan","Yes, and again, a nice rule of thumb I find, the shorter the better, is that in terms of replicating the size of the Canadian business in terms of the financials, which is $0.25 billion or so of EBITDA, and we have roughly 10 million active households in the program today. But to do that in Brazil, we're going to need about 2.5x that, so about $25 million, to replicate that because the per capita spend, obviously, is quite a bit lower. So getting up to $10 million this year, obviously, puts us in great shape to crank it up to the $25 million that we need. But that's the magic number is. Let's get to $10 million. We feel at that point, we've tipped over to the point of this thing will just really start cranking even faster than it is now. And then at $25 million, once you have some stability there, you're going to get a model very similar to Canada.","Robert P. Napoli - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","And then just a follow-up on the Private Label business. I mean, your portfolio is $7 billion today and I mean you've grown a lot, but $7 billion is nothing in the scheme of the credit card industry. And I know that you have a specific type of retailer you're targeting. And as I'm starting to do an investment fund, to invest in every public company that becomes an ADS client because their stocks all seem to double and triple as they take on ADS. But what do you think the market opportunity is over the next 5 years, obviously, through both the combination of organic and inorganic growth? What is the market available to ADS?","Edward J. Heffernan","Yes, it's a great question. And you're exactly right, the rest of the world can do their thing. Our sandbox, where we play, where we've always come back to, there's roughly 300 potential existing or potential clients in our sandbox. And they're all of roughly -- they're going to be a similar type of profile of what we have today. And as a result, we have 110 clients today, that's $7 billion of AR. If we think there's roughly 300 out there, you do the math, I think it comes out to about 3x that. So call it $20 billion or so. There's a -- we think we're about 1\/3 penetrated. And as a result, if this shift continues towards the data-driven marketing, this could be a very strong growth engine for years to come. But we think we're about 1\/3 of the way there.","Robert P. Napoli - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","And just last question, on the pipeline of new clients. Are you seeing more of that coming from those that are customers of your bank competitors, or are they people who are doing it internally? I mean, I guess my question is, are you seeing a wave of bank competitors that are -- or clients that are bank competitors that are now looking at ADS and seeing what you've done for the likes of Bon-Ton and Pier 1, et cetera and not happy with the banks?","Edward J. Heffernan","It's a combo. Barneys was in-house, and Caesar's did have a program, at one point, with a competitor. But I would say that it's really -- the vast bulk of the signings are going to be coming from starting a program from scratch. It's usually triggered by -- it could be a change of management where the CMO comes over and has familiarity with the benefits of Private Label. Or it could be that this whole big data thing and bringing it online is really beginning to seep into the consciousness of the CMOs across the industry. But I would say probably 80% of the signings will be folks where we are starting a program from scratch, and then the other 20% is, to your point, we will welcome certain clients who have decided to join us.","Operator","All right. I think we're going to have -- that's it? Okay. We're going to call it a day. I know everyone has a bunch of stuff that they got to do. I'm sorry we didn't get to everyone. But again, so far so good. Enjoy your day, and thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call.

At this time, all parties will have been placed on a listen-only mode. Following today\u2019s presentation, the floor will be open for your questions. [Operator Instructions]","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Eddie Sebor of FTI Consulting. Sir, the floor is yours.","Eddie Sebor","Thank you, operator. By now you should have received a copy of the company\u2019s third quarter 2016 earnings release. If you haven\u2019t, please call FTI Consulting at 212-850-5721.","On the call today, we have Ed Heffernan, President and Chief Executive Officer of Alliance Data; Charles Horn, Chief Financial Officer of Alliance Data; and Bryan Kennedy, Chief Executive Officer of Epsilon\/Conversant.","Before we begin, I\u2019d like to remind you that some of the comments made on today\u2019s call and some of the responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risks and the uncertainties described in the company\u2019s earnings release and other filings with the SEC. Alliance Data has no obligation to update the information presented on the call.","Also, on today\u2019s call, our speakers will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures, which we will provide useful information for investors. Reconciliation of those measures to GAAP will be posted on the Investor Relations website at www.alliancedata.com.","With that, I would like to turn the call over to Ed Heffernan. Ed?","Edward Heffernan","Great. Thanks, Eddie. Joining me today is Charles Horn, our always prolific CFO; and Bryan Kennedy, as mentioned, President of Epsilon\/Conversant. Charles will go first and update you on the quarterly results and then Bryan will discuss Epsilon\/Conversant specifically, and then I\u2019ll wrap up with a third quarter look, and a full year outlook as well as sort of our initial brief discussion as we look into 2017. So, Charles, take it away.","Charles Horn","Thanks, Ed. It was a terrific third-quarter with double-digit growth in all profitability measures. LoyaltyOne and Card Services came in better than expected for the third quarter, while Epsilon\/Conversant lagged a bit on the top line growth expectations, but executed the important turn in adjusted EBITDA, which was flat for the third quarter after being down in the first and second quarters.","As a result of Q3\u2019s strong performance we are raising annual guidance for the second time this year, increasing revenue from $7.15 billion to $7.2 billion and core EPS from $16.85 to $16.90. We did not pass through the full $0.32 [beat] to third quarter core EPS guidance because a large portion is timing related, whereby some earnings were pulled forward out of Q4 to Q3. In particular, for AIR MILES we expect redemption activity to moderate in Q4 after a run in Q3.","Basically collectors were getting ahead of the upcoming expiry date. And for Card Services, our principal loss rates came in 20 basis points better than guidance in Q3. We expect to give that back in Q4 which will prompt some reserve build. Lastly I expect tax rates to tick up a bit in Q4.","Turning to the repurchase program, we have acquired approximately 3.3 million shares under our repurchase program year-to-date, and have approximately 300 million of our board authorization left in 2016. You will notice from this slide that we are making a big change in our shareholders return philosophy with our board of directors declaring a quarterly dividend yielding 1% with a record date of November 3. Going forward we expect to use the balance of share repurchases and dividends to return capital to investors. Ed will talk about this some later in the presentation. ","Let us flip over to page 4 and talk about LoyaltyOne. As previously mentioned, LoyaltyOne exceeded expectations for the third quarter as revenue and adjusted EBITDA increased 28% and 14% respectively. Brand loyalty came in as planned with revenue up 5%. AIR MILES revenue greatly exceeded expectations increasing 43% from the third quarter of 2015 due to elevated redemption activity.","As you can see from this slide, foreign exchange rates had a normal impact to the quarter. AIR MILES issued increased 6% in the third quarter rebounding from a 3% decline in the second quarter, and is on track for about 3% growth for the full year. AIR MILES redeemed increased 74% compared to the third quarter of 2015 as we saw a spike in activity in front of the 12\/31 expiration date.","Although expiry was introduced almost five years ago, this was the first quarter of elevated redemption activity related to it. We expect that some of the activity is just a pull forward from Q4 to Q3 and that activity will abate somewhat in Q4, a matter of timing. ","Now the answer to the question everyone now will be asking me is what does this mean for the accounting assumptions around the AIR MILES program. The answer is it is too early to know. We need to see if the elevated activity continues through Q4 and we need to evaluate which collector is redeeming as the break adjustment resume, certain collectors will redeem and certain collectors will not redeem. Only this second group really impacts breakage estimates.","Fast forward to the end of the year, if we determine that a breakage adjustment is needed, keep in mind that the accounting assumptions for the program are not evaluated in isolation. Rather several other factors and accounting assumptions such as cost to mile, [Indiscernible] residual et cetera will also need to be evaluated. These potentially mitigate the impact of lowering breakage rates.","Moving to BrandLoyalty, we recently signed supermarket chain, Lowes Foods, whereby we will manage promotional campaign in 75 Lowes Foods stores in North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia. Overall we are making solid progress in the US.","Let us move to Epsilon and Bryan Kennedy.","Bryan Kennedy","All right. Thanks Charles. Epsilon\u2019s revenue increased to $543 million for the third quarter, up 2% compared to the third quarter of 2015. Importantly, adjusted EBITDA came in at $135 million, which was flat compared to prior year after two straight quarters of decline. So to give you an update on our business, let me first discuss the EBITDA results.","Our most critical focus at Epsilon for the last several quarters has been to alter the long-term trajectory of the cost structure required to support our business. And a big part of that has been the ramp up of the investment in our India operations to fuel the global staffing model. I am pleased that adjusted EBITDA after a Q1 decline of 22%, followed by a Q2 decline of 9% has leveled off flat in Q3, even while still carrying substantial duplicative costs. While it has taken perhaps a quarter or two longer than we originally anticipated, I think on the cost front we can safely say that our strategy is working and we expect to see that trend continue to play out positively in Q4.","So let us turn briefly to the revenue picture and a breakdown of the offerings within the Epsilon segment. I will start with agency media and services, roughly 25% of the total business. These offerings produced $138 million of revenue for the quarter, a decline of 5% versus prior year. At the beginning of the year this business line was one of our concern areas and our objective was quite simply to lower the drag that it was placing on overall growth rates.","We have made steady progress with each sequential quarter from a decline of 23% in Q1 to a decline of 15% in Q2 and in this quarter as you can see we have now narrowed that drag to a mid-single-digit decline. Two key drivers fueled this. First after a slow first half Epsilon\u2019s agency offering has generated a number of new wins, beginning to fuel back half growth, such as the agency of record win we announced this quarter with Del Monte Foods.","Second we have been working to pivot Conversant\u2019s agency media offering away from a commoditized offering with a dependence on large holding company agencies. We have got a sound plan in place and we are progressing each quarter. Specifically we are shifting towards an emphasis on more direct client relationships, on midsized agencies and on a data-driven digital media offering fuelled by our unique assets and scale.","An essential part of this plan involves the consolidation of all of our digital media onto what we call our core platform, which is the engine that fuels Conversant\u2019s data-rich, high-growth CRM business. And over the next two quarters we will have substantially migrated the agency business to this core platform. What that does for us is important. It increases the quality and granularity of the audiences we can offer to our clients and it enhances our ability to deliver the metrics that clients are looking for. So we are on a good track to continue the transition of this business.","Let us turn to the digital and technology platform\u2019s business, the other 75% of our revenue. We grew to $405 million of revenue for the quarter, up 5% over the third quarter of 2015. Performance here was lower than expected driven by two key offerings that I will outline; one on the negative side and one on the positive side.","First the negative, our Epsilon technology platform business consisting specifically of loyalty and data-based solutions was soft for the quarter dampening an otherwise healthy growth for this category. This technology platform area in particular has been the focal point of the cost initiatives I described earlier as we have worked to correct this historic issue of being able to produce nice top line growth without demonstrating equal or better profitability growth.","Consequentially at the same time as we have been pulling back to focus internally on reining in costs we are seeing some external market conditions spike up that include price pressure and increased competitive forces and in turn we missed some top line growth opportunities. Although it is critical to get to the cost side of this equation first, now that we are beginning to see it play out, we should be in a better position to return our focus on growth as we move through 2017.","On the positive side, the second driver for the quarter here was Conversant\u2019s CRM business, which continues to perform very well. This offering was up over 50% compared to prior year and really lead the growth for this overall category again. We continue to see strong demand with both new client wins and ongoing cross-sell into Epsilon\u2019s client portfolio, and as of this quarter we have closed 36 year-to-date wins and a book of business that already exceeds our 2015 book by over 25% in potential value.","In summary, if you look in aggregate we have put together so far for Epsilon\/Conversant, in hasn't been quite what we had hoped for, but we have gotten some critical things done and are moving in the right direction. We addressed the cost structure within Epsilon, where the demand by our clients for hot skills wasn't matching up with a market willing to let us pass on those costs. And while we might have lost some momentum on the growth front due to that this was the right priority for our business.","And we focused on the ongoing transformation at Conversant, while driving successfully the growth of our CRM business. We are happy with the progress there and really that is phase one that we are now wrapping up. Phase two will be our focus as we enter and move through 2017, completing the agency [pivot] at Conversant, expanding our CRM offering, putting our shoulder back into raising the growth profile of our database and loyalty business. We are well poised for that with our deep, unique assets and an excellent global team to service our clients.","All right. Back over to you Charles.","Charles Horn","Thanks Bryan. Let us flip over to Page 6 and talk about Card Services. Card Services had a better than expected quarter with revenue up 26% and adjusted EBITDA net up 14% compared to the third quarter of 2015. Now what really drove the over-performance and there is really several things that I would point to. First gross yields came in at 26.8%, 60 basis points better than original guidance and within 10 basis points of last year.","Essentially the cardholder friendly changes we made in mid-2015 have burned in and the related compression has dissipated. Second, we continue to drive operating expenses leveraging with operating expenses as a percentage of average card receivables dropping 30 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2015. Third, principal loss rates were 20 basis points better than guidance of 4.7% and trends in delinquency rates are moving consistent with our principal loss rate forecast for 2016.","Looking forward we believe the [Indiscernible] Q3 loss rate guidance is due to timing from seasonality and that we will give it back in Q4. Conversely we did see credit sale slow during the quarter. While we increased tender share with our brands by approximately 150 basis points during the third quarter, softness at several of our core brands dropped credit sales growth in our core to 3%, down from 7% growth in the first half of 2016.","We expect that softness to continue into the fourth quarter. Counterbalancing, we have had a terrific year with new signings; The Children\u2019s Place, Ulta Beauty, and Williams-Sonoma to name a few. Two of these brands have launched and we are seeing early and very encouraging results as we welcome new card members to the programs.","We have seen healthy applications in the first few weeks thanks to our new [Frictionless] mobile credit acquisition capability, which reduces the times to apply by 25% and reduces abandonment rates more than five times. Turning back to our solid loss performance we have a good view into the rest of the year, and expect that we will track in line with full year expectations. We also expect as vintages mature, we will see delinquencies normalize around the middle of 2017 with losses normalizing thereafter.","Ed will talk about this a bit later. With that I will turn it over to Ed.","Edward Heffernan","Great. All right. If everyone could be on Slide 8, it say third-quarter and full year outlook. It has a bunch of colored dots on it to make it easy to follow, and this is the commentary I will give on the quarter and full year, then we will go into a couple of other items and then 2017. And from a consolidated level, third quarter revenue of $1.9 billion, up 19% and earnings per share of $4.74, up 20%. Obviously this was the largest quarter we have ever had in our history, and needless to say very, very pleased at how strong a quarter it was especially in this environment of low growth for the economy.","Obviously compared to guidance we exceeded guidance by a lot, and I did want to break out our thinking in terms of how much to pass through and not pass through. We decided to sort of break it up into three pieces. Clearly some of it was timing. Our loss rate in Q3 was lower than expected but we expect the loss rate in Q4 to be to get that back and as a result, if you want to call $0.15 or $0.30 sort of that timing issue between quarters for loss rates that is just how it goes.","So we don't expect to recapture that additional $0.15. The second is yes, we are following through some of the over-performance into higher guidance. We have raised guidance twice this year and that is what hopefully we will continue to do as is our practice. And then finally the third is, a little bit of \u2013 we need a little bit more flexibility in Q4, specifically as it relates to our AIR MILES business in Canada.","As Charles talked about, we are now approaching the first time in the program\u2019s history where we are looking at actually expiring miles from \u2013 I think it was 1992 through 2011. So you have got 20 years about to expire. Now everyone has been informed of this five years ago and has been informed since then. However, we did not know exactly what the behavior was going to be as we are approaching the final end date here, and as a result what we found is there is volumes that have picked up fairly dramatically in terms of people wanting to look at redeeming their miles, and as a result what we found is that it did drive a big spike in redemption activity, which does drive a little bit of profit through to the bottom line as redemptions go up higher than anticipated and that is what you saw in Q3.","However, what we want to do is we want to make sure that the consumer is having a good experience and it has been challenging. We are putting therefore many millions of dollars into customer care. We have hired a ton of folks to work the phones on the redemption side. Up in Canada we have got management taking phone calls on the floor and as a result we want to make sure that the millions that we are putting into this customer experience effort gives \u2013 that is where we want to have the flexibility in terms of some of the excess from the Q3 over-performance. And so will we need it all? Don\u2019t know, but it is better to be prudent. It is better that you have a good experience up there because frankly we are getting flooded with folks trying to get this stuff in and our job is to make sure that we don't damage the brand.","So bear with us through the rest of the year. We think we are in very good shape, but we do want to have a little bit of flexibility here to make sure we can bulk up those resources as needed. So, we are raising annual guidance to 11% growth in top line or $7.2 billion and core EPS of $16.90 or 12%. Again I'm reminded of the beginning of the year when we started out and there were lots and lots of concern about the ability to continue to be a growth company in the face of normalizing credit conditions followed by frankly a very soft Q1 with only about 5% growth.","We knew the engine was going to pick up eventually. It did so starting in Q2. There were then concerns about whether that can continue forward. Hopefully this has finally put that thing to bed. And what you have is you are beginning to see what this model can do and what this model can do is double-digit, top line double-digit earnings growth, while also absorbing almost 10 percentage points of the growth rate from normalizing in losses.","Said differently, if we are guiding to 12%, in the environment that wouldn't have normalizing, we would have done over 20%. So that is what the model can do. We are very happy with it. And finally on the share repurchase side, I think we have done around 700 million so far, and corporate leverage ratio remains quite manageable at less than 3x. Again Charles hates when I use \u2013 when I round up or round down, but in general, you got about $5 billion of debt, you have got a little under a couple of billion of EBITDA, and again the EBITDA is measured for our covenants and indentures across the entire enterprise.","So you are talking well under 3x and that we feel is a very manageable level. So we are good there, and then for the first time since we have started the company we are in fact establishing a quarterly dividend at 1%, and that is to provide sort of a more balanced return to shareholders. So you are going to see both dividends and you are going to see share repurchases. We are a growth company and that is something that frankly I have debated for years and years and years. The tide certainly has swung in favor of let us do a combo platter of both dividend and share repurchase. That is what we are doing.","And being a growth company, one of the nice things is you have a dividend that is going to grow quite nicely in the coming years as we continue to grow at a rapid clip. So it is sort of a nice thing to have out there, and it is also not significant enough to our cash flow that it hampers our flexibility when it comes to either buybacks or M&A or additional growth in our card business.","Speaking of which, let us go to our card business, another heck of a quarter portfolio growth, over 20% for both the quarter and the full year. And that is great news for me. What I am more pleased with frankly is the fact that our tender share, which again is defined as the amount of sales at a retailer that flow through our card versus other forms of payments.","Basically it means that more and more of the dollars that are being spent at retailers are flowing through our card, and that either means that we are bringing on more and more folks. Perhaps they are folks with lesser credit quality. That has always been a question out there, and as we look at it we continue to see that is not the case, and in fact that 85% of the additional tender share or growth that is coming on our cards are coming from accounts that have been with us for three years or more.","So it means that the personalized data-driven marketing stuff, so to speak, works. We have had tender share gains of between 150 basis points and 180 basis points. What does that mean? It basically means if the retailer is doing a couple of points of sales growth while we are going to do somewhere between 5 to 8 points higher than that. That is how important this tender share growth is and that is why it is so important especially coming from those nice mature accounts.","Gross yields, Charles talked about, again that was a huge concern of folks at the beginning of the year when year-over-year we saw yields down over 200 basis points. We felt comfortable that that was going to clean itself up as the year of progressed, and sure enough by Q2 it was only down 80 and Q3 we are almost back to flat, so that is one big concern that we can check the box on.","Finally delinquency rates and principal loss rates are tracking around the 50 basis points for the full year. We talked about our Q3 loss rate was below sort of our guidance of almost a year ago, and Q4 loss rate will make up the difference, but overall you are going to slosh around and come in right around where we want it to be for the year.","The other huge thing that sort of got lost this year was the fact that this was by far the best year in our history in terms of signing high quality clients. And it was by far the biggest vintage we have ever signed, vintage meaning that most of these folks are starting from scratch. We have ramped them up over the process of three years, and when fully ramped up they should be adding north of $2 billion of portfolio growth.","And if you look at the clients Boscovs, Hot Topic, Forever 21, The Children\u2019s Place, Bed Bath & Beyond, Williams-Sonoma, Century 21, and Ulta Beauty you are talking about by far the best vintage in terms of size and quality that we\u2019ve ever had which suggest the market is still quite robust.","Alright, let\u2019s go onto the next page talk a little bit about Epsilon and Conversant as Bryan talked about. I would say if there was something that was bit of a disappointment so far this year it would have to be our top line at Epsilon frankly. We were hoping that we could pull off the cost restructuring in the whole India initiative well at the same time not losing any momentum on the revenue side, I think our appetite was a bit too large on that one, so the revenue growth is still choppy it was down 2% in Q1, was up 5% in Q2, is up 2% in Q3 that\u2019s not our model, that\u2019s not what we\u2019re shooting for, we want to get into a very solid mid single digit growth run rate on top line and actually have a very consistent flow through with some leverage to the bottom line. And in order to do that as Bryan talked about, we needed to completely revamp our cost structure essentially trying to mitigation the cost of the high skills with perhaps potentially some better leverage on the labor side and that was the whole India initiative where we have our office today and are very happy with all that things ramping up.","So, from I guess a longer term perspective, from my perspective, from Bryan\u2019s perspective we believe we have a cost structure fixed and you can see that it\u2019s beginning to actually show results with your EBITDA year-over-year going from a minus 22% decline to minus 9% to flat and I expect this going up 5% in Q4 and then we exit the year and hopefully put this thing behind us. We will have the cost structure in shape so that we can now go after the top line knowing what our costs are. So, it\u2019s been a long process and somewhat painful at times but nonetheless we\u2019re done with it.","We turn now to LoyaltyOne which comprises our European based BrandLoyalty business, what can you say there, they\u2019re continuing to track double digit growth in revenue and adjust the EBITDA for the year, it seems to be a machine the Canadian rollout has been very successful and we\u2019re looking at $45 million or so in revs just from that and it\u2019s only a year or so old and then we had a big announcement of our first client in the United States and that rollout is beginning to takeoff and with that hopefully we will have many more announcements moving on from there. Obviously, with the US being 10x the size of Canada, the opportunity there is quite large. ","Looking at AIR MILES which is our Canadian royalty business, we are seeing double digit growth in revenue some of that driven by the extra redemption activity that's flowing through, but we are seeing mid single digit growth in EBITDA as well. So, the program itself is vibrant, it\u2019s robust, it\u2019s still growing. It is far from sun setting that's for sure. And probably the only cautionary we have there is we are working very hard to make sure that the brand does not get scarred with some of the drama around the expiration of 20 years worth of miles. It's happening it's going to happen. It's one and done for us financially. We don't think there is much risk there. However, we are being very cautious in terms of making sure we put as many resources as we can against this thing from people etcetera, etcetera to make sure that the consumer experience is as good as possible even though it is a little bit crazy right now.","So that's where we are and let's now talk about the 2017 outlook again at a very high level. As we usually do this time of the year we give a base case and the base case is plus 10 plus 10. We expect also nicely growing cash flow, free cash flow to go along with that which you will tend to get with our type of business model. So that's the base. It doesn't assume any meaningful share repurchases, any meaningful M&A. And it also factors in what we believe is the final drag from the card services, loss rate, normalization. So again, you are talking we expect to grow double-double despite absorbing another 10 points potential earnings growth that's going towards this normalization process.","And right now from what we are seeing it looks pretty good out there. The consumer looks good. And we expect another solid year of double digit growth. So we started 2016 with a lot of folk skeptical that we could in fact hit double-double and in fact we are doing quite a bit above that despite absorbing this drag. We expect a similar rollout in 2017 and hopefully people now feel comfortable that this is the type of model that can absorb this type of normalization.","On LoyaltyOne what are the big things we are trying to do with BrandLoyalty continue what they are doing. It's pretty straight forward especially in North America let's keep going. There is a lot of wood to chop out there. So that's what we are going to be doing.","In AIR MILES, we expect to have a solid 2017 that being said, I do believe that we are going to get dinged a little bit on our brand in terms of this whole expiry process even though it will be over by the end of the year and will be on a very simple quarterly basis and you won\u2019t have the type of noise or drama. The fact is we are going to have to think hard about are we going to have to do something to make sure that our customers still feel well and respected and that they are getting value of the program. So we are going to watch very closely what the behavior is, what the reaction is and we are going to try to mitigate anything that comes out that somewhat negative","On Epsilon, Bryan talked about what we have done this year. Its critical next year that Conversant continue exceptional growth in its CRM business, this is the data driven business where we ingest skew level information from various clients. We then match up that type of behavior to unique Ids associated with folks out there and reach out to them with very targeted messaging that business has been growing rapidly 30%-40%-50% something like that, over 40%. And it's a big business. It's getting bigger and bigger. We are growing somewhere between $80 million and $100 million a year of revenue. And we expect that to be a big engine going forward.","What sort of lost in that is the whole agency piece of Conversant which again is when it's the old value click business where we use to provide inventory to the big holding companies on [indiscernible] that of course has gone the way of the rotary dial phone and what we are now doing is we have made the decision that this is absolutely a business that can be pivoted towards CRM-light or for those clients who don't need the full heavy duty CRM. It is just a list activation type program where we are reaching out very quickly for sale that's coming up in two days. This is a perfect way of doing it. So we think we have got a solution there that could also help feed eventually into the big CRM business.","On the core, Epsilon core we need to convert this new cost structure quite frankly into revenue growth. It's time to get going on this thing. We have got the cost structure that we want. We know how to price the deals now. And we expect to get some movement here on card services. It's going to be a little bit different in 2017. The focus will be laser like on existing organic growth and making sure there is huge book that we signed in 2016 has a very strong start up. So, we will probably be a little bit less on just looking for bulk out there in the marketplace that is big portfolios to purchase. We are looking more on taking our bread and butter which is these great names that have never had a program starting them from scratch, nurturing them and getting them moving and grooving. And we expect that allows us to keep the types of returns that is unique in the marketplace. So that's what we are focused on.","Also the less of a focus on pure bulk relates to the fact that some of these big files that are out there frankly the frothiness in the market is such that it's just not attracted to us so we are going to be very disciplined about it than here before we will do it again. Nonetheless we expect very solid growth in cards and we did not forget talking about the final stage normalization in credit quality which should take place this year. I did want to mention very quickly I have seen a couple of commentaries out there about the 2015 vintage and loosening credit and everything else so let me make it very clear. We did not loosen credit at all in any of our vintages. What happens however, as you get further and further away from coming back from the great recession is that the clients that you signed and the cardholder that sign up will tend to skew more towards the lower end of our acceptable range. But we did not lower standards at all. But what you have is more folks coming from the lower end of that acceptable range and it's not being balanced out at the higher end.","So as we moved into 2016, in the 2016 vintage you will see that we did in fact tried to balance that out a little bit better and so we did tweak the credit quality to be a little bit higher and that should balance out nicely. So I wanted to make sure that no one misunderstood that piece of it. Okay. I appreciate everyone's patience.","Let's go to the outlook with the fabulous chart that we have here. It says delinquency and the net loss rates and Charles and I and the folks at Card Services have spent I don't know how much time trying to figure out the easiest way to communicate and to provide comfort that this is not a runaway train and that in fact this is a normal process that needs to take place after a long period of abnormally low losses following the great recession. And we have been through every single possible scenario and have come up with probably the easiest way for people to view this and this is how we run our business frankly, which is you look at delinquency rates. So in account that delinquent need to flow through 180 days of being delinquent before it actually writes-off and that the write-off results in a charge to the P&L statement. And that means that you have a nice view into what the ultimate loss rate will be.","Delinquency rates have been the best predictor that there is in the card business and in our business for sure with 90% correlation over many, many, many years and so you will see from the first chart here, then in 2016 we saw our delinquency rates go from 42 to 47 and you saw our corresponding move on the loss rate side. We expect 2017 to be around a 5% and stabilize out there going into 2018 as well. How did we come up with this stuff? We just completed, we go through a portfolio by portfolio over 155 clients vintage by vintage in each portfolio, take a look at the aging and then we lay out what we believe the delinquency flows will be. This is what we are going to use. We will update this every month. We will provide this in our monthly release and this is really the best metric that we know that really captures everything. So if you start seeing these delinquency rates starts striking higher then chances are you are going to see losses as well.","Alright, let's go to our final page I believe, second or final page which is the 2000 outlook what we are calling closing the wedge. This is a very simple concept. What you are looking at here are delinquency curves as fascinating as they are, let's spend a couple of seconds on it and what you will see here is it's by month. What you will also see is how the curves look very similar and how they go up and down which means there is a great deal of seasonality to delinquencies and so for example when we released our recent monthly data and it showed a 5% or something on delinquencies and I got a couple of folks saying, oh my gosh, your delinquencies are going a bit seasonality. October, which we haven't released yet, you are going to be in low fives and then November, December, you are going to start dipping into the fours. That\u2019s just the way the cycle works. So again this is the best way to look at things and if you look at the orange line if you can see it that\u2019s 2016, it shows how it is above the red line by about 50 basis points which was 2015 and fairly consistently so. And that\u2019s right the good predictor of your loss rate.","As we go into 2017, this is the critical point. 2017 is the dotted blue line. You will see that we will enter 2017 we believe around that 50 or 60 basis point spread versus last year and then the whole bet comes down to does this gap start to narrow. Does the wedge close? If in fact the wedge closes, over the next couple of quarters and starts to narrow then you just know by definition that the eventual losses that are spit out based on those delinquencies will normalize as well. So what this essentially says is the normalization process is nearing its end, we get into Q1 we get through Q2, Q2 which starts to narrow and by the end of Q3, you are basically on top of where we were this year, which means the losses that come out after that are going to be flat to this year. And what does that all mean, it means earnings accelerate from the low double digits to the 20 plus that you are used to. So get used to the wedge. That's what we are going to be talking about. And it also takes a lot of the noise out of the system and the idea of talking about delinquency flows up and down and master trust and growth losses and net losses and total losses and everything else frankly the noise level it's hard to really get the message out there and so this is how we run our business if the wedge doesn't close, then we have another year that we got to fight through this thing in 2018. We do not believe that's the case, but we are trying to be as transparent as possible.","Alright finishing up on summary, over the past 15 years, this company has had revenue growth of 16% a year for 15 years. Core EPS has been up 26% each year for 15 years. As we look at 2016 and 2017, because of the normalization and loss rates which essentially means look the great recession washed a bunch of stuff out, you had sort of pristine credit only coming out of the recession and that\u2019s beginning to normalize now as people have repaired their credit and we\u2019ve a more normal consumer mix in our portfolio. It\u2019s nothing to get worked up about, it just means things are returning to a level that we had anticipated. But, the normalization process has knocked 10 points of our earnings growth and brought it from the 20s into the 12% we\u2019re looking at for 2016.","Nonetheless despite this normalization effort you have a model that sufficiently diversified and business is cycling at different times where we can absorb this hit and still grow double-digit as we have this year top and bottom in double-digit in 2017 and then back to the 20% after the wedge closes. At the end of the day I\u2019ll finish finally and say that I think the narrative for this company frankly has been lost this year in terms of the ways that has been out in the marketplace. We expect to regain the narrative and we will be talking more and more about the strategic positioning of this company why we believe financially even in a normalization period we\u2019re double-double when the wedge closes we go back to 20%, but there is a reason for that and the reason for that is all our businesses are benefitting from the secular trends that we\u2019re seeing whereby data and unique data is being used to gain insights to then provide marketing and creative that are then turned into personalized one-to-one communications to our client\u2019s customers and that\u2019s through the various digital channels where we have unique IDs on individuals around the world.","And that\u2019s a secular trend we expect to continue, it\u2019s certainly not going away and it\u2019s something that we are very excited about across all our businesses and as a result our time as long as the wedge is closing and we\u2019re on track for our double-double we will be spending more time trying to explain what really makes the model unique and has been so successful for 15 years. So that\u2019s it, I\u2019m going to wrap it up and turn over to Q&A. Operator.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Ashish Sabadra with Deutsche Bank.","Ashish Sabadra","Good morning, thanks, solid beat. My question was around Epsilon, so Ed you talked about it being choppy and you\u2019re taking all the right measure on the cost structure. My question was can you also talk about the demand environment and the competitive environment is there anything going on there which has caused the softness in the technology, revenues that moderated quite a bit from 15% to 5%?","Bryan Kennedy","Sure, I\u2019ll take that question. I think, I mean that\u2019s something that we look at pretty carefully there is no question that there are lot of companies that are playing in this space and have entered the space from the big Google and Facebook of the world that provide solutions to SAS players to the big agency holding companies that are scrambling to put together technology and data solution. Now, we stand back and look at it and we think that it\u2019s still a very vibrant market, we have a particular focus which is to bring our data driven solutions together with technology and creative and deliver those in kind of a client intimate ways. So, we\u2019re looking for the segment of the market where clients really value a services rich sort of deliver that\u2019s not going to be the model that the entire market will chase after, but we think that there is plenty for us.","So, I think for Epsilon at this point this is a bit more of a scenario where our win rate has slowed a bit that perhaps is because you\u2019ve been more picky and cautious with all of the focus on costs. And then, if you look at our existing client base, we\u2019ve seen a bit of a pullback in some of our large clients again perhaps that\u2019s a loss of focus that something that we better workout as we move through 2017, we certainly will have a much more intense focus on growth as we roll into the year. So, a couple of factors out there but I don\u2019t think major drivers for this market.","Ashish Sabadra","Thanks for that color Bryan, very helpful. Second question Charles was on the delinquencies, on the slide 11 you talk about \u2013 the slide talks about delinquencies going up 30 basis point in 2017 that\u2019s lower than the expectations for the charge off increased by 50 basis point, I was wondering if you can provide some more color there and how much confidence do you have in the delinquencies only go up 30 basis point?","Charles Horn","It\u2019s one of those I would say we\u2019ve pretty good confidence in what we have here Ashish, you can see as Ed talked about we built this up portfolio to portfolio, we do expect as you look at the gap on page 12 would be most pronouncing the first two quarters then narrowing in the third and fourth quarter. Going back to what Ed talked about if you look in the Trust which is not a great illustration but it\u2019s a little bit of a sample. You could see the 2015 vintage went quickly to loss, the 2016 vintage is going much slower it takes about two years for an account to get what we comment to and less risky. So that 2015 will be flowing through by the middle of 2017 and that\u2019s why you will see that wedge close quite appreciably. So, I would say right now that obviously we\u2019re looking for the 12 months, more than 12 months, we turn the portfolio every six months. So we can get pretty good visibility to it and we can make changes to the portfolio as necessary to track to the numbers we are looking for.","Edward Heffernan","Yes. I mean the way I look at it is just math, if you are going to be up your 50 basis points it's kind of what we are talking about at the beginning of the year and then the gap starts to narrow and then you are running in the back half at almost flat to where you are. By definition you are not going to be up your 50 or 60 basis points because of the math.","Ashish Sabadra","Okay. That's very helpful. Thanks for that color. And maybe the last question on the \u2013 if I based on the fiscal year 2016 guidance if I back into the fourth quarter number that implies a softness like the revenue moderate to 8% growth for fourth quarter. Is that just conservatism or are there puts and takes there that we need to be aware of?","Edward Heffernan","It primarily goes back to what we talked about with LoyaltyOne and AIR MILES where we had a big ramp in revenue in Q3. We think some of that is pull forward out of Q4. So we already expect that the AIR MILES revenue to drop in Q4 and that's really what you are seeing sequentially.","Ashish Sabadra","Okay. That's helpful. Congrats once again on the solid quarter. Thanks.","Edward Heffernan","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Wayne Johnson with Raymond James.","Wayne Johnson","Hi, yes good morning. Ed I was hoping that we could touch base a little bit on the card services and the four growth components namely same-stores sales growth, tender share, new account wins and then portfolio purchases. In the past you parsed that out when we asked about it and I was hoping you could do the same again as we look forward into 2017?","Edward Heffernan","Sure I would be happy to Wayne, I think one of the areas that is of concern is the fact that our client base although the consumer right is doing quite well and is holding up the economy what we are not seeing is we are not seeing that translate into a lot of good growth at our clients. What we are seeing that our clients probably overall is actually they are same-stores sales Wayne have been down 1% to 2%. And that's not new news to anyone, but soft good apparel high end home furnishings, jewelry stuff like that you are just not seeing the consumer spend there. The consumer spending it on autos and things like that which of course benefits our auto business, but so the same-stores sales are probably minus 1, minus 2, and as a result with the tender share gains we can get probably plus 5, plus 6 and sales growth from the core whereas before we used to do plus 10 when the clients were doing plus 3. So you have sort of down shifted a little bit in terms of expectations from the core. We still expect to get somewhere between 5% and 8% point above same-stores sales of the clients but right now we are seeing softness.","I know the NRF came out and suggested we are going to have a pretty decent holiday, hopefully that is the case. But again that's sort of down shifted. Sort of mitigating that for us has been the fact that the vintage that we did sign for 2016 frankly was well north of what's going to be a 2 billion add to the file. The big growth chains like in [indiscernible] and forever 21s of the world those are going to do quite well. The other ones are very large clients [Williamson] owners of the world. They are beyond of the world. They are going to be good size files and so I would say that weakness on the core client base itself is going to be mitigated by the ramp up on the organic side from the big 2016 vintage.","As we look at big portfolio purchases in 2017 frankly, we don't see much out there that is hugely attractive if we do something it will have to be some very strict hurdles rates we are not going to dilute the business. We want to see our yields hold up very firmly through 2017. So, we may sacrifice a bit of growth on the portfolio to maintain more robust yields and a better use of capital. So look for 2017 to reflect a little less robust growth from the core due to the core itself the retailers being sort of sub-par growth on their sales but we do expect the tender share gain and very strong 2016 contribution.","Wayne Johnson","I appreciate that response. That's very helpful. And just a quick follow up if I may so on the tender share gain can you just talk little bit about where, what the tender share is for matured retail customer or customer you have had three or four or so. What's that wallet share versus a new client when they are brought on board and what's driving that cadence?","Edward Heffernan","Sure, fair question. Essentially when for those of you not all that familiar with wallet share it's essentially right the percentage of the retailer sales that flow through our card. The first answer to where it is when we start the program I can even do that without rounding. It's at zero. And then over the course of three years we will probably get it to around 30% or so of all sales at that retail flow through our card. And then, the real fun stuff kicks in that the longer we have our client, the more skew level information we have on the customers of that client which means the more precise the targeting is when we do all of our targeting to the clients through all the different channels that whether it's point of sale or whether it's through all the various digital channels using Conversant. And we actually have a number of clients who are over 50%. And what we are finding is a huge chunk of the incremental pickup for us Wayne is through the online channels, these retailers are using online very effectively and our online sales are probably close to 40% of total card sales versus the retailers which are maybe 20%. So you can expect to see the slow creep from 30% tend to share up to as much as 50% over a period of ten years.","Wayne Johnson","Great, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Andrew Jeffrey with Sun Trust.","Andrew Jeffrey","Hi guys. I appreciate you taking the questions this morning. Just a question with regard to the wedge add which I think is a great way to frame up your expectations. When you talk about normalization just cause that -- would you say that as the credit cycle progressed and you saw the 2015 vintage sort of evolve that underwriting tightened a little bit and that's why you are so sure that as there is vintages season that the loss rates will moderate or is there something else at work? I am just trying to get a little granularity on your confidence level there and what\u2019s driving in?","Edward Heffernan","Yes, Charles can take care, but the bigger thing is that the losses, in the great recession you flushed out more than you normally would in a more typical recession and as a result what was left over who was left standing meant that you had a lot of like super prime coming into the file which is not really our bread and butter. We are much more in the sort of mid to upper prime type range and what's happened over the course of the number of years the recession is in the rare view mirror, you are having more and more folks who have repaired their credit, who are back in the market, who have jobs again, who are working and they tend to flow into the file and as a result what you saw was it's less about losses going up is more about losses are beginning to conform more to sort of the type of consumer that we cater to. So that\u2019s sort of the big, sort of misperception out there of \u2013 we\u2019re not shooting for 4% loss rate that\u2019s not how we optimize a file. When you\u2019re talking to folks that we want and the people who visit the stores, our loss rate we believe is optimized at a higher level and those are the folks that have been flowing in specific to your question, yes, when we saw the 2015 vintage and we saw that we were kind of, it\u2019s looks like a lot of the prime folks who are at the high end of the pool, there are few of those and more folks who still matter credit card carrier but it was a little bit lower in the overall pecking order. They tended to dominate a little bit more and we needed to tighten up a little bit.","Bryan Kennedy","Not a lot I can add to it, this is purely mix. A higher percentage of applications in the early part of coming out of the recession are high quality individuals, super prime because you basically burned a lot of the market. As they start to repair their credit four or five years thereafter they start applying for credit hitting the bottom end of it and writing quite seriously. So, you have a mix shift that you can adjust if it gets beyond a certain spectrum and that\u2019s what we did. 2015 move to little bit, quicker than what we thought it would so we tightened up little bit in 2016 to keep a track into the numbers we want.","Andrew Jeffrey","Okay, thanks. And just as a quick followup can you just talk a little bit about how you view Amazon with regard to its impact on your client same store sales recognizing the tender share may get some of the impact?","Edward Heffernan","Yes, whether it\u2019s Amazon or the whole online Amazon affect, what it essentially done is two things. First, it has made shoppers much more educated when it comes to where they can get the best price. So whereas before you had folks who has a little bit hit or miss, now everyone has got their phone, everyone is comparing prices and as a result that\u2019s what putting a lot of pressure on our clients which is really on the pricing side and so that\u2019s why the margins have been so tough at our clients. Obviously, the whole online space makes it a lot more convenient for people to work, I do think the retailers in our space are coming back strongly with their online offerings and will make a nice dent on that side of it. But Andrew, I really from what we\u2019re seeing it\u2019s the pricing side of it, it is your Amazon has educated the consumer to such a degree that the consumer, no one pays full price anymore and as a result your sales are suffering as much from pricing declines as from just unit declines. So that's what the retailers are struggling with is what is the new model. What we are trying to do is obviously this flows very nicely into how we run our business which is you can't just have $200 million marketing budget and go out and splash it around to everyone. You need to be much more precise, much more effective with how you market to folks down to one-one-one level. So this impact has been driving quite a bit of thinking on the part of retailers to change what has been for decades their way of going about marketing and moving towards the unique data driven personalized approach we do.","Andrew Jeffrey","Okay. Thanks a lot. Appreciate it.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Brett Huff with Stephens.","Brett Huff","Good morning guys. Thanks for taking my question. First question on Epsilon, you talked a little bit about sort of some of the things you going through and I think you said you needed to kind of refocus on some of those big clients that they have pulled back their spending and maybe there is loss of focus as you\u2019re reducing cost. Can you talk about how that might compare to any structural changes that you see because you mentioned it wasn't structural, but I just want to make sure I understand that point that you made?","Edward Heffernan","Yes, sure Brett, I mean, I think from the perspective of existing client relationships obviously you got to do an excellent job of serving clients, walking the halls, bringing solutions to them that really meet the needs that they have. And I mean, we strongly believe that that demand for full service kind of strategic support is still rich in the marketplace. There are certainly alternatives with software as a solution kind of offerings that will allow client to maybe do something in-house. Over the long haul our bet is that the kind of skills required to really make that work and to drive results are difficult to create within a client's organization. So, I think from a market perspective having watched us for 20 years I don't see that that's going to change radically. So that's kind of the focus point for our business.","In terms of whether there is something structural that goes well beyond that again we will watch that quarter to quarter but we really believe strongly and this is coming from the voice of the clients that we serve and the global 1000 CMO that we are targeting that needed there in the marketplace and those are the skills that they don't have in-house. The focus issue for us and really they\u2019re using famous foundation and places, the change we did see is scenario where the kinds of skills that you need to service those relationships aren't always matched up with the client\u2019s willingness to continue more for those as cost of living goes up etcetera. So that's really the driver behind our shift on the cost structure.","Brett Huff","Great, that's helpful, thank you. And just second follow-up question on card. Ed, I think you mentioned more folks in organic growth less buying portfolios I think you have also in the past said that there are couple of programs you are going to non-renew, I want to know the status of those were in your commentary of focusing on organic growth and if there is any knock-on effects from that non-renewal, should we expect more of that overtime from some of those clients or does that moderate?","Charles Horn","So, in the first quarter we did put the two portfolios to help our sale knowing that we were not going to renew them at the end of 2016. We would expect those two programs to be gone from ADS by the end of 2016. If you look at the average card receivables we gave you, we excluded already. So we are not considering that in the growth rate. So I don't think it's going to have any meaningful effect going into 2017 especially to Ed's point given that very strong 2016 vintage we signed to replace it.","Brett Huff","Okay. That's all I need. Thanks guys.","Operator","And our final question will come from the line of Robert Mattson with Dougherty & Company.","Robert Mattson","Thanks for taking my call and congratulations on the quarter. Ed quick question. The dividend and for long time I guess the preference was to not protect [indiscernible]. I guess a little thought here is this, you curiously book up your cash flow in the three buckets M&A, funding the receivables and then share returns. Will this strictly come out of the share returns or will this be incremental and obviously we see this as maybe pulling little out of M&A, a little out of funding and then also you mentioned about it growing, should we also be thinking this as some of the payout ratio and should grow more or less with those?","Edward Heffernan","So on the first one Robert I would say this adds to fourth option that we can flex based on what we see in the market. It could flex against M&A, it could flex against buyback. So it's really just fourth item we can consider on our capital allocation strategy.","Robert Mattson","Okay. And I guess going on to Epsilon on a little bit different angle. Let's talk about the current customers. If you look out in the space there is a lot of vendors particularly in the technology side versus Derby, which is one of your partners. They are seeing opportunities to gain share, they\u2019re seeing lot of activities, lot of activities on the digital transformations and the data driven marketing. Opportunity spend against share could you elaborate a little bit more Bryan I guess on kind of activity you can do to bring the growth rate higher and make them more durable to get around away from this choppiness. It would seem to me that the growth rate should be able to get higher give rate of market strength and desires where most thing down this path?","Edward Heffernan","Yes, I mean no question there right now given all of the options in the space it's kind of a complicated decision process for our clients to navigate in terms of thinking through all of those options and then selecting the right choice. I mean, part of what we have done historically is position ourselves is kind of a trusted adviser that has the ability to really help a client navigate those decisions and then actually drive outcomes from their investments. That's a different position than a lot of the other providers including some of our partners who are little more focused on a software sale with less accountability and responsibility to really drive results. So part of what we need to do better I think is kind of double down on that bet in terms of educating our clients. And then focusing carefully on the players that really value this sort of services that we bring to the table and not frankly chasing everything.","The other side of it from our perspective is when you look at the assets that Conversant brings to the table from a digital execution perspective, from the ability to really have pristine cross device capabilities and then incredible ability to reach consumers. When you put that together with our big technology platforms including harmony and database and loyalty platforms you start to really see I think some significant differentiation in terms of what we do versus the rest of the marketplace. We have frankly not put our shoulder significantly into that effort. It\u2019s part of what we are working on right now in fact we have several key pilots with clients that being to put those capabilities together on a more integrated way and I think that's going to be a key effort for us as we move through 2017, that will start to drive part of what you are asking about.","Robert Mattson","Okay and I guess this is final question, going back to the delinquency trajectories, if we were to look at the ability to meet that wedge, missing the wedge would that be, is anything intrinsic to your portfolio or this be largely a broader macro event?","Edward Heffernan","This is the portfolio by portfolio roll up, so again we go through all 155 portfolios every vintage in it and we will see where they are and life of the account and how the curves are looking and then we project out. So it does not assume any huge improvement on the macro side at all.","Robert Mattson","Okay, great, thanks a lot.","Edward Heffernan","Okay. So I think that's it. Thank you for all your time and we will talk you next time. Bye, bye.","Operator","Thank you.

At this time, all parties have been placed on a listen-only-mode. Following today's presentation, the floor will be open for your questions. [Operator Instructions] In order to view the company's presentation on their website, please remember to turn off the pop-up blocker on your computer.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Ms. Annelise Han of FTI Consulting. Annelise, the floor is yours.","Annelise Han","Thank you, operator. By now you should have received a copy of the company's second quarter 2017 earnings release. If you haven't, please call FTI Consulting at 212-850-5721.","On the call today, we have Ed Heffernan, President and Chief Executive Officer of Alliance Data; and Charles Horn, Chief Financial Officer of Alliance Data.","Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on today's call and some of the responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risks and the uncertainties described in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC. Alliance Data has no obligation to update the information presented on the call.","Also, on today's call, our speakers will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe will provide useful information for investors. Reconciliation of those measures to GAAP will be posted on the Investor Relations website at www.alliancedata.com.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Ed Heffernan. Ed?","Ed Heffernan","Great. Thank you, Annelise.","Today, we're going to stick with the same format that we did last quarter, which is probably fairly brief commentary by Charles and myself. And then, we'll open it up for questions.","So obviously joining me today is Charles Horn, our CFO, and he is going to walk you through the second quarter results. And then, we'll turn our attention to the full-year outlook. How we're doing against our goals for the year. And then also, we believe at this point, we feel pretty good about putting a stake in the ground for 2018.","So with that being said, Charles?","Charles Horn","Thanks, Ed. The second quarter came in slightly better than expected with both the revenue and core EPS up 4% from the second quarter of 2016. We saw continued strength at Epsilon and Card Services and positive momentum at AIR MILES in both miles issued and adjusted EBITDA margin, which returned to the mid-20s range during the quarter.","However, brand loyalty continues to fight through some timing issues. Revenue down about 30% for the second quarter, and we now expect that trend will continue through the third quarter. Setting the unexpected softness of BrandLoyalty aside, we are delivering on our three major objectives for 2017.","First, restoring Epsilon to both positive revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth. Second, delivering on credit normalization. And third, retooling the AIR MILES model. During the quarter, we concluded our 500 million share repurchase program. In addition, we augmented our liquidity during the second quarter by replacing and upsizing our corporate credit facility. Its maturity is now 2022 and its capacity is $4.6 billion, up $500 million from the previous facility.","Let's go on to the next slide and talk about LoyaltyOne. It was a soft quarter for LoyaltyOne, if we breakdown the segment by major business. AIR MILES revenue decreased 12% to $179 million for the second quarter of 2017, driven by 13% decline in AIR MILES reward miles redeemed. The decline in miles redeemed was expected given the elevated redemption rates in the second quarter of 2016. The burn rate, which is miles redeemed divided by miles issued dropped to 76% this year versus 86% last year, and that's the range that we really try to operate this program to 76%.","AIR MILES issued was down less than 1% year-over-year and that's improvements from the 4% decline in Q1 due to several sponsors driven promotions in May and June. We continue to see steady improvement in collector engagement and activation and our collector retention rate currently sits at 98%. As a result, we expect issuance growth to turn positive in the back half of the year.","Our adjusted EBITDA margin at AIR MILES improved during the quarter, and are trending towards mid-20s guidance for the year. We continue to look for ways to streamline cost while better serving and adding value to our collectors.","During the quarter, we significantly expanded travel options for our collectors, while also providing more ways to book in AIR MILES.","BrandLoyalty's revenue decreased by 32% to $101 million for the second quarter of 2017. Several programs that were executed in the second quarter of 2016 are now scheduled for the fourth quarter of 2017.","Timing of the short-term promotions are driven by the client, so having program execution shift from one quarter to another is expected. Adjusted EBITDA margins for BrandLoyalty dropped into the mid-single digit range for the quarter due to its high fixed cost structure.","Let's move on to Epsilon. Epsilon carried its solid momentum from Q1 into Q2 with the revenue increasing 5% to $544 million and adjusted EBITDA increasing 4% to $107 million compared to the second quarter of 2016.","Once again, we saw solid top-line performance within our key product offerings, coupled with strong expense control. In particular, salary and wage expense increased only 1%, but was offset by onboarding cost associated with two new significant clients moderated EBITDA margin expansion during the quarter.","Breaking down revenue by offering, our agency and auto offerings continue to grow double-digits with auto benefitting from solid first half wins such as Hyundai and Volvo. Our digital media offering noticed converged CRM continued its double-digit growth trend increasing approximately 30% year-over-year. Our data and CJ Affiliate offerings were stable with low single-digit growth.","Importantly, Epsilon's technology platforms offering continue to show progress toward a promising turnaround narrowing to a 3% decrease for the second quarter sequentially improving again, since exiting Q4 2016 with a double-digit decline. Decline basis showing stability, and we have seen an increased win rate on the basis of the introduction of cloud based, more packaged products into the market.","Finally, Conversant Agency business continues to be a drag in Epsilon's growth rate, about a 150 basis points for the quarter. Stabilizing this non-core offering has been a challenge, but frankly its diminishing size, lessens the overall revenue impact moving forward. Putting these trends together, we are looking for revenue growth of 7% or better in the back half of 2017.","Let's go to slide six, and talk about Card Services. Card Services had another solid quarter as revenue increased 13% to slightly over $1 billion, and adjusted EBITDA net increased 11% to $306 million, despite a large provision billed. Notably, this was the 22nd consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth for Card Services.","Total credit sales increased 6% with core programs those greater than three years old delivering low single-digit growth despite softness in the retail sector. A couple of reasons, we continue to grow credit sales. First, diversity of plants, specifically brands such as Wayfair, Zalez [ph] and Ulta Beauty had helped to mitigate weakness in the apparel vertical.","Second, is the migration of sales from bricks and mortar to non-store channels. Over 30% of our credit sales are non-store versus the industry average of about 15%. Card receivables grew to just under $16 billion, an increase of 17% over the second quarter of 2016 consistent with our expectations of mid-teens growth for the year.","We continue to drive operating leverage as operating expenses expressed its percentage of overall receivables, dropped from 9.5% in the second quarter of 2016 to 8.6% in the second quarter of 2017, a 90-basis point improvement. The net loss rate was 6.2% for the second quarter of 2017, a 10-basis point improvement over the first quarter of 2017.","The gross loss rate continues to trend with our delinquency forecast, which suggests lower rates in 2018. Our recovery rate is down this year, it was about 18% in Q2 of 2017 versus 23% in Q2 2016, pressuring the net loss rate primarily due to lower pricing in the third-party recovery market.","Ed will talk later about how we are stepping up our in-house recovery efforts to combat the lower pricing.","I will now turn it over to Ed.","Ed Heffernan","Thanks, Charles. Thinking here, we'll also have the wedge that was provided to you and that's just sort of illustrative of how we're doing against what we first actually introduced, I believe it was October of last year.","So, if you will turn to slide nine, which is the second quarter of 2017. Again, just sort of quickly reviewing all the points Charles made, consolidated plus four, bottom-line plus four, we are looking for about that range on top-line and that's a little bit better than what we had anticipated on core EPS, where we had gotten to more like flat.","Again, in terms of the businesses, Card Services growth continues to be quite strong. Epsilon, which is the second consecutive quarter of what we like to call repeatable growth, so we don't have all the big dips that we've had in the past sort of the false starts and then disappointment, so it looks like things are going along pretty nicely there.","And then in LoyaltyOne Canada, some good news there; the actual EBITDA margins up there came in in the mid-20s, which is really where we want to be for the full year or so. The model has been retooled, and now we are just getting ready to crank it back up, probably the one disappointing area was on the BrandLoyalty side, less so on Q2, we knew Q2 would be soft, but a bit more in terms of when we expect to bring on a number of these programs, we will talk about that a little bit later.","Again, the three goals for this year that we've laid out over the last six months would be one, Epsilon Conversant, let's make sure we have repeatable growth quarter-after-quarter both top-line and bottom-line. And we feel comfortable at this point that we have seen - we're seeing the daylight and in fact we were looking to see a little bit of acceleration on top-line as we go into the back half.","Number two was the big old question of credit normalization, our loss is going to continue to go up, or we firmly beginning to see a plateau and this is just a normalization process. And we're dead on track with the wedge that we put out back in October. So, we can check the box here. And then the third was the retooling of the loyalty program in Canada and that is coming along pretty nicely.","So, let's go ahead and turn to Epsilon in our full-year outlook. Again, we talked about the repeatability of the performance, that sort of the key thing we've been focused on and the ability to deliver sort of at least this year that mid-single-digit sort of top and bottom-line, which will hopefully begin to strengthen a bit as we move into '18 and beyond, as we finish the turn in the technology platform. But we did have a decent second quarter both top-line and bottom, it's the second consecutive quarter and frankly this hasn't occurred since back in 2015. So, as we look into Q3 and Q4, we see that trend continuing.","The big sort of work we had to do this year was to confirm that we can retool, repackage the technology business, which is about 25% of Epsilon's revenue, these are the big platforms that we build both the big database platforms and the big loyalty platforms.","And if you recall that got hit pretty hard last year, as we realized that our pricing was not competitive and our time to market was not competitive. We repackaged all that and the revenue which was down that segment 13% in Q4 of last year was cut to 7% in Q1 and 3% in Q2. And we are very nicely on track to get that to flat by year-end and then we'll be up low single-digits as we move into '18. So, the turn there is for real and that that certainly going to benefit us going forward. So, that's a good relief.","During the quarter and really for the year, the major growth drivers obviously the big digital media business, the Conversant CRM offering is really on fire and doing extremely well as or both the auto businesses and the agency businesses. And the auto business, you know you hear some weakness in card sales and stuff, that's not really where a lot of our focus is, we're more on after the sale was made, a lot of the communications and personalization that go out there to an existing card owner about what's going on and time to bring in for this or that from a servicing perspective. So, we expect that to continue to be strong. Also, we're onboarding couple of major new brands, which should set us up nicely for '18.","Full-year guidance, comfortably on track for what we've been talking about, which is sort of the mid-single-digit rev and EBITDA growth, I'd say the one tad bit of new news would be that we do expect top-line to accelerate up to around 7% plus in the back half based on what we are seeing and how quickly the Tech Platform has turned. So, that's probably the new news coming out of Epsilon Conversant.","I'll finish up on this with Conversant itself, if you were to rip apart, the various pieces to look at, just the Conversant stuff that we acquired back at the very end of '14, which you would find is that that business, those businesses are running in the high single-digit, which is exactly what the original acquisition model was based upon.","So, a little bumpy getting from A to B; we probably went through most of the alphabet before we got to be, but right now, it looks like that acquisition is beginning to pay off nicely. So, that's why we are in that one. Why don't we turn our attention to the next group, which would be LoyaltyOne?","And again, this is where you've got a little bit of some messy numbers to sort of sort through. Again, in terms of guidance, no change for Canada, we guided this year to about 760 of revs and about a $180 million of adjusted EBITDA. That would put our margins right around in the mid-20s. And if you recall with the resets, and the issues that came up last year from legislative perspective, you know that knocked our margins down into the teens in Q2 and for the rest of the year, we're already back in the 20's, mid-20's actually, which is very nice. So, we've put the changes through, they're working. And so, we believe that model is once again going to deliver what we expect to on a go forward basis.","Again, there were the questions out there in terms of was there damage done to the brand? With all the noise last year, and the place you look for that would be on both the sponsor side, those are the big names that pay us to issue the miles, and then the collector side, which are the actual consumers who use the program.","And as of right now, we feel very comfortable that we don't expect to see any attrition whatsoever on the sponsor side, which is great news. In fact, most of them, the general theme that we're getting from them is enough already, move on, and let's get going. So, that's good news there.","And then on the consumer side, which is sort of the issuance side, a measure of health is, our people using it to drive additional sales, additional issuances of miles. We were down 4% in Q1, that's now swung to really minus 1%, almost flat in Q2 and we're on track to be back sort of our long-term plus 5% run rate by year-end. In fact, we'll break our heads above water in Q3. So again, I think the program after taking a couple of body blows last year has come back nicely without any permanent damage and we were able to retool the model.","Okay, BrandLoyalty. We don't really talk too much about that, it's been such a consistent grower since they joined the company back in '14. In fact, if you looked at the last three years, I think the numbers are high-teens.","Annual revenue growth in sort of low double-digit in terms of EBITDA growth; very high grower, consistent grower over the last three years. It looks like we've got a bit of a timing issue this year to explain it a little bit, we've got 135 clients in the business over across 40 countries, roughly 200 and 250 programs we run each year. Again, these are the grocers and these are their sort of quarterly quick hit promotional type programs to drive sales during the quarter. And they're heavily influenced by major events.","Again, this is our international business, and so things like the Rio Olympics in '16 and the Euro Cup in '16 drove a lot of programs. We knew we didn't have that in '17 and '18, the World Cup, so we expect that actually will bring on a lot of promotional programs. So, the question is in '17, what made us think we were going to get that double-digit growth when we didn't have the big events out there helping to drive it.","Frankly, we were hoping that the big agreement we signed with Disney would have happen a little bit sooner and we could have gotten some traction out of that. Again, that's the agreement that allows us to provide a lot of these programs with Disney type merchandise across all of EMEA. And that we expect which is coming online in Q4 is going to be a strong driver for '18 along with the World Cup. So, you're going to see sort of a very, very strong year in '18, less so in '17.","So, what's it all mean from a visibility perspective, we were looking at the big ramp up being Q3, Q4 of this year. It shifted to Q4 and Q1 of this year and Q1 of next year. And so, you've got a shift of really. We have a strong visibility into Q4, we've got the program signed, we're looking at 25% plus revenue growth in Q4 and 40% EBITDA growth in Q4. And we expect a very strong jump off in Q1 as number of these programs ramp up.","So, I think that while disappointing that we didn't get these things wrapped up sooner, the good news is there is no issue from a business model perspective. We just have a timing issue on a business that usually has been very consistent on an annual basis year-to-year. So, you get about $0.40 where we are planning on in Q3 of '17 that's been shifted into our '18 guidance. So, we've increased to '18 guidance accordingly.","All right, Card Services, let's go to them. Receivable growth 15% plus again very strong, pipeline robust tracking to another $2 billion, vintage again that means when all the signings have ramped up, they will add $2 billion of portfolio growth to the business. And where are they coming from, right? This is the question we get all the time.","And they are coming from varied sources. Obviously, our focus has been in parallel in soft goods and home furnishings and jewelry and there is a ton of wood to chop there. But the type of retailer is changing a bit, and so you will see our announcements will be more of a combo platter of traditional hybrid which is both store and online as well as pure online players. And in terms of the pure online players, these could be startups that weren't even around a couple years ago.","But also, there is quite a few sorts of established names, very well-known names that no longer feel the need to use department stores as their primary platform and are actually striking out on their own in developing pure e-commerce models. And that allows us to step in and they would be perfect sizes for us as opposed to some of the monster department stores, which the portfolios are just too big for us. So, we view it as a pretty good opportunity to continue to grow the business.","In terms of the financials, the yields are stable. We're getting nice operating leverage out of the business. And then probably the second big question over the last two years has been around credit losses and are they normalizing, are they not normalizing? When do they stop going up? Because that really drives a good chunk of how the earnings flow through the business itself.","And we brought out last October, what we call the wedge, which is essentially looking at the best future predictor of losses, which of course are delinquencies. So, certain percentage of delinquent accounts after 180 days are written-off and those can be very predictable over at least six to nine-month period. What sort of amazes me is the fact that we put out the chart back in October and we are dead on with the wedge.","So, we have looked at Q1 where delinquencies were up 50 basis points year-over-year, Q2 averaged 40 basis points over the last year and now we're entering sort of the front part, which is Q3, Q4. Q3, you are going to see that thing dropped pretty dramatically and we're going to wind up about 20 basis points over, and then we'll be flat in Q4. And all that means is flat delinquencies means that loss rates will be no longer going up in '18 and will be flat to lower for 2018. And that's when we know that you have the slingshot that we've talked about so much in earnings confusion on having to set aside all those reserves.","All right, in terms of any noise on the business, the principal loss rates. Again, we thought that loss rates gross loss rates right now are tracking up about 50 basis points, which is what we expected. The noise that you are hearing in the marketplace has to do with recoveries and again recoveries account for lowering the loss rates by as much as 20%, 25%, so they are important.","And what you've had in the market this year is that there is a lot of paper that's being sold to third parties on the market we participate in that program. We also do a bunch in-house and what we see in this year is a very, very soft recovery market, number of reasons have been given, I don't really know which is the correct one, but so, we are looking at a situation that we run into back probably in '09, in '10 where we sort of swung using the external third-party market and decided we're going to do it all in-house and because we're going to get a better yield on that and that's what we're going to do this year.","So, you are going to move from a model, where you are using the third-party market, you get the sale, you booked a recovery amount, it's - you get the short-term benefit against the quarter, but because of the pricing it's going to be a lower benefit than in the past versus if we're sowing in in-house, we hire our own people, we ramp up that process, we're going to get recoveries that are going to be back in the low 20% range, which is really what we want and so that pushes out the benefit a little bit, but from a cash flow perspective it's a no-brainer.","We're going to be tinkering with that for the rest of the year, what we are definitely swinging more to the in-house, how much more either will it be 80%, it will be a 100%, we don't know yet but we're going to tinker with it, we're going to see how that's going, we're clearly going to be going in that direction until the third-party market firms up, because we know we can get the type of recovery rates that we need by bringing in in-house.","What is that all mean, at the end of the day from a full-year guidance perspective, we certainly still expect mid-teens revenue growth on the top-line and then importantly, the sort of what I would call operating cash flow or what we call adjusted EBITDA net, which is it's a little bit of funny term, but it essentially includes all these provision costs that we talked about the credit loss provisions, it also includes our cost to funding the portfolio.","So, it's sort of what the business has thrown off from an operating cash flow perspective, and because it includes the recoveries and how much are in-house and how much is going to be third-party et cetera, et cetera - the simple thing that folks need to remember is regardless of how much we bring in-house versus sell the third-party market, that key metric there is going to be growing 10% plus and that's our goal.","So, we will tinker with the other stuff, but the net result of all of it is yields are strong, operating leverage is quite good, delinquencies are dead on track, gross losses are dead on track, recoveries are fluctuating a little bit but we'll manage it to the point where we'll do 10% plus on our cash flow growth.","Okay, let's finish up with our '17 outlook. We have from a consolidated guidance perspective, we're increasing our revs from 77 to 78 up a $100 million up about 9% on core EPS, we're going to ding core EPS by the $0.40 of timing issues at BrandLoyalty that we talked about and so you have 78 and 18.10 for guidance for this year. And then you will see the quarterly rollout, we have good visibility here in Q4 in terms of the ramp up of the slingshot, so mid-teens growth in Q4.","It's about a quarter before, we normally would throw out '18, but we wanted to give people our initial cut. We have been working quite a bit in terms of where are the various businesses headed and in terms of our comfort level with growth in the Card business and credit quality and Epsilon Conversant, the timing of BrandLoyalty and the retooling of the Canadian model, there is a bunch of pieces here, but at the end of the day, we feel comfortable at this point of actually put mistake in the ground a little bit earlier than we normally would.","And we're looking at a return to more than double-digit top-line. We're looking to grow top-line, almost a $1 billion to 8.7 or up 12%. And then on core EPS, we are looking at the mid-teens, you throw in the $0.40 from the BrandLoyalty timing, you are actually getting closer to the 20%. We put in 21.50% or 19%, so plus 12, plus 19 for us seems to be a doable and achievable initial cut of guidance. We haven't factored in things like what are we going to do with all the free cash flow. So, we'll figure that out as the year unfolds.","So, to sum up, and then we'll turn it over for questions. Look, I think we're executing on the big three goals that we had this year, which was the Epsilon Conversant sort of that repeatable sustainable mid-single-digit top and bottom-line. We're actually looking at a little bit of an acceleration in the back half on top-line. So, we feel good about that and taking that into '18.","We're looking for our ability to grow through sort of the macro retail challenges that are out there. We're seeing mid-teens to high-teens portfolio growth. We're looking at opportunities with different types of retailers, so we expect that to continue through '18.","Credit normalization, it's been a long process. It'll be almost two years since the normalization process happened. But based on the delinquency curves and the wedge, we're dead on with that, which means we're going to have flat floor losses in '18.","And then finally, you had our LoyaltyOne business, where Canada had some trauma last year, we had to retool the model, could we keep all those sponsors, are the collectors going to get reengaged? Everything we're seeing right now is yes, and can we return the model to the mid-20's type EBITDA margin? And we already saw that in Q2.","So, we've checked the boxed with all the three and of course, with us, it just wouldn't be alliance unless we had a bit one fly in the ointment and this time, it's the business that has consistently done strong double-digit top and bottom-line growth.","We do feel comfortable however that's a timing issue. And we think that you're going to have a really significant 2018 out of BrandLoyalty. So, overall, we feel good. That's why we're giving our '18 guidance a little bit early. But right now, we think things are heading in the right direction.","So, I think we took a little bit longer, or I took a little bit longer than necessary. So, let's open it up for questions, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Bob Napoli with William Blair.","Bob Napoli","Thank you, and good morning. I guess looking at the business and now the BrandLoyalty business and it has always been pretty volatile by quarter. And I guess that's continuing a little more. But do you feel that the business has become more complicated overtime than you'd like it to be I mean are all of the pieces, do they fit. I mean you're multiple obviously is a way below where it's been historically, your valuation your PE multiple. And maybe some of that is the additional complication of the business. I just would love your thoughts around that.","Ed Heffernan","Sure, it's fair question. I think a business like BrandLoyalty which has sort of these shorter-term hits in terms of loyalty programs, I don't think it's gotten more complicated, it's always been as you've correctly pointed out very choppy by quarter.","For the past three years that choppiness sort of has always even doubt on an annual basis to give us that double-digit growth. This is really the first year in four years that they've been part of Alliance, where we're seeing that chop actually pushes it into the first quarter of the following year.","So from our perspective, we can see the visibility, we see the pipeline, we see the programs that are getting booked. And we know that with the World Cup coming and with the Disney programs signed, it's going to be a very big '18, it's unfortunate that it had to hit our '17. But I don't really think it's gotten more complicated, but from a volatility perspective, it's great double-digit business growing annually ever year. It's got a huge market, but it doesn't have the type of visibility the other businesses have.","Bob Napoli","Okay. And just my follow-up question would just be on credit, it looks like the delinquencies as you said are right in line with what you had laid out a year-ago. The conversion, so are you expecting higher credit losses now in the back half for the year as you get that stop selling as much and then bring it in-house, so should we expect charge-offs to stay in the 6% range, or that will be above that for the rest of the year as you make that conversion?","Ed Heffernan","I don't think we really can really pin it down, what we're trying to do is basically say, like the wedge is dead on, so we know we're going to be hitting towards flat loss rates or better in '18. The gross loss rates were up right where we put in that 50 basis points for the year. The recovery is going to vary by how quickly we can get the in-house stuff moved up.","So, the comfort that we can give people is the fact that regardless of what we do in-house versus third-party the overall earnings of that business will be up 10% plus. So, we want to give that comfort and then you know, look we're not going to be stupid about it and you know pull the rug completely out of doing third-party sales but it really benefits the company, if we can be a bit more patient, deliver our 10% plus on the earnings side for that business and get it in-house. So, stay tuned.","Bob Napoli","Thank you. Appreciate it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Thanks. Good morning. I guess Ed just a question on Epsilon, obviously you guys have pretty decent momentum it seems, as we look out to the intermediate term over the next several quarters. But as we look ahead to next year, are there any other areas that we should be concerned about because it seems like there is been a lot of volatility within the various segments of that business, is there anyone that you are particularly concerned about at this point?","Ed Heffernan","Well, the big one obviously Sanjay was the tech platform business which was the about a quarter of the combined Epsilon Conversant and that was a source of a fair amount angst last year because that used to be the workhorse for the entire segment, as you know I used to pound out 8% to 10% growth and then we've got 5 flat cuts, flat wooded with sort of pricing was too high, delivery time was too long, it was too complex, it had too many belts and whistles, so that's been retooled.","At the current rate that we're seeing that business turn, which is a little bit faster than we had anticipated in the backlog of orders that we are seeing for use more shrink-wrapped type offerings from tech.","I've got to tell you, I think between the tech platform, getting its head above water as we exit this year, it should do low single-digit growth in 2018 versus sort of down 14% last Q4 and about flattish in the third quarter probably.","So that's no longer the big worry, and so if that can stabilize which it has and actually grow a little auto again which is more on existing autos those big programs look solid and the big CRM business, those two are there are really the big drivers of sort of that double-digit growth in those two businesses.","And then the other businesses are sort of more a mid-single digit, the data and agency and stuff like that, so it's a very long way to answer to say. We don't see any trains coming at us right now and so, can we finally move Epsilon Conversant from sort of that mid-single-digit and start creeping it up into the plus 7, plus 8 models that we really wanted when we took on a Conversant and that sort of where we're shooting for.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Okay. And my follow-up's on the Card Services segment. You guys talk about the stronger revenue growth, when I looked at the revenue came in relevant to our expectations, those were a little bit weaker and it seems like it seems like it was driven by this uncollectible season finance charge build, maybe Charles you can just talk about your charge-off outlook which is a little bit more non-committal and sort of your expectations for the yield given this phenomenon.","And then just on the expenses in that Card Services business, I guess the run rate year-to-date improvement in that businesses have been quite strong and obviously you're expecting a little bit of moderation, but is there anything specific that drove that improvement in the first half? Thanks.","Charles Horn","So, let's first start off with the gross yields that Sanjay is referring to. If you recall, we keep an allowance for principal receivables, meaning receivables, we don't think we'll collect.","We also keep reserve for build finance charges that we deem uncollectible. There is a direct correlation between the two except that the build finance charge reserve goes against revenue so it's a gross yields impact. With that direct correlation, the loss rates being up in the high watermark in Q2, then that reserve for your build finance charges will go up and that gross yields is negatively affected. And then when your loss rates come down that pressure based on your gross yields go up.","So, what we see, it's a short-term issue, it's a direct correlation with the loss rates as the reserve basically the loss rates come down our principal, you'd see that reserve come down and expect gross yields to come back up in Q3 and Q4.","On the OpEx, we do think we can get 40 to 50 basis points of improvement as a percentage of average AR. Some of the improvements this year just timing meaning we're shifting some marketing out of Q1, Q2, Q3 and Q4, that's why we have been really startling Q1, Q2, we'll give some of that back. So, 50 to 60 basis points is a realistic target for 2017.","Ed Heffernan","And I think Sanjay also to make sure, we certainly expect losses to be down back half versus the front half, it's just one clear as to how much based on what we do with recoveries, but earnings themselves should be out that sort of double-digit in that business.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller with Barclays.","Darrin Peller","All right, thanks guys. Credit sales, I think came in about 6% growth versus the high single-digit trends I think you guys were expecting and yet the organic growth of your receivable side continues to be even stronger than that. Can you talk through the dynamics there in terms of what you are seeing in terms of the overall purchase volume trends and what are your expectations are for that embedded in your guidance throughout this year and next?","And then if we should expect that gap organically between the purchase volume growth and the receivables growth ready to process, are you including also Signet in the portfolio or in the revenue growth outlook, I know it's not as a full-year impact, but some benefit to '18.","And then lastly on the credit side, the cost, I'm just curious what bringing recoveries, the collection in-house due to the cost structure of the business? Thanks guys.","Ed Heffernan","Sure, I'll take that and then I'll kick it over to Charles. The relationship between sales and portfolio growth, you will have periods where a sales growth is higher than portfolio growth and you'll have periods when portfolio growth is higher than sales growth. So, it's not - they are not an absolute lock step, this is what you probably see as the year progresses, is you'll begin to see that narrow a bit. We do expect to see our credit sales walk back up to the low double-digit as we move into the back half based on what we're seeing out of the new. It's primarily from the new clients rolling up, and so, you are going to see that gap narrow as the year progresses.","Charles Horn","Yeah, what I'd add to it, Darrin you talked about Signet, since it's coming in so late in the year coupled with purchase accounting is really not going to drive a lot of lift to revenue or profitability. So, it's really more of 18 events for us.","The other question on the core, the core growth and credit sales is consistent with what we thought for the year and based on that low single-digit range, there has really been no change or modification there.","On the cost of bringing things back in-house, we have factored that in, in terms of the guidance we're giving you to 50 to 60 basis points OpEx leveraging. So, there is really nothing incremental if add thoughts to bring in 100% back inside, we're good or if we keep it somewhere between we're good. So, don't expect that to be any additional pressure in terms of their profitability for the year since we've already factored that in.","Ed Heffernan","And to give everyone sort of a sense of why the recovery thing is so important to us in terms realizing what the true values are on the recovery side? There is sort of - there is breakeven point out, do you format out or do you crank up other resources in-house, and do it?","If we can book somewhere in that 20s let's say recoveries are between 20% and 25% on losses then we're relatively in different when you do the math between in-house versus pushing into a third-party, but the outside market this year has brought this rate down to more like in the mid-teens. So, it's fairly dramatically and it behooves us, because we knew in-house, because we're also running in-house programs, that we're collecting in the 20's. So, this has found money once we bring it in-house, so that's sort of the tradeoff.","Darrin Peller","And just to be clear, I mean just a closer loop on that, you are including some economic benefit from Signet in '18's guidance but not additional portfolio acquisitions?","Ed Heffernan","That's correct.","Darrin Peller","Okay, thanks guys. And just a quick follow on the AIR MILES side, just remind us again, are we reiterate the visibility you have. I mean I understand your sponsors are sticking with you and saying they want to do more, but I guess from a consumer standpoint, you talk about the brand not being damaged from last year. Just more evident so you can give us that, we should expect AIR MILES' issuance to rebound. Is it just, have you really surveyed the population meaning the client base?","Ed Heffernan","Yeah, that's a fair question. And to say the brand hasn't been damaged I probably misspoke. I think they're definitely was damaged, I mean it was terrible for us. And clearly, the political environment was such that it was open season on the AIR MILES business from the government's perspective.","From the consumer side, the best metric that we look at is our people engaged. What's the activity rate, and if we've got two thirds of the entire country of Canada active in our programs, we say our eye is at number staying stable or is it down. And as you started out the year quite frankly it was down. And we were I guess the activity rate we were probably down what Charles, 4%, 5%. Then it was down 2%.","The last - we don't even have to do surveys, you just look at all the active account holders we're back to flat. So that would just that's our best predictor of saying, hey, it looks like people are overrate and are moving on. But I can tell you I'd rather not go through out it again.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ashish Sabadra with Deutsche Bank.","Ashish Sabadra","Hey, thanks. Good morning. Just a quick clarification, so despite the push out in BrandLoyalty, you were still able to increase the revenue guidance given the momentum in the rest of the business. But this guidance that was mostly because of the fixed cost in the BrandLoyalty is that right? That isn't really any other pressure in other parts of the business, which is putting any kind of the pressure on the earnings.","Charles Horn","Yeah, we'd say Ashish that we're not really seeing any pressure against Epsilon. If you look at it we've raised the revenue growth, we said we're going to have some cost associated with the onboarding of two new clients, which is why we did really push any incremental EPS from that and that's not unusual. If you remember back to your skill, we on-boarded the client, you incurred all the cost to get them onboard before you get the revenue stream coming through.","With Card, what we're basically saying is you've got some upside on your OpEx that maybe the left side on your gross yield, but conversely, you've got a little risk in the recoveries which would mitigate it, so we don't want to pass through any increase there. So then if you look over BrandLoyalty, when we started the year, we really thought BrandLoyalty would do about EUR115 million in EBITDA extracting close more like to 85 so about EUR30 million delta in Europe which equates to $0.40.","And so that's why what we're saying it's really an issue where we've got good performance with got Epsilon not ready to pass anything through yet. But as I talked about we have a very good visibility would be, it's not coming through in Q3 where we expected, that's a short fall we're talked about $0.40 or more to slipping in into 2018.","Ed Heffernan","Yeah, let me sort of the crystal clear on this one, it's something where we spent a lot of time internally talking about. If we wanted to stay within our Card business the third-party sales even at the lower rates, let's say you could have come up with that $0.40 to offset the push out of BrandLoyalty. But we feel from a business perspective, that just the wrong way of thinking.","And so, I know people are not going to be thrilled that this $0.40 that they're pushing into next year. We were very thoughtful in what we did. And there was potential of over performance significant over performance in cards, if we kept doing what we were doing. But we do think that using some of that over performance in pushing out to in-house recoveries is the best thing from the business. It's going to benefit '18 and beyond and its real cash flow, but it can't be used to cover off the $0.40 in BrandLoyalty this year. That's as plain as I can put it.","Ashish Sabadra","Thanks for the color. That's very, very helpful. And maybe just a follow-up question, so as we think about the impact with the recoveries, how should we think about the provisions in the back half and also allowance for loan losses reserve rate for the back half of the year. Should we see more provisions in the current quarter and then maybe taking moderating off in the fourth? Thanks.","Charles Horn","What I would say Ashish, we are still looking for Q2 being the high watermark in that net loss rates, so dropping in Q3, Q4. If you look for the second quarter of about 6.65% reserve rate. What I would expect it could drift up a little bit in Q3, but it'll end Q4 right around that 6.65% reserve rate. So, I think we're pretty well got the rate for what we expected in the year. And now you just got a couple of quarters for to flow through.","Ashish Sabadra","Thanks for the color.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Wayne John with Raymond James.","Wayne Johnson","Hi, good morning. I have two questions, one regard to [indiscernible] other one regarding capital structure. So, on the new tech platform, Ed is it fair to say that the coding is complete on this. If you have it given the percentage of completion, how far is it completed? And if not, when do you it will be?","Ed Heffernan","Yeah, it's done. We're selling and we're delivering. So, there is no more from that perspective now, it's just a question of completing the delivers and booking the revenue. So that's why I think you're going to see us get our head above water before the end of the year. So, the work is done.","Wayne Johnson","Okay, I appreciate that, so just a quick follow up on that. So how many customers have you boarded on it today? Or that's in process at least; I'm just trying to get some more clarification on that?","Ed Heffernan","Yeah. I mean we probably have fairly robust pipeline. I would say you probably have 12 to 15 that are either then delivered on or in the process of getting spilled up, but that's a solid number for us.","Wayne Johnson","Okay, that's helpful. And then just on the capital structure side. Do you still think it make sense to keep all three provisions all the business units together? Or do you foresee at some point in the future a reason to split the company up.","Ed Heffernan","That's - people have asked us along the way. And it's going to be the standard answer Wayne of, if this model isn't getting traction over a period of time in terms of value, then we're clearly compelled to look at other structures.","Right now, frankly, if we are correct and this acceleration and slingshot happens in '18, frankly we would be disappointed if people weren't pretty excited about it. And we're getting closer and closer to it.","We'll see what people think about it and once we start really cranking up the double-digit growth on a consistent quarterly basis. Hopefully that will get folks excited. There is a school of thought on both sides. I mean as we look at it now, and you look at all the disruptions that's going on in the various industries that are out there, and what you're really seeing right as you're beginning to see tech beginning to or continuing to disrupt verticals that no one had even contemplated a couple of years ago.","And if we were to look at for example the Card business and the retail space, everything else. If you believe that disruption is occurring there which we do, we have the type of structure where you have all these technologies which is in the form of all these skew data and all these unique IDs that we use at Conversant to identify folks and their proclivities online. And so, the question is can we have, can we be the tech type provider that is the big disruptor as it comes to the Card industry itself and frankly I think we can.","There is so much fragmentation and disruption going on in just the retail space that our ability to bring data and skew level information, the analytics, the digital distribution channels, the Omni channel type distribution approach something that's pretty compelling to these retailers today and the ones that were breaking off from the big department store platforms, frankly they are looking at the tech side of us while they are looking at the card side of us.","So, right now it kind of makes sense, but you know we need to execute on the slingshot.","Wayne Johnson","That's really helpful. But you say that these services like Epsilon and Card Services as well it will be a low demand because of what's happening with Amazon coming into the physical retail world with the potential acquisition of Whole Foods and potentially others will follow?","Ed Heffernan","You kind of fade in on me Wayne, could you say that again?","Wayne Johnson","Would you say that Epsilon and Card Services could be in more demand to fight off the impact of Amazon getting into the physical retail market?","Ed Heffernan","Yeah, I mean I don't just say Amazon, I mean all the big tech platform players who are disrupting more traditional verticals. There is no question that when we have discussions with clients or prospects today, let's just taken the Card business, if less and less of the tell me about the Card product and its more and more about how does that help me have a differentiated product, how does that help me reach the consumer across all channels, how can you provide sort of that personalization approach to the consumer that these big tech platforms are promising.","And so that's why I see sort of this when people are down about where retailers going, what we are looking at is actually all these hybrids brand new e-commerce players those splitting off from department stores for us, it's actually this type of volatility and disruption is driving a tremendous amount of business for us and that's just in the retail space and as we go into other verticals that's right in Epsilon sweet spot, so yeah. I mean you know from what we are seeing this disruption has probably a good thing for us.","Wayne Johnson","Thank you.","Ed Heffernan","We're going to do one more.","Operator","And your final question comes from the line of Larry Berlin with First Analysis.","Lawrence Berlin","Hi, good morning guys. Two quick as I hold. First one on BrandLoyalty, how was the U.S. and then Canada deployments going and are you seeing external pipeline building in those two countries, going for next year?","Ed Heffernan","Yeah, in Canada you've got the benefit of having 20-year presence 25-year presence in the country. So, we're in pretty good shape in Canada in terms of the programs that are there and they're up and running there is either four or five brands that we have programs with in the U.S., it's a question of when does the first - fall we have one grosser there we are doing now we have a couple pilots, we have couple of calls that are come in since the Amazon Whole Foods thing popped up.","So, I think you know again we've never really been able to find a way to penetrate the grosser vertical in the U.S. every other vertical we got but grosser has always been tough, I think the margins are so tight. But there is a new sense of urgency out there, so I would expect a couple of these things to fall but, look we are not relying on some monster deal in the U.S. pushes through '18.","Our bread and butter has been the 40 countries that we're in in Europe, Asia, Latin America, now its Canada, but I do expect to get some traction in the U.S. I know there are one or two names would be nice and if one of the big ones comes into the tent, then it gets fun.","Lawrence Berlin","You pulled that on a totally different topic, on stock buyback, what do you guys think is going forward in this year and next year for us I mean the program and soft goods?","Charles Horn","I'll tell you Larry, we've completed the 500-main authorization this year. I'm sure we'll do at least another 500-main authorization in '18. I would say at this point we've not really decided to do another buyback authorization or '17. Do we look to pursue a little bit of M&A or do we just look to pay down a little bit, I'd say at this point we're just being flexible around the remaining free cash flow utilization for '17?","Lawrence Berlin","Thank you, guys.","Ed Heffernan","Thanks.","Charles Horn","Bye.","Ed Heffernan","All right, thank you. Bye-bye.","Operator","This concludes today's Alliance Data second quarter 2017 earnings conference call.

[Operator Instructions]. In order to view the company's presentation on the website, please remember to turn off the pop-up blocker on your computer.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Ms. Vicky Nakhla of AdvisIRy Partners. Ma'am, the floor is yours.","Viktoriia Nakhla","Thank you, Operator. By now, you should have received the copy of the company's second quarter 2019 earnings release. If you haven't, please call AdvisIRy Partners at 212-750-5800.","On the call today, we have Robert Minicucci, Board Chairman of Alliance Data; Melisa Miller, President and Chief Executive Officer of Alliance Data; Tim King, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Alliance Data; and Charles Horn, Executive Vice President and Chief -- and Vice Chairman of Alliance Data.","Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on today's call and some of the responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties described in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC. Alliance Data has no obligation to update the information presented on the call.","Also on today's call, our speakers will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe will provide useful information for investors. Reconciliation of those measures to GAAP will be posted on the Investor Relations website at alliancedata.com.","With that, I would like to turn the call over to Robert Minicucci. Robert?","Robert Minicucci","Good morning to all. I won't repeat the management introductions as it's just been affected, so let me say a few words regarding the company's strategic direction and the related organizational changes announced last month. As discussed on previous earning calls, over the last 18 months, the Board and management together conducted a comprehensive strategic review of the company, its component businesses and its go-forward strategy. Through that process, a number of steps were identified, including the sale of the Epsilon business and other initiatives designed in each case to simplify the Alliance Data narrative and, more importantly, focus capital and effort on the Card Services business. That business comprises both the company's highest earnings and highest growth assets.","Previously, Ed Heffernan had led the company through a strategic review process and implementation of these initiatives, some of which have been completed, other of which are in flight and progressing as expected. Ed's leadership on these transformative projects was invaluable, and his departure was part of the succession plan implemented in connection with the company's new strategic direction. The Board extends its sincere thanks to Ed for his outstanding services.","So, we begin a new chapter in the company's leadership. It's aligned with our Card Services focus. Our new President and CEO, Melisa Miller, joins us from the Card Services business, which she successfully led as President for the last eight years. Our new CFO, Tim King, also comes for -- too as well from Card Services where he served as CFO for the past seven years. Given their respective background and Alliance Data's strategic direction, the Board believes Melisa and Tim are ideally suited to lead the company, and we have every confidence in their ability to take Alliance Data to new levels of success.","Finally, our former CFO, Charles Horn, has taken on a new role as Vice Chairman. In this capacity, he will oversee, on an interim basis, a number of transitions at the company resulting from the Epsilon transaction, including ongoing cost reductions and other Board initiatives.","I'll now ask Melisa to provide some introductory remarks.","Melisa Miller","Well, good morning, everyone, and thank you, Rob, for the kind introductions and for delivering them in person. I wanted to begin today by saying how honored and incredibly excited I am to be assuming this new role, including the expected challenges and the opportunities that lie ahead. As Rob mentioned, we have a sound plan in place to transform this great company, and we've been successfully executing against that plan in the past several months. To be sure, we are making intentional, purposeful changes for the long-term viability and health of the organization. We are laser-focused on returning Alliance Data to its more formidable growth and profit profile and achieving our key objective with this transformation, and that key objective is to unlock greater shareholder value and deliver value to all of our key stakeholders.","During this deliberate journey, we have and will continue to tackle the tough decisions head on. We will make the necessary and critical changes in the short term to restore credibility and confidence for the long term. We are well positioned to drive our performance and long-term, profitable, sustainable success.","My commitment in getting our consistent growth game back on track is steadfast. And while our expected success does not come without some anticipated near-term choppiness, we set a new course for Alliance Data's growth and viability for the long haul. I am confident in what our future holds and prepared to both lead and support our business heading into this exciting new chapter.","Charles, I'll now turn the floor over to you.","Charles Horn","Thanks, Melisa. Let's flip to Page 4, and we'll discuss consolidated results for the second quarter. Revenue decreased 3% to $1.35 billion, adjusted EBITDA net decreased 15% to $310 million and core EPS decreased 12% to $3.83 for the second quarter of 2019. These results exclude the Epsilon segment, which was in discontinued operations. Our second quarter results were mostly in line with expectations, although core EPS was negatively impacted by the timing of credit card portfolio acquisitions.","We acquired several client portfolios aggregating over $900 million in June, which we expected to acquire later in the year. While this pull forward supports our receivables growth projections for the year, the impact of the provision-built post acquisition reduced second quarter EPS. The provision bill leads revenue recognition for a couple of months following the acquisition of a portfolio.","EPS decreased 33% to $2.71 for the second quarter of 2019. A higher effective tax rate, 27%, compared to 15% in the prior year quarter negatively impacted EPS by approximately $0.43 for the second quarter. As previously discussed, we completed the sale of Epsilon to Publicis Groupe on July 1. We anticipate using the net proceeds of approximately $3.5 billion from the transaction to retire corporate debt and to repurchase our shares. The debt retirement of $2.4 billion is largely done, dropping our pro forma debt leverage ratio to 1.6x, and we plan to launch within the next few days a modified Dutch tender -- Dutch auction tender offer to acquire between $700 million to $750 million of our common stock. The remainder of our share repurchase authorization has been set aside as dry powder to enable opportunistic future open markets for other purchases, the timing of which is tied to other initiatives underway.","Let's flip over to the next page, and we'll talk a little bit about LoyaltyOne. LoyaltyOne revenue increased 1% to $251 million for the second quarter. Adjusted for unfavorable foreign exchange rates and the shift to a net revenue presentation on certain product redemptions at AIR MILES, revenue increased 10% for the second quarter. Adjusted EBITDA decreased 23% on a constant currency basis primarily due to higher cost redemptions at AIR MILES, largely a function of product mix redeemed.","Breaking down the results further. AIR MILES revenue, adjusted for the items discussed above, decreased 6% due to low redemptions. Issuance and redemptions both decreased 2% for the second quarter with issuances down due to the timing of promotional activity.","BrandLoyalty's revenue increased 24% on a constant currency basis due to strong program performance in Europe, Asia and Brazil. We continue to focus on driving cost efficiencies in order to improve EBITDA margins back into the historical mid-teens range.","With that, I will turn over to Tim King to talk about Card Services.","Timothy King","Thank you, Charles. It's an honor and pleasure to be here today. I look forward to working with all of you. Getting started. Let's turn to Page 6 while I'll review our key statistics. Overall, you should take from the slide that we're beginning to show improvements in our AR and credit sales while maintaining healthy credit quality and return on equity metrics.","Starting with credit sales. We are flat to Q2 2018. Recall that in Q1, this number was down 7% year-over-year. You may recall that Charles outlined during the Q1 call that it takes some time for our newer programs to spool up. This is fully in line with our expectation that we'd take a quarter or two for the new healthy vintages to replace the divested programs. We expect healthy year-over-year increases for the remainder of 2019. Also showing improvement from the prior quarter are the AR metrics. For instance, end-of-period AR was down 5% in Q1 versus a decrease of only 2% for this quarter. All AR metrics were in line with credit sales. However, with credit sales, we expect continued improvement in positive variances for the next two quarters. Previously, we guided to a year-end AR number greater than $20 billion, and we are still very comfortable with this target.","As Charles mentioned, a few strategic acquisitions were put forward into Q2, which pressured deals. But ultimately, these acquisitions will be beneficial to the remainder of the year. Operating expenses, excluding the impact of the mark-to-market for the held-for-sale receivables, were 9.4% or 25 basis points worse versus prior year. As in previous quarters, this number is being affected by the mark-to-market accounting.","Let's turn to our credit quality metrics. As expected, we continue to see improvement in the loss and delinquency rates, both of which are showing a 30 basis point improvement. Finally, on this page, we continue to show a very stable 31% return on equity. This number is consistent with Q2 2018 and Q1 of 2019. The key takeaways are improved credit sales and AR numbers, stable credit quality and return on equity results.","Let's turn to Page 7 and review key financial numbers. Revenue is down $50 million or 4% for the quarter. This is driven by slightly lower normalized average receivables, coupled with lower gross yields. As previously discussed, the variance on the operating expense ratios -- the ratios we're seeing here are the dollar variances. And as mentioned earlier, this is being driven entirely by the mark-to-market accounting for these held-for-sale receivables. The provision expense benefited from a slight decrease in receivables, lower charge-off rates and better delinquencies with some offset due to the provision build required for the day two accounting of the newly acquired portfolios.","Lastly, our cost of funds are up from 2% to 2.3%, resulting in $30 million increase and primarily due to the higher spread in the ADS market.","And we'll now turn it over to Charles who will run you through the updated full year guidance.","Charles Horn","Thanks, Tim. What you'll see basically is our revenue guidance for the year remains at the $5.8 billion or 4% increase that we talked about in the first quarter. We have updated the reported core EPS guidance to reflect the anticipated Dutch tender as well as the completed cost reductions at the corporate location.","In addition, we remain on track to deliver accretion compared to the original guidance of $22 for 2019 as pro forma core EPS is still expected to exceed the lower end of the range provided during the last earnings call.","With that, I will flip it back over to Melisa.","Melisa Miller","Thank you, Charles. I'd ask everyone now to turn to Slide 9. And I wanted to take just a moment to both reinforce and highlight where we see Card Services ending 2019. As Tim mentioned, we are confident in our guidance on the growth and quality of our receivables and expect to end 2019 with greater than $20 billion in card receivables. As predicted, with credit quality stable, we turn our full attention to maximizing the value of both our legacy core and our newer programs.","Our deliberate expansion into a wide range of healthy verticals, including the new partners we've welcomed this year, provide the momentum to achieve our targets and position us well for future success.","We note that our newer vintages, so those programs launched in 2015 and beyond, now represent over $5.5 billion in average receivables with incremental runway for growth based on our historical trends. The recent launch of our consumer deposit platforms -- platform with deposits approaching $1 billion will provide incremental flexibility for future growth.","So, in wrapping up the financial aspects of our review, the core tenets of the Card Services business are improving, completely consistent with our plans: receivables growth returning; credit quality stable; and new businesses ramping nicely. In closing, we thought it was equally important to spend a few minutes on the value metrics of the Card Services model, in particular, essentially offering insight into why we continue to win and stay differentiated in our space. Put differently, many of you asked these questions of us who are you really and how are you differentiated. So, we want to spend just a few minutes on that question, and I'd ask you now to turn to Slide 10.","An answer to the question of who are we, we are really the brand behind the brands that customers love. We have over 30 years of experience in building the most valuable and successful programs in our space. It is no accident that customers who have one of our branded cards in their wallet spend 2 to 3x more than customers without a card. Now you may have heard that proof point before. We highlight it again because once a card member has one of our branded cards, we are able to keep them or retain them as an engaged customer at a far higher rate than others in our space. More importantly, when we welcome a brand and convert a program, we always see the value of the program grow by 20% to 30%.","So, your next question might be how do we make all of that happen. Turning now to Slide 11, it's really how we lead the market in the convergence of three core competencies: data-driven insights; marketing; and payments. This is where we invest our time, energy and our effort. Our team of experts sort through the clutter in a sea of choices facing consumers today, and we are uniquely able to deliver the very precise, very personalized experience and recommendations that customers demand today. We have deliberately expanded our universe into verticals where our tools, technology and techniques will also add value.","Specialty apparel will continue to be important to our portfolio. More importantly, we've successfully extended into winning categories to meet the emerging demand of consumers and brands. Specifically, we've successfully expanded into beauty, so think Ulta and Sephora. We've expanded into the home goods category. Think Pottery Barn and eTail, think Wayfair. These are just a few examples of how we are actively leading in the transformation of the retail space. We are seeking healthy verticals and brands with a multichannel approach to serving consumers. And the one thing all of these verticals have in common is that the consumer is in the driver's seat. The consumer is at the heart of everything we do, and they are also at the heart of everything that our brands do. And while the consumers' needs and behaviors are changing, our deep understanding of them will not.","Our purpose is clear. We help our brands know more about their customers, so they can sell more. Our approach of blending data, marketing and payments together ensures that we build more successful programs than anyone in our space. We acquire more, retain more and maximize the spending and engagement in a manner that differentiates us.","We wanted to give you a bit of a preview today. We'd ask you to stay tuned for more. Sometime in the late fall, you can expect that we'll be hosting an Investor Day. We look forward to walking this community through a deeper dive with greater specificity on what the next best generation of Alliance Data Systems will bring to the industry.","With that, operator, we are finished with our prepared remarks, and I'd ask that we open up the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Your line is open.","Sanjay Sakhrani","All right. And congratulations to you all on the call, Melisa, Tim, Charles on your elevated roles. I guess my first question is a higher-level one where, Melisa, maybe you can walk us through some of the objectives you have to get the company back on track and how it might differ to the ones previously articulated to us. And obviously, Rob, please feel free to chime in on the repositioning and sort of the progress there. Underneath it all, I also had a question for Charles or Tim on the strategic repositioning because another $500-some-odd million of loans were moved to held for sale. Are we done with those? Or will there be more?","Melisa Miller","So, Sanjay, I'll go ahead and take that first question. By the way, thank you for the words of encouragement. For us, what we would say is that we are really creating a maniacal focus on how we create value for all of our stakeholders. Our shareholders, of course, brands we serve, the consumers that we support, getting very, very clear on our key differentiators, what are the consumer trends in the marketplace and then making sure that we have a sound strategy of knowing where to invest and what it takes to win consistently. Getting our growth game back on track, as I mentioned, is a priority, but it's also important to mention that it's not growth at all costs. We hold ourselves to very, very high standards, and you can expect that these ROEs of 30% or greater are standards that we will continue to hold ourselves to.","So, we are engaged with conversations across all of our levels of management, be clear on our priorities, be maniacally focused on returning value for all of our stakeholders and creating focus for our organization.","Timothy King","So, Sanjay, it's Tim. I'll take the held-for-sale question. Obviously, in the quarter, we actually had some success, and we were able to move some portfolios out, but we also had one strategic nonrenewal. Frankly, it was a client that was -- the economics were untenable for us, so we have decided to let that portfolio go. So, in essence, you'll see on our balance sheet the held-for-sale stayed about flat, and that was a function of, obviously, divesting some programs. We're successful with those and then, obviously, marketing one portfolio held for sale.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research.","Darrin Peller","Melisa and Tim, I also want to echo my congrats on the role. Let me just start off. If you could talk about the profile on your $900 million books that you acquired a little sooner than you expected, I guess, first, what types portfolios? Do these involve an e-commerce oriented? What kind of loss profile do they have? And then the ROE on the new active AR that you have now that's growing. And then Melisa, when we think about the bigger picture for the card, what may be a card stand-alone business long term, can you talk to us about do you foresee that being still a double-digit receivables grower? I know you've mentioned 30%-plus ROEs, but maybe just a little bit more profile. Are you still going to have some profile of loans in them all in the traditional retail you've had before? Or is it -- are you really trying to shift it all to a more omnichannel-type e-com offering?","Melisa Miller","Yes. Darrin. Thank you all. If I may all answer that question in reverse order. In terms of our growth profile, as I mentioned, we are just keenly focused on restoring sustainable, profitable growth, but we will use a balanced scorecard approach. We do hold ourselves accountable for growing AR, but again, not at all costs. So, we'll continue to hold ourselves to a very high standard. And as I've mentioned, you can expect to see us delivering superior ROEs than others in our space.","With respect to mall-based versus non-mall-based, for us, we're going to be opportunistic. There are brands that are domiciled in malls that are still winning. And where we have a healthy brand, where there can be a program where we can add value, we will be opportunistic and pursue it. What's most important for us is seeking those brand partners that have a multi-channel approach. Darrin, that's where we can build our biggest and most valuable programs. We know that when we can get one of our cardholders shopping in more than one channel, they are more than 2x as valuable. So, having a multi-channel approach for the brands that we serve is really important.","With respect to the brand profile of the acquisition, more to come on that later, Darrin. As we actually relaunch the programs, we'll be a little bit more specific. But take great comfort in knowing that a couple of these brands are actually in some of these winning segments that we've discussed, and these are completely consistent with our overarching strategy.","Darrin Peller","Okay. And then just a quick follow-up. I mean, in terms of the strategy now for the next 12 to 18 months, I assume that the LoyaltyOne business is on the radar in terms of -- I guess, the question really is how active are you in that process? How should we as investors and analysts think about that business? How quick should we expect this to be a standalone Card Services company?","Charles Horn","Yes, Darrin. It's one of those where we've talked about going back to the first quarter and as I've said before, we have a number of initiatives underway. Additionally, nothing to discuss at this point or to announce at this point, but we will keep you updated as we move forward with these initiatives.","Robert Minicucci","It's Rob Minicucci speaking. I think from a Board perspective; we got a little out of -- ahead of our skis in November when we talked about Epsilon. And frankly, management and the Board have resolved that we're going to announce something when we have announced Epsilon, when we signed the contract. And that's going to be the policy of this company going forward. We're not going to talk about [indiscernible]. We're going to announce something when we have something to announce.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Napoli with William Blair.","Robert Napoli","And congratulations as well. Melisa, one of the things that -- I think has been some concern maybe around your clients that maybe you could address is that the sale of Epsilon has removed some of the value-add potential that Alliance Data brings to its partners. And that what we sense there maybe was a little bit of consternation amongst your customer base. But can you go just address that and talk about the skill set that you bring to the table today versus what you brought to the table with Epsilon?","Melisa Miller","You bet. And I'm so glad that you asked that question because we do not expect this transaction to change in any way the value or the nature of our relationships with our brands. We had a long history of working together with Epsilon and have actually enjoyed the relationship a great deal. It's completely memorialized with arm\u2019s length agreement. We're one of Epsilon's largest, most strategic partners. And as such, together, we have an opportunity to influence their innovation and technology roadmap. What's important for this group to know is while we do leverage some of the capabilities and the data assets, it's really the 30 years of experience and the data scientists and the data analysts and the marketers within the Card Services business that have leveraged these capabilities and have made these programs saying, \"We don't expect to miss a beat.\"","Robert Minicucci","And Rob Minicucci again. I want to support that statement by giving you a fact or two. Previously, each of the three businesses, the executives running the business units had a compensation scheme based on their performance. And both EBITDA and revenue growth were accounted for 80% of their economics. So, we had, at Card Services, arm\u2019s length agreement with Epsilon in the past. We have extended that contract. And now instead of 80%, it's 100%. There's no corporate overhead sharing, if you will. But there really is no change in the economic incentives to the executives running their respective businesses. So again, we have a contract in place. We expect them to be a valuable partner with us. And it's just documented now as I suggested.","Robert Napoli","And a follow-up question. You put out a pro forma EPS, at least $22.67 for 2019. And you talk, Melisa, about critical changes in the short term, near-term choppiness. Like how much visibility do you have on that number? And then maybe, as importantly or more importantly, there's a very wide range of estimates out there for 2020. And if you could just maybe -- if you could address that at all because if you have good visibility on the $22.67, maybe add a little bit of color to how people think about or if you could add some color how people think about 2020.","Charles Horn","Sure, Bob. I'd say this. If you look at it from a performance standpoint, we have very good visibility into Card Services numbers this year as well as LoyaltyOne. You do have a variable associated with the $350 million of consideration from Epsilon that we fell back. So, based upon the deployment of that $350 million in terms of open-market purchases, that can influence the run rate a little bit just in terms of timing, but otherwise, and so we have very good visibility into achieving that number.","Robert Napoli","Okay. And then as we think about 2020, any color on the very broad range of -- do you expect to grow that number in 2020? Or is the near-term choppiness add some cloudiness to that capability?","Charles Horn","I'd wouldn't say there's any cloudiness, Bob. But I will that it is somewhat dependent upon some of the other initiatives we have underway. So, it'd probably be a little bit premature for us to start jumping and talking into 2020 at this point.","Operator","Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust. Your line is open.","Andrew Jeffrey","Melisa, just honing in on one of the bullet points on Slide 7 in the deck that talks about OpEx in Card Services. I wonder if you could elaborate a little bit on some of the investments, you're making for new partner launches, sort of how those might compare with historical growth investments in Card Services and how you think about those both from a timing perspective and in the context of your long-term ROE targets.","Melisa Miller","You bet. What I would tell you is the types of investments with -- to support new program launches are consistent with what we've seen in the past. What makes -- what will change the dynamics of the investment is whether or not we have a large number of stores that we have to bring up and train; the amount of collateral that is in keeping with training all of those stores; and actually, the number of channels that a partner integrates with us. So, one of our greatest strengths is that we interact with our partners in all of our channels. It's also one of the things that add some expense upfront, both on the technology side and on then the people side as we get brand partners pulled up. So, this profile isn't terribly different, but we did have a number of new partners that we brought up this past quarter, so we had a lot of activity with respect to new brands.","Andrew Jeffrey","Okay. And would you expect to see the leverage on those expenses in the back half of '19? Or does that wind up being more of a 2020 kind of event?","Timothy King","Andrew, it's Tim. We would expect that in the back half of 2019.","Andrew Jeffrey","Okay. And then one quick last one for me, Tim. Can you quantify the amount of provision lift or the higher provisions this quarter resulting from that portfolio acquisition, so the timing value?","Timothy King","Yes. It was about $10 million.","Operator","Jason Deleeuw with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","Jason Deleeuw","And congrats, everyone, with the elevated positions. Melisa, I was hoping you could talk about the addressable market opportunity that you see out there that's still remaining for Card Services. And then just given all your experience in the space, just talk about the evolution of the competitive environment. Have there been any significant changes on that front over the years?","Melisa Miller","You bet. I'm glad you asked that question, Jason, because part of the reason that we're so bullish on our future is that the addressable market is actually growing for our space as we see emerging retailers coming into the market. So we would tell you that when you look across the $1 trillion that's actually available to us, and we do a little bit of the Goldilocks, some are too large, some are not, going to fully leverage our sweet spot, we would tell you that there's about $250 billion worth of opportunities that we could pursue where we would put our head on the pillow at night and say, \"Our tools and our approach could add value to this program.\" So, it's a very, very large market. And if we were to just say, \"All right. Let's get our 35% share of this market,\" you can see that you've got a very, very significant growth path.","I'd also add, Jason, while not in the scheme of new business, in the scheme of growth tests, when you think about that 2015 vintage and beyond, because so many of those programs were startup, that also provides us with a great deal of runway for growth. So, we are really optimistic that we are in a marketplace that has a lot of white space for us. That's for sure.","In terms of the competitive landscape, we would tell you that it's crowded. There are certainly some emerging payment solution companies. This group might refer to them as fintechs that are becoming more prominent in the marketplace, and we're watching them very closely. Consumers do have expanding demands. Everything we do is to serve consumers. So, we are clear on what consumer demands may mean for us and are watching very closely how we might serve those emerging demands. Does that help, Jason?","Jason Deleeuw","Yes. That's very helpful. And then as a follow-up just -- is there any help you can give us on thinking about receivables growth? In June, the active client\u2019s receivables grew 12%, have been growing 10%. And then on the last call, there was talk about a 15% receivables revenue -- or run rate growth rate. So, I'm just -- is there any help you can give us on thinking about kind of the targeted or just kind of a range on receivables growth?","Timothy King","Sure. So, in the latter half of the year, you're going to get mid-teens active growth. I think you're quoting the active growth, Jason. And we should finish the year in the low to mid-teens for our active growth for the receivables. If you go just to reported, you're going to be more on the single digits in the -- in Q2, but then to the double digits in Q4. And you'll finish the year low single digits.","Operator","Will Nance with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","William Nance","And congratulations to Melisa and Tim. So, I maybe wanted to start off on credit. So, delinquencies and losses have both been improving recently. And when we look out over the next year or two, how should we think about the interplay between, on one hand, the portfolio growing really fast than some of the newer portfolios and that can tend to put upward pressure on losses versus some of the tailwind you have from lower recoveries and some of the shift towards some of the higher-quality portfolios? I guess how are you thinking about losses over the next 18, 24 months?","Melisa Miller","Yes. That's a great question, Will, and we would tell you that we've lived through the cycle of delinquency and losses. And when we look out into the future, we would tell you we would expect both would be stable.","Timothy King","And Will, on your question on recoveries, I would say there's no pressure or change in our strategy at all. The recovery process is very, very stable. We wouldn't expect any change to what we're experiencing now.","William Nance","Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe if I could hit on yields. They've been under a little bit more pressure for the first half of the year. I guess can you talk about some of the moving pieces and how we should think about that as some of the newer programs start to spool up? And I guess on that note, like, when we think about the company moving more towards kind of a card-centric focus, is there any thought being put towards maybe moving towards more of a GAAP presentation of results over time?","Timothy King","So, I'll answer the yield question and then come back to the GAAP question in a second. The -- we would expect that we spool up some of those programs you saw announced last quarter and over the course of the last few weeks as well as the spool up of the portfolios we purchased. By the end of the year, we should be down a little bit, but really consistent year-over-year versus 2018. So, we obviously will have some rebound in Q3 and Q4. And obviously, on the GAAP presentation...","Charles Horn","It's really going to come down, Will, to the other initiatives underway. At this point, we think it's -- the core EPS is still a very good metric. As time goes by, that could change. But there's really nothing at this time to indicate that, that's going to happen.","Operator","David Scharf with JMP Securities. Your line is open.","David Scharf","And welcome, Melisa and Tim. I guess the question I had and it also dovetails to maybe a broader question on some of your plans for future disclosure with the management transition in place, I'm wondering, Melisa, we have disclosure, obviously, in the securitization documents of your top 10 retail programs that are in those asset pools and their concentration. And the vertical breakdown on Slide 11 is very helpful. But obviously, the securitized assets are only about 40% of the total now. I'm wondering, specifically, if there's any color you could provide on, perhaps, how those verticals that you outlined on Slide 11 stack up in terms of the mix of the portfolio; and b, whether or not going forward we may get increased disclosure on program-specific balances for the managed receivables, not just the securitized.","Timothy King","Yes. It's something we've thought about. And clearly, as we've transitioned the portfolio, we'll continue to think about what's the right disclosure. So, I would say stay tuned. I'll make a joke at my expense. Five weeks into the job, so we got to think about those disclosures and what the organization looks like in the future and about what's the right segmentation. So, stay tuned.","Operator","Dan Perlin with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Daniel Perlin","Melisa, now that you've taken over, and I'm sure you guys have done another deep dive in terms of looking over the core portfolio, are there any retailers that are on your watch list that could surprise in the card business that we should be at least mindful of as we think through this transition right now?","Melisa Miller","Yes. Dan, that's a good question. There are some brands within our core portfolio that have struggled certainly with their top line growth. We are in constant contact with the senior level individuals within these brands, meet often to understand what their plans are. The great news is there are none that are of size, that if some sort of event were to occur, that we would expect there would be any impact to us.","Daniel Perlin","Okay. And then the other question I had was around corporate expenses declining kind of post the divestiture of Epsilon. So, it looks like in the quarter, it was down about $12 million. I don't know if that's entirely related to that. But can you just help us a little bit with the cadence in order to get us to that pro forma $1 to $1.15 that I think you guys had provided in the first quarter?","Charles Horn","Yes. Dan, it's a situation where we think that from an EBITDA standpoint or a drain, we can take it to probably in the $94 million to $96 million of expense this year. As you saw going forward, we think that, from an EBITDA standpoint, we can take it to as low as $60 million or maybe even better. So, what you're seeing is the partial year benefit coming through in 2019. We'll look for the full run rate benefits entering into 2020.","Daniel Perlin","Okay. And then just one last quick one. The wind down in this retail marketing division at BrandLoyalty, how big was that business? Was that contemplated? Any just color there would be great.","Charles Horn","It was pretty small. I think the charge we took in the first quarter for it was around \u20ac8 million. It was basically a satellite office that wasn't really carrying its weight. It did have some inventory that had some lease improvements that we wrote off, but it wasn't overly large charge to us, Dan.","Operator","George Mihalos with Cowen. Your line is open.","Georgios Mihalos","And congrats, everyone, as well. Melisa, just wanted to follow up on something that you had said about fintech competition in the space, if you could kind of elaborate on that. And is it -- you're talking more about some of these nontraditional financing methods that maybe some of these retailers are employing sort of like a mini-layaway program. Or is it proliferation of digital wallets and Apple Pay or PayPal, things like that, where maybe there's an embedded funding source and that could be impacting usage?","Melisa Miller","Good morning, George. It's really the former and not the latter, and we're seeing it obviously in the web environment or the digital environment and certainly not in-store. It's really an acknowledgment that there are emerging payment types in the marketplace. We are watching them very, very closely. What's interesting about some of these fintech organizations is, as you know, none of them really have their own bank charter. So, we believe that we have a unique opportunity, both because we have expertise on the financial side and we have strong relationships with our brand partners on the technology side. And for me, it was really an acknowledgment that consumer needs are changing. In order for us to stay relevant and differentiated, we have to make sure that we have options to serve those needs. Does that help, George?","Georgios Mihalos","That's very helpful. That's perfect. And maybe just a quick follow-up. As you enter or expand in some of these newer verticals, just curious, the demographics of your customer, is that materially changing? Is there anything to kind of call out that are maybe a little bit different that have some of these historical users of your Private Label instruments?","Melisa Miller","Great question. From a credit quality standpoint, George, we would tell you that our standards certainly don't change. Demographically, though, our newer vintages are skewing a bit younger. And what we like about that is that helps to balance the overall demographics of our file. So, our legacy core has a tendency to be a bit more mature on the spectrum. And some of the newer brands that we've onboarded attract a slightly younger customer. So, on balance, it's a really great mix for us.","Operator","Jamie Friedman with Susquehanna. Your line is open.","James Friedman","It's a talented new team. Exciting time for the company. My first one is about in terms of the prior guidance, I know it's better for Charles or for Tim, but when you gave the receivables guidance last quarter, have that already contemplated the new portfolio acquisitions?","Timothy King","It had. It's just, obviously, we've contemplated that being later in the year. So, we pulled that up into Q2. And hence, the effect on the provision and the overall income for Q2. But we -- the number that we had given before for a year-end guidance had contemplated the portfolio acquisitions.","James Friedman","Got it. Okay. And then just a follow-up there. In terms of the $900 million in new AR, how should we be thinking about the profitability contribution of that, say, near and longer term? Anything you'd call out about that part of the book?","Timothy King","No. I would -- it's going to be fairly consistent with our -- the book, as you see it, the overall book. So, nothing that I'd call out in particular. It does take, obviously, a little bit time to spool up to get to normalcy, meaning that the first quarter, we're going to have a provision available. Once we get to run rate by the end of the year, it should be at the overall portfolio levels.","Operator","Ashish Sabadra with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Ashish Sabadra","Let me also echo my congratulations to the team. My question was on the allowance for loan losses. Those have been coming down. The results have been released. But as we think about receivables growing going forward, how should we think about the headwinds from result there going forward? And then also just a question on CECL. Any initial thoughts on CECL effective in 2020?","Timothy King","Sure. So, thanks, Ashish, for the question. First on the allowance, I wouldn't expect any additional pressure from the charge-off or the delinquency. Charge-off and delinquency, we expect to be very flat to slightly better on the year. And therefore, no pressure on allowance as contemplated under the guidance in 2019. As we adopt the CECL into 2020, we've been very successful in hardgoods and jewelry. Those assets generally have longer lives, so we would expect to have some build as we go into 2020 as we adopt CECL. We're going to have to look at the end-of-period balance sheet to see how much we have of the longer-lived assets versus short-lived assets. But we do expect some build.","Ashish Sabadra","Okay. That's helpful. And maybe a question on capital allocation going forward. Thanks for providing the details around the Dutch process, but my question was about the free cash flow. The business generates a lot of cash. How should we think about the use of cash going forward? And is there a change in strategy there?","Charles Horn","Ashish, the way we look at it is we'll continue to balance the leverage at the holdco, the parent-level debt. We've taken it down to a very manageable level at 1.6x leverage right at the moment. So, what we will try to do is balance the reward or basically the contributions back to the shareholders as well as balancing that parent-level debt. We think we're in very good shape. Going forward, I think it's going to be pretty much driven by the other initiatives we have underway. And that could influence how much we return to shareholders. It could be more or it could influence, as we go a little bit the other direction, it could be a little less. What I would anticipate there going forward is you'll still see a share repurchase program in place for Alliance Data. It will be probably an authorization of usually $500 million a year, of which some portion is going to be used to return capital to shareholders.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Vince Caintic with Stephens.","Vincent Caintic","Just of a question on the $900 million and perhaps the opportunity set for more portfolio acquisitions. What is the market looking like in terms of being able to acquire more? And then conversely, how does the organic market look like? So, if you could maybe talk about the $20 billion in guidance and how it looks like versus the -- further acquisitions versus the organic growth.","Melisa Miller","Vince, is your question would we expect any more portfolio acquisitions this year? I want to be sure I'm answering the question that you're asking.","Vincent Caintic","Yes, for this year. And then also just what you'd see as maybe the pipeline of portfolio acquisitions, if there's being market out there for more acquisitions.","Melisa Miller","Yes. Moving forward, 2020 and beyond, and we would tell you then into this year, we would be opportunistic if one or something became available. We don't have further acquisitions contemplated in this guidance that we've shared with you today. But again, we would be opportunistic if we could add value and it meets our financial hurdles, and we have a committed brand. With respect to the pipeline, in general, we have built out our pipeline for the next 3 to 4 years. So, we're pretty clear on which programs are likely to become available and are building a strategy on how or if we would pursue them.","Vincent Caintic","Got you. And when you look at those pipelines, I know you said that you have -- so you're growing but not necessarily at all costs. Sort of if you could give us a sense of when you look at a portfolio, what sort of hurdle rate and sort of what kind of characteristics you look at as you're looking for that growth.","Timothy King","Yes. I'll start and then let Melisa jump in. And on the -- I'll start off as the finance guy saying the first thing, we look for is commitment from the management team of our partners. When we have a strong commitment, those programs grow. And that basically then ends up being a program that we know we can grow the sales, we can grow the program, we can grow the number of accounts with -- coming out of those programs. So that's first and foremost. The size of the portfolio, the vertical therein as well as the credit profile dictates what type of return, we're going to demand of those. And so, we generally will talk about a blended, but we won't talk about a specific in the open market. We'll try to manage through the blended given the different verticals we're in and the different sized portfolios.","Melisa Miller","And we are, as I've mentioned earlier, I think several times today, really holding ourselves accountable to that ROE of 30% or greater. And the folks within card are conditioned for that type of threshold as well.","Operator","We have one final question in the queue, Surinder Thind with Jefferies.","Surinder Thind","Just following up on a question about the strategic direction of the firm. More specifically, when we look towards the end of the year, is the -- excluding any strategic decisions around BrandLoyalty, should we expect the firm to be at full run rate, meaning all of the changes surrounding the cost cuts of Epsilon, obviously, the repurchase of the shares from the Dutch auction. And then it seems like there's a little bit of variability around some of the spending around some of the initiatives. But how should we think about where the firm is going to be positioning at a year-end basis relative to kind of the pro forma guidance of run rates $22 do you think?","Charles Horn","And the answer is yes. We would be looking forward to the full pro forma run rate as of January 1. As we did talk about earlier, the $350 million that we've set aside as dry powder for the repurchase, there is some variability as to when we will deploy that, which could impact it to some degree, Surinder. But overall, I'd say, all the profitability initiatives, the corporate reductions, everything that we have planned will be at a full run rate by pretty much January 1.","Surinder Thind","Understood. And then just a point of clarification. How should we think about the growth of the active portfolio in the back half of the year, if you can just revisit that, and then maybe on a longer-term basis looking into 2020?","Timothy King","Sure. So, the active, the back half of the year, while on just a recorded average AR, you should be expecting mid-teens, low teens growth rate from active AR in the back half of the year. As we get towards the latter half of this year, we would expect to report it in active to be the same. And so, we won't obviously quote active on a go-forward because it -- we won't have the -- that look at that metric anymore.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to the presenters for final remarks.","Melisa Miller","Well, I will end the call the same way that I began the call today with great enthusiasm in this new role. I appreciate everyone's interest in our firm, everyone's congratulations, and we will talk with you next quarter. Thank you.","Timothy King","Thank you.","Operator","This concludes the Alliance Data second quarter 2019 earnings conference call. We thank you for your participation.

(Operator Instructions) In order to view the company\u2019s presentation on their website, please remember to turn off the pop-up blocker on your computer.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Ms. Julie Prozeller of FTI Consulting. Ma\u2019am, the floor is yours.","Julie Prozeller - Investor Relations, FTI Consulting","Thank you, operator. By now, you should have received a copy of the company\u2019s first quarter 2014 earnings release. If you haven\u2019t, please call FTI Consulting at 212-850-5721. On the call today, we have Ed Heffernan, President and Chief Executive Officer; Charles Horn, Chief Financial Officer of Alliance Data; and Bryan Pearson, Executive Vice President and President of LoyaltyOne.","Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on today\u2019s call and some of the responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risks and the uncertainties described in the company\u2019s earnings release and other filings with the SEC. Alliance Data has no obligation to update the information presented on the call.","Also on today\u2019s call, our speakers will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe will provide useful information for investors. Reconciliation of those measures to non-GAAP will be posted on the Investor Relations website at www.alliancedata.com.","With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Ed Heffernan. Ed?","Ed Heffernan - President and Chief Executive Officer","Great. Thanks, Julie. Joining me today is Charles Horn, our always exuberant CFO and Bryan Pearson visiting us from Canada and leader of LoyaltyOne. Charles will discuss the operating results for the first quarter and then Bryan will walk you through LoyaltyOne and in particular to new business, BrandLoyalty. I will wrap it up with a discussion about our guidance and outlook for \u201814. Charles?","Charles Horn - Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Ed. The year started off pretty much as we expected with strong revenue growth, up 17% from last year and dampened core EPS growth of 9% from last year due to incremental personnel cost needed to support growth expected in the back half of 2014. Even so, we dropped there some additional earnings meeting core EPS guidance of $2.70 for the quarter.","Organic revenue growth was strong at 8% driven by high single-digit organic growth at Epsilon and low double-digit organic growth at Private Label. For LoyaltyOne, organic revenue growth was essentially flat on a constant currency basis as their amounts redeemed dropped 4% compared to the first quarter of 2013. BrandLoyalty, which closed on January 2, 2014, added approximately $112 million in revenue to the first quarter.","Adjusted EBITDA, net reduced for funding cost and a portion attributable to the minority shareholders of BrandLoyalty increased 3% compared to the first quarter of 2013 burdened by higher payroll expense. We estimate that approximately $20 million was development payroll signifying it did not drive current period revenue, but is needed to support future revenue. BrandLoyalty added about $14 million of EBITDA, $9 million net of non-controlling interest to the first quarter, which we believe will be seasonally lowest quarter. Diluted share count was $66.1 million consistent with our guidance. With the maturity of the next and final tranche convertible debt in May, we expect our diluted share count to drop to approximately $63.1 million for the second quarter of 2014.","Let\u2019s turn to next slide and Bryan Pearson will talk about LoyaltyOne.","Bryan Pearson - Executive Vice President and President, LoyaltyOne","Thanks, Charles. LoyaltyOne\u2019s revenue increased 37% to $329 million due to the acquisition of BrandLoyalty, which as Charles said added $112 million. During the first quarter, we fought through a couple of headwinds in our core AIR MILES business as revenue declined 10% from the first quarter of 2013. The first and primary driver was the Canadian dollar being down by about 8% from a year ago. This lower translation rate dropped AIR MILES revenue by about $19 million. And then the second factor was that AIR MILES redeemed declined 4% from a year ago creating a revenue drag of about $6 million. We will likely face these kinds of headwinds throughout 2014.","Adjusted EBITDA increased 4% to $65 million for the first quarter. Again due to BrandLoyalty which added $14 million gross or $9 million net to LoyaltyOne. Adjusted EBITDA for the AIR MILES business was down 10% from the first quarter but was essentially flat on a constant currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA margin for AIR MILES remained consistent between quarters at 26%.","Adjusted EBITDA margin for BrandLoyalty was 13%, but we believe that we will definitely expand as the year progresses. AIR MILES reward miles issued actually decreased 4% compared to the first quarter of 2013 due to the weakness in consumer spending, some of which relates to the timing of the Easter holiday which landed in Q1 in 2013 and doesn\u2019t actually land until Q2 in 2014. And some of this relates also to regulatory changes which are eliminating reward mile issuance from prescription purchases in some regions. We still expect full year issuance growth to be in the low single-digit rate for 2014, mostly due to increased promotional spend and the addition of new sponsors in the back half of the year.","For the first quarter, AIR MILES redeemed decreased 4% due to reduced demand primarily for our travel related rewards. AIR MILES cash on the other hand our instant reward program continues to gain momentum with the rollout of 300 plus IGA stores in Quebec during the quarter. We expect the expansion of the AIR MILES cash offering to increase overall miles redeemed by approximately 3% compared to 2013.","Now, before turning to a discussion on BrandLoyalty let me just give you a brief update on Dotz. Our priority for Dotz in 2014 is really pretty simple. It is all about growth. We had an excellent start to the year as Dotz added 1.2 million collectors during the first quarter, bringing its total collector count to 12 million. In addition, we plan to continue our market expansion strategy in 2014 with a target of four new markets by the end of the year, which would bring the total market count to 13.","Why don\u2019t we turn to the next slide, during the quarter LoyaltyOne acquired a 60% stake in BrandLoyalty, which is a leader in transactional and emotional loyalty programs. BrandLoyalty is based in Netherlands and employs over 400 associates in 14 offices around the globe. The primary product offering they have is our short-term loyalty campaigns that are run for grocery retailers in Europe, Asia and Latin America. In the programs shoppers earn points using either digital or paper stamps for achieving spend thresholds during each shopping trip. The points are then redeemed in the store for high quality merchandise at BrandLoyalty sources and distributes to the retailer. Through its subsidiary Ice Mobile shoppers can also download custom mobile apps that add digital capability for earning and redeeming points as well as increasing customer engagement by a targeted mobile messaging.","BrandLoyalty\u2019s programs are short-term in nature, but they offer a full service no risk approach for the retailers to grow their sales. Starting with the program design and the actual selection of the products they use their unique data and analytical approach to support the procurement distribution and in-store merchandising of products that create the kind of aspirational short-term program that changes consumer behavior. These turnkey programs are proven to drive increased visits to the store and increased basket size which results in measurable sales results and a positive return on investments for their clients.","LoyaltyOne is excited about this acquisition as this offers the following strategic benefits. First BrandLoyalty is really one of two leading players in these type of short-term grocery promotions and they have an excellent track record of double digit organic growth, which clearly is an excellent fit with Alliance Data\u2019s growth model. Second, grocery retail is a key vertical for both LoyaltyOne and BrandLoyalty and we believe that we can leverage existing relationships to grow the BrandLoyalty platform in North America. And third, LoyaltyOne\u2019s advanced analytics capability and advisory services presents a new product offering for BrandLoyalty customers which will lead to future revenue synergies between our organizations. We are pleased with the results that we have had to-date and we are working diligently as a team towards new opportunities.","Now let me turn it back to Charles to discuss Epsilon.","Charles Horn - Chief Financial Officer","Thanks Bryan. If we turn to the next page Epsilon\u2019s revenue increased a healthy 9%, all organic to $348 million for the first quarter 2014. Technology led the way with 11% growth supported by 15% increase in database revenues fueled by expansion both in new and existing client base. E-mail which is part of technology continues to be soft, but we believe the next release of Harmony scheduled for the second quarter of 2014 will remedy that. Harmony which is our new digital messaging platform was recently ranked number one Red Pill Email for its features and functions and received a perfect score of five in the categories have been the security, queries and segmentation ease-of-use. The preview of this next release which had segmenting and multichannel capabilities has resulted in several new customer wins.","Moving on, agency also delivered a solid performance increasing 9% compared to the first quarter of 2013 driven by continued strength in the auto vertical. We are currently in the process of on-boarding two new agency clients, which should contribute revenue as 2014 progresses. Our outlook for 2014 remains high single-digit organic revenue growth supported by a backlog, which is up double-digits compared to the same time last year. Adjusted EBITDA net increased 1% to $55 million compared to the first quarter of 2013 as higher healthcare cost attributable to a higher associate participation rate, severance expense associated with the integration of HMI and upfront expenses incurred to ramp up two potentially large new clients dampened the revenue flow through to adjusted EBITDA.","In summary, it was a good start to the year for Epsilon. We remain positive about the product cross-selling opportunities generated from agency as well as the continued rollout of the Harmony platform. We could have done a little bit better with expense control in the first quarter, more labor inefficiencies than we would like to have seen, but some of the expense could not be avoided given our strong backlog and the need to staff in advance. Overall, strong start to the year with expected continued momentum.","Let\u2019s turn to the next slide and talk about Private Label. This quarter represents the ninth consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth for Private Label as revenue increased 13% to $562 million driven by 15% increase in average card receivables. Organic revenue growth was a robust 12%. Adjusted EBITDA net increased 7% to $244 million as the revenue flow through was dampened by 26% increase in operating expenses compared to the first quarter of 2013. As we talked about in the last earnings call, this increase was expected as we added about 1,000 new associates mailing our call centers in order to increase support capacity and prepare for future growth. We expect leveraging of operating expenses as the year progresses and we ramp up new clients.","Moving on in the P&L, the provision for loan losses increased 6% from the first quarter of 2013 primarily due to growth in credit card receivables, while funding cost remains stable between years despite the growth in receivables as we continue to replace maturing debt with cheaper new debt.","Now, let\u2019s turn to the next page and talk about some of the key metrics for Private Label. The total gross yields decreased 60 basis points when compared to the first quarter 2013 due to the impact of new programs. Moved into the second quarter, we expect to see a slight uptick in gross yields as this influence moderates. Importantly, we continue to pickup share during the quarter as our credit sales of core clients meaning pre-2012 (vintages) increased 7%, while overall client sales were about flat compared to the first quarter of 2013.","Normalized principal loss rates increased 20 basis points to 4.9%, while delinquency rates increased 10 basis points both compared to the first quarter of 2013. Based upon the trends we are seeing, we expect stable to slightly improving principal loss rates for the remainder of 2014. From a loan loss reserve standpoint, we ended the first quarter with a 6% reserve rate, which represents approximately 16 months of forward coverage. The last thing I will discuss is new metric added this quarter return on average assets. As you can see from the chart, we generated very strong return 6.4% this quarter compared to 6.5% last year. It is just another metric that reflects the difference in Private Label\u2019s business model compared to just a card issuer.","Let\u2019s move on and talk about liquidity. Liquidity at the corporate level remained strong at $1.1 billion at March 31, 2014 after deploying over $300 million on the BrandLoyalty acquisition and the share buyback program in the first quarter. Their levels remain modest with excellent debt service coverage ratios. As noted on the slides, we have $345 million of convertible notes coming due in the second quarter, which we planned to cash settle. This has created a little confusion in the market given at the current settlement value of the convertible notes would be about $1.9 billion. The way it works is we pay $345 million, the face value of the convertible notes, our hedge counterparties pay $1.55 billion and the noteholders receive a total of $1.9 billion in cash.","Several months after the debt maturity, we had to settle the other side of the hedge arrangement with our counterparties meaning the warrants. At ADS\u2019 current price, we would issue approximately 5.1 million shares to settle our obligation under the warrants. Importantly, these shares are already included in our diluted share count and are separating apart from the phantom shares you have heard us talk about so much in the past. In our nutshell, we paid $345 million in cash and issued 5.1 million shares to settle the convertible notes. Our guidance reflects all of this.","Lastly, Ed and I have always talked about our capital allocation priorities for 2014. And as we have indicated in the past, they will flip around based upon which gives us the best accretion. M&A will continue to be our first priority, but as you can see, the buyback program is still important to us. Year-to-date, we have spent $115 million of our $400 million board authorized program.","With that, I will turn it over to Ed.","Ed Heffernan - President and Chief Executive Officer","Alright, thanks guys. Now, I am going to step back a little bit and look at sort of the bigger picture and the overall view of how the years trending and other things that we are seeing out there and how they might impact the company. I would say overall obviously Q1 has got a lot of puts and takes in lot of moving pieces, but in general, I think we could probably sum it up by saying that we are very, very pleased with the organic growth rate of our top line. I know that\u2019s a big item out there in the marketplace these days and what we are finding is that once again, we are feeling very comfortable that this year we are going to run organically at 9%, maybe 10%. And that would be at least 3x GDP, which is our goal. So I think from a revenue perspective, you are talking 9%, 10% organic, you are talking 20% plus when you layer in BrandLoyalty, the top line looks very strong this year and we are bumping up guidance accordingly on our top line.","And from an expense perspective, obviously getting banged with the Canadian dollar is going to cost us 50 or 60 on top and probably about $0.15 to $0.17 on EPS. But again, I think we can play through that without a problem. So very strong organic top, overall top, 20% plus. And what we are looking at is we are seeing stronger revenue growth coming out of BrandLoyalty. We initially thought we are looking at about $0.5 billion of top line. It looks like it will already be more like 550. Epsilon is running a little bit stronger than we have thought as is private label. You take those three offset a little bit of it with the Canadian dollar and that\u2019s where we get an upward bias in our guidance for top line.","So very pleased there on I guess the balancing act that we are trying to accomplish this year, which is bringing on a huge book of new business at both Epsilon and our Private Label. We have alluded to last quarter fact that we are going to have to ramp up a significant amount of folks. And Charles mentioned, we added another 1,000 people just in the Private Label group to handle the book of business that we signed last year and we are signing now. That will obviously bodes extremely well for the back half of this year and going into \u201815 as well. Unfortunately, we need to absorb it now without the top line against it. So, that\u2019s a little bit of the drag that you are seeing in the first part of the year. We do feel very comfortable however that it\u2019s the right bet to make and that the back half and in 2015 we are going to be glad we did so.","So based on where the revenue is going, we think that we are right on track with where we want to be. Actually, I think we are actually trending a little bit better as we sit on top line. And as a result, we are going to go ahead and bump up guidance from 12.20 to 12.25 which would give us earnings growth of 22% for this year. I do think that\u2019s probably a conservative raise at this point. And as the year plays out, I certainly would hope that we can continue to drift that number upwards as the year progresses.","Turning to the page on the specific businesses, 2014 outlook, Bryan walk through what\u2019s going on in his businesses, I just wanted to sort of hit the highpoints again with the AIR MILES program. We expect on a constant currency basis revenue to be up in the low single-digits and adjusted EBITDA to be up somewhere in the mid single-digits. I think overall, those are good numbers for the year. I will call your attention to as we have seen over the past 18 years. The key metrics there, AIR MILES issued, we cautioned people from trying to look at it on a quarterly basis. If you look that at last year, our issuance by quarter was minus 3%, minus 5% and plus 11%, plus 12% and we ended the year plus 4%. That\u2019s pretty much which you\u2019re going to be seeing. This year you\u2019re going to see this thing jump all over the place because the lot of it is driven by promotional spend. We don\u2019t have visibility on a quarterly basis as much we do on an annual basis.","So, whether it\u2019s growing double-digits or down single-digits, I would caution anyone into reading too much into either movement and focus more on the full year basis. Bryan also alluded to the fact that well we have our full year goal of around plus 4%, plus 5% as we usually do. There is probably a point or so of risk due to some legislation up in coupled with provinces regarding our ability to issue for when someone buys prescription drugs, so that could damp in growth in that metric little bit, so more to come on that. But, overall LoyaltyOne should have a solid year once again.","BrandLoyalty, right of the gate, they are trending quite a bit stronger than we had anticipated which is always a great thing to see as the first quarter out of the new business. And their revenues are running stronger and we\u2019re pumping them up 10%. We would expect their organic revenue growth to grow over 20% this year. And when we are talking about our 9% to 10% organic growth, that excludes the organic growth at BrandLoyalty, because it was an acquisition. So, overall organic growth for the company would be even higher than that.","Brazil, as Bryan mentioned also it\u2019s all about scale and if you look back at 2011, we were under 2 million collectors, 2012, 6 million. Last year we ended just under 11 million and already we\u2019re up to 12 million this year. And so, I expect to have a very, very strong year this year. In Brazil, we\u2019re looking to expand into four new regions as well and we\u2019ll keep you posted on that. I always get the question of how do I \u2013 how can I value the Brazilian piece of the business and goodwill of some is that we would need about 2.5 dotz collectors \u2013 excuse me to be equivalent to about 1 AIR MILES collector. So, essentially in Canada, we\u2019ve got about 10 million folks and that generates the 1.25 billion or so of EBITDA. So, someone can do the math and come up to about 25 million is what we\u2019ll need down in Brazil.","So, I hopefully we\u2019ll be \u2013 we\u2019re about half way there at this point and it\u2019s looking right along. In Epsilon, again very strong story from a great organic perspective and it was nicely balanced to which is what we like. The database part or the technology part was quite strong double-digit during the quarter and should continue that, that\u2019s based on the large number of builds that are going on now, we brought on a lot of folks for the record number of databases that were assigned last year. A lot of this is again a continuing trend with folks wanting their own loyalty program, their own loyalty platform, their ability to collect that data on the consumer, they can lend to use for a data driven marketing. So, we\u2019re seeing very strong demand for that. It looks like if we typically sign about 15 of these type platform builds a year, last year we did 23 plus, this year we\u2019re currently running at that rate as well.","So, again I\u2019d say we\u2019re scrambling pretty hard right now to make sure we\u2019ve got the folks on board to make that happen. Charles mentioned the new Harmony platform which is getting very good reviews out there and I think it\u2019s so far so good, we will know probably by the end of second quarter. We\u2019ll be hopefully comfortable saying that this thing is after the races, right now we\u2019re just in the process of converting some clients over as we speak and we want to make sure everything is smooth there as well, so that\u2019s the scoop.","Epsilon, in Private Label, once again gets the gold star that I think they will share with BrandLoyalty for the quarter. Again new client growth continues to surprise. Historically we tend to sign about five new clients per year which is a bit under $400 million of new portfolio growth for vintage. And again when we talk about vintage and we talk about signing clients most of clients start from scratch and so it take three years for them to fully mature and that\u2019s why when we talk about $400 million vintage that means three years after signing that essentially gives us tremendous visibility into the next couple of years.","Well, as we talked about over the past couple of years in 2012 there just seem to be a massive shift of interest from number of retailers as well as new verticals in retail for our particular product offering which again allows a close loop network to pull out not just who the person is, but also the information down to the category or SKU level, which is really the gold standard in data these days. In \u201913 the shift continued to accelerate and we signed our first $2 billion vintage and in \u201914 we are absolutely tracking to another $2 billion vintage we have announced Virgin, Venus DSW and IDD. And just those four should be about the first $0.5 billion when they fully spool up. So we have a number of signings that we will be releasing over the next six months and it looks like it\u2019s going to be another huge year. And the importance of that is that it allows us to look into \u201915, \u201916 and \u201917 as these vintages spool up and be very comfortable with the type of growth rates that we want.","Probably the \u2013 I would say the most important item to note here is the continuation in tender share growth. So for example if on a typical clients 30% of their sales flow through our card that\u2019s probably a pretty decent level for us. And then you look at well once the client matures, once the program matures, at the client we tend to grow or should grow at the growth rate of the client. Well, what we found during the holiday season in Q4 and what we are continuing to see in Q1 is that this private label product is really beginning to take off in terms of probably the best type of loyalty tool that the retailer has and so we saw that in terms of comparing the growth rate in card sales against the growth rate in our client sales overall. And as many people know from the weather or whatever is being said out there, the first three months of this year you probably saw relatively flat sales growth in the retail space. Against that our core sales growth is more like 7%, so something is working out there and I think that\u2019s part of what\u2019s attracting more and more clients.","Overall the results, the credit card portfolio I think you saw we did about 15% in Q1 that is going to accelerate and we will be running around 20% as the year rolls out. Principal loss rate and funding rates are pretty stable and we are not seeing any blips here or there in terms of anything on the credit quality side it looks good. Obviously we have brought on a ton of new folks which is great thousand plus people onshore, which will of course hit the expenses pretty hard until we have those programs ramped up and the revenue flowing through. But I think it\u2019s certainly the right thing to do.","So the overall outlook mid to high teens growth in revenue, double digit growth in adjusted EBITDA for \u201914, so another good year overall. Finishing up on the last item, and we will open up to questions. There is no question that the ongoing shift of spend in marketing dollars from sort of general brand spending into data driven marketing and loyalty programs continues. I don\u2019t think its news to anyone. Fortunately, we are on that side of the bet. And all three of our businesses were continuing to see a very high level of interest in every vertical out there trying to get a better beat on who their customer is, and how he or she behaves and how we can entice them to be a more loyal customer into frequent the retailer more often.","For us, we essentially have four objectives for the year and they are pretty straightforward. We are primarily an organic growth shop. Our goal is to grow our top line at 3x GDP. So, we would say roughly 9% for the year. We expect overall revenue growth rate of 22% as we are seeing a bit stronger results on top line from BrandLoyalty, Epsilon and Private Label. And then we have got a little bit of offset with the Canadian dollar. That will flow through the core EPS growth of 22%. And in the middle there, of course, our expenses and there is a lot of frontloading right now going on both in Private Label and at Epsilon and it\u2019s just the nature of those businesses that you got to pay for it now. And it starts flowing in a little bit later, but I think that means that it bodes extremely well for the future and we are building the foundation for the future and while we are on-boarding a record amount of new businesses.","So, if I were to finally sum it up I would say the year is tracking a little bit better out of the gate than we had anticipated. It\u2019s a little bit choppy in the first half, but it\u2019s because we are building for the second half and into \u201815, \u201816, and \u201817 which is for me where a lot of my attention is being spent these days. And then finally, I will sort of sum up obviously in the market, there has been a fair amount of volatility to start out the year and there is not much we can do about that, but we can say that with volatility comes opportunity. And from our perspective, things are looking a bit more intriguing now if this volatility continues. So that being said, I think we will cut it off here and we will move to Q&A. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.","Sanjay Sakhrani - KBW","And so starting with Epsilon, the two new agency deals that you guys spoke about, could you maybe just talk about when you onboard the revenues, are there going to be significant incremental costs that you incur? Are most of those costs kind of being incurred now and then the revenues come after? And maybe if you could give us a little bit more qualitative color on kind of the nature of these two relationships, because they seem pretty sizable? And then maybe just one on Private Label, could you just also talk about the M&A pipeline, you have a player that\u2019s going public, obviously Wells came into the market a little bit? So maybe you can just talk about how that M&A pipeline is materializing? Thank you.","Ed Heffernan","Sure. Let me start with the second and finish with the first. The M&A pipeline per se in Private Label, it\u2019s really if you look at the clients that we have signed probably 90% plus of the clients that were signing, they are starting a program from scratch. So, we are not really in the takeaway game from an M&A perspective. They will be one or two files probably per year that we will onboard and I would expect that to be the case this year as well. But for the most part, Sanjay, this stuff is coming from clients who either have had a program in the past and dead now and they are going to start cranking it up again or folks who have never had one. So, I think in terms of running into the other folks, for the most part, unless it\u2019s a really large file. I think we are comfortable in our sandbox. It\u2019s usually trying \u2013 our biggest challenge is trying to convince the prospect that the Private Label platform is the better loyalty option than other options. Of course one of the other options is Epsilon. So it\u2019s sort of a delicate balance there.","On speaking of Epsilon itself on the agency deals, yes, we are beginning to see some traction in terms of selling through the stacks so to speak, which would be not only the creative and agency side of it, but also allowing Epsilon to be the provider of things such as the demographic and psychographic data the database build as well as the analytics and distribution side of the business as well. So I am not going to get into the specific clients themselves, but we are seeing some traction on that side. On the expense side yes, I mean whenever you are in strong \u2013 when you are signing a strong book of business you are always going to have expenses that are running in front of the revenue and that should even out of your progresses.","Sanjay Sakhrani - KBW","Okay. And just one more on the Epsilon question, just is the opportunity to move some of those new relationships into the other lines as well but maybe materialize as revenue and in database and technology as well?","Ed Heffernan","Yes, that\u2019s the game plan or it could be a big tech client today and we would try to sell in the agency side.","Sanjay Sakhrani - KBW","Okay, alright, great perfect. And then I just had one last one for Bryan, maybe you can just give us a little bit of a refined window into Brazil, I guess Ed you mentioned that 25 million collector target to get to roughly the size of Canada. How do you guys get there from where you are right now because it seems like a lot of the collectors you got thus far came from Banco do Brasil?","Bryan Pearson","Yes, I think there is \u2013 they did come from Banco do Brasil but they also came very much from the retail partners that we have in each of the regions that we have launched, so I would suggest the following is that we have been doing market by market rollout. We have been trying to get and look for a national sized grocery player which would help us penetrate the two largest markets which are basically Rio and Sao Paulo. So remember that we are now at 12 million customers in that marketplace and we are now in the two largest cities in Brazil. There are still a number of markets there are last, so you can think about it three ways. One is we continue growing into new markets as we have been doing and that would take us on the pace and cadence that we are on today.","The second piece would be by adding additional partners to the mix so when that big grocer or a new fuel player or a bigger electronics players or whatever it maybe those will make the program more attractive and add even more customers from the existing markets we are in but also lend us the opportunity to do the third thing which is really grow that national presence which would bring Rio and Sao Paulo into the mix. That\u2019s sort of the (indiscernible). I think we are quite comfortable that we can continue with kind of the pace of growth that we have been on in the last for the while and the focus for us right now is to build a very viable program in all the markets that we are in which today collective activation which would be the measure of how many points are they redeeming, how many partners are they using those metrics are tracking quite nicely with what the early days were in Canada and so we feel quite confident that we are on the right track in terms of the value proposition we have for the marketplace.","Sanjay Sakhrani - KBW","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller with Barclays.","Darrin Peller - Barclays","Yes, you can help us understand what may have surprised you with regard to your top line growth during the quarter versus your initial I think $1.25 billion guidance maybe beyond currency. And then maybe you could just rank the key drivers enabling you to raise revenue guidance for the year despite this quarter and maybe just conservatism in the private label business that was going into the year or are they better than expected results in BrandLoyalty and what are key variables should we focus on? Thanks.","Ed Heffernan","Yes, Darrin in terms of the revenue I would say really came from two areas one FX was a little bit worse than what we anticipated to see here a little bit more pressure coming on LoyaltyOne. The second was we just acquired BrandLoyalty and initially probably we are a little optimistic on terms of the revenue but really it\u2019s a sequencing issue which is they are stilling to hit there as we had talked about we are actually going to have a very good year for BrandLoyalty revenue. Probably initially we thought the revenue would be a little bit stronger in the first quarter than what it ended up checking out. So I think it\u2019s just more of a timing issue for us nothing more, the currency was a little more pronounced BrandLoyalty timing issue on the revenue but still very strong for the year. And then if you go through and look at why we feel better about the revenue stream. Obviously, Ed's already talked about BrandLoyalty going from $500 million to $550 million. Ed also talked about private label. We started the year with 15% growth on average receivables. Now we are talking about 20%. So that\u2019s the upside we are seeing. The third of it is we did start off a little bit stronger with Epsilon, good, high-single digit organic growth, looking for some new clients to come through on Harmony, which could give a little upside to the back half of the year. And then going back to Sanjay\u2019s point as we do have these two big clients ramping, if we get to the point of revenue growth where we can recognize in Q3, Q4 that gives upside to the year as well.","Darrin Peller - Barclays","","Alright that\u2019s helpful. So, if we were to rank I mean it sounds like it is basically the BrandLoyalty upside, although it sounds like the first quarter was a little bit weaker, but you are still expecting that to ramp up enough and see the evidence that it will ramp up enough to actually do better than you initially planned, latter part of the year?","Ed Heffernan","","Yes.","Darrin Peller - Barclays","","Okay and then private label obviously you are looking at 20% versus 15% and then those two big deals for ramping in. Alright that\u2019s helpful, just on the credit quality side, one question. It seems like provisions were about $20 million or $25 million below your charge off level in the quarter, which typically we see you guys more in line or a little higher although you also seem like at least by our calculation you are still over 100 basis points higher in terms of your allowance level than your charge-offs, which is still a really conservative question, are we thinking about this correctly in the sense of how you want to keep that level going forward or \u2013 I mean can you give us a little guidance in terms of how we should think by your allowance levels for the rest of the year?","Ed Heffernan","I think you are right Darrin, in terms of the spread between the reserve rates and the trailing charge-off rate 100 bps to 110 bps is reasonable. Like we talked about we are still looking about 16 months forward of coverage in terms of the reserve we currently carry. So that\u2019s obviously very robust when most card companies would carry more like 9 to 12 months worth of coverage. So I think it will be \u2013 continue to be very conservative or and I will say appropriate in that regard. Good forward coverage, good spread, think of it being in 100 basis points and 110 basis points range.","Darrin Peller - Barclays","Okay, very helpful. Alright, thanks guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brett Huff with Stephens Inc. Your line is open.","Brett Huff - Stephens Inc","","Hello, can you guys hear me, okay?","Ed Heffernan","Yes.","Brett Huff - Stephens Inc","Okay, sorry about that. One quick \u2013 just to put a little finer point on the guidance Charles I want to make sure I understood this. What was your expectation for the Canadian headwind in the prior guided range versus the \u2013 I think its $55 million and I am just trying to balance that with it seems like the benefit of an extra $50 million or so we are going to get from BrandLoyalty?","Charles Horn","So, when we came out with our guidance last quarter, we were assuming the Canadian dollar would be about 0.94. Now we think the Canadian dollar will be more like 0.91 for the year. Now, the headwinds we face will be throughout the full year, but worse in the first quarter and lightest in the fourth quarter. So what we saw was a little bit more than negative impact in Q1 than we anticipated. We have taken it down little bit for the year, which is obviously included in our 12\/25 core EPS guidance. But again as the year goes on it abates in terms of the amount of the headwinds.","Brett Huff - Stephens Inc","","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And can you talk about a little bit more on that Epsilon frontend loading \u2013 I think you called out in the press release a couple of million dollars, but it sounds like it might be a bigger project than that or it\u2019s been \u2013 somebody already asked that question, but I just wanted to know a little bit more on \u2013 is it $2 million or is there more ancillary stuff in there, that\u2019s harder to quantify, we thought the profitability will be better in Epsilon, I am trying to understand what\u2019s going on in there?","Charles Horn","I guess I consider more direct costs we are incurring to rollout the platform with these clients. Again, if it\u2019s a large client and technology platform in this case software we are rolling out, it takes a number of months to get rolled out. During that timeframe we\u2019re incurring the expense the direct expense due to rollouts but we are deferring the revenue stream until it really gets up and ramped. So what you are seeing now is just the deferment expense. The expense we have to incur to get technology platform rolled out. But then when we get to the point of recognizing the revenue stream in Q3, Q4 then you can see the leveraging coming through a little bit obviously the EBITDA margin contribution.","Ed Heffernan","Yes, I think one of the things that we are beginning to see now given the size of Epsilon with north of 5000 people is that when you are signing 23 new deals a year on platforms and stuff you have got to bring in a lot of folks. And these are folks who are what we call folks who have the hot skills where we are competing with the other folks out there, the Googles or Facebooks and stuff like that for the same talent. And so getting those folks, getting them in the door, getting in the size of the labor force that we need, it\u2019s becoming something that is now more of a challenge than it was when we are a lot smaller, I will tell you that. And so we will probably hear on the side of getting a little bit more in the door sooner rather than later to make sure we have the pool available.","Brett Huff - Stephens Inc","Okay. And then one last question, I think Ed, you talked a little bit about Private Label going forward and it sounds like you are spending time there. And I think the last call you have said that 2015 Private Label sort of spots to start implementing, where we are starting to look a little scarce. First of all, I want to make sure that I am remembering that right. And if so, can you give us your sense of that same view of today?","Ed Heffernan","Yes. In terms of \u201814 obviously we are all booked up. And it\u2019s training the resources a little bit at this point. And so we probably \u2013 we are drifting into slots for \u201815 already. To your point, I would say, we could probably launch as up to at most 20 clients in a given year given that we used to do five. I would say, folks have done a spectacular job giving us that capacity, but I would say 20 is about it and it sort of goes back to the overall theme that we have been talking about, which is organic top line is very strong, revenue is very strong. We are going to flow through enough of it to give us the 20% plus earnings growth. Our real issue this year is not going to be bringing in top line and organic growth. Our biggest issue this year is on execution and making sure that with these record books of businesses, especially at Epsilon in the Private Label that the machine does a breakdown frankly. And that\u2019s where we are putting all of our efforts. In terms of the year, I think the financials are in very good shape for the year as there maybe a couple of minor tweaks as the year unfolds hopefully to the upside, but we are 100% focused right now on just handling the two books of businesses that we have signed and getting those on with how things preying at the themes.","Brett Huff - Stephens Inc","Great, thanks for your time.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Togut with Evercore.","David Togut - Evercore","Thank you and good morning. Could you comment on the unit pricing outlook for Private Label, Epsilon and LoyaltyOne for this year and next year?","Bryan Pearson","I am not sure exactly what you mean, David. I will probably answer a little bit differently. If you were looking at EBITDA margins, we are looking probably for stable to maybe slightly up in LoyaltyOne and AIR MILES. Obviously, we will see some improvements coming through on BrandLoyalty as the year progresses. For Epsilon, EBITDA margins probably flat to maybe up slightly. For Private Label, just because a little bit reserve build associated with the growth, you will probably see a little bit of EBITDA margin compression in the Private Label space. Is that what you are going, David?","David Togut - Evercore","That\u2019s helpful. And to follow that up in the Private Label space, I am curious if you are seeing any change in unit pricing as you compete for some of these new awards or have most of these awards that you highlighted in the quarter really been so sourced?","Bryan Pearson","I wouldn\u2019t say we are seeing really any pricing pressure in that regard. If you look for the year, we are saying that gross yields maybe down as much as 40 basis points. If I take out the ramp of the new programs, required programs, basically flat to maybe slightly up, so that would tell me really what you are seeing is the influence of the growth, not the influence of pricing pressure coming through on resounding to deals are basically some of the programs we have, really it\u2019s just the ramp you are seeing.","David Togut - Evercore","That\u2019s helpful. And just a quick final question on the co-branding side, could you update us on your strategy in co-branding?","Ed Heffernan","Sure. I think that one of the things we are trying to do in our Private Label business is to diversify a little bit away from our traditional verticals which would be soft goods, jewelry, home furnishings. And so co-brand, the choice of whether to use private label or co-brand is really up to the client. And what we found is there are certain verticals where co-brand works best and specifically (indiscernible), hospitality, those are the areas where there is a huge amount of interest in just having co-brands. So, if you see an announcement in those areas, so for example, with Caesars or with Virgin America something like that, those are going to be the co-brand space. The majority of our business will always continue to be Private Label, but there is a slot that\u2019s opening up for co-brand.","David Togut - Evercore","And then on that point, to what extent, can you extract skew level data from a co-brand card?","Ed Heffernan","Sure. It\u2019s the same gig. It\u2019s actually what you do is because we are the merchant acquirer and the issuer for co-brand if the transaction takes place at that retailer, clearly, we can extract the same type of information as long as the merchant, once again in Greece to give us that information. For purchases outside of the retailer, we can\u2019t get that level of information we could probably only get where you went and what you thought and how much you spend at the whole location. So it\u2019s sort of for stuff that takes place at the retailer, we can get the same level of information. That\u2019s the deal with the merchant. And outside of that, it\u2019s we are sort of stuck up with just sort of total dollars being spent.","David Togut - Evercore","What percentage of purchases on co-brand typically occur as the retailer on the card versus outside of that?","Ed Heffernan","I don\u2019t know, David. I don\u2019t have the stat.","Charles Horn","It\u2019s all over the place.","Ed Heffernan","Yes.","David Togut - Evercore","Okay, thank you very much.","Ed Heffernan","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Scharf with JMP Securities.","David Scharf - JMP Securities","Good morning. Thank you. Two areas. First on Epsilon, I wanted to follow up on earlier questioning about kind of cross-selling, has there been a history thus far of moving any agency clients to become data and technology clients or is there a track record over the last couple of years since you have entered the agency business?","Ed Heffernan","It hasn\u2019t been nearly as strong as it should be. A lot of that has to do with we really just finished, I think we talked about last year the organizational changes at Epsilon, whereas before we sold by product. So you would have someone responsible for the agency P&L, someone else responsible for technology, someone else for distribution, etcetera, etcetera. We rearranged everything so that now the P&L is by vertical. So if you are in the auto vertical, your P&L responsibilities are now cut across all the products. And as a result, your comp is cut across all the products. And we have found that when you tie your comp to that type of goal that tends to move the needle. So I would say that you had a smattering of deals last year. This year we are beginning to see much more sell-through. And it goes both ways. It goes agency clients which are now going into the technology side and technology going upstream into agency. So it\u2019s I would say this year and next year should be significant years for the sell-through.","David Scharf - JMP Securities","Got it, got it. That\u2019s helpful. And then secondly turning to Private Label, there is helpful commentary on the yield outlook, maybe there is more a tougher question to answer, it\u2019s more qualitative or macro driven, but setting aside the near-term headwinds on gross yields just because you are boarding on more new clients, you have to build bigger reserves. Is there \u2013 can you give us a sense for whether gross yields are still running below ignoring the new client aspect, whether gross yields are running below kind of historical peaks just based on the percentage of your yield that\u2019s coming from late fees? I am just trying to understand whether or not as we think about ultimately where that portfolio can trend, whether it\u2019s still let\u2019s say more of a prime portfolio or a higher credit score portfolio than you actually like? Just trying to understand kind of what key profitability can be and whether late fees are still representing about a third of gross yield or if their payment rates are still too high?","Ed Heffernan","I think if you take out the influence of the new programs right around to where it is, is about where we would want it to be. Said in other way, we are not really trying to push it up or push it down. You will have some influences coming through there, David. Obviously, we have an APR tied to primary. So if you see short-term rates go up, then you are going to see the APRs go up. So you can see little bit of float there naturally that the increase in APR offsetting the increase in funding cost. Flipside of it is they have talked about we are doing a little bit more co-brand than what we did in the past. Co-brands going to carry a little bit lower gross yield than what a typical PLCC would. So I would say expecting for those will be somewhat static, but those will have an influence on a go-forward basis that it\u2019s hard for me to really answer your question exactly. We do have a prime portfolio. We will endeavor to keep it that way. Going back to even 2007, we have kept our underwriting standards very consistent. Approval rates now are still pretty low for us, which would exceed them over time as people repair the credit. But aside from the two structures I talked about, I don\u2019t really see the impetus to make it to go up or down.","David Scharf - JMP Securities","Okay, very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust","Guys, good morning. Thank you for taking the questions. Ed, I appreciate the color on the pipeline and it sounds like demand is strong sort of across your businesses. I have been following Alliance for a while and I certainly have less than perfect memory, but I can\u2019t remember a time when you called out a 1,000 new employees in a call center. For example, can you just frame up for us how you balance visibility and I think you mentioned a couple of potential large customers at Epsilon suggesting that they are not signing. Can you just frame up the balance between the frontend loaded investment and perhaps the risk on either timing of new deals coming on this year or the risk that you don\u2019t win the contracts, you think you are going to win and how you frame that up in the context of your real confident second half outlook?","Ed Heffernan","Yes. It\u2019s I mean you hit the nail on the head. It\u2019s a balancing act. What we are finding is that really especially at Epsilon and at Private Label, you are just seeing more demand, more demand and more demand, which is as we say a great problem to have. I think hiring 1,000 people at Private Label. We need those folks up and running. We need the call centers built. We need the space provided well in front of these clients moving up. I think the messaging here is that none of this is hiring on spec. We are hiring folks based on deals that have been signed. So in the case of Private Label as we said, we have got 20 new folks, 20 new clients going up this year. The backlog looks very strong. And at Epsilon, we have got 23 big platform builds going on this year and getting those people in the door. That\u2019s the big challenge. And we are going to try to match delivering 20% earnings growth this year at the same time not letting business fall through the cracks. So we can have strong growth outlook for \u201815 and \u201816. It\u2019s a longwinded way of saying it\u2019s a balancing act. It\u2019s a good problem to have, but it doesn\u2019t take much either way to get your expenses to shoot out of control for a quarter or two. And we want to make sure that doesn\u2019t happen.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust","Okay. And you guys have a good track record of forecasting your business. One last one if I might just with regard to the loyalty business generally, when you step back and look at the traditional AIR MILES business versus some of them, it\u2019s BrandLoyalty or the cash rewards business in Canada or certainly the growth in Brazil, would you frame that up at all as kind of a changing of the guard or a maturation of your loyalty business generally or is that too sort of dramatic comment I guess?","Ed Heffernan","I think it\u2019s \u2013 let\u2019s put it this way. The program is 22 years old. When you have got a business that\u2019s been running for that long and you have got 17% of Canadians participating in the program, you could look at it and say is it in a maturing phase as a business overall? And I think that you could put that color on? And the reality is that we still see a lot of opportunity in that business for growth. Is it going to be a strong double-digit growth in the future? No, it doesn\u2019t have the potential to be mid to high single-digit as you go forward, yes. We have some things that we put in place, which will help us get there. And the answer to that is yes. We probably have the best year of signing new partners that we have had in years last year. If you look at that 10 million households, there is a portion of them that are very engaged in the program and there is a portion of them that are using some sponsors, but they are not holistically engaged in the program and using it as their primary reward vehicle. And so we see opportunity to continue to add sponsors in categories to continue to basically add to continue add more cross sponsor activations, we would say in other words a measure of engagement. And as a result of that, we think that there is opportunities with things like the cash program to change the nature of what our growth pattern has been over the last years. I think as much as anything, Canada has had an anemic spending environment for probably the better part of 18 months now. And I think the consumer is cautious in terms of how they are spending. And so a little bit of economic recovery and a little bit of these other strategies will get us back to a healthier outlook going forward.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust","Okay, that\u2019s great. Thank you.","Ed Heffernan - President and Chief Executive Officer","Okay. I think that wraps it up and we will talk to you next quarter. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you.

If you haven't, please call FTI Consulting at 212-850-5721.","On the call today, we have Ed Heffernan, President and Chief Executive Officer of Alliance Data; and Charles Horn, Chief Financial Officer of Alliance Data.","Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on today's call and some of the responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risks and the uncertainties described in the Company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC. Alliance Data has no obligation to update the information presented on the call.","Also, on today's call, our speakers will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe will provide useful information for investors. Reconciliation of those measures to GAAP will be posted on the Investor Relations website at www.alliancedata.com.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Ed Heffernan. Ed?","Ed Heffernan","Great. Thanks Eddie and welcome everyone. As usual, joining me today is Charles Horn, our CFO. And he's going to kick it off with an update on third quarter results, and then I'll jump in with full year expectations, and then provide the next layer of detail to our 2018 guidance. Charles?","Charles Horn","Thanks Ed. Revenue for the third quarter increased 1% to $1.9 billion, soft against our mid-single digit expectations, primarily due to hurricanes Harvey and Irma negatively impacting the growth shields at Card Services, which knocked off about three points of growth. Core EPS increased 13% to $5.35 for the third quarter 2017, better than our expectations, primarily driven by lower loss rates of Card Services and a lower tax rate, a result of initiatives implemented during 2017.","Excluding the improvement and the effective tax rate, core EPS increased approximately 9% for the third quarter. Adjusted EBITDA net increased 7%, benefiting from the better-than-expected loss rate at Card Services. During the quarter, we reduced our corporate debt by approximately $180 million to $6.2 billion. That brings our corporate leverage ratio down to about 2.8x as of September 30, 2017 versus our covenant of 3.5x, leaving us with over $2 billion in available liquidity.","Let's slip to the next slide and talk about LoyaltyOne. As expected, the third quarter was tough for LoyaltyOne, with revenue decreasing 20% to $305 million and adjusted EBITDA decreasing 26% to $61 million. Fortunately, the future looks brighter for this segment.","Breaking it down by major business. AIR MILES revenue decreased 28% to $185 million for the third quarter of 2017, driven by a 43% decline in AIR MILES reward miles redeemed. This drop in revenue was consistent with our expectations as we pulled in the burn rate, which are miles redeemed divided by miles issued from 129% last year to 80% this year.","80% is our target, really, moving forward. Importantly, the negative draw over from the elevated redemption rate is gone entering the fourth quarter of 2017. AIR MILES issued was down 7% year-over-year. Normal spend is on track, but we have seen less promotional activity in the grocery vertical. We expect issuance growth to improve in the fourth quarter and in 2018. Importantly, we recently re-signed BMO, our largest AIR MILES sponsor, to a multi-year contract.","BrandLoyalty's revenue decreased 5% to $121 million for the third quarter of 2017, consistent with our expectations. BrandLoyalty's fourth quarter is looking good, with revenue and adjusted EBITDA expected to increase double digits year-over-year.","Let's go to Slide 5 and talk about Epsilon. Epsilon came in short of expectations for the third quarter, with revenue increasing 3% to $559 million and adjusted EBITDA decreasing 7% to $125 million. Year-to-date, revenues has increased 5%, slightly better than annual guidance while adjusted EBITDA is essentially flat, soft compared with our annual guidance of 4% growth.","Revenue came in short of expectations as the growth rate in our digital offering slowed during the quarter. We believe the onboarding of new clients will fill this hole quickly. The pull back in digital growth also negatively impacted EBITDA margins for the third quarter. Importantly, Epsilon's technology platform offering continued to show progress toward a promising turnaround, with revenue increasing 1% for the third quarter. This is a significant improvement compared to the double-digit decline in the fourth quarter 2016.","The client base is showing stability, and we've seen an increased win rate on the basis of the introduction of cloud-based more packaged products into the market. Let\u2019s now move on to Card Services. Card Services produced another solid quarter growth, with revenue up 9% to $1.1 billion and adjusted EBITDA net up an even better 20%. Average card receivables increased 14%, just under $16 billion, consistent with our expectation of mid-teens growth while credit sales increased 5% to $7.4 billion.","Operating expenses increased 16% to $382 million or 9.2% expressed as a percentage of average of receivables. The percentage is essentially being flat with last year. The net loss rate was 5.5% for the third quarter 2017. A substantial improvement compared to the 6.2% loss rate in the second quarter of 2017 and better than our expectations.","Importantly, gross loss rates were flat with the third quarter of 2016, even excluding the slight benefit from the hurricanes, which I'll talk about later. Recovery rates are still down year-over-year, pressuring the net loss rate, but we consider this pressure to be transitory as we shift collections back to internal. Our delinquency forecast continues to suggest flat to lower loss rates in 2018. This trend allowed us to slightly drop our reserve rate during the quarter while maintaining 12 months of forward coverage.","Now the question everyone has been asking what was the impact of the hurricanes. We estimate the hurricanes reduced our credit sales by approximately two points, reduced our revenue by about $40 million for the quarter or about 100 basis points negative impact to gross yield and benefited our loss rates by about 15 basis points. So what that means to our gross loss rates were down 18 bps year-over-year, take away the 15 basis points for the improved from the hurricanes, and that's roughly the flat year-over-year change in our gross loss rates. It is important to remember that this is a temporary impact. Under FEMA-designated individual assistant disaster areas, affected cardholders are not required to make payments nor will any interest or late fees be assessed for two month period. Hurricane Irma will impact us early in the fourth quarter and then operations will return to normal.","With that, I will turn it over to Ed.","Ed Heffernan","Great. Thanks Charles. Slide 9, full year 2017 outlook on a consolidated basis, we're going to reiterate guidance of $7.8 billion in revs and $18.10 in core EPS. Obviously, on the rev side, the hurricanes hit us, as Charles said for about $40 million in Q3. We expect another $40 million in Q4. So it is about a $80 million on the top. Despite that, we are going to maintain the $7.8 billion guidance for the year.","In terms of earnings per share, despite the big beat in this quarter, we are keeping it the same for now. If you flow through the impact of the hurricanes all the way down, we expect that to be about a $0.25 headwind between Q3 and Q4. We think we can play through that primarily because \u2013 as Charles mentioned, our loss rates are actually coming in a little bit better than anticipated even after the impact of the hurricane. So for now, we're going to use that as sort of our cushion to make sure we can play to the hurricane and hit the $18.10.","So what does it all mean? It means that the slingshot that we've been talking about it seems forever is finally on track. The delinquency wedge is closing this month, which we're all looking forward to, and we expect Q4 to have our delinquencies finally anniversaried, and that means good news for next year.","As Charles also mentioned, growth losses, which were up 75 basis points in the first half of the year, we thought they'd be up about 30 in the third quarter and flat in the fourth quarter, actually came in slightly better in the third quarter, and were, in fact, flat in the third quarter versus prior year even after factoring out the hurricane. So we're running about a quarter earlier in terms of the benefits of the lower loss rates, which is, obviously, good news and led to the overperformance in the quarter.","Recoveries also remain soft due to market conditions, but should they make 2018 a pretty easy comp from that perspective. So, you put it all together and slingshot looks like it's shaping up pretty nicely. The momentum is building as you see our core EPS went from 2% in Q1 to 4% in Q2 double digits Q3 and we're going to be high single, low double in Q4. So it's getting ready for a nice run here in the back half. And as you move sequentially from Q3 to Q4, the big mover in Q4 finally after three sort of soft quarters, will be LoyaltyOne, which sequentially will add $0.50 a share more than it did in the third quarter. So that's the big mover that we're looking for.","And let's turn now to Slide 10, which is the 2017 outlook. We start with Epsilon. The original guidance was $2.24 billion in revenue and about $0.5 billion in adjusted EBITDA, 4% top and bottom. Year-to-date, we're running a little bit ahead on revs and a little bit behind on EBITDA. But in general, we're right in that range where we needed to be. On the Technology Platform side, which was, if you recall, the big issue last year, it was sort of a melting iceberg there for a while.","Revenues were actually down 13% in Q4 of last year, then it was minus 7% and minus 3% and actually this quarter, it turned to plus 1%. And so we think for now, we've got a pretty good miles traffic there that's going to be additive next year.","All right, let's go to Slide 11, which is LoyaltyOne, which has the two components, Canada and then BrandLoyalty or the business based over in Europe. Canada, no change in guidance. From beginning of the year, we expect a little over [$750 million] in revs and $180 million in adjusted EBITDA. Looks like we're coming in fine with both of those. We're making solid progress on retooling the model, the margins are running in the mid-20% range, which was what we were shooting for. Probably the two biggest pieces we were focused on this year would be the sponsors, those are the folks that pay us. We've seen no attrition from the sponsored ranks, and as Charles mentioned, we just renewed our biggest one, the Bank of Montreal. So that bodes well.","On the collectors' side, the question was are they going to be reengaged? Are we going to lose a bunch of active collectors because of the noise last year? And we were down about 6% in the latter part of 2016 in terms of total numbers of collectors who are active in the program. That's now to within 1% pre-crisis, as we would call it. So looks like the collectors are hanging in there. The one are that we're still working on while the core issuance is stable, which is about two thirds of all of the issuance, the promotional-related activity is still soft, and we want to start seeing that from up as soon as Q4.","So, we've got a couple of ideas on that down that front of a couple of big programs we're launching. BrandLoyalty, as we talked about last quarter, was probably the surprise this year in the sense that it was soft through all three quarters of the year and traditionally and historically has grown double-digit top and bottom. You could pretty much set your watch to it. And as we looked into it, we wanted to make sure that there wasn't a structural issue, that was more of a timing or transitory issue, and it looks like we're going to be in good shape for Q4.","We expect return to strong double-digit in Q4 and give us a nice jump-off for next year. So it was bit painful for the first three quarters and then, we're finally going to see some of the benefits in Q4.","All right, Card Services, where we get about 99.9% of our questions. Let's talk a little bit about that. Card receivables growth of 15%. You will see that on some of the monthly reports, we get some questions of, oh, it looked like it decelerated a little bit from earlier in the year, and is that the trend? And the answer is, no. What we did is we proactively went out there and there are a handful of portfolios that are viewed as noncore at this point that have been moved to held for sale and \u2013 since they no longer fit. It also clears the deck for us to bring on Signet without really stretching ourselves and keeping us that 15% growth rate for the year. So that should be where we wind up for the year.","We signed $2 billion vintage, and you'll see a handful of announcements coming before year-end that will be additive to what we have announced so far. Gross yields, as Charles talked about are down in the third quarter and will be down in the fourth quarter due to the hurricane impacts and the onboarding of Signet, and we can get into that in Q&A. We are seeing some decent operating leverage of roughly 40 bps on operating expenses that excludes losses.","And then the big question, credit losses, credit normalization. Are we there yet? Is it almost done? Bankcard players seemed to be saying that it doesn't look like they're going to normalize to the latter part of next year. And where we're sitting right now is a little bit actually ahead of where we thought we'd be. Delinquencies are right on track with where we want them to be. They're the best predictor of future gross losses. Q1, we're about 50 basis points over last year. We are on track in Q4 to be flat versus last year. There was a little bit of noise last month due to the hurricane, but we had sort of our final bubble of accounts flow through. And so we expect Q4 to be flat, and that's what we've been shooting for all year.","And so from a gross loss rate perspective, Q1 and Q2, we were up 75 basis points versus last year, as I mentioned, we thought we'd be up about 30 or so this quarter and then finally get to flat in the fourth quarter. In fact, we \u2013 gross losses were actually slightly better than they were a year ago in Q3. If you factor out a slight benefit from the hurricane, we were still flat to where they were last year, which, again, is running about a quarter in front of what we had anticipated, which is great news.","So I would say that the outlook on the credit front, I would say, is looking a little bit better than we had anticipated, which again reaffirms the impact of the slingshot for next year. Then we get to net loss rates, again, for those of you who don't live in this area, you have gross and then you have recoveries against that that will give you net. We talked about recoveries moving from higher than a year ago to flat. And now we need our recoveries to move from sort of lower than they were a year ago to actually flat. And so that's going to happen as we move recoveries in-house and should provide us a pretty easy comps for next year on that.","So what's interesting on the net loss rates is when we started the year, we guided to approximately a 50 basis point increase in net loss rates. And if you look at the components, we assumed it was 50 basis points on gross losses and recoveries would be relatively stable as they have been for years. It turns out the gross loss rates are only going to be up about 30 basis points. So we're doing better from that perspective, but it's certainly overwhelmed by the fact that the recovery market fell apart at the beginning of the year and so most of the increase in our net loss is due to the recoveries falling off.","So it's a mouthful, but what we focus on is what that say about going into next year. And right now, we look pretty encouraged. So loss rates 6.3% in Q1, 6.2% in Q2, 5.5% in Q3. It will be below 6% in Q4. It will flow something like 6%, 6.5% for October, November, December, something like that. Full year guidance, we actually expect mid-teens revenue growth in cards, and we expect 12% growth in adjusted EBITDA, which again is net of all the funding cost in cards as well as the provision for credit losses so double-double for cards despite going through this normalization process.","All right, let's go to 2018 guidance. We said we're holding on 2017 at $7.8 billion and core EPS of $18.10. For 2018, we're also holding at our $8.7 billion, up 12%, and $21.50, up 19%, a significant jump from where we are this year. And is it reasonable? First thing we look at is what our10-year average has been, and we've been running about 13 tops, 17 bottom. So it seems like after a softer year like this year that coming back stronger next year will kind of makes sense with the overall model. So that's what we're shooting for.","If you go to Slide 14, let's give you sort of a little bit more detail on the businesses. Epsilon, we expect mid-single-digit revenue. In EBITDA growth, we expect a big Technology Platform business, which builds the big CRM databases and the loyalty programs to return to modest growth, which is from our perspective very good news. And the Conversant CRM and auto verticals remain our fastest-growing offering. So mid-single, mid-single seems to be in order for Epsilon.","LoyaltyOne, this is the year to fully retool the program. We think it has been retooled. We want to see 3% to 5% growth in both top line and EBITDA. We want this business to return to modest, consistent growth and we believe that's certainly doable. There's a lot more wood to chop here in terms of what this business can do in Canada. And at a minimum, we would expected it to grow at the nominal GDP growth rate of Canada, which is a little over 3%, get a little leverage and perhaps we can get to 5%.","On BrandLoyalty, as we\u2019ve talked about, we expect Q4 to be the start of a nice run after multiple years of double-digit top and bottom, this year. Obviously, soft, we expect that to come back in Q4 we have pretty good visibility on Q4 and give us a nice jump-off for Q1 of next year. The comfort level that we're going to have for 2018 is really around the fact that in years where there's some big global event such as the World Cup, we tend to have more activity and more participation. And so next year, we have one of those events. We also have that big deal signed with Disney, and we'll be using that from a reward perspective across Europe.","So I think it looks like the pipeline is shaping up pretty nicely. Cards, where is cards going to be? Cards is going to be mid-teens portfolio growth, supported by this year's $2 billion vintage that we signed. We expect a nice solid return to mid-teens growth in both revenue and adjusted EBITDA. Again, it's a funny term, but adjusted EBITDA is net of all the funding cost and the credit cost. So and we expect net loss rates to be flat to down, meaning flat to improved versus 2017, meaning that the full normalization has now taken place and it should be very stable from now on.","Okay. I want to finish with 2018 guidance. I specifically want to address where probably the vast bulk of questions have been coming in over the last year and a half or so, which is loss rates and what does it mean, and how do you know it's going to be better and all that other stuff. So we've tried to choose \u2013 I tried to sort of put it in a one page or so to speak. And what you see with Private Label and having lived through the Great Recession and a couple before that, what you'll find with Private Label is their \u2013 the loss rates in Private Label tend to peak in front of the peak of loss rates for bank cards.","Said differently, we started talking about our normalization sometime back in late 2015, and we said that 2016 and 2017 was going to be the two years that it would take to bring losses back up to sort of pre-great recession levels after being abnormally low.","You started to hear from the big banks and bank card players about a year after that. And so the way it tends to work is our normalization runs about a year in front of the bank cards. And that's playing out exactly the way we've laid it out here, which is we're going to be done with ours in the Q4, whereas, I think the big bank card players are probably indicating its going to take them to late 2018 to normalize.","So we started earlier, we'll finish earlier and that seems to be the trend that it's following here. As a result, the huge reserve builds that we put through in the last couple of years are behind us. And now, you're looking at more of it builds with the growth in the file itself. The second reason why we feel we're in good shape in 2018 is the delinquency wedge, which again our accounts that are flowing through being late on payments for 180 days before they're written off. That gives us a good view into what's coming over the following six months. The so-called wedge, where delinquencies were up year-over-year is closing in Q4, and we expect it to be flat to prior year in Q4 itself, which means going into 2018, that\u2019s a good signal that losses will be flat as well.","Next, to sort of pile on here with Signet, which is coming on latter part of this month, talking about $1 billion plus portfolio, where if you recall, we only purchased the prime-only accounts. And so that carries with it slightly lower overall loss profile, which, again, can help dampen your losses on a go-forward basis. And then finally on the recovery rates, we were running this year at about 18% of gross losses.","And normally, we recover somewhere in the 20s, and that had a lot to do with the third-party collectors out there and some new regulations and a lot of paper on the market. We made the decision to move the business over time back in-house, which is what we've done before. We did it post-Great Recession. And it's really just math of how much we can get on the outside versus how much it cost to step up and do it inside.","We know we can do better than 18%, somewhere in the low-20s is where we'd like to be. So 2017 was unusually low. So moving in-house will gradually increase the recovery rates, basically saying, you get some decent comps as we move into next year. So everything is pointing to the fact that loss rates should be stable, to improved next year. It's been a very tough couple of years for all involved, including those listening on the phone.","And to give you a sense of what normalization cost, it's fairly punitive. The higher loss rates and reserve builds were the double-digit drag on core EPS, really, in both 2016 and 2017. And to put it in perspective, in 2017, with loss rates up 80 basis points, 30 gross and 50 on recoveries, we have core EPS of $18.10, up 7%. Had loss rates just stayed flat, and we set the reserves and provisions just based on portfolio growth.","Our core EPS would have been up over $21, so up 20%. That gives you a sense of how important it is that we reach the end of this normalization process. That's about $260 million of EBITDA that was poured into this expense over and above flat loss rates. So if you looked over the past two years, 2016, 2017, this normalization process has cost about $400 million of EBITDA or pretax earnings due to both the higher losses as well as the higher reserves we had to set aside.","We think that with the flat gross losses and the flat delinquency wedge in Q4 and relatively easy comps and recoveries. We'll be flat to down next year on in terms of losses, and that should very simply math return us to the high teens on the core EPS. And so after two years, the big reserve builds are over. And we've got very good visibility \u2013 actually excellent visibility on where we're heading in 2018. So I think we've feed now on the depths. So why don't we go ahead and move to Q&A?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Dan Perlin of RBC Capital Markets.","Dan Perlin","Thanks, good morning, guys. So I had a question around card, in particular, around the operating expense. So \u2013 and it relates to where you are in the build-out of your in-house recoveries. So was up, I guess, 16% or so year-on-year, but as a percentage of AR, it was only modestly up year-on-year. It was really was up sequentially, but modestly. So I'm trying to understand how we should be mapping that out over the next several quarters. And where are you in the process of actually bringing those people and to build up the in-house recovery?","Charles Horn","Yes, so there's two things I'd point you, Dan. First is the gross yield decline year-over-year makes the percent growth look a bit higher, the 16% you referred to. If you had basically the same gross yields year-over-year, you'd see it flat-flat. As a percentage of AR, it moved a nominal amount. We said, going back to the last quarter, we expected our operating expenses to be better this year, 40 to 50 basis points. I think that's still on track. We would tell you we're still in the process of adding collectors.","And we'll staff them up over the remaining of Q4. I would still expect the OpEx leveraging in Q4 to be better year-over-year. That said, we're still very much on trend to that guidance we gave last quarter of about 40 to 50 basis points improvement on an annual basis.","Dan Perlin","Okay. But just to be clear, the absolute dollar of OpEx expense was up 16%. And you're saying you're expecting that to stay at these levels or playing out throughout the \u2013 I would imagine that's where you're capturing the incremental cost of this recovery business, correct?","Charles Horn","That'd be correct as well. But let's say we hadn't had the influence of the hurricanes affecting our gross yields, the revenue growth would have been up 15% to 16%. So you have to basically influence the fact that you take a whack on your gross yields is not influencing your OpEx.","Dan Perlin","Okay. The other question I had is, can you just help me understand why the 15 basis point improvement in gross losses as a result of the hurricanes? I mean, I think I caught it, but I'm sure someone will ask, and I just want to make sure I'm clear on that.","Charles Horn","It just means for affected person within that FEMA designated zone, that account is frozen from migration to the delinquency trends to loss if they're in that affected area. So if they were in to 150 days past due and they were affected, it would just mean that's going to freeze and that would not have rolled into the charge off after 180 days.","Dan Perlin","Okay.","Ed Heffernan","Yes. So essentially, you get hit pretty hard \u2013 or actually harder on your lack of earnings in terms of the revenue, but you are getting a slight benefit in terms of \u2013 for a couple of months of putting those accounts \u2013 or suspending those accounts from rolling to losses. The net result is going to be about a $0.25 hit Q3, Q4 combined.","Dan Perlin","Yes. Okay. And then if I could sneak in one just quickly on Epsilon. You mentioned a pullback in digital growth. I'm wondering what do you think is driving that for you guys. And then secondly, you said onboarding new clients, I think, is going to help drive a big part of reacceleration there. And I'm just wondering what's happening, really, in the underlying core business. And then why is this \u2013 why are we seeing this shift? Thanks.","Charles Horn","I'd say, Dan, we think the core is still very strong. Occasionally, you get some timing differentials when new programs are coming onboard. I think that's the biggest thing we're looking at. We'd expect it to bounce back in Q4. We just had a little bit of a timing with fewer new programs launched in Q3 than what we've been doing before. But like I said, I think that will bounce back in Q4.","Dan Perlin","Okay. And then the onboarding as sort of rate of change of new clients versus core, it's just proportionate to the new clients signed, I guess, is what you're saying in terms of how we're mapping up growth.","Charles Horn","We would tell you the backlog is still strong. Occasionally, it just shifts as to which quarters till when the program is going to onboard. And I would say, we said a little bit lower in Q3.","Dan Perlin","Okay. Thank you, guys.","Charles Horn","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani of KBW.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Thanks, good morning. Charles and Ed, I guess, you guys mentioned the couple of different numbers on the impacts from the hurricanes. But I wanted to make sure I got the total because when I look at Slide 3, it talks about a three percentage point headwind related to the hurricanes. Is that the consolidated number, which would be, like, closer to $60 million on revenues?","Charles Horn","That is the consolidated number. And again, it's rounded to three. It was about $40 million impact to card and a $40 million to total. It's about 2.6% so around\u2026","Sanjay Sakhrani","Okay, I got it. All right, and I guess, my second question is a little bit higher level on Epsilon. It seems like \u2013 and it may be related to the question before, but just seems like that, that business unit is supposed to produce higher \u2013 high single-digit revenues. And that's what Ed sort of talked about in terms of multi-year view. I guess, when we look at all the variability in that business, I mean, is that still the case? Do you still think, Ed, that's it's a high single-digit top line grower? Or is there to be going some variability over the course of the next couple of years?","Ed Heffernan","Yes, it's a fair question. I mean, I think the one thing we've learned over the last couple of years is this variability is certainly by quarter. The big 25% of Epsilon, that's a tech platform was really our big concern because that was, as we said, melting pretty quickly last year. That's fully turned and we expect that to contribute positively next year. And so I really do think the long-term growth rate, Sanjay, of Epsilon has to be up around that 7%. And it's a question of how do we get from the sort of 5%.","We're running this year, year-to-date, up to the 7%. And hopefully, with the technology piece turning, that should give us a decent shot next year to get pretty close. But my goal, quite frankly, is that, that's going to be not really a mid-single-digit. That needs to be a high single-digit top line growth business.","Sanjay Sakhrani","I got just one more on credit quality because I figured I should ask this, and I appreciate all the color that you guys provided related to it. But I guess, with credit now sort of outperforming even relative to your expectation, the concern in the market has been there might be some contagion with the consumer, like there's something wrong with the consumers' health. It seems like given that credit is doing relative better than your expected range and this is a range that you provided a couple of years ago, the state of the consumer is relatively stable. That \u2013 would you concur with that view? Or do you feel like the health of the consumer is a little bit weaker than when you first gave that guidance?","Ed Heffernan","No, no. I \u2013 there's no question in our minds. And we do, if not twice a week, at least, weekly calls with the folks on the front line doing the actual collections. And these are thousands of people and we ask, what are the trends? What are you hearing? Are you hearing any sort of hesitancy? Are you hearing some of the noise that's coming out? And it's been rock solid with \u2013 there's no issues out there. If anything, I'd say, things are actually a little bit better. And obviously, we're seeing it in our own loss rates. But no, we're not hearing anything. And it sort of goes back \u2013 it's playing out pretty much the way we said, as you mentioned, a couple of years ago that we're just normalizing back to where we were before the Great Recession and then it stops. And it's stable thereafter.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Right, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller of Barclays.","Darrin Peller","Thanks guys. Just a first question on the growth of receivables guidance. I know you're mid-teens for next year, including Signet. I guess, that's a more of a high single-digit organic growth rate. It seems like your \u2013 is it strategically you're managing to a mid-teens all in growth just to really balance the business now? It's a bigger picture question, Ed, around the mix of business between the card business versus the others. Or is it more that the organic growth of the purchase volume has become more of a mid- to high-single-digit grower, and so that's just the new world we live in now?","Ed Heffernan","If I can say yes and yes, I think that would probably cover it. But I think it's sort of a combo platter. They earn off exactly what you just said, which is, we think, 15% growth for us is roughly a nice comfortable growth rate given the amount of business that's flowing in to the top of the funnel and to your point, factoring in, which we didn't have several years ago, some attrition on the bottom of the funnel as some of our longstanding clients are having difficulty making the transition into the new, whatever the new is.","And so we're not getting quite the growth we got from the core of five years ago. But what we're getting is we're getting more coming in, in terms of people shifting the marketing dollars to the data-driven business, which is Private Label. So it kind of watches against each other. And I would say, 15% is a good number. Could it flex up to a couple of points higher than that if core retail comes back? For sure. But I think 15% is a safe bet and that's sort of our strategic plan for the next three to five years.","Darrin Peller","Okay. And so just to remind us, the e-com \u2013 or the digital element of your business, I know you've talked about it before, I mean, that's obviously one of the bigger drivers. What is the metrics you've provided around that, again, if you don't mind repeating?","Charles Horn","Well, what we said on the last call, Darrin, is that the credit sales through online are basically outside of bricks-and-mortar over a third of our credit sales. That number can jump up to north of 40% in the fourth quarter as you get the holiday spend. That's really the metric we've been focusing on. It's the traditional bricks-and-mortar or about 85% in store, 15% online. And we have over a third of our credit sales online. So that's really the ability for us to capture the data, identify you, track you online and give you a relevant target it off and it gives us the ability to do that.","Ed Heffernan","Yes. And I would say that we're also beginning to see, Darrin, the core retailers. We're working pretty hard with them to increase the ease of their \u2013 of the online experience as well as bringing on the wafers of the world, the overstocks of the world, sort of the pure e-commerce players. And you'll continue to see that shift. My guess is \u2013 from an online credit sales perspective, my guess is we'll be at 50% in a couple of years.","Darrin Peller","Okay. That's helpful, guys. So just a quick follow-up, Charles. The delinquency trends you guys are guiding towards for the fourth quarter and into 2018, what is the impact of Signet on that in terms of \u2013 in other words, organically, without that would \u2013 I mean, I think delinquencies are still improving year-over-year and the wedge is getting close, but what are \u2013 where would we have been, I guess, organically?","Charles Horn","We'd put it this way, Darrin, is the improvement is not definitive on us onboarding Signet. I mean, we're looking basically \u2013 yes. If we're looking to Q4, we would tell you putting Signet on the side line, we feel good gross losses will be down year-over-year in Q4. And that's going to be driven by the natural improvement you're seeing on delinquencies in that wedge.","Darrin Peller","Okay, all right. That\u2019s great to hear guys. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ramsey El-Assal of Jefferies.","Ramsey El-Assal","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Can you take a step back on the hurricane and just help us think through what percentage of your business is generated in those impacted geographies?","Charles Horn","We estimate that it's up to 15% of our accounts were within the Florida affected area and the Houston and Texas affected area. That doesn't mean that all of them would have gone into this program, but it's up to 15% of our accounts were affected.","Ramsey El-Assal","Okay. So yes, essentially what you have is you put them into various buckets. And FEMA provides us with the areas that are hit the hardest. And that's probably about a two month tight hit, so you get the tail end at Q3. You get the beginning of Q4. But by November, December, we expect things to look pretty normal across the board. And we've got check this thing with what happened during Katrina, obviously, very different, but that's sort of \u2013 it's the same blueprint.","Ramsey El-Assal","And basically, there's no kind of intelligence behind in the sense they just give zip codes, and any account associated with that zip code gets the special treatment.","Ed Heffernan","No.","Ramsey El-Assal","Okay. I wanted to ask about the Equifax situation and whether that has \u2013 you anticipate any impact from that. It feels like not as many people are freezing their credits as maybe was anticipated initially, whether that would impact you at all regardless because you have a different underwriting procedure. Just wanted to get your comments on that.","Ed Heffernan","Yes, it's a great question. And I think it's top of everyone's mind. For sure, you heard an awful lot of stuff, bad stuff that came out of it and one of the things had to do with how can we protect the consumer or the consumer can freeze their accounts, et cetera, et cetera, that's going to lead to a lot lower level of account openings, both online and within the bricks-and-mortar stores for us. And we watch it pretty closely, and to your point, what started off as a potentially significant item and dwindled pretty quickly. We estimate that it's probably, at most, it will affect new account openings by about 1%. I mean it\u2019s we\u2019re just not seeing it happen. And even in some cases where they may freeze at Equifax, they're not freezing at the other bureaus, which we also use. So it remains to be seen a year or two from now, whether everyone gets on the bandwagon. But right now, it's really a nonevent from that perspective.","Ramsey El-Assal","Are there any dependencies on Equifax in terms of data you require for underwriting that have \u2013 you've had to find another solution? Or is it really just kind of business as usual?","Ed Heffernan","For us, it's pretty much business as usual. We'll go to other folks as we need them. But in terms of data availability that we need, I mean, that \u2013 it's there, it's available, and it's business as usual. It doesn't change the fact that a lot of sensitive information has gotten out there. But from our business perspective, it really hasn't changed procedures.","Ramsey El-Assal","Great, thanks so much for taking my questions.","Ed Heffernan","Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Jeffrey of SunTrust.","Andrew Jeffrey","Hi, good morning guys, thanks for taking the question. I guess a couple questions about loyalty. First would be in BrandLoyalty. Just trying to understand, sort of similar to Epsilon, how do you think about sort of your installed base of customers in terms of their growth. You mentioned some new signings and initiatives next year that will probably drive growth. But can you talk a little bit about same-store sales in BrandLoyalty, if that's the right way to think about the business and what those trends look like?","Ed Heffernan","Yeah, it\u2019s a good question. The way, it's a little different from same-store, but kind of the similar concept, which is the number of programs that a specific chain will launch in any given year. See you may have a large grocer in Germany that if we can get them to do two programs a year, that would be great, right? We're running 220, 230 programs a year, so it is a bunch. And so we make our money, essentially, when whoever it may be decides to run one of these three month promo, heavy-promo programs. So it could be either an existing grocer pulls up to do three programs in a year or we get a new grocer who only wants to do one program a year.","So it's really hard to do a same-store sales. But in general, we know sort of the total number of programs we need to launch in a given year to drive what has historically been a double-digit top and bottom growth engine for us. What we're seeing, as we move into World Cup and everything next year, is the European side of the business, which is the bulk of it tends to crank it up quite a bit for these things, less so in North America. And that is, in fact, what we're hearing from some of our big clients over Germany, in France, in Italy, et cetera. We also \u2013 with the launch, we're always looking for new product for these promotions. And having the exclusivity with the Disney brands over there, I think, will provide an additional incentive for the grocers to roll it up.","So there's really two drivers that we think will help the return to double-digit growth next year. And then the big wild card, Andrew, we're not baking it in, but if we can get someone big in the U.S. onboard, that's your upside. And so we've got a couple small programs that have launched in the U.S. Can we get one of the big guys to sign up, to try guys to sign up, to try to differentiate themselves a little bit, especially given all the turmoil in the grocer market here in the States? Don't know yet.","Andrew Jeffrey","Got you. That's helpful. And then just as a follow-up on AIR MILES. There's been clearly some disruption in the U.S. grocery market. I know you talked about promotions in Canada and the desire \u2013 the intent to grow with GDP. Can you just comment on sort of the health and vibrancy of the grocery channel generally and whether or not that's something that you think is affecting AIR MILES?","Ed Heffernan","Sure, yeah I think the reason for the drop-off in promo activity is, to your point, it's all grocer. And so we need to make sure that the other verticals are running and gunning, so that we can get this whole machine back up and going again. I mean, we're getting there. And it's frustrating in the sense of it hasn't fully turned yet. But the collector activation rates are pretty much back where they were. We haven't lost any sponsors. We're seeing weakness, to your point, on the promotional side from the grocers. But with the new deal with Bank of Montreal, which is a very large, while it is the largest sponsor, we expect to really reenergize that card program there.","So hopefully, the game plan is we're going to get more out of the financial services vertical than we had in the past and that should help hedge against continued softness on the promo side.","Andrew Jeffrey","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tim Willi of Wells Fargo.","Tim Willi","Thank you and good morning. I have two questions around Private Label that, I guess, might be a little bit more intermediate term in nature. But just given the discussion around the operating leverage and the improvements that you've quantified, Charles, is there like sort of a permanent sort of target we should think about on the operating expenses relative to receivables on an ongoing basis once you sort of gets that peak, I guess, leverage point, that this is sort of where the ratio goes to and probably stays there if we keep it at a sort of a mid-teens portfolio growth? Anything we should think about?","Charles Horn","Yeah. I\u2019d hate to say anything is permanent, but I'd tell you what we would target is about 20 basis points improvement per year, and that's expressed as a percentage of average AR. Obviously, growth imbalances influences it. There are certain programs that influence it. But I think that's a very reasonable target. It's about 20 basis points per year.","Tim Willi","My other question was about the digital side and referencing about 1\/3 of credit sales and maybe, over time, that goes to half. Are you seeing anything around delinquencies or customer service related to the consumers that are heavy digital? Just sort of curious about shift over time impacts. Anything positive or negative for the operation on serving those retailers and their customers?","Charles Horn","Tim, we'd tell you not really anything that we've seen different between the interactions online versus bricks-and-mortar. We know with online, we need to drive different service products. That's just the ability to minimize shopping cart abandonment, the ability to capture. You make it very simple if you make a transaction. But in terms of loss performance, delinquency performance, so forth, there's really no differences.","Ed Heffernan","Yeah, I think, the thing to remember, this is sort to use the buzzword, the omni-channel approach of whether it's bricks or clicks. What you're basically looking at is the same customer. And five, six years ago, you would say that she would shop 8 to 10 trips a year. And those would be to the mall. Now she's shopping like a dozen times a year, some more trips, but only two to the mall and the other 10 are \"trips online.\" So it's the same customer. It's just that they're shopping differently.","Tim Willi","Great, that\u2019s all I had. Thanks very much.","Ed Heffernan","And we do one more.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bob Napoli of William Blair.","Bob Napoli","Good morning, thank you for squeezing me in. One question on credit first and then an Epsilon question. Just the improvement in credit in the month of September, Charles, is that a move to the heavy increase in held-for-sale? I mean, there was a pretty significant increase in held-for-sale in the quarter. And when do you expect to sell those receivables? Are they essentially marked to where you expect to sell them at this point?","Charles Horn","So think about it this way. It didn't influence our loss rates, really, at all for the quarter. The shift you saw that is put in held-for-sale is a vertical that's really just not a core vertical for us. It's pretty small. We're going to look to divest it. It is at the carrying value, which would be par amount than the anticipated losses, so there is no assumed gain or anything associated with it. It's something we'd probably look to try to get off our books toward the end of this year, early next year. But really, it goes back to something that Ed said before, is with the growth we're generating and now assume that coming onboard, we can look at different verticals and this is one we tested for several years, really, not a great vertical for us. It's really time for us to basically do a little bit of cathartic process to the file and get rid of the things that we don't want to focus on. And so that shift to held-for-sale, that's exactly that small vertical that we're just decided not to pursue.","Bob Napoli","And the improvement in September then was driven by \u2013 it was a monthly data.","Charles Horn","It is performance of the overall portfolio, plus we did have some sales in the market, which we already had contracts in place. So just like we saw in June, we saw a little bit of improvement in recovery rate. We saw the same thing in September. So it's a combination of natural trends, a little bit of sale of previously charged-off paper that really drove the improvement.","Ed Heffernan","Yes, gross losses themselves are actually running flat or better than last year, which, is about a quarter ahead of when we thought that would happen. And then you throw in some of the third-party sales on the paper that we had hanging out there from the beginning of the year. That's what drove it.","Bob Napoli","Okay and Signet, you said you think it's going to be a little over $1 billion now coming onboard.?","Ed Heffernan","Yes.","Bob Napoli","Okay. And then just as it relates to Epsilon because that's \u2013 and I know you talked a bit about that. But the slowdown was obviously disappointing to you and below to us. But the CRM business and the auto \u2013 I mean, that business has been 30% grower. And it seems like having spent time with the management team there that seemed very optimistic about high levels of growth for that business. Is the visibility not as high? Is it not as predictable? And how lumpy \u2013 and are the opportunities in that very high-margin business, do you expect to see that? I mean, sounds like you're talking down the expected growth of that piece of the business.","Ed Heffernan","We break it down it two ways. We'd say auto is still doing fine. That's really not showing the revenue growth. We did see the CRM drop. The digital overall drop a little bit in Q3. We think it's still going to be a grower long term. That's going to be 25%, 35% grower. We think it's really unique business. What you're always going to have are little bumps on the road where you're just not onboarding the same number of new clients during the given quarter or where an existing client pulls back a little bit during the quarter. And we saw that with a couple of clients.","So we think it's, again, transitory. We think it's got a good top line. We think it's still a very unique business. It's going to grow into the future. So we don't think it's one where we're going to dial back the overall growth rate for Epsilon. We think it's going to be one of the drivers of Epsilon's growth rate in the future.","Bob Napoli","And just as it relates to Epsilon, obviously, I mean, how much of the Epsilon is tied to the secular growth \u2013 the positive secular growth trends within the marketing versus the agency? And as they see, the traditional agencies, obviously, are very much struggling when \u2013 and I kind of view Epsilon as being \u2013 having tailwinds from secular trends but what portions do and don\u2019t. How do you do that.","Ed Heffernan","25% agency like and 75% is getting the tailwinds.","Bob Napoli","All right. Thank you. Appreciated.","Ed Heffernan","All right. Thank you, everyone. We'll talk to you next quarter. Bye-bye.","Operator","Thank you ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today\u2019s conference call you may now disconnect and have a wonderful day."],"1364":["Alliance Data Systems Corporation (NYSE:ADS)","Q2 2016 Earnings Conference Call","July 21, 2016 08:30 AM ET","Executives","Edward Heffernan - CEO","Charles Horn - CFO","Melisa Miller - President","Analysts","David Togut - Evercore ISI","Sanjay Sakhrani - KBW","Darrin Peller - Barclays","Ramsey El-Assal - Jefferies","Bob Napoli - William Blair","Tim Willi - Wells Fargo","Presentation","[Call Starts Abruptly] \u2026double digit growth in revenue and adjusted EBITDA for both LoyaltyOne and Card Services and returned to positive revenue growth at Epsilon and stable FX rates. Another positive during the quarter was the opportunity to acquire earlier than scheduled the remaining 20% ownership in BrandLoyalty. It made sense to us as the company\u2019s performance has exceeded all of our expectations and the opportunity in North America looks very compelling. Accordingly, we acquired the remaining interest effective April 1, 2016 for approximately $259 million in consideration which was funded by up-stocking BrandLoyalty\u2019s credit facility.","Now the accounting is a little unique because the remaining ownership was purchased prior to the 10% tranches scheduled for January \u201917 and January \u201918 the consideration paid exceeded the churning value of the redeemable, non-controlling interest on the balance sheet which would have increased over the next year and half to roughly equal the purchase price paid. The difference of $68 million is an immediate charge to retain earnings on the balance sheet, but nonetheless is considered in the calculation of EPS, which was reduced by $1.14. Excluding this charge, EPS increased 13% for the second quarter.","What does the early acquisition means to ADS? From the revenue standpoint, nothing, as we already consolidated 100% of BrandLoyalty\u2019s revenue. From a profitability standpoint, it will add a few cents to our EPS and our core EPS for 2016. Turning to the repurchase program, we\u2019ve acquired approximately 2.6 million shares under a repurchase program year to date. We\u2019ve approximately 460 million of our board authorization left which we expect to use somewhat ratably over the remainder of 2016.","Let's go to Page 3, and talk about LolaltyOne. LolaltyOne had a very strong second quarter as revenue increased 17% to $352 million and adjusted EBITDA increased 20% to $79 million. Negative FX translation rates knocked about 2 points of growth off for the second quarter but on positive note we do not expect any FX drag in the second half of 2016 if current spot rates hold. AIR MILES revenue increased 6% on a constant currency basis driven by an 8% increase in miles redeemed. AIR MILES\u2019 issued declined 3% versus the same quarter last year which was expected.","As you may recall, we converted Sobeys' legacy reward programs into the AIR MILES reward program in the second quarter of 2015 that makes for a difficult year-over-year comparable. In addition we had less promotional activity in the grocery vertical this year. AIR MILES\u2019 redeemed increased 8% compared to the second quarter of 2015 primarily driven by AM cash or instant reward option. In particular we are seeing growth in in-store redemptions which are popular at our AIR MILES partners.","Moving to BrandLoyalty, revenue increased 44% on a constant currency basis, driven by an increase in the number of short term loyalty programs executed during the quarter. Continued expansion into new markets such as South Africa, New Zealand contributed to growth. The pilot recently executed with the top three gross in the U.S. finished with very strong results as pilot store showed revenue growth approximately 1.5% higher than non-pilot stores.","This was accomplished largely through an increased basket sizes. Plans are kindly underway with this grocer to extend the programs to the full store network at a later date. Additional pilot programs in the U.S. and Canada are also planned for the back half for this year. Overall a terrific quarter.","Now let's flip over to the next slide and talk about Epsilon. Epsilon's revenue increased 5% to 519 million for the second quarter, a solid turn from the revenue decline of 2% in the first quarter of 2016. Adjusted EBITDA decreased 9% to 103 million primarily due to duplicative cost in our India operation and severance cost. We expect these costs to abate during the third quarter allowing the full flow through of revenue to EBITDA.","Our digital and technology platforms business is hot, posting a robust 14% growth versus the prior year. This performance was reported by solid continuous from all offering in this category with our automotive platform and Conversant CRM business leading the way. In addition solid traction in the affiliate business and strong new business within our Harmony platform added to momentum. In particular Conversant CRM business with industry leading cross device recognition and reach had a terrific quarter with revenue up to 66% and a building backlog to show exceed the book of business we won in 2015 with over 20 new clients signed and launched from first half including Zales, Beachbody, Justice and White House Black Market.","Our agency media and services business continues to struggle as revenue declined 15% versus the prior year, this often has been weak for several quarters due to a combination of decreased spending by a large customer in our traditional agency and lower volume of digital media buys from large, third-party agencies. In response, three initiatives were started during the second quarter. The first was to adjust the cost structure and commensurate it with lower revenue expectations. That is largely complete. The second, which is a longer-term initiative, is to redirect digital agency toward mid-sized agencies and maybe direct clients. Third, we have begun pivoting this offering towards data-driven marketing and insights, thus creating a CRM Light solution for clients who aren\u2019t ready yet for full CRM. Early results are encouraging, as we have begun to gain traction in new verticals such as media and entertainment. Overall we see two key market trends that align well with Epsilon's cost strategy.","Demand from CMOs for measureable results and the ongoing shift from traditional marketing channels to digital and data driven channels. With the highly differentiated digital and offline data assets, a reach portfolio of services and its deep marketing advertising technology stack, the businesses is poised to resume healthy steady growth. Top 50 clients are growing at a high single digit rate and the business has robust topline, paired with prudent cost management initiatives kindly underway, we expect to see the return to profitable growth in the back half of 2016 and exit the year with the healthier cost structure going into 2017.","I\u2019ll now turn over Melisa to talk about card services.","Melisa Miller","Thank you Charles. Good morning everyone. Turning now to Page 5, I am so pleased to highlight that the card services business had another quarter of strong performance, delivering the 18th consecutive quarter of double digit revenue growth. Revenues are up 25% over last year, translating to a 10% increase in adjusted EBITDA net of funding cost.","Let's turn now to Page 6 and go over some of the key drivers of the strong performance first. Credit sales were up 18% resulting in year-over-year tender share gains of 180 basis points were measurable.","Now each quarter you hear us comment on tender share and we do so because it really is a fundamental metric to the success of our program and what may be helpful contacts here is these tender share gain we reference come from our legacy programs and do not include any gains from our newer card program. Put differently the tender share gains we reference are a result of increasing the number of trip spend and card member retention from those card programs with us prior to 2013.","Importantly the average tenure of our 12 month active shopper is 5 years and the sales distribution of our most tenured card members has been remarkably stable for four years, and I mentioned this because these are highly seasoned relationships and as such we have great visibility into their past behavior and that allows us to accurately predict how our card members will behave in the future.","These gains are not a result of any widening, loosening of lessening of our credit standards and this consistent increase in tender share is really a result of that data driven targeted marketing no more sell more brand promise and the increases here are certainly a signal of card members\u2019 growing engagement with our brand partners. Second, as expected gross yields are normalizing and the year-over-year compression is lessening and with very good visibility into the remainder of the year we expect to achieve our annual guidance for gross yields of 25.1% as well.","Third, operating expenses grew 24% this quarter while improving 40 basis points to 9.5% of our average card receivables. And even with this improvement we continue to make investments in preparation for the on boarding of several new partners from diverse retail verticals. For example, we deliberately entered the high growth segment of fast fashion with our recently announced Forever 21 partnership. We look forward to announcing additional significant partnerships in the coming quarters, and this year as in years past, the new partnerships we will sign represent more than $2 billion in steady state accounts receivable.","Our pipeline remains robust as we continue to identify strong potential partners that are passionate about driving consumer engagement in line with our evolving needs and view the card program as the ultimate loyalty tool. And fourth, our loss rate for the quarter came in at 5.1% in line with prior guidance and we remain confident in achieving our guidance of 5% loss rate for the full year. We continue to see success in these proven ability to drive stronger engagement and royalty through our tailored marketing solutions driven largely by deep data analytics, insights and innovative capabilities.","Now speaking of engagement, let's spend just a moment to cover off on some of the brands we most recently on-boarded. We\u2019re super enthusiastic about the progress of our newer partners, they\u2019re posting very strong results year-over-year and I wanted to take just a moment to share two very specific examples. One partner experienced greater than a 70% increase in application volume and a credit sales jump of 37%. This driving tender share gains of more than 800 basis points with just a few months post conversion. And another important partner saw tender share gains of 400 basis points, and credit sales increases of 45% post conversion.","These gains are really due to our improved tools and stronger multi-channel engagement and are again testament to the increased spend we generate for our brand partners. Now we also know that despite these strong programs results concern still exist in the market around the strength and health of the U.S. consumer. Candidly, we are seeing very few signs of concern. Our view is that consumer confidence is stable, delinquency trends are within expected parameters, card retention is very strong, and we continue to find success in engaging brands and their customers. We are welcoming new card members to our programs while the existing card members continue to spend across channels.","And if I can comment just a moment about the consumer spend, to be clear, they are spending and they are spending differently. For instance in some categories we see our digital credit sales, so those sales outside of the brick and mortar environment growing significantly year-over-year, Specialty retail currently sees digital credit sales over 40% which is certainly higher than digital sales for the brand and has been steadily climbing. Similarly, 67% of home d\u00e9cor credit sales now come through digital channels nearly a 10% jump in just two years.","Multi-channel shoppers, for those actively purchasing both in store and digitally are our fastest growing segment and they are also the most valuable to our partners. These multi-channel shoppers spend twice as much as digital as single channel shoppers, and looking more broadly nearly 4 out of 10 applications are now completed outside of the store with mobile applications in particular, the fastest growing channel. This continuing shift to mobile is reflective of consumer behavior as it is the channel where she increasingly chooses to engage with the favorite brand.","As earlier adaptors in the mobile space we have been innovating on this trend for many years and believe it will continue to accelerate. As such our investment strategy remains focused on delivering inventive capabilities that bring the most value to card members and to our brand partners facilitating deeper, loyalty and ultimately increase spend. For example, our MyLoyalty app solution continues to help brands carted to, engaged with card members as they apply, shop, earn and redeem all through a seamless intuitive and highly targeted customer experience. And newer capabilities such as the development of a proprietary mobile application experience that significantly reduces customer time and effort serves the changing consumer who is looking for every interaction to be effortless.","So in summary cards services has delivered another strong quarter, producing results in line with our high expectations. We are confident in our full year guidance around our loss rates. Our yields have stabilized ahead of our expectations and we remain confident in our consumer outlook and the overall quality and performance of our card members. Our investments and partnership align to the evolving need of both our brand customer and the retail landscape overall, thus demonstrating the value we bring to our partners through our broader retail heritage and our experience lends to the market.","Thanks so much. And Ed, I\u2019ll turn this over to you.","Edward Heffernan","Great thanks Melisa. Why don\u2019t we turn to the second quarter store card, we will try to wrap this up as neatly as we can. And we\u2019re going with the color coated circles on the left, we are looking for more green than other colors, that would be a good thing, and as we are midway through the year it looks like we are heading in the right direction, so to sort of sum it up, on a consolidated basis 1.75 billion and revs up 17%, 368 on EPS up 11%, I think for those of you who have been hearing Charles and I talked about how the year would play out. We talked about a Q1 sort of plus five top, plus five bottom, then Q2 moving to eight and eight and then eventually double digit in the back half. The fact that we are at 17 in Q2 and 11 on the bottom in Q2 as well, essentially means that we\u2019ve pulled -- we\u2019re running ahead by a quarter.","So essentially the back half has been accelerated and that\u2019s essentially what you are seeing in Q2. We had some signs that things were accelerating, but of course we wanted to be a little bit more careful until it actually played through. So I think the easiest way to look at the quarter is, it\u2019s not unexpected that we are running at double digit, what was on expected is that we are running a double digit this early in the years.","So, that certainly takes the risk out of the back half of the year. We\u2019re nicely ahead of guidance and in fact we feel comfortable raising guidance at this point for the year. As Charles mentioned the buyback, we\u2019re about halfway through and the year is about halfway through and we\u2019ll leave it at that.","Now let's turn to card services, Melisa talked extensively about performance once again. Very strong growth in the overall portfolio and we do talk on and on about tender share because that is so important to us, that sort of what makes or breaks our model versus other models out there and essentially that is the ability of triggering an additional purchase or visit with the purchase by the shopper over and above what she would traditionally do. And that\u2019s all done through our data driven marketing and targeting, and as Melisa talked about 85% of this tender share gain is from very mature accounts. Folks have been with us for years and years and years, it's not a function of just pumping more plastic out into the marketplace and that\u2019s something that\u2019s important. So, the model works.","Probably the biggest surprise for the quarter in terms of good news was the gross yield certainly came in well ahead of expectations, specifically if you recall Q1 is where we saw the compression in yields of 210 basis points. We suggested that we thought this would roll off as the year progressed as we anniversaried various programs. We actually saw a faster burn-in in Q2 and as a result we pick up a very-very nice chunk of revenues from the gross yield compression being less than expected. So put simply, we went from 200 basis points compression in Q1 all the way down to 80 basis points in Q2. And then we\u2019ll trickle ahead for the rest of the year a little bit better than that as the final programs burn through. So that was probably the first good news surprise for the quarter.","Losses, they\u2019re dead-on, there is not a lot to talk about there. We talked about 5% loss rate for the full year way back at the beginning of the year. We are dead-on with that number as we look at the back half, so no surprises there. There is no big cliff heading our way out there, it's pretty straight forward and this is just normal account seasoning. And as Melisa said there is no distress that we\u2019re seeing in the consumer, so very straight forward on the loss side.","And then obviously what Melisa and I spend a lot of time on is what does the future look like, and the future again looks very promising. We\u2019ve just announced thus far Boscov's Forever 21, Children\u2019s Place, Bed Bath & Beyond, Hot Topic. We probably have another half dozen that are signed, including a couple of biggies that we will be announcing in the back half of the year, so very, very robust signing season for card services.","So I think that\u2019s it for cards. We move now on to Epsilon, where we have moved from green, yellow and red to now green and yellow, which I think is a good thing. And I probably would say the second, if you recall it piece of good news or a surprise for the quarter was that we knew Epsilon was turning and again Epsilon includes both Epsilon core as well as the Conversant folks. And in Q1 obviously it was a disappointing quarter, revenues were down 2%, our goal was to swing that to positive a couple of points by Q2 and then hit mid-single digits as we move into the back half and accelerate from there.","Again the news here was that the revenue acceleration occurred faster than we had anticipated and we actually swung from minus two to plus five between Q1 and Q2. So seven points change in growth is quite a bit and needless to say we were pleased to see that. We expect that type of performance to continue, if not tick up as we go into the back half. And as Charles mentioned the good news now is once we have the topline turned, the cost structure should play out as soon as the quarter we are in now Q3.","So essentially as we\u2019ve talked to people, we had a -- we were in the process over the last year of a very significant ramp up as we built up our India operation and we had a lot of duplicative cost et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. Bottom line is the flow through will begin in Q3 and that should put us in very good shape for not only the back half but more importantly as we go into next year and the following year. So that would be what we call the Q3 flip for lack of a better term.","And then I would like to spend just a couple of seconds on a Conversant. So Conversant became part of alliance at the beginning of last year and obviously it was met with a fair amount of skepticism out there, some of it's made a lot of sense, some of it we disagreed with. But at the point if you looked at three pieces of Conversant sort of the traditional Conversant before we went into how we report it today, sort of mashed up with the core Epsilon. You\u2019d have three pieces, and the traditional Conversant had about a quarter of the business in agency and that is probably we are going to run down for the year probably 15% or something like that.","Then you have a quarter of the business that\u2019s what we call CJ affiliate and that\u2019s running nicely at mid-single digit up and has a very strong cash flow contributor. And then you have the biggest piece half of Conversant which is the data driven CRM piece and that is running between 40% and 50% for the year and that is -- that\u2019s really the huge piece and you obviously want your biggest piece to be your fastest grower. So if you put it all together what you essentially have is in Q2 if you looked at Conversant from a traditional perspective you would have seen double-digit top consolidated with of all three pieces and double-digit bottom. And I raise that because of the fact that that was our goal.","If you went back to the original pieces behind the acquisition we knew that the affiliate business is the good business and will chug along. We knew that the agency business would be pressured and we need to find a way to distinguish that from other businesses. But primarily the CRM business we were hoping for the huge cross sale through the rest of alliance, that has happened and as a result we are seeing 10% top and bottom that the original deal was based upon. So, as far as we\u2019re concerned we hit our goals from the original deal. You look at BrandLoyalty obviously came out of the gate double-digit across the board right from the beginning of the acquisition. So the two deals we\u2019ve done in the last three-four years have performed quite nicely. Some started a little bit faster than others, but right now both seem to be producing.","And as we move into the LoyaltyOne segment, and we talked about BrandLoyalty, we mentioned in Q1 that it is a lumpy business and we have good visibility on full year but quarter-by-quarter it's difficult. But needless to say Q2 was fairly impressive with revenue up over 40% and EBITDA over 100%. So that was obviously a very big quarter for BrandLoyalty. We think we probably don\u2019t want to keep that as a run rate going forward, although I\u2019d love to, but I think mid-teens top and bottom would be a good set of numbers for the year. Also as Charles mentioned the BrandLoyalty U.S. pilot has been completed, it's been very successful. We need to be a little careful about chatting about what\u2019s next. But we have very high hopes in terms of upcoming activity in the U.S.","Now let's turn to Canada and AIR MILES revenue was up 6% and I believe it was up 5% in Q1. EBITDA for Q2 was up 4% and EBITDA in Q1 was up 11%. So I think the bottom line of all of it is that there has been murmurs out there that the Canadian business is too mature and that it's not really going anywhere and that it's very sluggish. This is a solid mid-single digit top and bottom with very strong cash flow generation. This is a great business and I think it's going to be around for a long time and that\u2019s why we keep it firmly as part of the assets within Alliance. So, very pleased with that issuance.","Again jumps by quarter, it was up 5% in Q1, it was down 3% in Q2. I think on a full year basis we\u2019re still shooting for somewhere around 4% or something like that. So, overall, we did have over performance versus guidance, it came from three areas; first, on a top line basis Epsilon\u2019s revenues swung faster than we had anticipated, 7 point swing versus we were looking at more like 4 or 5; second, in Card Services yields came in better than expected as we saw the burn through of these programs occur faster and that was good news; and then finally on the bottom line it didn\u2019t help top line, but on the bottom line as Charles said we accelerated the opportunity to take the final 20% of BrandLoyalty and that added a few pennies in addition to the other stuff, so probably those three things drove the over-performance. But in general really across the board it was a really good story.","I think on a full year basis let's just jump to that. We are raising full year guidance to revenues of 7.15 billion, up 11%, core EPS for \u201916, 85, up 12% and the new And the new guidance does reflect the flow through of the second quarter deed to our guidance. And we will flow to additional over performance if any, if that occurs in the back half for the year, essentially this year has been planning out, either Charles nor I want to get too far out and over our SKUs here, so what we are effective doing is we will flow through the over performance when it comes. But let's not go charging down the road too quickly right now.","Certainly things are heading in the right direction, there is an upward bias to even the existing guidance. But when it comes we\u2019ll flow it through. You can think it almost as a hedge against if foreign exchange rates that going wonky again. We don\u2019t want to have to recut and go through all that stuff again. But in general back half looks good, second quarter obviously double-double, look very good.","Card services we still expect double digit growth top and bottom for the year. Yield compression will continue to lessen each quarter and we went from 210 to 80 and it will continue to lessen as the final two quarters play out, which gives us again from where Melisa and I said, a very nice jump off point for next year.","Principal loss rates, lot of chattered out there in the market place, losses are going up, they are going up faster, they\u2019re going up slower. It's pretty straight forward, we are seeing the seasoning we thought at the beginning of the year, we will do 5% and then you know the other 50% basis points next year. So we are not seeing any consumer distress and the new vintages that we are signing, we have already completed the 2 billion in signings needed for the full year this year. So it's only July, but again a wonderful year.","Epsilon, revenue growth rates snapped back in mid-single, we expect that to drift up a bit and improve in even Q3 and Q4 as the momentum continues. We expect the revenue flow through to EBITDA starting as soon as Q3, as India is slowly ramped up, and again we will call it the Q3 flip. Digital and technology businesses are hot. As Charles mentioned double-digit growth, it's three quarters of Epsilon Conversant, so it's by far the largest chunk of it and it is doing extremely well.","The final piece the quarter of the business that\u2019s agency media and media services, again better than Q1, still have some work to do. We have a number of initiatives underway, I guess the overall way to think about Epsilon Conversant is that, we manage a portfolio products and services that can range from products that are in decline 15%, 20% to those that are growing 60%. The goal here is to manage to a weighted average growth rate into the mid to high single digits. And so I think we are back on track there.","And on the agency side specifically we have a number of initiatives underway, specifically sort of data driven CRM lights if you want to call it for clients who don\u2019t want to do the full scale heavy duty CRM offering, but also potentially looking at maybe a white label type approach to the platform offering up to the mid-tier and smaller agency that can\u2019t afford to bring all that stuff in house. So again I think there is a bunch of good stuff going on there that we\u2019re still feeling pretty optimistic about it.","Finally, and then we\u2019ll take some questions, LoyaltyOne. We expect mid-single digit growth in revenue on a constant currency basis and as I said this is a -- it's a good business and it continues to get good traction up there. AIR MILES issued also about 4% and then of course BrandLoyalty strong double-digit top and bottom line growth as the business continues to expand globally.","Overall, if you were to look at the bigger picture and the longer term picture you would see that if you went from the year before the great recession then including the great recession and all the way up to last year this company has delivered top line growth averaging 15% a year and bottom line growth or core EPS growth of 18% year again and then includes the great recession.","So, it's not all that surprising that we\u2019re already back to double-digit top and bottom, again I think it's a quarter ahead of schedule, but we are raising guidance and expect to be running at plus 11 and plus 12 for rev and core EPS. It's the ability to grow our core EPS by double-digits despite being in a period of normalization in our card business.","So what does that all mean. What it essentially means is we\u2019re dumping a whole bunch of P&L expense, not cash expense, the P&L expense into our reserves as losses normalized and as we\u2019re growing 20 plus percent, it's a big drag on our nums. And you\u2019re talking a couple of hundred million dollars. And what that effectively does is that knocks 10 points off of our growth rate. And so, even in its big high growth period with big reserve builds we\u2019re still able to deliver double-digit top and bottom, that\u2019s pretty good.","And so if we can do plus 11 top, plus 12 bottom, essentially in a period where you\u2019re done seasoning and loss rates are stable that would have been plus 11 and plus 22. So, that\u2019s the order of magnitude here. Our goal is even in a seasoning period which is what we\u2019re in now. We still expect to deliver double top, double bottom.","So I think that our business outlook looks good, and I think if we don\u2019t have anything else here we might as well just go to Q&A. Obviously, you can tell from our tone that what once was a very heavily weighted backend year is now no longer the case and we\u2019re feeling chipper about it. So why don\u2019t we open it up to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from David Togut with Evercore ISI.","David Togut","Thank you. Good morning and nice to see the strong second quarter results and the increased outlook for the year. Melisa appreciate the helpful insights into Card Services, with credit top of mind, could you just remind us what the FICO score ranges are for your customer base? And how these are trending with new customer additions?","Edward Heffernan","The situation David we really don\u2019t look it at that way. The underwriting that we do is a combination of internal proprietary data that we use plus euros that we pull as well. So it's really a combination we use. If you think about the underwriting David, we have been using the same approach since the early 90s, so it's a very mature, it\u2019s part of our secret sauce. So it's not a case where we purely rely on euros, so it's more of a case we use our internal data which is as you know extensive to really find the universe of consumers that meet our profile but they\u2019re also a little bit different. Part of the reason we get the growth rates we do. So I would say it's what we\u2019ve always said before, we don\u2019t target subprime, we are going for a prime consumer. But we don\u2019t really rely upon bureaus as 100% underwriting.","Melisa Miller","And David if I can just add on top of that we have invested pretty significantly in tools that allow us to look at data sources even beyond that which would be our standard either from other outside sources or that which we have internally. And we believe that combination is a bit of our secret sauce. It allows us to welcome as many card members to the program that will actually pay us back but also are really accretive to our brand partners.","David Togut","Understood. Just shifting gears, ValueAct recently increased its stake to 6.8% of ADS and they spelled out some objectives in a press release. Can you enlighten us about your dialogue with ValueAct and where you think that will go overtime?","Edward Heffernan","Sure, I certainly read the press release. I would say that what we can say is that they have known us extremely well for probably a decade and they have been quite savvy with their bets over the past decade. The initial discussions we have had were similar to the discussion we will have with any potential large investor, which is, tell us about the business, the plans, the future and the believe is just what they said that they think it\u2019s a good value and they think that the noise around the whole credit and how it's going to impact us in everything else is overdone. And that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been told in terms of their position. Anything else frankly, I believe they have to file certain papers if they decide to do something else. But frankly that\u2019s all we know at this point.","David Togut","Understood. Just finally just wanted to confirm that you are reaffirming your free cash flow guidance for the year?","Edward Heffernan","Yes.","David Togut","Okay. So 1.4 billion?","Edward Heffernan","Yes.","David Togut","Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Thank you, good morning, and good results. Quick question on some of the initiatives around Epsilon, redirecting the digital agency towards mid-agencies and the alike, how long do you think this takes to really assess whether or not they work or not?","Edward Heffernan","Yes, I mean it's -- what we are seeing on that small piece in the agency side is that the traditional clients we had, the real big agencies have taken a lot of that work in house, right. Because the goal of that part of the business was originally to go out and find inventory and appropriate inventory where we could place the various advertisements and messaging. And so as that has happened and programmatic trading and everything else was come into play, what we\u2019re looking at and where we think there is a big opportunity is, there is a lot of clients out there who love the huge CRM type offering that requires them to give us the SKU level information, both online, offline. We take that. We churn it through the big machines. We find the right patterns. We go out and place those with the appropriate folks out in the digital space. But there is also we believe a huge chunk of folks, clients out there who don\u2019t necessarily want or need the whole suit to nuts that we offer with big CRM as we call it.","So I am going to call it CRM light, which is where you\u2019ll use some data. So for example a client may just say look, I am having a big sale, it\u2019s going to be in the southeast region of the country. I want to go out and I want to find those folks who\u2019re most likely to visit, here is my email list. Could you go out, use that data and let everyone know that\u2019s appropriate about the sale and what\u2019s going on? And that\u2019s a much smaller commitment from the client. And we think that\u2019s a good way to get them in the door and hopefully eventually upsell to big CRMs.","So the long winded answer is if we can do that along with our partners at let's say the mid-tier agencies who can afford to build these massive trading platforms, programmatic type platforms that this could be a nice winner and a nice feeder as well into big CRM. We\u2019ve already started the retraining of our agency sales folks into CRM and so we expect this thing to start taking route really towards the back half of the year. So, hopefully we\u2019ll see some results before we exit this year.","Sanjay Sakhrani","And then I guess I have a second question on private label, and maybe it's for Melisa and all of you all. There is obviously always chatter about large renewals for all of the big private label issuers and you guys included. But can you just conceptually talk about your confidence in retaining some of your larger customers as they\u2019ve grown with you plus anecdotally maybe you could just talk about if any of those sales, the sales lift commentary that Melisa had still applied to these big relationships as your relationship has evolved?","Melisa Miller","Sanjay, good morning, I am glad you asked that question because the sales gains that we talk about are really from those legacy programs. And candidly we have a high degree of confidence that we will retain those partners where we\u2019re like mind and where they view the card program as the ultimate loyalty tool where we\u2019re both making joint investments into the program. Candidly tender share increases, increasing spend and retention is really how our partners measure us and it's the report card that we have for ourselves. So we would tell you this that we have a 100% track record of retaining those important brand partners where we are aligned on the goals of the program and we intent to approach the future just the same way that we\u2019ve approached the past.","Operator","Your next question comes from Darrin Peller with Barclays.","Darrin Peller","Just want to start off with guidance if you don\u2019t mind, it\u2019s good to see you\u2019ve been on the quarter and raised for the full year by that beat. But just understanding the timing around the quarterly cadence now, your third quarter guidance suggests sequential increase in third to fourth quarter to me your full year, which I think is a little bit more of a ramp than we had initially expected given fourth quarter often has a drag from reserve builds. So can you just give us some color on what the dynamic is between third and fourth quarter EPS in terms of the pick up?","Charles Horn","Again a lot it comes to timing, I would say some of it is going to be driven by BrandLoyalty. The BrandLoyalty you saw with its revenue down 10% in Q1 and up 40% Q2, it will likely draw to maybe negative Q3 within big pop in Q4. As you know that BrandLoyalty is a high fix cost structure, so with its revenue ramps you get a nice flow through to earnings. It\u2019s just items like that that have that influence. The CRM business with Conversant, it is very much back half driven around the holiday season, you can get nice ramp. So Darrin it's not one single factor, it's just a number of factors that drive the growth you are looking sequentially Q3, Q4.","Darrin Peller","Okay, all right thanks. And just I guess I want to follow up to some of the questions around the private label of card services business. Specifically in a metrics that got better here more than expected, I mean the yield in particular -- I know there were some nuances on how you are seeing some of the program and the way you charge for and time payments.","Just explain in a little more detail if you don\u2019t mind and how that got better versus your expectations? And then if that trend should continue going forward, what's going to drive that along with maybe just from a really just touch on credit quality one last time, given how many questions all of us have gotten around. It seem fine, but is there anything you seeing, in any of the delinquency buckets that are any different at all, maybe either you or Melisa can determine? Thanks.","Melisa Miller","Yes Darrin, I\u2019ll go ahead and answer the question if I can in reverse order. With respect to the consumer behavior, candidly we are just not seeing the distress in terms of her payment behavior and her shopping behavior that others have discuss. Now she is shopping differently and she is spending differently. And part of advantage that we have here is as you know, we have diversified our portfolio a bit. So apparel seems to be the area where we see some weakness. But in terms of her payments behavior and her relationship with us, we have great visibility into where she's been and great visibility into how she's going to continue to behave with us.","So again we feel very comfortable with meeting guidance for the year. With respect to what has changed from the end of last year, recall that we did make some program changes and the risk mix -- excuse me the vintage mix of our new partners was also influencing what those yields looked like and simply as Ed said we are ahead a quarter, the burn in and the normalization just happened sooner than we expected. And again with very good visibility into what the future looks like, we feel very-very good about meeting that guidance.","Edward Heffernan","I want to hit the credit thing because there is seems to be so much chattered out there that is maybe helpful to put in respective and having been in the business for a thousand years here going back to the 90s and the various cycles to where we are today, I think probably the biggest stress test that anyone has ever faced was the great recession. And in the great recession what actually happened was that even though private label tends to -- and always has run a point or so above loss rates in sort of the general purpose arena. What actually happened in the great recession is we performed a lot better than the general purpose cards.","And so when it really hit the fan the general purpose cards, those portfolios went from 4%, 5% to 10% or 11% loss rates, I mean on a 600 basis points, we went up 300. And the reason behind that is why I guess we don\u2019t share the concern that others do about private label and everything else is the fact that for sure, it's the card that doesn\u2019t have utilization of a general purpose card the best great in terms of when times get stretched because of the fact that you do not have a big open or buy line and you do not have the ability to go use it to buy food and put gas in the car and then go bankrupt.","So, what you\u2019re seeing is there may be lots of cards out there. But as you go down the credit spectrum you bring down your credit lines. And so you may have a $100 credit line on someone with a thin file. And that ability to manage or open to buying your credit lines across 40 million households is what allowed us to really manage to a very modest hit during the great recession, and that\u2019s why I think we don\u2019t expect to see any spike because we are very active in terms of managing credit lines.","Darrin Peller","That\u2019s helpful. Just quick follow up and then I\u2019ll turn it back to the queue. On the buyback front, I know there was a lot last quarter, you did the -- you paid out for BrandLoyalty this quarter. Is that why there was a little bit of a slowdown on buybacks, should we expect that to resume next quarter and going forward? Thanks guys.","Edward Heffernan","Obviously we can\u2019t tell exactly what we\u2019re going to do. But it shouldn\u2019t change the general thinking for the year. I would look at it simply as we\u2019re halfway through the year. We\u2019ve spent half the money [Multiple Speakers].","Operator","Your next question comes from Ramsey El-Assal with Jefferies.","Ramsey El-Assal","So you mentioned that you pulled forward the purchase of BrandLoyalty. On the EPS side, what did that add in the quarter and in the guide?","Charles Horn","It probably added about $0.03 to the quarter and for the year if they continue to meet expectations, Ramsey, it will probably add an incremental $0.05 compared to what we started the year thinking.","Ramsey El-Assal","Okay.","Charles Horn","And what we\u2019ll do with that Ramsey, is as it comes through on a quarterly basis then you\u2019ll see us flow it through to our guidance.","Ramsey El-Assal","Got it. On brand loyalty, how should we think about the -- how can I put this as sort of sales cadence or where you\u2019re at in the sales cycle with this program. In other words, especially in North America you seem to have some success in the programs. I mean are you waiting to dial up the sales resources you stack against rolling this program out? Are you still consider yourself in kind of test and learn mode? Or is there some inflection point we should be waiting for when you kind of put the pedal to the medal or is it more just going to be a gradual cross sell or build over time?","Edward Heffernan","I think in North America if you look at where we started, we started up in Canada. Obviously it made sense since we had all those relationships with the big grocers. Pedal is to the metal in Canada and that\u2019s bringing in 40 million, 50 million a year of incremental revenue since we started it probably 18 months ago. So, Canada is fully spooled up. And so you\u2019re left with the U.S. which is 10 times in terms of the market size of Canada, which gets us obviously pretty excited.","We were very deliberate in the pilots that we\u2019ve been running. All we can say at this point is that the results were quite good and the results, we expect that the client is hopefully as excited as we are and hopefully we\u2019ll have some bigger news before the end of the year. And that\u2019s that\u2019s unfortunately all we can say at this point, but once that happens then we press the accelerator a little bit more.","Ramsey El-Assal","Got you. Lastly from me on the regulatory front I heard a little chartered in the quarter about the CFPB looking at differed interest promotions, are there any other acute areas of risk in the business at this point? How are you thinking about regulation over the next call it 12 months to 18 months?","Edward Heffernan","Here is what we would say, we have been thriving in a very heavily regulated environment for many, many years. We obviously stay very close to pending points of view to any actions that are taken out there. For us on the differed side, it is not a significant portion of our business and so we would respond accordingly if there is any feedback that was given. And for us you know next to our partners and our consumers we take all reputation with the regulators very, very seriously. So we build strong relationships and build our business accordingly.","Ramsey El-Assal","Okay. Thanks for your comments.","Operator","The next question comes from Bob Napoli with William Blair.","Bob Napoli","Melisa, just maybe a follow up on the regulatory question I guess, obviously regulatory has been a big challenge for anybody in a financial services industry and as you guys are getting larger you may have a different regulatory body reviewing you, I mean you may already have that happening. But what are you looking at? What are your -- and are there areas of concern as new regulators, as you grow, take a different look at Alliance Data Systems, is there anything we -- what should we be worried about or concerned about?","Melisa Miller","So Bob, we would tell you that this growth as you well know has been very purposeful, very planned, like all of the other institutions we have been dramatically strengthening our areas of compliance, compliance management systems and candidly the FDIC and the CFPB have had strong collaboration for some amount of time. The consumer protection laws that are written by the CFPB are currently laws we already abide by and so we feel very good that there shouldn\u2019t be any big surprises. Well there be some nuances to the relationships? Potentially. But sitting here today we don\u2019t expect something large or ominous to come our way.","Bob Napoli","Okay and then --.","Melisa Miller","[Multiple Speakers] given to, is given.","Bob Napoli","Thank you, on the credit side if you look typically cards across the credit card industry, credit weakens in the back half for the year seasonally, I think that\u2019s if you look back historically in ADS it's not necessarily always the case. But is there why -- I mean you are right at your target for the year in the first half of the year with the potential for seasonal weaken in the back half, why are you so confident on hitting your target on the credit side for the year?","Melisa Miller","Well, there are a couple of things that contribute to that Bob. The first is again as we mentioned these customers that our 12 months active have been with us for many years. So we have great visibility into where she\u2019s been and how she will behave in the future. And for us although some of our brand admittedly are seeing weakness.","We generally continue to deliver that three times the brand growth, we saw that play out in Q1 and Q2 and so set differently in times of brand weakness. The card programs are actually the bright spot because they are the most loyal card members.","And so this is where that multi-channel approach comes into play, we will talk her more, we will ensure that she has the right motivation to either online or get back into the store. But we are confident in our sales projections for the year.","Bob Napoli","On the credit side, and I mean on the sales side I mean are you seeing the same payment rates, are you looking -- what are you looking at to give you that very high confidence that you\u2019ll hit your 5% charge off?","Melisa Miller","Well, what we\u2019re confident in is that we are seeing the delinquency following normal seasonal trends. We are seeing our charge offs follow normal seasonal trends, and no we\u2019re not worried about our payment rates. Our payment rates are commensurate with the balances that our card members carry, so we are not concerned about that.","Edward Heffernan","I think if I could pile on a little bit, essentially delinquency flows how we\u2019re carrying [ph] those delinquency flows, recovery rates, personal bankruptcies, open to buy, all the stuff that goes into figuring out the flow through and the visibility. We\u2019ve been spot on since the guide at the beginning of the year where we gave it by quarter. And based on all the flows we\u2019re seeing, the losses they\u2019re not going up than the back half versus the front half. We\u2019re going to be right at that 5% by the end of the year.","Bob Napoli","Last question [Multiple Speakers]. A big -- the differentiation of your card business versus your competitors or Synchrony and the marketing side of your business. I thought The Children's Place was a good example. But are you seeing -- when you're talking to potential clients, how often or how important, how would you differentiate yourself? And is your differentiation today the same as it has been in the past and are you seeing competitors invest more in their marketing capabilities to narrow that competitive gap?","Melisa Miller","Well, it\u2019s certainly a crowded competitive fields right now, Bob and what we would tell you is our newest brand partners as well as our legacy brand partners are our very best selling tools. So if you think about the two examples that I just called out, these are brand new partners that have had very, very long standing programs with other issuers. And so the card member didn\u2019t suddenly change overnight and the brand didn\u2019t suddenly change overnight.","What changed perhaps are the new tools that we make available, the way that we move out new value propositions to really resonate with the card members, and candidly the way that we go about segmenting a client customer base so that we can get our back into the store. So, we believe that our history speaks for itself. In all humility we earn business every day. But we have a proven track record of delivering larger, more meaningful programs to the market we serve.","Bob Napoli","Thank you.","Edward Heffernan","We take one more question.","Operator","Your next question comes from Tim Willi with Wells Fargo.","Tim Willi","Hopefully I can sneak two in here real quick. First one is, Ed, just going back to the free cash flow and thinking about that nominal number versus how you allocate that and truly what's there for the repurchase program, which you have executed on. But obviously, you're growing the bank and the receivables. And if you look at some of the regulatory reports, you're actually putting capital into one of the banks. So I was just wondering if you could walk through, maybe explain a bit what's going on with the bank capital infusion relative to free cash flow, relative to other priorities for that free cash flow. And then I just had a follow-up on Epsilon real quick.","Edward Heffernan","Yes, I\u2019ll give it to you at a high level and Charles can put any detail that he wants. But at the very high level we -- when I look at capital allocation capital resources for any given year I start with our general definition of EBITDA, net of funding cost, net of corporate interest expense, net of CapEx, you add back sort of the delta between the provision and what our actual cash losses are. And you come up with about 1.4 billion, of that amount if cards is growing the file 3 billion a year or something like that we are going to need 450 million to 500 million of capital to support that. You take that of the 1.4 billion, you are down at 900 and that essentially is what we have to play with, without sort of increasing the leverage a lot.","But sort of that 900 is sort of what we play with and that either goes towards buyback or it goes towards M&A. And look, the M&A could be at the bank level with a portfolio, in that case we would keep a little bit more down to bank or it could be M&A for an Epsilon or LoyaltyOne in that case we would upstream it to the parent. So that\u2019s essentially the breakdown of our free cash.","Tim Willi","Great, thank you. And then just a quick follow-up on Epsilon, and I apologize if this was addressed earlier. I hopped off. But in terms of that agency business, I think mid or early second quarter, I think there was a study or a paper written by a trade group around the ad agency and the inventory and things of that nature, basically saying there was not a lot of transparency between the big ad agencies and their consumer products, customers in terms of the services they provide in kickbacks and discounts and things like that.","It sort of showed a conflict maybe with some of the insourcing that was going on at those big agencies. Again, maybe I'm just going way down the wrong path here, but I'm just curious if that development is something that actually potentially could benefit your agency business even just incrementally as maybe the end customer, that big consumer product Company or whatever says, I need more transparency and objective execution around my services versus just giving it all to you in house. Is there anything there to think about or no?","Edward Heffernan","I would certainly, I think I would just leave it at it does not hurt us, that\u2019s for sure.","Tim Willi","Fair enough. That\u2019s all I have thanks.","Edward Heffernan","Okay well thank you everyone. We look forward to a great summer, a good Q3 and a strong end to the year. So thank you and we will talk to you later.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"1613":["Alliance Data Systems Corporation (NYSE:ADS) Q3 2012 Results Earnings Call October 18, 2012  8:30 AM ET","Executives","Julie Prozeller - FTI Consulting, IR","Ed Heffernan - President and CEO","Charles Horn - Chief Financial Officer","Melisa Miller - President, Retail Credit Services","Analysts","Jim Kissane - Credit Suisse","Sanjay Sakhrani - KBW","Darrin Peller - Barclays","Dan Perlin - RBC Capital Markets","Operator","Good morning. And welcome to the Alliance Data Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all parties have been placed on a listen-only mode. Following today\u2019s presentation the floor will be open for your questions. (Operator Instructions)","In order to view the company\u2019s presentation on their website please remember to turnoff the pop blocker on your computer.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host Ms. Julie Prozeller of FTI Consulting. Ma\u2019am\u2026","Julie Prozeller","Thank you, Operator. By now you should have received a copy of the company\u2019s third quarter 2012 earnings release. If you haven\u2019t please call FTI Consulting at 212-850-5721. On the call today from Alliance Data we have Ed Heffernan, President and Chief Executive Officer; Charles Horn, Chief Financial Officer; and Melisa Miller, President of Retail Credit Services.","Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on today\u2019s call and some of the references to your questions may contain forward-looking statements.","These statements are subject to the risks and the uncertainties described in the company\u2019s earnings release and other filings with the SEC. Alliance Data has no obligation to update the information presented on this call.","Also on today\u2019s call are speakers will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures which we believe will provide useful information for investors. Reconciliation of those measures to GAAP will be posted on the Investor Relations website at www.alliancedata.com.","With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Ed Heffernan. Ed?","Ed Heffernan","Thanks Julie. Why don\u2019t we go ahead and get started. Hopefully everyone has a the slide that were made available and today as usual we are going to start with the third quarter results and then we\u2019ll move into what our full year outlook seems to be at this point. And then as it has been tradition for us over the last dozen years we will give our initial look see at 2013.","I think overall as we get started as has been the case with us for the last few quarters at least it looks like things are running strongly and therefore, we once again feel comfortable bumping up guidance pretty much across all the metrics even with the headwinds of higher shares flowing in from the converts and the phantoms.","So it looks to be like a good run to the end of the year and we\u2019re looking at a very nice jumper for \u201813. We all know it\u2019s a little bit early to say \u201813 looks like another rock solid year. But we\u2019ll try to give at least a little color as to what the trends are.","Obviously, Charles, the ever popular CFO will be kicking things off. And then for the first time we have Melisa Miller, who is been in-charge of our Private Label Group over the last year and for those of you who have not had the opportunity to meet Melisa. She has been with us at ADS for going on seven years now and prior to that she spent 22 years at Experian and was the big cheese who ran sales for all of their commercial credit division.","So again very, very strong background in the industry and I think quite frankly a big reason for the tremendous performance that we\u2019re seeing out of Private Label this year and I think you\u2019ll find we\u2019re equally excited about the next couple years as well. So you can look forward to that.","And with that, I will turn it over to Charles.","Charles Horn","Thanks, Ed. I will first walk you through the consolidated results before we move to the segments. Overall, another terrific quarter for ADS, an 8% increase in revenue, drove 15% increase in EPS and a 10% increase in core EPS.","This was accomplished despite the continuing dampening effect of phantom shares, which had 3.9 million shares to our diluted share count for the quarter. Excluding the phantom shares from both periods, core EPS was $2.75 for the quarter up and even stronger 16% compared to last year.","We beat core EPS guidance for the quarter by $0.16 if we exclude the benefit of the tax reserve release. In our updated 2012 guidance, you will see that we are flowing through this several performance to our core EPS guidance for the year.","In summary, Q3 results were driven by solid performance in Private Label and LoyaltyOne with mix results at Epsilon.","Let\u2019s flip the next page and discuss LoyaltyOne\u2019s results. LoyaltyOne had a solid third quarter with both revenue and adjusted EBITDA of mid single digits when we exclude the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange translation and operating losses in Brazil and India.","Consistent with our expectation, topline growth moderated on a sequential quarter basis due to the decrease in the burn rate to 73% from 78% in the second quarter of 2012. As discussed in last quarter\u2019s earnings call, the burn rate was artificially high during the first half of 2012 due to the introduction of an expiry policy at the end of last year.","The effect of this notification which created four quarter redemption is now waning and burn rates returning to more typical levels. As a reminder, burn rate is calculated as miles redeemed during the quarter divided by miles issued during the quarter.","As discussed before, adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter was at mid-single digits over the same quarter last year when we take away the drag of unfavorable exchange translation in operating losses associated with our international expansion efforts. Importantly though, if we look through to the base airlines AIR MILES reward program, our margins -- EBITDA margins increased slightly over 30% for the quarter. So your base Canadian business is doing very well.","Miles issued were down slightly compared to third quarter of 2011, primarily due to the timing of promotional activity by certain key sponsors. We believe this is merely a timing issue and the issuance growth will bounce back to mid single-digit range in the fourth quarter.","Miles redeemed were up 2% compared to third quarter of 2011, essentially in line with our expectations. We expect the burn rates for the fourth quarter will drop into the mid-60% range, which will likely cause miles redeemed to be less than the fourth quarter of 2011.","A new instant reward program, AIR MILES cash was added to the AIR MILES Reward Program during the first quarter of 2012. To date, approximately 850,000 collectors have enrolled in the program, which is being offered at five sponsors.","We plan to add additional sponsors in categories for the program over time and to increase the number of locations where miles cash redemptions are accepted. Our original target was to add 10 sponsors in the program by year-end but seven is now more likely number. The time near the rollout is not completely within our control as it requires point of sale programming changes on the part of other sponsors. To date, miles issues under the program are not material.","Now, quick update on dotz. Nationally, we have seen our total collectors enrolled in the program grow to over 4.5 million at the end of the third quarter, already exceeding our year-end target of $4 million. Our goal is for dotz to enter additional two markets during the fourth quarter ending the year with six total markets and these markets would cover approximately 25% of Brazil\u2019s total population.","Let\u2019s turn to the next page and talk about Epsilon. Epsilon\u2019s overall performance for the quarter was mixed with strong growth in adjusted EBITDA was increased 10%. On \u2013 at this point, revenue decline of 30% for the third quarter of 2012. Our line of business database digital revenue was down 2% due primarily to the previously discussed weakness in healthcare and pharmaceutical vertical.","Data revenue was off 1% as improved performance in compiled data offerings was offset by unexpected softness in our cooperative data offering primarily for the B-to-B vertical. Agency\/analytics revenue decreased 5% due to what we believe as a temporary pullback by one of our largest agency clients.","Overall, Epsilon\u2019s results reflect what we expected, a slowdown in topline revenue growth for the back half of 2012. Historically, new wins would cover any vertical or client weaknesses that didn\u2019t happen in the first half of 2012 as we experienced delays in closing pipeline opportunities.","Fortunately, we\u2019ve been able to rectify this situation as a backlog of wins is now double-digits year-over-year building a healthy ramp for 2013 as these new wins on board and drive revenue growth. At the same time, Epsilon\u2019s strong adjusted EBITDA growth coupled with substantial EBITDA margin expansion demonstrates both sound discipline and the impact of Epsilon\u2019s 2012 focus on restructuring and realigning the business around a unified go-to-market strategy that aligns all sales and client services into industry verticals that delivers solutions across all Epsilon areas.","This restructuring has unified the company\u2019s diverse offerings and simplified service delivery in order to maximize benefits to clients as well as the identification and capture growth opportunities within clients, which should benefit us in 2013.","With that, I will turn it over to Melisa to talk about Private Label.","Melisa Miller","Thank you, Charles. Good morning. Private label strong revenue and EBITDA growth was fueled by large increases in cardholder spending and a number of new timing. For the quarter, revenue increased 17% and adjusted EBITDA net of funding cost increased 21% compared to the third quarter of 2011.","So let\u2019s take a look at some of the fundamentals driving these results. In the area of receivables growth, average credit card receivables increased 26% compared to the third quarter of 2011 while ending credit card receivables increased 32% from September of 2011. Now, much of this growth we attribute to the success we\u2019ve had signing and on boarding new clients during the year with our notable successes being Pier1, Bon-Ton and Talbot. And we\u2019re seeing that our respective clients are really responding to our marketing and loyalty approach to growing our joint program.","However, even without that new business our core file saw strong growth with average in ending receivables up 14% and 17% respectively. Our cardholder spending remains very, very strong, up 40% from the third quarter of 2011 and excluding the new program, the core growth rate was still a very strong 20%. So this performance to our signals that the investments we\u2019ve made in customer care and advanced analytics and really our multichannel approach to cardholder communication is driving more trips, more business and more spend for trip.","With strong spending and improved retention from our existing cardholders, a number of new partnerships fully backing these credit programs and a strong pipeline of potential new clients, we expect this growth to continue to accelerate well under 2013.","We built a marketing-oriented customized environment and our philosophy of really leveraging all of the data and the possible touch points as a means to promote these programs continues to pay us big dividends in the form of cardholder and loyalty.","Portfolio quality continues to improve the principal charge-off rate with 4.3% for Q3 2012, compared to 6% for Q3 2011 and 4.9% for Q2 2012. So this is an improvement on both the year-over-year basis as well as sequential basis. And the trends are now suggesting 180 to 200 basis point improvement in charge-off rates for the full year 2012 opposite 2011.","Funding rates continue to improve as older tranches of debt mature and are replaced with cheaper new paper. Our cash funding rates for all card-related borrowings which excludes non-cash items was 2.5% in Q3 2012, 120 basis points better than last year.","So overall the outlook for 2012 remains positive with very strong receivables in revenue growth, low principal charge-off rates and improving funding costs, entering into 2013, the outlook remains equally strong supported by a very, very solid pipeline of new prospects.","Charles, I\u2019ll turn it back to you.","Charles Horn","All right. Thanks Melissa. We\u2019re flipping to the next page and we\u2019ll talk about liquidity. I\u2019ll start off with the corporate liquidity, which continues to build increasing to $1.7 billion at September 30, 2012. Cash has increased almost $800 million while available borrowing capacity approximates $900 million.","So what we have is basically very substantial war chest. Net corporate debt was approximately $1.7 billion at September 30, 2012 with our leverage ratio which is defined as corporate debt to adjusted EBITDA of 2.1 times compared to our maximum loans covenant of 3.5 times.","At the bank subsidiary level, we have approximately $2.4 billion of available liquidity at September 30, 2012. Since Q2, we\u2019ve renewed one conduit totaling $300 million commitments at favorable terms and issued $1.2 billion of term asset-backed securities with an average life slightly over six years and a weighted average coupon of about 2.2%. This is the best execution ever for ADS.","Our focus in 2012 has been to take advantage of a robust financing market to lock in long-term fixed rate money. While we give up some current great opportunity by going further out in the curve, we gain long-term certainty and latter maturity dates.","Continuing our dividend trends, our two banks paid $32.5 million in dividends to the ADS parent during the third quarter. We reduced the dividend by $25 million compared to the second quarter of this year, due to the acquisition of approximately $600 million of credit card portfolios, coupled with our desire to maintain strong regulatory capital ratios. We expect dividends to returns to the mid-$50 million range next quarter.","I will now turn it over to Ed to walk you through our updated guidance and\/or initial 2013 guidance.","Ed Heffernan","Great. When we turn to the slide titled 2012 full year\u2019s scorecard and this is where we get a chance to sort of step back. We are in the waning months of the year, and so it shouldn\u2019t be too many surprises or frankly any at all as the rest of the year plays out. And so this gives us an opportunity to step back and say all right, how does the full year shape up, what we\u2019ve been happy about, what has been a disappointment to us and all of this should come together and help easily signal our entry into 2013.","And so let\u2019s start off first with a division-by-division look, and as we talked about - let\u2019s start with Epsilon. Epsilon for the year is going to post very nice topline and EBITDA growth rates in the mid-teens roughly 13 top, 13 bottom, and of which, we are very pleased with one and not pleased with another. In fact, quite frankly we are disappointed with the organic topline growth rate. We frankly missed the organic target of 7% to 8%. Looks like, we are going to be coming in more like 3% and that means we were off topline probably about $40 million, that\u2019s as simple as I can make it.","Charles talked about a couple of the headwinds that we faced and our biggest discussion point right now, is this something that we need to worry about as we go into \u201813, or is it more of an air pocket or air boiler, whatever you want to call it for 2012. So topline I would say was disappointing. What was pleasing on the other side was the fact that our bottom line came in right where we wanted it, if not slightly higher.","We expect to do about organic bottom line of about 10%, which is what we had expected. It also means that our margins have increased a hundred basis points above expectations. So bottom line looks very solid and then really what answers the question is how does the pipeline look?","What we found was in the first half of this year, the pipeline and the pipeline is defined very simply as wins that means mean ink on paper plus verbals, getting the verbal nod from a client that\u2019s how we define our commitments. And in the first half of this year, our commitments were actually running slightly behind last year which gave us some pause, and that also meant that we knew that the back half of this year was going to be soft. It\u2019s pretty simple math.","The really nice news right now is that what we\u2019ve seen over the past few months is that the pipeline has now jumped dramatically, and is now running as Charles mentioned double digits ahead of the pipeline last year. So our wins in verbals are up double digit versus where they were last year, which means it looks like this was in fact more of an air pocket for a couple of quarters that will play out in Q3 and Q4.","And then we should come back, based on the pipeline assigned deals very nicely for \u201813. So again it\u2019s a tale of some disappointment that we are seeing in topline Q3, Q4. It looks like that was an air pocket based on the wins in pipelines and as a result, we do feel very good about our guidance for Epsilon for next year. But let\u2019s not also forget that from an earnings perspective, Epsilon did deliver double-digit organic earnings growth and 13% we\u2019ll print as our overall earnings numbers. So a bit of a mixed bag, but as I look forward certainly more positive than negative.","LoyaltyOne don\u2019t really have any negatives coming out of that area, results again and this is 100% organic. We are looking at plus 8, plus 8 which is right where we wanted it to be, maybe a point better than expected. But top and bottom line is striking very nicely to expectations despite incurring additional costs with our accelerated rollout in Brazil. Basically the Canadian business managed to over perform a bit and offset that additional investment.","So very pleased with LoyaltyOne\u2019s results overall and our key metric miles issued. If just to remind everyone, we\u2019ll make any money unless the points get issued or the miles get issued and we need that to run right around 5%. It\u2019s running around 6%, which is good. And then also one of the key metrics we track that Charles talked about is what\u2019s called the burn rate.","We reserve essentially at 72%, meaning we expect 72% of all the miles that have been issued to eventually be redeemed. Over the last 20 years I think was somewhere around 50%. So we are quite a bit under our long-term reserve rate, but more importantly we also need to keep track of current trends.","And as Charles mentioned, we had a pull forward based on some new policy changes at the beginning of the year that jumped the burn rate up to 102%, that\u2019s too high. It\u2019s now being drifting down 78% in Q2. This quarter we are right on top of where we wanted to do for the reserve rate and we think Q4 will be somewhere in the mid-60s. So that\u2019s good news there.","And then finally, something that the we are all eagerly waiting every quarter to see that how the key metric is doing, which is the number of folks signed up. To put it in perspective, Canada over a 20-year period has signed up a 10 million households and that business serves off a $0.25 billion of EBITDA. In Brazil coming from zero within a year, so we have already jumped to 4 million folks actively engaged in our program.","We expect that to go up dramatically again in \u201813, as we enter a couple of very, very large market. So Brazil is actually running ahead of expectations, which is why we are accelerating the rollout there. So overall those are the first two businesses. I would say as a general report card, we are pleased with where we stand.","Finally obviously the gold star goes to a Private Label. Results long-term, we\u2019re probably looking at a business that would do somewhere in the mid to high single-digit organic growth. But obviously it has been running at 2 to 3x that this year with revenues up in the mid-teens and earnings or EBITDA up around 20%. It\u2019s been heck of the year as Melisa talked about the performance obviously, well above expectations.","But the one thing that I\u2019d like to call out is the fact that we have never in my 14 years here seen bigger book of business that\u2019s been signed in any given year. And you are talking about the big ones like Pier1 and Talbot\u2019s and Bon-Ton\u2019s, newer programs like the True Value\u2019s, Blue Nile\u2019s, Premier Designs, Ideal Image, Westgate.","We never had a mix since I have been here. So many large brand name, big programs that are existing combined with very, very exciting, starting from scratch-type programs that we will continue to drive growth over the next two, three years.","And in fact, on our very rough measure the 212 vintages what we call it will add close to $1 billion to the existing AR file so almost 20%. Melisa can talk about the trends that are driving that but clearly what we are seeing our more and more retailers getting excited about the close loop network, the Private Label offers.","Again this is all data driven and comes right back to what we do for living, which is how do we takes skew level data and turn it to the merchants\u2019 benefit for their customers that combined with the fact that, there are number of significant programs, where let\u2019s just say folks are less than enthusiastic about their current providers and are looking to come over to us.","And then finally, Melisa and her group being the marketing girls that they are, are driving very significant wallet share gains within the core. The numbers are staggering when you look at the overall market.","I\u2019ll spend a little less time on the credit quality and funding. Obviously things are heading -- have continued to head in the right direction there. But as we leave 2012 and go in to \u201813, we can\u2019t count on the credit quality or funding rates continuing to improve and so what we\u2019re looking at again is sort of the old school growth of let\u2019s see how the book of business is growing, but overall very, very good year.","In summary, if you were to look at the over performance, I think we being raised now every quarter. This one, of course will be no exception. We see Private Label as driving the over performance for this year. We see LoyaltyOne very nicely tracking to expectations and that\u2019s after absorbing some additional expenses for Brazil.","Brazil is in fact ramping up faster than anticipated. We were hoping to have about 4 million folks by year end. It looks like we are going to be close to 5, which is great. And then the mix bag at Epsilon solid bottom line, disappointing topline, but the pipeline having turned very dramatically in the back half suggest that we are heading in the right direction.","On sort of the how much more can we confuse folks in terms of phantom shares and warrants, we\u2019ve had very significant price appreciation in the stock, which causes dilutive effect as phantom shares and warrants flow into the share count. That being said, if you looked at 2011, we had about 4.5 million of these phantom shares that will effectively go away when the converts mature at no cost to us that was 8% of our shares outstanding.","Right now, we are looking at right around 9 million of these phantoms for almost 15% of our shares. So, that\u2019s a heck of a headwind to overcoming and still raise guidance. However, we feel comfortable of course doing both. And so the net result is significant over performance versus our expectations and once again we are raising guidance.","So, let\u2019s turn to 2012 full-year guidance. We expect revenues. We\u2019re bumping up revenues almost I guess from our initial guidance of about 3.5, we\u2019re bumping it up to 3.6 about $100 million. That will be about a 13% topline growth rate. If you were to do an apples-to-apples and have the one M&A deal, which was -- has been in for full-year, you would still see roughly 11% year-over-year topline. So, a very, very strong from an organic growth rate perspective.","Core earnings, we expect to be up in the mid-20s. Again, the fund stuff with the phantoms come into our shares outstanding, a share count has gone up 11%. But overall core EPS, we have taken from initially in $8.30 freezing it to $8.60. So whether it\u2019s revenue core earnings or core EPS, everything is being bumped up.","What I, of course, focus on is, if you were to take the phantoms out since they will be going away how much we really earning on a core EPS perspective and its about $10 a share, which is up 20% year-over-year and that something that I think is pretty exciting. And so, leave you with 13% top, 26% our core EPS and 20% on economic EPS as we exit this year and move into 2013.","So, if you flip the page, let\u2019s talk about and again we know it\u2019s early and there are lot of things that can change. But as you folks who\u2019ve known us over the years. We have a pretty good view as to what\u2019s going to unfold over the next 12 months or so. So, once again we feel pretty good throwing out some of our targets and these will be reflected in our budget and therefore what we get paid on.","So, from a financial growth perspective based upon again what we are seeing the very strong pickup in sign deals and verbal commitments, Epsilon should snapback pretty nicely to the organic growth that we have targeted, which is about 7% top, 9% on EBITDA and the key initiatives is obviously, let\u2019s translate those inc. deals and the verbal into revenue and earnings. And we\u2019re off and running there.","The other big initiative is again we believe we are building a very unique model with Epsilon, where it is the classic what we believe is the one throat to choke for the Chief Marketing Officer, the Chief Information Officer of the global brands, who are looking for someone to pull together everything from the creative or digital agency perspective to also have data assets, database assets, analytic capabilities and the ability to distribute the brand message through all sorts of different channels, be it direct mail, point-of-sale, commission based e-mail, mobile, social, targeted display, whatever it maybe and this one-stop shop is what we built. And so now it\u2019s on us to make sure that our client will look to us for all of their needs as opposed to just one or two, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been putting together for the past year.","Turning to Loyalty, no one thinks that it can\u2019t keep rolling and so we believe sort of around six top organic and about 8% adjusted EBITDA seems about right. To get there we would also need about two to three new AIR MILES sponsors. We think those are in very good shape.","Renewals look to be running at 100% as usual and this is a very critical year 2013 for the Brazilian program, specifically we will be looking to enter the two big markets down there, Rio and S\u00e3o Paulo, and so that combined with all the markets we\u2019ve entered to date would suggest, we get critical mass as 2013 unfolds, which means hopefully the fun can begin at the end of \u201813 going into \u201814. Also you won\u2019t see the drag that you had in \u201812 and \u201813.","Finally, on the Private Label side, 10% top, 10% EBITDA, again, running slightly ahead of our long-term growth expectations, for that we probably will need about six new start ups to keep the train running in \u201814 and \u201815. There\u2019s a number of opportunities for new portfolios.","The bottom line of all of these is that we don\u2019t believe and we\u2019re not counting on any help from either charge-off improvements or funding rate improvements. In fact, we baked in a slight drift up to maybe the mid 5% charge-offs from about 5.2% is what we\u2019re going to run for this year, whether or not we\u2019ll see that. It\u2019s still unclear. Everything looks to be fairly pristine at this point. But we want to emphasize the fact that the growth here is going to be as I mentioned old school growth. You throw on $1 billion they are, you\u2019re going to get nice growth here.","So, the big difference here is that if you were to look at other participants in the card industry, you\u2019re really talking about bank cards and you look at the key metric which is consumer revolving debt, which for years have been growing 7%, topped out at $1 trillion. And then fell off a cliff for three years in 2009, \u201810 and through three quarters of 2011, and went from $1 trillion down $800 billion and has now flattened out at about $800 billion over the last three quarters, which is good news.","But it also means consumers aren\u2019t loading backup and that\u2019s why, I think you\u2019re seeing with big card companies it\u2019s very hard for them to get any type of growth. Obviously, that is completely irrelevant to us. As you can see in the numbers, our ability to gain growth is driven by retailers who are coming on board because of the data is coming, it increased wallet share at our core clients and its in the abnormally high number of wins that Melisa and her team are getting.","So I would caution anyone to for the most part ignore what you\u2019re seeing out of the key metrics that the big card companies based on the fact that we\u2019re grow on the file 20%, 30%, and so our sandbox looks extremely attractive now and for the next couple of years.","All that means is we are going to stick to our long-term model and we put the stake in the ground and again, this is the base case. So this would be, I don\u2019t want to stay conservative but it\u2019s certainly something we feel incredibly comfortable with 8% organic top, 10% EBITDA and 10% free cash flow growth. This assumes no M&A and no activity on the share buyback front, which for those of you who know us means that it certainly is a fairly conservative view.","So our \u201813 guidance as we move into it on the last page here, you will see revenue of $3.9 billion, adjusted EBITDA $1.3 billion, so 8% and 10%, respectively, for those two metrics.","It is I would say four messages that we should deliver. The first is top and earnings or EBITDA are consistent with our long-term model of 8% and 10%. Also the fact that in this environment of new-new of what our good growth rates, we are running about four times real GDP growth rate from an organic perspective, which we feel is fairly attractive.","This does not include any assumptions about M&A or buybacks, those would be additive. And we did look at where the street was throwing out their numbers and it looks like we\u2019re very consistent on both revenue and EBITDA of 8% and 10%. So we feel comfortable there.","Also is the one area where we probably need to spend a little of time on is the earnings per share which right now we\u2019re putting down as 10% going from $8.60 to $9.50. I think what some folks need to do as they had a slightly higher number and again, we\u2019re not saying we won\u2019t gradually drift up there as the year unfolds, but it needs to factor in, the fact that the convert doesn\u2019t come off until August, and that the share price we are using is 143 bucks versus 132 for 2012.","So some folks may need to revisit their model in terms of their share count outstanding. I think some have taken a little bit off the number of shares and I think they may want to revisit that.","Needless to say, we feel that, probably the more important metric is that we would end the year at 62 million shares, which gets the noise out of there from that first convert, 62 million shares would put us at a run rate of $9.80, which I think is probably what people are thinking about.","So we get a little bit of swap below the line. We know the metrics themselves are very comfortable with what folks are anticipating of 8% and 10% top and EBITDA and then the earnings per share, again we\u2019ve got some timing issues, little bit of swap but once you get through the noise, you\u2019re looking at about 62 million shares, or about $9.80 run rate, and I think that\u2019s probably the key message here.","To sum up, we are providing a base case. We are providing as we always do what I call wiggle room. So that we have opportunity to make investments if for example there\u2019s another market we want to enter that may require some investments.","Second, as Charles mentioned, all day long we will trade-off short-term benefits on funding to lock down seven-year money at 2.5%, 3%. And if we could do that, we certainly would. And I think what we haven\u2019t factored in here is based on the trends that we\u2019re seeing even if we\u2019re not getting any help from credit quality or funding costs.","My guess is if you\u2019re going to see over performance in \u201813, it will most likely come primarily from other Private Label Group once again. So I guess, overall my guess is at this point with this base case, the earnings per share is that fairly conservatively and as the year lays out, you\u2019ll most likely see this drift up as is our tendency and has been our tendency over the past year.","So overall, we see a very strong 2013. If we can run the business at four times the growth rate of GDP, we\u2019d be very happy and get our EBITDA around 10% and then get our earnings drifting up probably back, profit of 13%. As the year plays out, I think that would be a very good year for us.","We would also based on almost $2 billion of liquidity at corporate, we are looking at M&A activity as always and most likely on a tuck-in basis, we\u2019re not looking at anything huge. And also we do feel that shares remain very attractive at these levels.","So that being said, I finally be quiet and will turn it over to Q&A. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from the line of Jim Kissane from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Jim Kissane - Credit Suisse","Ed, can you give us a sense on what\u2019s behind the temporary slow down at the large client. Why are you confident that business with this client will pick up over the next few quarters?","Ed Heffernan","Mean Epsilon.","Jim Kissane - Credit Suisse","At Epsilon, yeah.","Ed Heffernan","Yeah. It was more of -- we had a couple of air balls primarily in healthcare which is a big sector for us. The pharmaceutical specifically, we had a lot of stuff, the one-off patent, there was less marketing and what, we knew about it. And so what used to be an area growing double-digit basically went backwards. And so we needed to cover that off. And there was another very large client in the telecom space that for various reasons needed to cut expenses and therefore cut marketing dollars.","That all being said, I think, that\u2019s almost for $40 million which was the shortfall in the topline. We see that stabilizing but frankly we\u2019ve always had these little air pockets in the past and we\u2019ve always had some big wins that would make up for it and for whatever reason in the first part of this year, we didn\u2019t have them.","We just didn\u2019t sign them and obviously that was an area of concern. What we saw and you\u2019ll see releases coming out, I would say very shortly showing that the bounce back has been equally dramatic. So I don\u2019t know whether people just like to get me all stressed out in the first half of the year and chill me out in the back half.","But the wins in the pipeline, the big missing deals that we had in the first half are coming in the second half and that means 13 looks pretty good.","Jim Kissane - Credit Suisse","Great. And a question from Melisa, since we have you. You obviously have a great backlog with all the signings, can you give us the sense on the potential new business pipeline and maybe why erratic. Can you give us a sense in terms of your go-to market strategy and how you differentiate it relative to some of your large competitors? Thank you.","Melisa Miller","Sure, Jim. In terms of our pipeline, which we call our strategic stack, so it is, very plan full, very deliberate right now and filled with start-up, startovers and we call them earnaways, rather than takeaways. So it\u2019s really filled across all of our vertical specialty retail, how good some of the new areas that we\u2019ve been testing into.","But I do want to sort of mention that we were never really going to comprise on the standards that we have around, not chasing after every single shiny object, right. We want to do business with those partners that see us as a growth vehicle for their brand and maybe that\u2019s a good segue into really what sets us apart like we are first and foremost the marketing and loyalty company reported by banks secondarily.","So, it\u2019s really -- Ed has talked about previously its ability to leverage and use all of the data that we collect with all the data that our clients collect that helps us create real, meaningful insight that we can improve our wallet share, put more purchases on our card and then finally at the end of the day our clients currently are really seeing the value in incremental sales that we add to their business and they\u2019ve been terrific supporters and references for us as we explore those clients that may be seeking to leave their current provider.","As Ed has previously mentioned some of our prospects, I have a point of view and feel of it Bruce about how they are experienced whether during the great recession and so we hope to change that as we welcome them to our family. So in general, our pipeline for \u201813 is very, very strong. Our win strategy is the same and that we want to partner with companies that are very, very strong and committed to the program and we are really bullish on 2013.","Jim Kissane - Credit Suisse","That\u2019s outstanding. Thanks Melisa.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani from KBW. Your line is open.","Sanjay Sakhrani - KBW","You guys talked about the strong liquidity position and I was just wondering if Charles, maybe you could just walk us through, kind of, how that liquidity builds over the course of the next year or so. And then, what the uses could be? One of the issues, I think, I have heard you talk about is the warrants on the converts. Could you just talk about perhaps wanting to buy those back? Thank you.","Charles Horn","Sure. So Sanjay, could you look, where we are right now. We have $1.7 billion of liquidity. I\u2019ll ask fast forwarded on other 12 or 15 months, you\u2019re going to add $ 700 million plus. So let\u2019s say you\u2019re in the $2.4 billion to $2.5 billion of liquidity. What they gives is a very good ability to deploy an effective means.","So number one priority would be, is there a good tuck-in acquisition that makes sense that fits our strategy, maybe new vertical and new product offering. Number two, we\u2019d still have plenty of liquidity to address the warrants that make sense. We would like to cash, settle them if necessary.","Number three, if there is the ability to increase our ownership in our JVs that could makes sense, especially down in Brazil. Our number four, we have left over liquidity, we could pay down some debts but reality is with our leverage ratio being 2.1 x, that really, that\u2019s not a high priority for us.","So I think we have the ability to consummate all of the first three and still retain liquidity into our business and that\u2019s really the focus.","Ed Heffernan","Yeah. I think to Charles\u2019 point, if we were to look at, we had talked about building up the war chest which we feel we\u2019re done and it shows that if we\u2019ve got $2.5 billion of early available liquidity and because EBITDA is growing double-digit rate, ratios are dropping like stone.","I would say that we\u2019re going to see deployment of that liquidity would be exactly what Charles said, which is there are a couple of areas from a tuck-in perspective that we\u2019re looking at for $500 million type deal would be ideal for us. We\u2019re pretty good at those things. Also, we do feel that there may be an opportunity with the warrants to take some action on that front and again trying to split the use of liquidity between both providing a couple additional point of growth over and above organic, at the same time returning it to shareholders via some type of equity repurchase and based on, where I see the future going, we are certainly bullish on that. So, those would be the two areas that you are most likely going to see use of liquidity over the next 12 months.","Sanjay Sakhrani - KBW","Okay. And then second question is, I think, Ed, you have mentioned this throughout your speech. But I mean there is the cost that you are incurring for growing Private Label in 2013. So, the actual jump off amount is higher into 2014, am I thinking about that correct?","Ed Heffernan","Of the reserve sales?","Sanjay Sakhrani - KBW","Yes. So, I mean, it\u2019s could grow, you are building reserve that kind of having an adverse impact in 2013 and you will get the full benefit of the growth in 2014, right?","Ed Heffernan","Okay. Yeah. I mean sorry. Yeah. Actually, as you\u2019ll see whenever you\u2019re growing, as you know also well, especially when you\u2019re growing in hyper growth mode. You have to set aside reserves based on the growth rate and how much you\u2019re putting on in terms of they are, that does have a dampening effect for sure especially in Q4, albeit temporary but it does have a dampening effect on what flows due to the bottom line and that\u2019s what hyper growth does.","Now, the good news is, I guess, whenever it tends to moderate, hyper growth moderates, you\u2019re going to get the full flow through, which is fine. What we\u2019ve been able to do at this point is and I will turn it over to Charles, is that, our reserve rate, we believe is quite healthy and as a result, we think we are going to be in very good shape on that front.","Charles Horn","Exactly. So if you break it down what happen is this year, our reserve to basically stay stable year-over-year because our rate has been coming down. As we indicated for next year our rate will probably stay the same. So, if you have substantial growth in your ending AR then you are going to flip to reserve built. So your reserve will probably increase $40 million as much as $50 million next year.","Now, the key takeaways that reserve is based on your ending AR not your average AR which is where produces the income. So that\u2019s a timing effect this time you\u2019re just talking about it, we have rapid growth in your ending AR, your reserve is going to lead with the finance charge comes through and that would be into June \u201814. So, in this initial year of flipping to a steady rate with rapid growth, you are going to get a big one-time build and then you\u2019ll see it start coming to the numbers better in future years.","Sanjay Sakhrani - KBW","Got it. Perfect. And maybe just one last one from Melisa. I mean, when you guys are out there competing on these earn away deals. I mean, are you seeing a lot of competition out there, because it seems like we are getting entire mixed signals in terms of the some of the key players out there up?","And then just, on the charge-off guidance that you guys have for next year. I mean, are you guys being conservative there in assuming a big step up from where you are right now? Thanks.","Melisa Miller","Sanjay, with respect to competition, I\u2019ll tell you, from our perspective it is fierce in terms of activity, right. And I think there would be a bit of arrogant to assume that we won\u2019t have to work very, very hard to earn away some these current programs. And what we are finding just as we take a good deal or pride in our current programs, the legacy our current providers will invest it heavily in the current program. So, they will fight pretty hard to keep them.","What makes us unique though is there is no single provider like Alliance Data, where we can swing all of our data assets not just in retail but by leveraging what Epsilon brings to there as well. And so there is no one provider that is able to strength together personnel assets, data assets and the competencies that we have and that\u2019s really been winning strategy for us in the marketplace.","Our clients want to know that we are singularly focused on helping them build their business. So, we setoff and if our client simply want to approach us as an arbitrage on interchange we may not be that very best partner. Competition is fierce. However, we believe that there is no one company that can bring to bear all of the assets that we can.","And then in terms of charge-offs for next year. I don\u2019t know that we would tell you that we are being conservative, I think, Sanjay, we are being realistic in that overtime those charge-offs will pick up. We certainly are not doing anything reckless in terms of how we underwrite, in fact we continue to improve our tools. But overtime, I think we can expect that we\u2019ll get to pre-recession or closer to pre-recession rates.","Ed Heffernan","Yeah. I think to Melisa\u2019s point. If we can give guidance of very strong double-digit growth out of Melisa shop and that includes having charge-offs rates drift up and I guess passing up, short-term, funding advantages to locked down long-term, albeit more expensive fixed rate money and we are still doing solid double-digit.","I think that gives, should give everyone a lot of comfort, and to Melisa\u2019s point and as you know, Sanjay, we don\u2019t know when we are going to go from 5 to our long-term historical 6, 6.5, it maybe two, three years, I don\u2019t know.","Right now we\u2019re not seeing any indication, right, personal bankruptcies even look better. We are not seeing anything out there that suggests that there is any immediate drift upward. However, we are putting a plan together saying, let\u2019s get there, the old fashion way which is let\u2019s grow.","Sanjay Sakhrani - KBW","Perfect. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller from Barclays. Your line is open.","Darrin Peller - Barclays","Putting off on the Epsilon segment, you\u2019re calling for 7% revenue growth in Epsilon in \u201813 and that\u2019s probably on easier year-over-year comps. As far as we head into 2013 versus 2012, so can you give us a sense for what you see the segment doing very longer, just longer-term. I mean is this a segment that should grow at some point again a high, just called 10% range or what is the long-term growth propel really of this segment?","And then also can we expect margins in the segment to remain sustainably at these stronger levels, I know reshuffle something last couple of quarters, but can they stay this high as you roll on the new pipeline you\u2019ve talked about going forward?","Ed Heffernan","Yes. So great questions. I think, by itself and based on the pipeline and based on the history of Epsilon. I think if you are looking at 7%, 8% organic top and 8% to 9% EBITDA. I think we would say we are comfortable, certainly comfortable using that as a long-term model for Epsilon.","The one wildcard in there is that that would assume that Epsilon functions the way it has function for years, which is we win a database deal, we win a digital agency deal, we win a data deal, we win an analytical deal. And a lot of them involve one or two pieces of Epsilon and not all five.","If in fact, the new organizational structure we put in place this year turned into what we believe the vision is, which is the Chief Marketing Officer\u2019s and the Chief Technology Officer\u2019s out there are in fact looking for one throat to choke. They are going to look for partner that can basically offer everything.","And so that changes deals from $5 million wins to $30 million annual wins. And if we are the go to and we are the only ones out there in the marketplace that cover this everything from they creative all the way through distribution. If we are successful over the next few years of becoming that one go to party to handle all the digital and direct marketing expenditures from the CMO\u2019s then you are going to see a very significant increase in the growth rates of Epsilon.","We are not comfortable tossing that out at this point because we are just really starting it. But if you start seeing deals begin to flow out in RPR releases saying, we are going to be doing everything from creative to data to database distribution then you know we are on the right track.","So it\u2019s still early in the process. We are betting the whole bunch on. There is that next leg of growth available if it comes through, and right now we are going to stick with sort of the traditional organic growth that we\u2019ve seen. And as we become the one throat to choke, hopefully that will drift up in the coming years.","Charles Horn","And Darrin, I think from an EBITDA margin standpoint you get to keep a couple of things in mind. One is the base business that Epsilon has been steadily growing its EBITDA margins. But as we onboard these new acquisitions, it has little bit of a dampening effect.","The second you have to keep in mind is that there\u2019s seasonality involved. We tend to be a little bit weaker Q1, Q2 with strength in Q3, Q4. So when you look at the Q3, 27% of the EBITDA margins, don\u2019t expect that to continue straight line into the first and second quarter of next year.","Having said that, we are still looking for about 150 basis point increase in mid-25 range next year, and I that think over time, the ability to get it back up 26%, 27%, 28% is there. The timing will be driven by the on boarding of acquisitions. If we continue the tuck-ins and then the leverage that we expect to get as we fully integrate them.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital","All right. That\u2019s helpful. Just Ed, just a follow-up quickly on the grow targets. So Ed, when you saying long-term you are seeing something potentially better. The 7% number you gave for \u201813, that\u2019s still does really. That\u2019s still really found in just when you are seeing your car in pipeline, but not expecting all these big expansions to more holistic offerings right now. Is that right?","Ed Heffernan","That is correct.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital","Okay. All right. Thanks. Just a question on our overall guidance now for \u201813. If you look at your 10% growth in core earnings for \u201813, your business segment guidance alone is roughly about 9% when you put them all, all three pieces together. It just seems that that it gives very little of any attribution to the much lower funding costs in the year. I think we are trending around 20 or 30 basis points better in \u201813 and \u201812 given what you\u2019ve done from a refis standpoint.","And while you are saying, I know you are saying the dollar amount of the reserve may increase because the portfolio size has grown so much and I think you said $40 million, Charles. But when you compare that to more than to the roughly, I think it\u2019s about a $1 billion of receivables growth through 2000 - in 2013 versus \u201812 as well as the fact that I think the ratios should come pretty materially given how consistent and strong delinquencies are or credit\u2019s spend over the past year and really seem to continue to be. Shouldn\u2019t that alone those two variable alone get you materially above just 10% core earnings growth?","Ed Heffernan","I have two\u2026","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital","I know you are generally conservative, but go ahead.","Charles Horn","Number one, obviously as Ed talked about before, we always like to keep a little flexibility within our guidance. Number two and this is the key takeaway, when you saw addressing in our press release. When you onboard a new program, generally it is our performance as well as what our program does that for two to three years under our operation.","Number two, you get the dampening effect or basically the accounting for the acquired program as well. So what that does as you saw in Q3, where you saw the gross yields drop a little bit. If we continue to grow at these higher rates, during the short-term you are going to see depression or some dampening on the gross yield. And so that\u2019s part of the issue.","Now the flip side of it is, again I\u2019ll go back to the reserve build. If my ending AR is $500 million higher than my average AR, my yield comes off average, my reserve comes of ending. So if I\u2019m not getting an improvement in that charge-off rate then we are going to have a stable reserve rate. And basically my provision is leading my future revenue stream from that growth. So those are the key takeaways that you should stick in your model in evaluating 2013.","Ed Heffernan","Yeah. I think, Darrin, your point is well taken. It\u2019s October and we\u2019ll probably have a few more refinements in January. And as you correctly pointed out, we like to offer something that you can take to the bank and then let\u2019s see how things play out during the year. And if it\u2019s another year like this year, hopefully there will be more good news to bleed out as the year progresses.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital","Okay. Great, guys. Thanks a lot.","Ed Heffernan","Okay.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Dan Perlin from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Dan Perlin - RBC Capital Markets","Thanks, guys. So, I have maybe a bit of a more strategic question for you guys. How do you balance the opportunity that you see in front of you, for these opportunistic private-label portfolios that might come into, might come into review this year given how your liquidity. Despite the fact that that has become a meaningful, a larger growing part of the business but also has a lot of visibility going into the next couple of years as others have pointed out versus opportunities that are going to come into and what has been an underperforming unit in Epsilon.","So, I\u2019m just trying to reconcile how we should be thinking about this capital redeployment. I know you talked about tuck-ins at $400 to $500 million, but with $2.5 billion you clearly have more than that this year then you had less liquidity, starting I think last year. So, I don\u2019t want to go through the uses of cash but I do want to kind of understand, how you\u2019re thinking of balancing redeployment of that in areas that are more visible versus less visible. Thanks.","Ed Heffernan","Yeah. No, it\u2019s a great question. It\u2019s very simple. People ask us all the time as you know, Dan, that\u2019s going back many, many years of how big should Private Label be versus the other two. And frankly, we\u2019re at the point as we\u2019ve always been of - we\u2019re not shy to take advantage of opportunities in the marketplace, and right now this is a golden time for us in Private Label for a number of reasons.","And I\u2019ll just stick to the non-controversial one, which is everyone knows data is what it\u2019s all about, and retailers are discovering after all this time that having a closed look network with skew level information is hey, that\u2019s pretty good idea. So we\u2019re getting a lot of interest there and that is helping to drive along with Melisa\u2019s sales programs much larger wallet share gains that existing clients. The more I guess you would say politically sensitive side of it is that there are number of potential clients who are very unhappy with where they are today, whether it\u2019s in-house or with someone else and we certainly are going to bend over backwards to welcome them into our family. And so we think this is a fairly unique opportunity for us, which is a 2012, 2013 and probably a 2014 opportunity and we are going to take full advantage of it.","And that means that Private Label will continue to grow above historic norms over the next two, three years and that throws up an awful lot of cash and liquidity. Against that of course, we are seeing Brazil, which will be huge as it continues to school up as Private Label will eventually start moderating, let\u2019s say two, three years from now. Well before then you\u2019ll see Brazil kick in very significantly, let\u2019s say in \u201814 and so that\u2019ll start balancing the ship the other way.","And from an M&A perspective, there are a couple of slots and Epsilon where we can certainly see a couple of tuck-ins that will help also rebalance the ships. So overall that combine, if you look at Brazil, if you look at let say two tuck-ins of $0.5 billion or so in Epsilon over the next couple of years, the growth in both of those businesses and then some liquidity being returned to shareholders. If you look at all those pieces combined with sort of this unique trend in Private Label, what I think you\u2019ll find is we can maintain a pretty decent balance, it just will be a little bit heavier around the Private Label side for the next 18 months.","Dan Perlin - RBC Capital Markets","Okay. So why I\u2019m hearing this to make sure I get that, there is nothing so big out that is transformative, even if there are some possible deals out there that could follow that camp. But its not that your strategy is going to be more consistent tuck-in as you said old school growth and not likely to go down the path of these -- and figure what we sad earlier deep shiny objects that you need to chase that are much, much bigger in scope but you could certainly afford. It doesn\u2019t sound like that\u2019s what you are going after. Okay?","Ed Heffernan","Yeah. Never say never but the [Uber] deal, I would think is -- look we we\u2019ve been around the block enough times that those are tough to do and get right. We\u2019re pretty darn good with the tuck-ins.","Dan Perlin - RBC Capital Markets","Yeah. Can I just ask Charles the quick question on what he views as the triggers to ultimately get Brazil beyond that kind of 50% ownership so you can kind of bring it back in that we could certainly see that first hand?","Charles Horn","I wouldn\u2019t say there are any triggers.","Dan Perlin - RBC Capital Markets","Okay.","Charles Horn","You will be able to see on our one-off negotiation basis over time to get to majority ownership.","Dan Perlin - RBC Capital Markets","Okay. So there is nothing that occurring say, in that Brazilian family right now that we call the trigger.","Charles Horn","No. I\u2019d stay with what I said which is there will be one-off negotiation that if the opportunity presents itself, we will take advantage of it.","Dan Perlin - RBC Capital Markets","Okay. And there is one little onset if I could ask. You mentioned in AIR MILES the timing of the rollout is going to be dictated by the point of sale programming changes. Is that just a, kind of, inoculate statement that you\u2019ve turned out or is there actually something that we need to be aware of at the point of sale. Thanks. I\u2019ll stop now.","Charles Horn","No, it\u2019s just matter of some of the big retailers that could utilize the program have to modify their POS which can take time. And so it\u2019s not necessarily within our control. I think the sponsors wanted, the collectors wanted. It\u2019s a matter of somewhat substantial programming changes that need to be made.","Dan Perlin - RBC Capital Markets","Excellent. Thanks guys.","Ed Heffernan","Okay. I think we\u2019ll probably stop it there and I know everyone has got jobs to do. So we\u2019re excited as you can tell and hopefully everyone else as well. So we\u2019ll talk to you next time. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for your participation.

(Operator Instructions) In order to view the company\u2019s presentation on their website, please remember to turn off the pop-up blocker on your computer.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host Ms. Julie Prozeller, of FTI Consulting. Ma\u2019am the floor is yours.","Ms. Julie Prozeller","Thank you, operator. By now you should have received a copy of the Company's fourth quarter and year-end 2011 earnings release. If you haven\u2019t, please call FTI Consulting at 212-850-5721. On the call today we have Ed Heffernan, President and Chief Executive Officer and Charles Horn, Chief Financial Officer of Alliance Data.","Before we begin, I\u2019d like to remind you that some of the comments made on today's call and some of the responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risks and the uncertainties described in the Company\u2019s earnings release and other filings with the SEC.

Ed?","Ed Heffernan","Thanks, Julie, and welcome. We are aware it is earnings season and everyone is pressed for time, so we will be respectful of your time. This morning and also hopefully we give everyone a very good start to the day as we talk about our record 2011 earnings, which came in nicely ahead of our expectations and also drove our decision to come out of the gate raising 2012 numbers. It does look like its going to be a superb year in 2012 thus far.","With that being said, let\u2019s get right at it. I will turn it over to Charles Horn, our CFO. He just finished his cup of coffee and he is ready to go.","Charles Horn","Thanks, Ed. It was a great quarter to end another record year. We will start by looking at the fourth quarter.","Our revenue increased 12%, to $848 million. Our EPS increased 33% to $1.12 per share. A very meaningful core EPS number increased 9% to a $1.70, beating the company\u2019s guidance of a $1.46. If we exclude the year-over-year build in phantom shares, which you see on the slide. Our core EPS increased 17% year-over-year. And Adjusted EBITDA, net of funding costs increased 21% to $194 million.","You routinely hear us talk about phantom shares, and many of you asked why do we point them out? The simple answer is because we never have to economically settle them. They come into our share count due to accounting reasons, but nothing else. So if you look at the slides, you can see our phantom shares added 4 million and 2. 8 million shares respectively to our diluted share count for the fourth quarter and full year 2011. As a result, it create a drag on core EPS of $0.12 for the fourth quarter and $0.39 for the full year 2011.","Summarizing for the year, we achieved double-digit growth in our numbers. Revenue up 14%, EPS of 57%, Adjusted EBITDA, net of our funding cost up 35% and core EPS up 30%, a remarkable year.","Let\u2019s flip to the next page and talk about LoyaltyOne. LoyaltyOne came in consistent with our expectations for the quarter as we had anticipated an unfavorable exchange rate environment and lower collector redemptions as a result of active program management.","For the quarter, revenue was down $10 million or 4% due to $2 million negative impact from exchange rates and a $9 million decrease in redemption revenue. The decrease in redemption revenue was due to a conscious effort by management to pull back the burn rate compared to the fourth quarter of 2010.","Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was consistent with the fourth quarter of 2010. Unfavorable exchange rates lowered adjusted EBITDA by approximately $500,000, while incremental costs associated with the expansion of the Dotz coalition program in Brazil with a $2 million drive to the quarter. Excluding these items, adjusted EBITDA was up 6% for the fourth quarter of 2011.","The key metric for AIR MILES. AIR MILES issued increased 10% for the quarter, the highest percentage increase of 2011 and the highest since the third quarter of 2008. This large increase shows that both collectors and sponsors remained highly engaged in the AIR MILES program. It also drives immediate cash flow and positions us for strong revenue growth in 2012 and beyond.","As discussed before, we continue to roll out the Dotz loyalty platform in Brazil. Enrollment in the program continues to exceed our expectations as we ended 2011 with over 1.6 million collectors. We estimate that this number will grow to over 3.5 million collectors by the end of 2012.","During the fourth quarter we announced a program enhancement for AIR MILES, the addition of an instant rewards option. Collectors in the AIR MILES program, beginning in the first quarter of 2012 will have the ability to allocate some or all of their AIR MILES collected into this option. It will provide collectors with an instant liquidity at the point of sale with participating sponsors. Both the sponsors and collectors have been asking for this enhancement and we delivered.","We anticipate that AIR MILES earned under this option will have a shorter life, perhaps the shortest 12 months, with only a nominal number going unredeemed. Profitability to LoyaltyOne for this option will be from the pricing of the redemptions or gross margins rather than the more traditional breakage.","Let\u2019s turn to the next page. At the same time we announced that all existing and future AIR MILES reward miles will have a date stamp of five years. This is a common industry practice. The implementation has no immediate accounting impact to LoyaltyOne, rather it just expires miles already considered dead for accounting purposes. All this does is crystallize the breakage rate over the next several years.","As we\u2019ve talked about in the past, management routinely pulls leverage to keep the AIR MILES program tracking to a 72% ultimate redemption rate. As you can see on the chart, aside from 2010 which was somewhat of an anomaly, our burn rate has been below or at the ultimate redemption rate. As of December 31, 2011, 59.9% of all miles issued since inception of the program have been redeemed. As expected, the upward trend in the key miles redemption rate is flattening.","Let\u2019s flip to the next page and talk about Epsilon. Epsilon had another excellent quarter with revenue up 42% and adjusted EBITDA of 29% compared to the fourth quarter of 2010. Excluding the acquisition of Aspen, revenue and adjusted EBITDA increased 4% and 13% respectively for the quarter. Data digital revenue increased 11% compared to the fourth quarter of 2010 continuing the long trend of double-digit organic growth. A robust backlog and pipeline should continue this double-digit growth into 2012 and beyond.","Data revenue was up 1% compared to the fourth quarter of 2010. Softness continued in the consumer demographic portion as consumers pull back on prospecting volumes. On a positive note, Abacus which is our cooperative catalog division showed improvement with revenue up 3% in the fourth quarter. This compares to flat year-over-year growth in the third quarter of 2011. We expect some softness in data to continue into 2012, with revenue growth expected to be in the low single-digits.","Our agency analytics had a strong quarter, benefited by the Aspen acquisition in the second quarter of 2011. Aspen continues to exceed our expectations and provide depth to our pipeline for 2012. Adjusted EBITDA margins for 2011 were down 170 basis points compared to 2010, due to the Aspen acquisition. As you can see on the chart, excluding Aspen, adjusted EBITDA margins increased 40 basis points compared to 2010, reflecting the operating leverage in the Epsilon business model.","As we\u2019ve talked about for several quarters, Aspen carries a lower adjusted EBITDA margin than the rest of Epsilon, even with expected cost synergies that will likely continue into the future. The addition of Aspen, however, greatly augments our Epsilon offering. One; it completed our end-to-end marketing solution. Two; it opened up new previously untapped verticals, and three; it provided tremendous cross-sell, up-sell opportunities. The prospect for revenue synergies is expected to drive EBITDA margin expansion for Epsilon in the future.","Let\u2019s split to the next page. You routinely hear us talk about the end-to-end marketing solutions, so what we\u2019ve done is we provided you an example here. For example, when Citi decided to launch the premier Loyalty Program, Citi ThankYou in 2004, they turned to Epsilon to design, build and host the core platform. Over the last seven years, Epsilon has extended from that platform to among many things, deploy and manage a multi-channel marketing communication platform, to manage Citi\u2019s outbound permission-based email marketing campaigns, and recently to assist Citi\u2019s innovative move into social media with the launch of the Citi ThankYou Facebook application.","Epsilon\u2019s role was to build the Facebook app, pulling together creative, technology development, analytic and data management services and to integrate the app back into the core loyalty program. This is how it works. ThankYou members are invited via Epsilon\u2019s email platform to download the Facebook app. Members invite other Facebook friends to pool Citi ThankYou points across their personnel social network. This point pooling approach enables consumers to use the groups aggregated points to earn rewards at an accelerated phase because the app is resident on a members Facebook page. Epsilon has helped Citi to extend its brand presence into the member\u2019s personal social network.","Clients like Citi are enhancing their customer brand experiences by taking advantage of Epsilon\u2019s intense solutions and extending the use of data, technology and customer insight into new channels and customer applications. We continue to see strong growth prospects for the business with these innovations and with the added service capabilities that Aspen brings to the table.","Let\u2019s flip to the next page and talk about Private Label. Private Label finished 2011 strong with revenue up 7% and adjusted EBITDA net of all funding cost up 33% compared to the fourth quarter 2010, an excellent quarter to conclude a record year. Perhaps equally as important was the positive momentum generated during the quarter which you\u2019ve seen in four primary areas.","The first is receivables growth. The long wait is over, as growth materialized during the quarter. Average credit card receivables increased 3% compared to the fourth quarter of 2010, while ending credit card receivables increased 6% from December 31, 2010 setting the stage for strong growth in 2012.","The second is card holder spending. Credit sales accelerated each quarter as 2011 progressed, up 5% in Q1, 9% in Q2, 10% in Q3 and 13% in Q4. Card holders continue to be actively engaged and appear to be feeling better about their personal situations.","The third is portfolio quality. Entering 2011, the management expected improvement in credit quality. This improvement happened somewhat quicker than what we had anticipated and looks to be continuing into 2012. For the fourth quarter of 2011, the principal charge-off rate was 6.3% down 260 basis points from last year. This compares to a 200 basis point improvement for full-year 2011.","The fourth item I\u2019ll talk about here is funding cost. Funding cost improved steadily during 2011, concluding with the placement of term ADS in the fourth quarter at the lowest all-in pricing in the history of ADS. Our cash funding raised for all card related borrowings, which excludes non-cash items with 3.3% in 2011, 30 basis points better than 2010. A similar improvement is expected for 2012.","The last item I\u2019ll talk about is new program growth. Our target entering 2011 was five new Private Label programs, broken down three start-up programs and two existing programs with miles attached. We exceeded that target signing seven new programs during 2011, four of which had miles attached. These signings had only nominal benefits in 2011 as the two largest files, Pier 1and Bon-Ton are expected to be in 2012 closings. The addition of these two files or portfolios is expected to boost year-over-year receivables growth to the mid teens for 2012. The outlook for 2012 for Private Label is solid, receivables growth coupled with declining loss rates and cheaper funding rates should lead to higher profits.","Let\u2019s flip to the next page and we\u2019ll give you a quick update on liquidity. At the corporate level we ended 2011 with a robust $600 million of liquidity at the corporate level. Entering 2012 we plan to be opportunistic and raise additional liquidity as market conditions permit. Essentially, we\u2019ll look to increase our dry powder by terming our borrowing under our existing revolving credit facility.","Our net corporate debt was $1.97 billion at year-end, a very moderate amount given that it equates to approximately 2X, adjusted EBITDA and only slightly more than 3X, our expected 2012 projected free cash flow. At the bank level we have approximately $2.2 billion of available liquidity at December 31, 2011.","We issued $350 million of public fixed-rate, term asset backed securities during the fourth quarter of 2011 with an average loss of approximately 3.6 years and a weighted average fixed rate coupon of just under 2%. We will look to increase the amount of term ABS placements in 2012 in order to lock in long-term low cost funding.","Regulatory ratios at our banks remains strong. WFNB capital ratios were 15% for Tier-1, 14% for leverage and 16% for total risk base at December 31, 2011. This compares to well capitalized minimums of 6% for Tier-1, 5% for leverage and 10% for total risk base. Due to these robust capital ratio\u2019s our banks [dividended] $55 million to ADS during the fourth quarter.","The last thing I\u2019ll talk about here is the share repurchase program, and it continues to be one of our anchor strategies. During 2011, we acquired 2.9 million shares for aggregate consideration of $241 million. During the fourth quarter we announced a new $400 million repurchase program for 2012.","I will now turn it over to Ed, to walk you through our updated outlook for 2012. Ed.","Ed Heffernan","Great. Thanks, Charles. I\u2019m on the slide, 2012 trends and expectations and I think it would be helpful if we step back just for a second and talk about the assumptions inherent in these expectations. First, sort of a general couple of statements on the overall macro environment. I don\u2019t think its anything stretching, but its essentially saying that we expect continued tepid growth in the macro economy, call it 2% real GDP. We do expect modest job creation. However, not enough to really make a dent in the elevated unemployment level and we expect the continuation of low interest rates. So, those are sort of the assumptions underpinning our expectations for the year. They seem fairly reasonable from what we\u2019re seeing out there.","And then, more specifically, let\u2019s talk about our sandbox. In our sandbox we\u2019re really focused on the $400 billion of annual spend in the marketing space that has continued it\u2019s long-term shift towards direct data-intensive targeted marketing in a way from sort of the general marketing that characterize the industry a couple of decades ago.","And the important thing here is the market is in fact growing in these direct data-intensive channels. And in fact, the aspects in which we compete the organic growth rate in these markets itself is about 7% growth. So, it\u2019s a very, very attractive market. As we all know, it\u2019s a lot easier to grow when the overall market is growing. So, we\u2019ve \u2013 we focused our energy on this space, this subsection of the $400 billion that is in fact growing very nicely. And it\u2019s important because it does cover all three of ADS\u2019s businesses. So whether it\u2019s a one-off type program like a Hilton-honors over at Epsilon or a large coalition program as in Canada or a one-off loyalty program in the private -- with the credit component in private label, all three of the businesses are driven by ultimately getting at the data from the consumer and then using that information to help micro target to those existing consumers or to acquire new consumers. So, bottom-line is we believe the market itself is growing quite a bit faster than the overall GDP.","Specifically, if we look at the divisions, you\u2019ve Epsilon, which came out of nowhere a few years ago and is on Phase II, top of billion dollars in revenues this year, which will certainly be a great milestone. We expect strong double-digit revenue and EBITDA growth to continue.","We do expect that most of our efforts will be on further integrating the different parts of Epsilon and to put it in perspective we started the process of creating the overall Epsilon model back in 2004. So, it\u2019s been a seven-year process, and the idea was to essentially replicate what we\u2019ve in the other two businesses, which is a one stop end-to-end solution catering to large corporations.","And over the past year, we completed that with the addition of Aspen, providing big footprint in the digital agency space. And so, now, we\u2019ve really the only global full service end-to-end business that can provide everything from the creative or agency. We\u2019ve an enormous amount of data of demographic and psychographic that can of course turn through the database produced very fancy analytics and help our client\u2019s target on a micro basis, many, many segments of their consumer-base or for customer acquisition.","So, you put that all together, that\u2019s why I call that\u2019s a little mousetrap you got there, but it\u2019s also important that you\u2019ve the right distribution channels as well, not every distribution channel works effectively with one person over another. And so, as exciting as everyone in the digital world is about all the different channels there, let\u2019s not loose focus of the fact that for the Global 1000 it\u2019s also important to have a very strong presence in the traditional world.","So, what we\u2019ve done is we\u2019ve also put together the complete distribution channel, everything from your more traditional point of sale and direct mail approach to your sort of beginning digital offering, which is permission-based e-mail. We did 40 billion permission-based e-mails over the past year, another record, but also increasingly getting into mobile display and as Charles talked about new initiatives in the social space.","So, the idea of having the information as well as having all the distribution channels is extremely attractive to the Chief Marketing Officers of the Global 1000 as I call it, we like to serve as the \u201cone throat to choke\u201d and that\u2019s our job.","That being said, with the build-out of Epsilon now complete, M&A is not a major emphasis for 2012. We\u2019ll of course be opportunistic if something comes along, but right now, we believe we got the machine built. And so, the focus is very simple. It\u2019s to continue to drive double-digit growth. And second, and this is also critical, is we want to make sure that when we\u2019re dealing with the Global 1000 that they view Epsilon not as just a provider of digital agency or analytics or distribution or data, but they view Epsilon as the place to go to handle their entire needs when it comes to this targeted marketing.","And so, much time and effort will be spend on integrating all the different parts of Epsilon in the sales team to make sure that we\u2019re selling no longer a $3 million or $5 million contract, but a $40 million or $50 million contract and that\u2019s the ultimate goal, very similar to the other two parts of the business where it\u2019s all or nothing with our clients.","So, stay tuned, we\u2019ll get some pretty neat things in the pipeline. And let\u2019s not forget the other two areas as we move to the next page, Charles talked at length about LoyaltyOne. Obviously, the bulk of that is our AIR MILES business in Canada. We\u2019re very, very pleased that the key metric, which is, if you want to call it, miles issued, points issued, whatever it is, it\u2019s when a consumer spend some money and generates some miles of points. Well, that had been stalled, if -- for lack of a better word, for about three years and that came roaring back last year as the team did a wonderful job of driving incremental sales growth as well as getting additional commitments from existing sponsors and having a very successful year bringing on new sponsors especially in the retail vertical.","So, that key metric was up very nicely and we expect that to continue in 2012. We\u2019re looking for 5%, 6% type issuance growth for 2012 and revenue tends to follow that over a long period of time.","So, we expect revenue and adjusted EBITDA to be -- again, it\u2019s a 100% organic, tracking up in the mid single-digits. The trends look favorable. What we\u2019re seeing is the growth behind it really is coming from three areas. One is, new sponsors, we\u2019re getting additional successes in the retail vertical, which you\u2019ll see. Again, we also are seeing a bounce back in some of the non-discretionary spend as well as discretionary spend on the credit cards, that are up there with Bank of Montreal and American Express. And then also the new offerings, we talked about the launch of the AIR MILES cash option, which gives a number of our collectors, what they\u2019ve been asking for quite sometime. So, I think you put all that together we should have a pretty good year in Canada.","Also needless to say, we are pretty excited about how the Brazilian venture is progressing. We did take a go-slow approach to sort of test the waters a couple of years ago. In last year, in 2011, we rolled it out to a couple of the regions and what we found was the acceptance rate was quite a bit better than we had anticipated. It seems like timing is half of it, say and the timing seems to be right for Brazil. And as a result we\u2019ve made the decision and it\u2019s reflected in our guidance that we will use a bit more of some of what we expect is over performance in 2012 in order to fund the roll out of additional regions in Brazil.","So rather than an additional two regions we are looking to double that and roll an additional four regions in 2012. We had a million six folks enrolled by the end of 2011. We would be disappointed if we came in less than 4 million by the end of 2012 and to put it in perspective, Canada, which has been around for 20 years the AIR MILES program has a total of 15 million. So you can get a sense of how quickly this thing is ramping up. Obviously we will need more than 15 million eventually to replicate the size of Canada because of the demographics are a bit different, but needless to say that\u2019s going to be our critical metric that we will share with you over the next several years as this thing spool up.","Okay, finally private label. No other way to say it \u2013 this year is going to be characterized to the good in the sense of it is a return to the very basics, old school growth. And that means we are not looking for driving big numbers from funding, from credit quality improvements, from op improvements, from yield enhancements or any of that stuff. Yes, they \u2013 many of those will contribute to better earnings, but behind it all really after quite some time of relatively stagnant file growth, we\u2019re now seeing finally very, very strong acceleration in both credit sales, people using the card and portfolio growth. January is no different, we are \u2013 I think we are seeing somewhere around mid-teens credit sales growth in January.","So folks are spending and that will drive high single digit growth in the portfolio that we\u2019re seeing in January that will continue as we bring online as Charles said some of the new signings from last year, which was year of record signings that will bring on additional growth as the year progresses. As you roll in the Pier 1s, the Marathon Oils, J.Jill, Petland, Cycle, Christopher & Banks, all signings from last year you\u2019re going to get that growth rate into the double digits and the portfolio which is a number we haven\u2019t seen in quite some time. So it does look like everything is heading in the right direction. What is also pleasing is that the 2012 pipeline looks equally robust.","Obviously, there has been some chatter out there about the Bon-Ton deal. Again, we can\u2019t say too much until everything is signed, sealed and delivered, but we certainly think that this could be a major, major win for the company.","So I think with the signings spooling up from last year the comfort that consumers seem to have in finally loosening up and spending some money as well as what we\u2019re seeing with additional opportunities this year. I\u2019d expect the growth rates of both credit sales in the portfolio to be quite impressive.","Not to take away from the fact that there are things also driving increased earnings within private label and that would be of course we are continuing to see credit quality improve. A lot of folks have thought that 2012 was the end of all the improvements and that maybe the case of the big bank cards, I don\u2019t know. We do have a longer tail than the bank card world, and as a result we are absolutely seeing continued improvement in credit quality. We expect at least 70 basis points that are credit quality than we had in 2011, and we are certainly tracking to that. So that\u2019s good news.","And then finally on the funding rate side, we do continue to see the benefits of record low yield curve. One of the things we talked about using some over performance dollars to drive an accelerated rollout in Brazil. One of the other things we are toying with now is, is this the time to go out on the yield curve and lock down longer term fixed rate funding obviously paying up a little bit for that. But again, you\u2019re providing much more visibility into your future earnings stream, and using a little bit of over performance for that as well. So people who have known us for years know that we tend to do this and look for that for this year as well.","Finally on a consolidated level, next page, yes record 2011. We expect a record 2012. What I like to see of course is that what we are seeing, which is all businesses are expected to contribute solid growth. So in the past we have had usually two out of the three engines cycle up and that usually is fine. We are actually seeing all three cycling up nicely for 2012 and we expect core earnings, core EPS, EPS and other metrics that have double-digit growth, we actually expect our free cash flow to be up almost 20%.","To stave off the obvious question of where all the cash is headed, we talked about M&A and right now that is a low priority for us primarily because all three of our businesses are built out. And so we are focused \u2013 almost we are focused exclusively on organic growth. And while we want to drive the core businesses we also have each business has its own sort of additional growth avenue for LoyaltyOne. It\u2019s the Brazilian ramp up for our private label group. It\u2019s signing new clients, but at the same time let\u2019s see if we can make some hay out of a lot of the confusion out there in the banking world and pick up a couple of files of some good names.","And then also add Epsilon, we talked about converting the discussion away from, hey, let\u2019s be database and data and really make it a one stop shop and one throat to choke for the chief marketing officers of the Global 1000, so all of that is sort of organic growth.","And so then we turn to share buyback, Charles mentioned that we have 400 million authorized for 12. We will be opportunistic in our buying. If you were to go back we have spend $2.32 billion at an average price of 52 bucks and have taken down 40% of our outstanding shares. Obviously, that was probably a decent move. It\u2019s not quite as much of a [gaining] at these levels, but there is certainly still an appetite at the company, especially to the point that there is an opportunistic chance to get in there. So, that\u2019s around, and we expect to use some cash for that.","And then, finally, our leverage is still very moderate. We\u2019re only little over two times debt, and again, I can recall when we went public 10 years ago, we were at six times. So, to us, two times is nothing. However, it looks like, given our priorities this year we\u2019ll have fairly extensive free cash flow to pay down some of the debt that\u2019s outstanding.","And what are we going to do? What we think we\u2019re going to do at this point is, we made our contrarian plays over the last few years. As we talked about, we bought the bulk of our shares at the bottom, and I think that was a pretty good move. Again, it\u2019s less of a [gaining] at these levels. We took advantage of a lot of the negative, I guess, the negative vibes over the market in the past few years and we stepped in and spend our money on M&A, and also that\u2019s now fully built out.","So, we made our two big contrarian moves at that point. We also grew private label right during the great recession. So, we had three big contrarian plays over the past few years. I think those benefits will continue for many years, but the opportunity to do more has lessened quite a bit.","So, right now, perhaps \u2013 it is the time where we step back for a little bit, and start rebuilding the war chest for the next big run. And as a result, Charles has been charged with utilizing not only our free cash flow, but also to get out there and identify additional funding facilities, such that, our corporate liquidity can move very nicely from $600 million to $1.5 billion to $2 billion over the next couple of years. And we\u2019ll be cautious and we\u2019ll be willing to wait for the right opportunity to come along. It could come along this year or next year or the year after. We know we\u2019ll be there, but we certainly don\u2019t to chase it.","So, that\u2019s pretty much it from that perspective. The bottom-line is \u201912 looks good. We expect record year of double-digit growth, double-digit per share growth. We should also mention it\u2019s artificially dampened by the Phantom shares, which we\u2019ll finish up on the next page.","With all the businesses running strong, we\u2019re going to be focusing on really building up a nice war chest for the next run because there will be something that pops up in the next two, three years, it\u2019s going to get us pretty excited again.","All that being said, we\u2019re going to start-off the year by raising guidance. And as we turn to, I believe the last page, which is raising guidance, you\u2019ll see that across the board we\u2019ve increased our core EPS from 830 to $8.45. Our free cash flow, which is really what\u2019s left in our pocket at the end of each year after CapEx, regulatory capital, interest payments, taxes etcetera is increasing roughly 20% to $600 million, which is roughly about 9% free cash flow yield, taking up the Phantom shares it\u2019s more of a 10% plus free cash flow yield. So, it\u2019s fairly robust, and there are no big CapEx projects floating around that should dampen that.","Finally, Charles talked at late about Phantom shares and yes, this troublesome operation does cause some issues when trying to explain it to the marketplace. The short answer is, those shares go away, when our converts mature, and so to put it in perspective if you were to look at 2011 and we reported $7.63, had those shares \u2013 those converts matured and those shares went away, we\u2019d have reported it about 829, so, about a $0.66 benefit from eliminating the Phantom shares.","In \u201912, it\u2019s bigger. We\u2019re guiding to 845 without the Phantom shares, it\u2019s more or like $9.55, which is about a 15% year-over-year growth on an apples-to-apples basis.","So, bottom-line is these Phantom shares depress our reported earnings about a buck 10 this year. And the good news is these dampened earnings do drop-off in the latter part of 2013.","And then, finally in 2014 with a 100% of the benefit in 2015. So, it\u2019s a little bit of a pain to talk about it and frankly, I haven\u2019t quite figured out the accounting on it, but that\u2019s why we\u2019ve Charles. The good news is that we\u2019re growing pretty strongly even with the Phantom shares and once they drop-off you\u2019re going to see a very nice pop.","So, that being said, why don\u2019t we turn to Q&A?","Question-And-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Jim Kissane with Credit Suisse.","James Kissane - Credit Suisse Securities","Thanks guys, and great job. Charles, can you sketch out the P&L impact from the AIR MILES cash or instant redemptions and maybe some of the expectation around what portion of the AIR MILES will be instantly redeemed versus collected or saved for future use? Just trying to get a sense of what the future redemption rates will be an impact on the P&L? Thanks.","Charles Horn","You know, Jim at this point we really don\u2019t know how much will transition into this new instant reward option, my guess would be over the next five years it could be as much as 40% of points issued goes into it. The difference is with the instant reward option, it\u2019s not going to be more profitable, the EBITDA percentage will be about the same. But what is likely going to do, it just accelerate [forward] revenue and EBITDA for the simple fact that you\u2019re going to have a shorter life.","We estimate right now that the instant reward option will play about 12-month life versus our existing program, which has a 42-month life. So, I think the profitability will be equivalent. It will come through gross margin versus breakage, but it will just likely come through quicker as the programs ramps up due to the shorter life of the points.","James Kissane - Credit Suisse Securities","","Sponsors will be paying more per mile, is that the case?","Charles Horn","No. The cost to the sponsor will be the same. It just comes down to reward option value.","James Kissane - Credit Suisse Securities","","Okay.","Charles Horn","So like with any traditional program, like in the U.S, if you take cash versus a product, you get less equivalent cash value. So, it\u2019s the same concept. The costs of the products are redeemed and so it\u2019s little bit cheaper to maintain a gross margin, which equates to what you normally would make on your EBITDA margin.","James Kissane - Credit Suisse Securities","","Okay. And you obviously did some things in the fourth quarter to push down the redemption rate, should we expect the redemption rate maybe absent for instant reward option to remain lower than where it\u2019s been in the past?","Charles Horn","We try to keep the existing program with the burn rate of somewhere around 69% to 73%. That\u2019s the range we\u2019ll like to see it operate. Last year and fourth quarter of \u201910, it was little bit rich. So, what we do is we actively controlled the program via the options that you can redeem for the pricing of the option to try to keep it in the band as we move up toward that ultimate redemption rate of 72%.","James Kissane - Credit Suisse Securities","","Okay. And then just last question, I know we\u2019re running out of time, but the incremental investments related to going to more regions with the Dotz program in 2012, what\u2019s the impact this year on the numbers?","Charles Horn","Yeah, it\u2019s -- again, we\u2019re going to double the number of regions we\u2019re going to go in. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a material number, it\u2019s a few million probably for an extra couple of regions, but given where we think the over performance is going to come in the company that\u2019s already been factored in. So think of it is, we\u2019ll take a little bit off the table in terms of over performance and pour it into a faster spool up there the same way on our funding side for Private Label. Jim as you know in the past we\u2019ve tended to trade-off a little bit of over performance there to lock in longer term visibility by locking in long-term fixed rate funding.","James Kissane - Credit Suisse Securities","Great job, thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Darrin Peller with Barclays Capital.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital","Hey, thanks guys. So let me just start-off, if you don\u2019t mind with Epsilon. The trends have obviously been pretty strong over the past couple of quarters and we are now seeing mid single-digits high organic growth in the business added on by the recent deal, but can you just maybe give us some color on expectations for 2012, maybe even beyond just the actual growth rate. Maybe \u2013 can you give us a little color on the actual trends? What is the actual \u2013 what is the demand by your customers really that\u2019s driving this kind of growth, and how sustainable is that?","Charles Horn","Yeah, as we look into 2012, obviously we think the Epsilon model is high single-digits on the top line for sure. Will it reach 10%? I don\u2019t know, but it\u2019s very robust. What we\u2019re seeing is the biggest demand is coming from the very large database builds and those are driven by the Global 1000 essentially saying; hey look, I\u2019ve got 20 different brands, they\u2019re all in a different system, I need someone who can pull it altogether and then also I need sort of the demographic, psychographic information to be added to it. Oh, by the way I need to have someone who has a clue about the campaigns and how they should look and what distribution channels they should use. So the bottom line Darrin, is if our bet is right at Epsilon, which right now it looks like its heading in our favor, that there will be a \u2013 the biggest demand at Epsilon will be coming from the Global 1000 basically sitting there saying; I want to expand my relationship with Epsilon because I\u2019m sick of dealing with 20 different providers out there. And as a result with Epsilon, you\u2019re seeing almost two-thirds of the new growth that Epsilon is actually coming from existing clients making bigger commitments along the food chain there.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital","Got it. Moving more internationally as well as though? I know there is existing clients taking their business from domestic operations and moving it out, overseas perhaps?","Charles Horn","Yeah, I mean that\u2019s part of it, so for example; when you see us launch a big Global 1000, you can be sure that if someone is in an other country and logging into that clients website and signing up for whatever it maybe, and providing information that engine will flow into Epsilon for sure.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital","All right, if I can shift over for a minute to the credit book, Private Label. The reserve rate now, your allowance is about 200 basis points higher than your charge-off ratio which is one of the bigger cushions in terms of safety and reserving that we\u2019ve seen versus most of the banks, just seems kind of high. I guess, just questions, should we expect further momentum down on that number, assuming charge-off to stay flat or even improve more?","Ed Heffernan","Well Darrin, the way I would look at it, we ended the year with a -- for the full-year charge-off rate is 6.9%, we\u2019ve got it towards 6.3% for 2012. What I would anticipate is that 60, 70 basis points if it manifests will come through to the bottom line, so the reserve will drop.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital","Good. So, you still have more leverage there as well. And a last question on Private Label and I\u2019ll turn it back into the queue, on the transaction side; can you just explain the drop in the merchant fees. I think you said there was 19% drop in some of the merchant fees or the merchant related revenue whereas I know volume was up.","Ed Heffernan","Yeah, I mean, I\u2019ll jump in on that. A lot of that has to do with the programs that we\u2019re striking with, either on the renewals or on the new accounts which essentially is, we're in partnership with the merchants creating if you want to call it, a structure whereby there is a pool of money based on sales that will both parties has agreed will go directly towards promoting increased usage in the card.","So the big struggle that Private Label has always had and won't go away in the near future is, unlike bank card, Visa, MasterCard which is jamming your mailbox with gazillion offers, our cost per acquisition is very, very low, its through the store most likely, point of sale. But what's behind all that is a critical need for the store associates to be familiar with the card, the offer, the rewards program, the loyalty attached to it. And therefore given the turnover in retail associates at the store which is huge, there\u2019s a huge amount of training that needs to take place.","So we think its better to spend our dollars helping that part of the training as opposed and to give up some of the merchant fee in return. So essentially funding is a rebate that\u2019s being used to fund that training.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital","Okay. That\u2019s very helpful, thanks. All right, thanks guys. Good quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from Carter Malloy with Stephens, Inc.","Carter Malloy - Stephens, Inc","Hey guys, congratulations again. Some great wins and growth in the Private Label program, so I almost hate to ask, but can you comment on, is there more there, what you see in the pipeline and competition for those portfolios?","Ed Heffernan","","Sure, I\u2019ll jump in on that, its -- I think Carter, if you looked at last year, we signed, 6, 7 whatever the number is, that was probably our best year, in a number of years and then from a qualitative perspective the names that we signed the Pier-1 and the Marathon\u2019s and whatever. I mean, these are good quality names that I think will endure and growth in our file going forward. As I look into 2012 and \u201913 there are a couple of trends that are of interest.","One is; it all gets back to all this micro targeted marketing and everything else. The Private Label business again with the closed-loop network provides SKU level information, which is so critical to merchants these days and you can\u2019t get that with general purpose bank cards. So there is a renewed interest from what we\u2019ve seen on behalf of a lot of retailers out there to find a way to mine information so they know more about the client and they can market to their existing customers and acquire new customers, and Private Label is a perfect platform for that, so there\u2019s additional interest in that.","The other is, a really interesting trend that\u2019s going on separate than that, and that is there is an awful lot of turmoil that what I would call, the large players and the big portfolios that are out there that, really fly above our radar screen, but you\u2019ve got, Private Label is now back quote-unquote in as a great asset to hold, so its been moved from bad banks to good banks. You\u2019ve got a very significant acquisition of one of the major players out there in the Private Label business that will sell some confusion.","So there\u2019s a lot of turmoil from what we\u2019re seeing out there, as a result there are certain clients who in the past have gone with the larger players primarily, because they don\u2019t want to give up the touch points, the customer care and a lot of the marketing that we require to come onboard with us. What we\u2019re finding is that is now becoming a reasonable request given what they have experienced through the great recession from a service quality perspective. So we are going to try to make some hay, I would be very surprised if you did not see a couple of nice portfolio wins, takeaways, in addition to our more traditional new retail start-ups.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital","Okay, thanks for the color on that. And then another question on the Canadian loyalty side, you have roughly 1,200 basis points of safety net there, but what are your expectations around the impact of expirations driving up redemption rates there and how is your outlook over the next, say, two to five years?","Ed Heffernan","It\u2019s a situation where the expiration really doesn\u2019t affect that curve very much. The expiration or the time stamping nearly makes the miles we have already deemed to get from an accounting perspective to go away, it just provide certainty. In terms of the way we keep the tracking toward 72% is through exactly what Ed has talked about for years. You pull levers to keep the burn rates within a reasonable range, 69% to 72%. Then you know it\u2019s going to mature to about at a pace of about 1% per year, and then you keep tapping the breaks until it slows at the 72%. So your point has lot of head room between the current redemption rate and the ultimate redemption rate and you just moderate your redemption levels, your burn rate to keep it achieving that ultimate redemption rate.","Charles Horn","And said another -- put in highly technical terms probably. There hasn\u2019t been any freak out.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital","All right. It\u2019s helpful. Thanks guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Scharf with JMP.","David M. Scharf - JMP Securities","Hi, good morning. I am going to stay on the same topic because I want to make sure I can understand really just from a \u2013 more of a consumer perspective how this transition works. First of all when you talk about rolling out instant rewards in March, is this about just a handful of sponsors or you have got some significant client concentration or one or two very large sponsors behind this drive to move towards instant rewards and what\u2019s the real timeframe for when this is all rolled out to your top guys?","Ed Heffernan","It won\u2019t take pretty much the full-year David. So you will get a couple of big guys that come in the second quarter, some in the third quarter, some in the fourth. So it\u2019s going to rollout by region. Obviously it affects your supermarkets, people like that. Any type of retailer benefits the most because you\u2019ve a point of sale. You come and swipe your card, you get the instant liquidity option. So I would say it\u2019s going to roll in over the course of the year. We will not have too much Brazilian impacts 2012, but it really sets us up in 13, 14, and 15.","David M. Scharf - JMP Securities","Okay. And when -- when you think about kind of managing to the same gross margin level, I mean, I think most of the loyalty world out there is no longer really operating on a breakage model. They have instant rewards. I mean when you look at other instant reward programs in the industry and even when you look at Dotz, which is not a breakage model. Should we ultimately think about, I mean, there is always going to be some level of breakage. People die and in case of AIR MILES, people probably leave Canada, but how long does it take when you look at other programs. There is a sort of 95% redemption kind of program ultimately and does that mean you have to basically raise the number of miles constantly that people have to accumulate it they want to redeem instantly because it seems like if the sponsor is not paying more, the consumer has to.","Charles Horn","Yeah. It\u2019s -- we do think it will have a bifurcated collector base. And what we are seeing is that was a very strong push from both sponsors and collectors to offer up something less than a week\u2019s vacation down in Disney Land or something like that and have something more on the instant side. So to your point you will have almost a barbell where you\u2019re going to have one end, which is driven by the more instant rewards where profit is driven by pricing and gross margin and really no breakage. And then you will still have a fairly significant group which could be 50%, 60% who are in fact aspirational, and as a result they do want to spend their time saving up for the family vacation or the big reward down the road. So you are going to have two types of collectors and not much in the middle.","David M. Scharf - JMP Securities","And is there any data out there, I mean, as you do market research and what the impact is of ultimately raising the number of miles, your points you have to accumulate to take advantage of an instant award. I mean -- for the sponsors, the sponsors obviously want this because the consumers do. The sponsors have any say and kind of how much you ultimately are raising, the effective price really on the consumers. Do they just pretty much assume that at least in Canada, it\u2019s the only game in town so these people are still going to want to accumulate?","Ed Heffernan","(Indiscernible) through before we do it. The second piece of it is as a consumer you are accustomed to a discount when you\u2019re dealing with cash option versus a product option, it\u2019s same in the US. When we do that you have a grace credit card, if you want cash you get 20% less once you get if you did product. So it\u2019s a mindset that\u2019s pervasive throughout any coalition program or any loyalty program for that matter. But if you take cash you\u2019re going to take a little bit of a discount or haircut off of it. So that\u2019s just pretty common nature and it\u2019s pretty well accepted.","David M. Scharf - JMP Securities","Thanks very much.","Operator","Your last question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette and Woods","Thank you. Hey Charles, we talked about this before, but just in terms of the receivables growth you guys are expecting this year, but could you just talk about what kind of impact that has on the P&L as far as pluses and minuses are concerned. And then \u2013 I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019ve missed this, but just the interest expense was a lot better than what we expected, could you just talk about that a little bit? Thanks.","Charles Horn","All right. So if we break down the seven signings, we had four of them actually come with miles attached, two closed in \u201911, which we will get a full benefit pretty much in \u201912. Now the two files that we\u2019ve closed within 2012, Pier 1 and Bon-Ton where you get the AR coming through, you don\u2019t get a lot of earnings boost within 2012. Much \u2013 most of the earnings will come through in 2013, 2014. The reason basically be when you acquire portfolio, you fair value it, so your purchase accounting will soak up any embedded income that come from it. So the key takeaway would be most of the programs we add in 2011 will be ramping in \u201912. Pier 1 and Bon-Ton units are closed in second, third quarter will not provide a lot to \u201912 because of the way the accounting works. The most of the benefit will come in \u201914 and \u201915 \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, \u201913 and \u201914.","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette and Woods","And that the growth expectation that you guys alluded to at the begin \u2013 in your prepared remarks, that doesn\u2019t include any potential wins that you may have, right?","Charles Horn","Correct.","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette and Woods","Okay, great. And just that interest expense plan?","Charles Horn","This is corporate?","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette and Woods","Yeah. Was there anything specific there?","Charles Horn","You know Sanjay, I can\u2019t think of anything. I will look at it and call you back. It didn\u2019t hit my radar screen as to what you\u2019re looking at.","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette and Woods","Okay. Fair enough. And final question maybe just on Dotz, I think you guys, Ed kind of touched on it earlier on, but just \u2013 what\u2019s the timeline where it becomes a significant earnings?","Ed Heffernan","Yeah. Well, it depends how fast if we keep accelerating it, there are eight regions that essentially cover the marketplace with a 190 million people in Brazil. There is about 70 million to 90 million that we will consider in our sweet spot, so to middle-class type consumers and 90% plus of them are in those eight regions. So we should have six regions done by the end of \u201912.","We should have all eight regions done by the end of \u201913. So in terms of the earnings power, I think what you will see is something fairly significant start flowing in \u201914 for sure. Maybe we can accelerate that a little bit sooner, but the beauty is because there is no big trust account down there that the cash coming in is in fact used as working capital. And therefore can fund a lot of the expansion and so the only thing you take is a little bit more on your P&L. So, look our goal is like everything else.","The coalition program works best when you have the largest number of folks and the largest number of sponsors. And so our goal is essentially to charge 100% to get this stuff up and running and get the network in place and then after that hopefully it just becomes a nice cash flow machine for us.","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette and Woods","Okay, great. Thank you.","Ed Heffernan","Okay, that\u2019s it. We will let everyone get back to work. Thank you very much for your time. Bye.","Operator","This does conclude today\u2019s conference call.

Following today\u2019s presentation, the floor will be opened for your questions. (Operator Instructions)","In order to view the company\u2019s presentation on your website, please remember to turn-off the pop-up blocker on your computer. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host Ms. Julie Prozeller of FTI Consulting. Ma\u2019am, the floor is yours.","Julie Prozeller","Thank you, Operator.

Ed?","Ed Heffernan","","Great. Thanks, Julie. Okay. We are going to right into it and joining me today is Charles Horn, our erstwhile and ever popular CFO, and down term Toronto, we have Bryan Pearson, the President of LoyaltyOne, which of course includes both the AIR MILES Program in Canada, as well our efforts in Brazil, and we welcome Bryan, he used the last of the Canadian pennies to make the journey down here.","Charles will discuss consolidated Epsilon and private label results and Bryan will walk you through LoyaltyOne results, and I will chime in at the end with a couple of comments. So that being said, Charles, take it away.","Charles Horn","Thanks Ed. It was a terrific start to 2012. Highlights for the first quarter of 2012 are, revenue increased 20% to $892 million, EPS increased 19% to $1.86 per share, core EPS increased 17% to $2.38 beating the company\u2019s guidance of $2.13, excluding the year-over-year builds and phantom shares, core EPS increased 27% to $2.58, lastly, adjusted EBITDA net of running cost increased 25% to $275 million.","As noted above, the 4.9 million share increase in phantom shares dampened core EPS by about $0.20 for the quarter. We expect this overhang which is directly correlated with our average share price to continue throughout 2012. Ed will talk about this further as part of his update later in this call. The key takeaway the company does not have any economic obligation to issue or cash settle this year.","Let\u2019s move to LoyaltyOne, Bryan take it away.","Bryan Pearson","Thanks Charles. LoyaltyOne had a strong first quarter in both revenue and both key growth metrics increasing by double-digit over the last -- over the first quarter of 2011. Revenue was up 20%, compared to the first quarter of 2011 before foreign exchange translation. Both our marketing and redemption related revenue were up double digits compared to the same quarter of last year.","Adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter was flat to 2011. However, we actually made two EBITDA investments in 2012, which position us well for future growth.","The first is, we introduced the new instant redemption program at our high frequency retail sponsors, which we called AIR MILES Cash and this required a sizeable one-time launch investment of $4.5 million in the quarter primarily to spot marketing activity and infrastructure.","The second investment is, in our expenses, is attributable to our international and non-AIR MILES Reward program related expenses.","Expenses in 2012 increased by $2.1 million over the first quarter of last year, supporting the roll out of Dotz in additional markets in Brazil and investments in other geographies, excluding these items, our adjusted EBITDA was up 13% for the first quarter of 2012 and adjusted EBITDA margin was 26% in line with historical margins.","Miles issued grew 11% for the quarter making five consecutive quarters of growth and two consecutive quarters of double-digit growth. The first quarter was particularly strong as both our credit card sponsors had a great start with strong acquisition programs and increased spend on the cards. In addition, we\u2019ve benefited from aggressive marketing campaigns from our fuel sponsor, Shell, as they looked to gain market share in their sector.","Looking forward, we expect to see mid single-digit issuance year-over-year growth for the remainder of 2012. Miles redeemed were up by 26% for the quarter, which is higher than our normal growth, but in line with our expectations for the quarter.","In late 2011, we announced the implementation of five-year expiry on all existing and future AIR MILES, and we anticipated that the introduction of an expiry policy would cause a temporary one-time pull forward of miles which redeemed in the first quarter, and we expect that that redemption activity will abate and return to more normal 2% to 3% year-over-year growth rates for the remainder of this year.","A quick update on AIR MILES Cash, our new instant reward program which launched late in the first quarter, already has about 350,000 collectors that have signed up for the program, which is currently being offered at only four sponsors, Shell, Metro, Jean Coutu and Rexall.","We plan to add six more sponsors to the program during 2012. Overall, the target of the instant reward program is high frequency retail sponsors primarily in the grocery, pharmacy, gas and home improvement categories.","So let\u2019s turn to the next slide now and discuss our longer term view of initiatives. Beyond the growth of the Canadian AIR MILES Reward program, we continue to see progress with Dotz, an international coalition program in Brazil in which we own 37%.","As shown on the slide, Dotz achieved growth in all of the key metrics during the first quarter of 2012. First Dotz\u2019s launched in the Sao Paulo interior region in March of 2012. This region is made up of 23 cities and a total population of 4 million with Campinas being the largest city amongst them with a population of 1.1 million.","Second, the total new enrollment in the first quarter was 600,000 collectors bringing the total number of collectors that we have currently have enrolled in the program to approximately 2.2 million and that represents 45% target market penetration in the markets we\u2019re operating in.","Third, issuances in the first quarter were strong  with 3.5 billion Dotz issued which was in line with our expectations. The Dotz program and the Brazilian market continued to demonstrate increasingly strong results. Our focus is on securing additional high frequency partners in existing markets and adding national partners.","For the remainder of 2012, we anticipate to launching Dotz in three additional markets in Brazil, including one major market with a significant population base. With the new markets launched we expect total enrollment by the end of this year to approach 4 million collectors and we remain extremely excited about the opportunity in Brazil.","Based on its target market coupled with current consumer spending habits in brazil, we believe a long-term opportunity for Dotz is at least the same size as our Canadian program. As we ramp up the business in Brazil, we\u2019re looking for opportunities to make similar measured investments in other interesting markets.","As mentioned in previous calls, we continue to pursue attractive markets for coalition with our main criteria being the size of the market, the competitive environment in terms of the presence of the existing coalition programs and a strong network of national retailers in high frequency categories.","Over the long-term, we expect that international growth in combination with continued solid performance from the AIR MILES program in Canada will result in a return to the double-digit topline and bottom line growth for LoyaltyOne.","And before I pack you back to Charles, I\u2019d just like to express a heartfelt thank you to all the LoyaltyOne and Dotz teams for another outstanding year in 2011, and a strong first quarter of 2012.","Charles Horn","Thanks Bryan. Let\u2019s flip over to next page and we\u2019ll discuss Epsilon\u2019s quarter. Overall, it looks a very solid first quarter for Epsilon with revenue up 46% and adjusted EBITDA of 18% compared to first quarter of 2011. Organic revenue increased 5% while adjusted EBITDA was flat on a year-over-year basis.","After adjusting for investments related to one-time data center relocation cost along with incremental 2012 spend in infrastructure and security to build that Epsilon platform for future growth, adjusted EBITDA growth was in line with revenue growth at 5%.","If we turn and break it down by business line, data base digital revenue increased 7% compared to the first quarter of 2011, due to continued growth in existing clients and launches such as both Kellogg and Crafter in the quarter. The backlog continues to expand with new winds such as the Container Store and Northwestern Mutual announced this quarter.","Data revenue was flat compared to the first quarter of 2011, strength in the Abacus cooperative catalog offering, which was up 6% year-over-year was offset by softness in the consumer demographic data offering due to weakness in two sectors including financial services.","The third piece of it which is agency analytics and the strong quarter benefited by the Aspen acquisition, which was completed in the second quarter of 2011, and it was bolstered in particular by solid growth in the automobile sector. Aspen continues to add to the topline of integrated opportunities for Epsilon overall.","Adjusted EBITDA margins for the first quarter were down 400 basis points compared to 2011, primarily due to a shift in business mix that is directly related to the Aspen acquisition, which as we talked about before carries a lower adjusted EBITDA margin than the rest of Epsilon.","In addition 2012 investments, including the one-time data center relocation, costs and incremental spend, related to infrastructure and security negatively impacted Q1 adjusted EBITDA margins.","However, as Epsilon builds up the integrated platform, the strong topline of bundled solution opportunities continues to grow and should drive leverages as we move into 2013.","Let\u2019s flip to the next page and briefly talk about private label. Private label started 2012 strong with revenue up 10% and adjusted EBITDA net of funding costs up 34%, compared to the first quarter of 2011.","Fast momentum continues to be seen in four primary areas. The first is receivables growth, growth is returned with the continued moderation of cardholder payment rates, average credit card receivables increased 7%, compared to the first quarter 2011, while ending credit card receivables increased 12% from March 31, 2011 aided by the conversion of the Tier 1 imports credit portfolio on March 29, 2012.","Second is cardholder spending, credit sales continue to accelerate, up 20% from the first quarter of 2011. This compares to 10% growth for full year 2011. Cardholders continued to be actively engaged and appear to be feeling better about their personal situations. In addition, the onboarding and new programs in 2011 contributed approximately 6% of the growth.","Third is portfolio quality, entering 2011 management expected approximately 60 to 70 basis points of improvement in principle charge-offs compared to the prior year. Trends are now suggesting closer to 100 to 120 basis point improvement in 2012.","Lastly would be funding cost, and our funding cost continues to improve as older tranches of debt mature and are replaced with new cheaper longer tenure paper. Our cash funding rate for all card related borrowings, which excludes non-cash items was 2.7% in Q1 2012 or a 100 basis points better than last year.","Overall, the outlook for 2012 is excellent. Solid fundamentals coupled with a strong topline and potential new programs. Recently announced long-term agreements with Premier Designs which brings along a small portfolio. Similar to 2011, our goal is five new programs for 2012, we remain confident this is an achievable number.","Let\u2019s turn to the next page and talk about liquidity. At the corporate level, our liquidity increased to $1.3 billion at March 31, 2012 after raising over $750 million of additional liquidity during the first quarter.","In March 2012, the company issued $500 million of senior notes at a rate of 6.38% that mature in 2020 and raised about $251 million of bank debt at LIBOR plus 200 basis points. The all and blended rate of the new debt is approximately 5.1%.","Net corporate debt was approximately $2 billion at March 31, 2012, a modest amount given our leverage ratio which is defined as corporate debt to adjusted EBITDA. The ratio was 2.3x for the first quarter, compared to maximum loan covenant of 3.5x. We expect the leverage ratio will fall as 2012 progresses and we keep our free cash flow.","At the bank sub level, we were approximately $2.8 million of available liquidity at March 31, 2012. Subsequent to quarter end, one of our credit card trusts issued 550 million of public, seven-year fixed rate term asset backed securities, only the third credit card debt offering issued longer than five years since 2008 by any issuer.","Approximately $430 million of the AAA rated notes were issued to investors with a fixed coupon of slightly over 3.1%. The remaining supported -- subordinated bonds were retained by the company.","Regulatory ratios at our banks remained strong. For the World Financial Network Bank, capital ratios were 17% for Tier 1, 16% for leverage ratio and 18% for total risk based as of March 31, 2012. All well above regulatory well-capitalized minimums. Robust capital ratios allowed our bank subs to pay dividends of approximately $58 million to Alliance Data during the quarter.","I will now turn it over to Ed to walk you through updated outlook for 2012. Edward?","Ed Heffernan","Thanks, Charles. We can move to the slide entitled 2012 guidance. We can walk through that fairly quickly. I guess is an overall statement, clearly, things are running stronger than anticipated and that over performance if you really look at it coming from two main areas.","The first is that the use of our clients private label cards is running well ahead of everyone\u2019s expectations, growth in card spending is really zipping along and hit 20% growth in card spend in Q1 versus last year, obviously, incredibly strong.","With the stabilization in customer payment rates, what that means is, the cardholder spending is in fact, finally driving some growth in the average credit card receivables. For that reason finance charge income was quite robust in Q1, as well as benefits from the merchant.","Second, as Charles mentioned, credit quality continues to defy its longstanding correlation to unemployment. Again, you are looking at a file that looks to be pristine after being cleaned out during the great recession and as a result, you\u2019ve got the characteristics of the super prime file and as such the portfolio is notching loss rates really quite a bit better than anticipated.","These are the two main drivers behind the over performance that we\u2019re seeing thus far this year, everyone else seems roughly on track. These two areas plus the results of LoyaltyOne and Epsilon give us the comfort to significantly raise our earnings guidance for the year and specifically, we are increasing our after-tax for quarter earnings guidance by as much as $25 million and on a GAAP net income basis the corresponding increase would also be $25 million.","So big increase in total earnings and now, how does that filter down on a per-share basis, this is where the fun begins. This would equate to over $0.40 of incremental earnings using our original share count of 60.5 million shares.","However, as you heard a lot from us over the past few months, due to our increased stock price, our projected 2012 fully diluted share count has increased by right around 3 million shares. So as such, our higher total earnings will now be divided into more shares leaving us with effectively the same $8.45 per share guidance from before.","However, all is not lost, since about half of the increased shares are what we call the phantom shares, which disappear at no cost to us when the converts mature in \u201813 and \u201814. That is it\u2019s merely in accounting convention.","So, if you were to look pass the $1.3 million in new phantom shares, you would see effectively a true increase in economic earnings per share of $0.17, which will automatically flow through to EPS as the converts mature.","And the next slide, we will walk you through it in a bit more detail. It\u2019s a little bit busy, but you will see, we\u2019ve increased the after tax core earnings by $25 million from $511 million to $536 million.","The higher share count due to our projected higher stock price caused an increase of $3 million in our total share count. EPS stays the same due to the large share increase. However, about half of the increase for phantom shares which drop off in \u201813 and \u201814, excluding those as you can see we have effectively increased our guidance by $0.17.","In fact, if you backup all $8.3 million phantom shares, which again will drop off, our true economic EPS that will flow through is $9.72 or 1.30 higher than our expected reported number of $8.45.","Frankly, where do you look to the phantom shares now or wait until they officially drop off when they convert mature, doesn\u2019t change the outcomes. In the end, the much higher EPS number will flow through.","So to keep things simple for everyone, I like the rule of thumb that for every $1 increase in the share price, let\u2019s say above $125, roughly 200,000 shares are added to our share count and of those 200,000, roughly half are real and half are phantom.","So our guidance was set originally at 110 bucks, moved to $125, so we added 15 bucks at 200,000 shares per buck. That\u2019s what added 3 million new shares of which about half are phantom. So hopefully that\u2019s clear as mud for everyone.","Let\u2019s now turn to the final page titled with our new financial term, In a Nutshell. Again reiterating over performance is driving us to increase our core earnings by $25 million versus prior guidance.","Second, incremental phantom shares are in fact masking this significant increase in guidance if you excluded the new phantom shares as we said, the core EPS guidance would have increased $0.17. These aberrations are masking approximately buck 1.30 in core EPS, compared to 2011, and that will flow through core and GAAP EPS as convertible debt matures in 2013 and \u201814.","All right. What\u2019s it all means? Again, the business is running stronger than anticipated. For those of you who have known us for years, what we tend to do is we tend to try to use some of that over performance to invest in the future, some to invest in visibility and some to flow through as just pure over performance. And if you would look at, where we expect to use the over performance that is clearly beginning to pickup steam in 2012, what you will see is the following buckets.","First and foremost, we\u2019re taking the opportunity to invest very heavily in Epsilon\u2019s infrastructure. Again, our seven-year effort to pull all of Epsilon\u2019s pieces together, including digital marketing agency, data, data base, analytics and distribution. We completed that last year. We now need to stitch everything together. So that we can go out and land the full suite of services that some of the global 1,000.","That\u2019s the ultimate goal here. That does take a fair amount of work. We will be done with all of this investment by the end of 2012. The mandate to Epsilon is they need to be ready for prime time in 2013.","Second, also something we\u2019ve done in the past is since one of our businesses specifically, private label does require us to be fairly active in the capital markets and borrow a good chunk of funds. We have the choice of obviously having a very short duration in our funding book and borrowing a percent or something like that.","What we did however is, and we will do it all day long is we traded off that short-term benefit to lock in money, fixed rate money for up to seven years. And obviously, you lose a couple of points benefit in terms of interest savings, however, we think the trade-off is where flow gives visibility down the road.","And frankly, we will be doing more of this as the year unfold and in all the years, I have been here, I can\u2019t recall getting three points for seven-year fixed rate money. So, we are going to get as much as we can to this stuff and I think, it will payoff great down the road.","Also, not only because of the over performance, but primarily because of the success we\u2019ve seen in Brazil last year and the initial rollout this year. We have in fact double down and accelerated the rollout in Brazil, which Bryan alluded to you earlier, and it\u2019s going gangbusters down there were pretty jazzed up about where things are going. And we would expect to incur incremental costs obviously associated with the rollout. But frankly now it\u2019s the time to hit that thing hard.","Also some of the over performance will in fact be queued up to cover true dilution from the convertible debt warrants. I would also say that Charles talked about, going out into the market, raising liquidity right when we didn\u2019t really need it, but that\u2019s exactly the time we want to do it.","We are left with a lot of cash and as a result, we are going to have a negative between borrowing cost and what we earn on our cash. Again, we think that\u2019s an excellent trade off and an excellent use of some over performance as it gives us new flexibility as the year progresses.","And then finally what\u2019s leftover is effectively an increase in our guidance by $0.17. Although, it won\u2019t flow through until the phantoms disappear.","So, overall, things look good. I think we\u2019re taking the over performance and slicing it up into a balanced approach between actually having the over performance flow through, as well as using it to invest in the future and accelerating some investments in the near-term.","We also talked about the nice balance of wins to start the year with Premier Designs, Northwestern Mutual, The Container Store, Toys \u201cR\u201dUs. Subsequent to the end of Q1 obviously we just announced a very significant expansion in Brazil. We talked about the three quarters of billion of new liquidity and $0.5 billion of fixed rate ABS deal that we did for the private label group.","So it\u2019s been a busy first quarter. I can say that we are -- our comfort level is quite high right now in terms of how 2012 is coming together. As a result, most of us are turning our attention to 2013, based on the trends that we\u2019re seeing both and things like cardholder spending, portfolio growth, new wins, funding costs, credit quality, miles issued, miles redeemed, new database wins, new agency wins.","You put it all together and we think the momentum carrying us through 2012 will give us a very, very strong jump off for 2013, and so we\u2019re spending a lot of our time now on what 2013 is going to shakeout as.","So, that being said, I think we will open it up for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Jim Kissane from Credit Suisse.","Jim Kissane \u2013 Credit Suisse","Thanks. A question for Bryan and I guess and Ed. Can you give us a sense of your level of confidence that the miles redeemed will in fact moderate over the course of the year? And Bryan, if the fact that you rolled out the instant redemption having some impact or collectors of traditional MILES cashing them in as they move to the new model? Is that having any impact? Thanks.","Bryan Pearson","Yeah. Jim, yeah, you basically have hit the nail on my head. There is two dynamics which are happening. One is, the announcement of expiry and despite best efforts on communications you are always going to have people who don\u2019t understand there is a five-year window on that and so they might act a little quicker than they need to.","But, I would say, the bigger piece of pull forward and we see it in the underlying numbers was the move to Cash, which launched at the very beginning of March. And what happened was we saw pull forward of redemptions and when we moved to Cash at the beginning of March there was also a change in the pricing, effective pricing for gift card and for certificate based miles, redemptions as well.","So consumers, a little bit of activity was based on people moving to Cash and then taking some miles out, but most of it was a pull forward in that sector. In fact, Jim, when we look at the rest of the reward categories, we saw exactly we expected to see which was a nominal growth and that leads us to believe that it\u2019s effectively a pull forward.","Ed Heffernan","Yeah. So, Jim, we think it\u2019s going to abate quite a bit in the second quarter to the rest of the year and I think, overall, we\u2019re targeting about $74% burn rate for the year, which is in line with what our overall expectations would be. So, I think you do is as Bryan talked about, you get the one-time pull forward, you will see it fall back in Q2 through Q4 and then have a very reasonable burn rate of about 74% for the year.","Jim Kissane \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay. But to be clear, the instant redemption miles are not included in your metrics in the release, right? Those are going to be accounted for separately?","Ed Heffernan","They are still nominal at this point, Jim.","Jim Kissane \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay.","Ed Heffernan","And so going forward as they do become material you will see them broken out separately.","Jim Kissane \u2013 Credit Suisse","Got you. And just a sense on the outlook for the growth investments in Epsilon and Loyalty, you flagged a few of them making them sound like they are one-time, but it also seems like several of the investments are more recurring. So can you give us sense on how much spending will be done on the investment front and Epsilon and Royalty going forward? Thanks.","Ed Heffernan","Yeah. I\u2019ll leave the numbers to Charles, but the big probably if you want to call it one timer would be whenever you accelerate the roll out in numerous regions down in Brazil, what you are doing is obviously you are adding per region a few million bucks. As almost as a pull forward if you want of what we would have done the following years but I think it\u2019s a way to go.","Charles can put a fence post around it. But also in Epsilon probably the -- we are doing some infrastructure investments to make sure we\u2019re best of breed. Those are probably ongoing expenses. Our biggest stuff is we are consolidating data centers. And I think that is -- that\u2019s going to be done by the end of this year as well as the couple of other items. So Charles, I don\u2019t know how much you want \u2026","Charles Horn","Right. So for Epsilon for the one-offs, primarily the data center move, it\u2019s probably will be $5 million to $6 million of expense this year. On the ongoing internal investment, just to beef up the infrastructure, it\u2019s about $2 million a year in incremental costs which you see coming through the numbers.","Jim Kissane \u2013 Credit Suisse","And Loyalty?","Charles Horn","For Loyalty it\u2019s not going to be appreciably higher probably for Dotz, it will be $3 million -- $2 million to $3 million higher than what it was last year.","Jim Kissane \u2013 Credit Suisse","And in the interim, redemption cost, does that go away now that it\u2019s been rolled out or does that continue?","Charles Horn","That was the one-time marketing spend. We did have some over performance coming from obviously the higher redemptions we plowed it backend to use (inaudible) into the marketing -- to get that program up and running.","Jim Kissane \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay. And just last question, Charles, I think you said you expect five wins in private label this year. Does that include the Bon-Ton and Pier 1 or is that incremental?","Charles Horn","It would be incremental.","Jim Kissane \u2013 Credit Suisse","All right. Okay. Thank you very much. Good job.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani from KBW.","Sanjay Sakhrani \u2013 KBW","Thank you. So we will start there with the five wins, so just M&A, in terms of our outstanding RFPs, are there a bunch in terms of what\u2019s left over from Cap One and HSBC linking up? And then maybe we could talk staying on private level, we could talk about charge offs. I mean how low can charge offs really go?","If you look at the general purpose industry, we are materially or appreciably below average. Can the same happen in private label or does the growth phenomenon kind of tamper that a little bit? Thanks.","Ed Heffernan","Yeah. I will take a little bit of it anyhow. In terms of what we\u2019re seeing in the pipeline, I would say it\u2019s probably more active today than, I can recall. I think part of it is because actually you mentioned a couple of the players. There is turmoil in the industry. There is people deciding to come back in, who were out before.","In addition to that, we have taken a much more aggressive stance towards growth in our private label business. We think this is the time to strike. So we are being aggressive on that front as well. You slap it altogether and I think what you\u2019ll find out is our typical year where we\u2019ll sign five new clients, which tend to be spooling up that take two three years for it to really hit a good run rate.","Those are what we typically do. We\u2019re usually not too active on the M&A front from the file perspective. However that being said for a number of reasons what we\u2019re seeing is there is a very significant opportunity out there I think for us, specifically. And you see it in the Pier 1, you see it in the Bon-Ton. There are a number of other significant names that are also circulating in the pipeline, Sanjay, for a number of reasons.","One being I think our products set is appealing more and more to the CEOs and CMOs who understand the whole micro targeted loyalty concept and also quite frankly there is an awful lot of turmoil in the other parts of the sector, which lend itself very nicely to our approach of nice clean, smooth. We\u2019ll hold your hand and give you premium service type approach.","So I think those two combined, you will see most likely over performance in the both wins and our typical long-term growth rate in file growth for the next two three years would be my guess.","On the credit quality side, hey look, I\u2019m with you,-- we typically track 100 to 120 bips above the unemployment rate. I\u2019m certainly glad we are not doing now. The pristine nature of the file right because of the debt and the length of the great recession has created a super prime type profile in the file itself.","We are down in the 5% of range. We typically run rate around 6%. We are -- I\u2019d love to sit there and say boy we are, crystal ball says, we\u2019re going to begin to drift back up to six sometime over the next 12 months or so.","But we are not seeing it and what we are seeing in the early stage delinquencies, middle stage, late stages recoveries, everything is suggesting to us that this could be a fairly lengthy process before things begin to drift up in our case maybe another 80 or 100 basis points till they normalize at 6%.","So everything we\u2019re seeing and again looking at early stage delinquencies give us probably the best view, but all the -- what we\u2019re hearing from the floor from the collectors is that across the board all the buckets are looking as strong now as they were six months ago. So to answer your question, I think we will be below our long-term average, probably for quite some time now.","Sanjay Sakhrani \u2013 KBW","Just a follow-up for Charles, just on reserve coverage, I mean that went up this quarter, could you just maybe talk about that migration over the course of the year. I know you guys got some portfolio wins, so can that eat into that coverage going forward?","Charles Horn","First, we did take it down little bit, we are in 8.2% reserve at the end of Q1 versus 8.3% at the end of 2011. So we took it down about 10 basis points. Likely over the course of the year, if we continue to see this, continued strength in our charge-off rates falling that you will see the reserve rate come down, it could be as much as 30 or 40 basis points if we see these trends continue.","From an acquired portfolio standpoint, it really does not affect our reserve because it brings in a fair value. So really what you\u2019re seeing more is the maturation of the file, the credit cleansing that\u2019s taken place for the file. So if we continue to see those trends on, we had expect reserve percentage continue to drop for the remainder of 2012.","Sanjay Sakhrani \u2013 KBW","Okay. And maybe since we have Bryan on line, I had just a couple of questions on loyalty and specifically to Canada. I think Charles has mentioned this notion of co-exclusivity in certain regions. I was just wondering if you could just talk about how the partners had reacted to that and kind of what the opportunity is there for growth beyond kind of what you have already signed up?","And I think there is a couple of renewals next year and I was just wondering how those discussions are going? Thanks.","Bryan Pearson","","Okay. So there\u2019s three questions there. First, is this amazing fascination with the Canadian ability to accept co-exclusivity which seems to be a funny term. Yeah, it\u2019s -- what we usually enter into co-exclusivity is where we got sector or segment of the market which is fairly fragmented.","And if we don\u2019t have a dominant player who owns a vast proportion of the marketplace, significant market share, then it actually serves our collector better and believe it or not, it actually serves the partner better to have more players in the sector. And sometimes the stores that overlap or you got two credit cards that are competing for the same customer but the amount of upside that exists for both partners is greater than the amount of overlap that exists.","And so we look to optimize around co-exclusivity in categories where it makes sense. Do our partners like it? Well, yeah and no. But now we\u2019ve got a track record of well over a decade of doing this in different categories and we can demonstrate that there actually is a net gain by virtue of having better category penetration.","I think the second question was around growth and what categories we would pursue. And I\u2019d say that you\u2019ve seen some great announcements in the last little while around things like Zale\u2019s and Toys \u201cR\u201dUs and Nova Scotia Liquor this year, which shows that we are continuing to penetrate the specialty retail segments quite effectively and we are working quite diligently in there. There is a lot of landscape to continue to work on that front.","And so if you are looking for where we would be acting, it would be around specialty retail, quick service restaurants and continuing to grow in the liquor category in provinces where we don\u2019t have presence so far. I\u2019m trying to remember your last question, it was\u2026","Sanjay Sakhrani \u2013 KBW","It was on just renewals.","Ed Heffernan","Yeah. Renewals, yeah, and we don\u2019t anticipate we are in current discussions on a few fronts. I think you saw that we resigned metro which has continued our track record of basically resigning on favorable terms virtually every major sponsor category that we\u2019ve had and we don\u2019t have any reason to believe that that should change in the forthcoming months or years.","Sanjay Sakhrani \u2013 KBW","Wonderful. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Scharf from JMP.","David Scharf \u2013 JMP","Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. I had wanted to shift back at the private label. You used the word turmoil to describe some of the goings on in terms of some M&A activity and some people making noise of entering the business again. Can you just qualitatively discuss whether or not in regards to converting the pipeline whether the RFT, the bidding process, the sales cycle and anything on the ground is changing yet with potentially some more renewed interests from some other banks?","Ed Heffernan","Yeah. We have to be a little careful here but I think what we are seeing and what really came to fruition with both Pier 1 and with Bon-Ton had more to do with not the usual suspects, Dotz jumping in and jumping out of the markets depending upon where it is in the credit cycle.","But it had a lot more to do with probably two things, one is, there is a much greater and heightened awareness of if you want to call it the new way of reaching and messaging the end-user, which obviously is what we\u2019ve bet the company on since day one.","And that is there is a much greater interest in both traditional point-of-sale, direct mail and even commission-based e-mail but now moving into the mobile, social and targeted display as ways of communicating with the customers -- the client\u2019s customer base, that\u2019s obviously our bread and butter.","So I think that\u2019s attracted renewed interest from the folks, who in the past probably weren\u2019t quite as just about that. The second thing would be how to describe the \u201cturmoil\u201d is that there are a number of, I think CEOs, CMOs who did not have a good experience elsewhere during the great recession.","In fact they didn\u2019t and as a result what kept them from joining us here was the fact that we of course require that the customer care functions in a lot of the marketing and date base work need to come with the more traditional credit and processing functions that they can just get elsewhere.","And so they always debated do I want to actually give all this stuff to ADS or let me just outsource the pieces that I don\u2019t deem strategic so what we are finding is that the conversions that we\u2019ve had with the CEOs has been very much along the lines of look, I had a really bad experience during the great recession and as a result, you guys are effectively a marketing firm first and I\u2019m willing to give up those pieces to join the party.","So there is a new sense of, a, different channels that need to be tapped out there, this is what we do for living and, b, some of them as I said had a very bad experience during the great recession. And they knew that during great recession, we actually grew the business and kept everyone on shore and actually continue to invest in it. So that seems to be resonating with people.","David Scharf \u2013 JMP","Okay. That\u2019s helpful context. Then maybe for Charles, just three quick questions on some of the credit metrics. With respect to the 20% credit sales growth, is there a figure for how much of that\u2019s from programs that have come on board in the last 12, 15 months ramping up versus how much of that would be considered either a mature or a same client\u2019s figure.","Charles Horn","If you take the programs added in 2011, they were about 6% of the overall 20% increase in credit sales.","David Scharf \u2013 JMP","Got you. So 14% almost a true organic figure.","Charles Horn","Correct.","David Scharf \u2013 JMP","Got you. Also a question on the payment rates and you had made reference to payment rates moderating a bit and that helping balances and we should continue to see more of that. I\u2019m looking at the trust data which is about I guess two-thirds of your receivables. I mean the payment rates in the first three months of this year or above 19%, it look like the average payment rate throughout last year was 18.5%.","And I\u2019m wondering if there is even more kind of upside that then you are indicating, I mean it doesn\u2019t look like payment rates have moderated all that much from what we saw last year.","Charles Horn","Let me put this for you right. They are not flat, but if you are looking at in a year-over-year change of 30 to 50 basis points back what we were going through which was 130 to 150 basis point year-over-year change, it\u2019s definitely is moderating. And so we\u2019re not getting nearly the amount of pressure we did before.","Obviously and generally, you would want 14% growth rates produced more than seven to AR. But as that continues to spin out and go from may be 50 basis points spread to 30 to 10, there is more upside in the ability to grow average AR based upon the credit sales we\u2019re generating.","Ed Heffernan","Yeah. I think if I can jump in here. One of the nice hedges that you have naturally in the business is that as you move from a super prime time file where it takes strong double-digit sales growth, just generate high single-digit type file growth, when you start moving those losses, when those losses begin eventually whether it\u2019s a year or two years from now migrating back towards sort of that 6% normalization level that usually translate into.","Obviously you are beginning to come away from super prime and more back into our sweet spot which is prime that then means that the double-digit sales growth means double-digit file growth. So what you give up on losses, you pickup in file growth and hence finance charge. And we actually make more money that way.","David Scharf \u2013 JMP","Lastly, I just want to revisit the reserve levels. You were provisioning at 8.2%. Charles, you talked about this a few times, I know in the past you\u2019ve mentioned that a reserve levels at about 100 to 130 basis points above the trailing 12 months average loss rate. If we stay at sort of mid 5% for loss rates this year, that LTM average starts trending down below 6%?","Charles Horn","Right.","David Scharf \u2013 JMP","It was written down, I saw you had set maybe a 30, 40 basis point improvement in the provisioning which would still put you at a couple of 100 basis points above that LTM. I\u2019m trying to get a little more clarity on what the year-end reserve levels would now look like?","Charles Horn","The first thing, David, is when we you look at it on a quarterly basis, we always factor in seasonality aspect of it. But if we fast forward to the end of the year, you\u2019re likely going to see an LTM charge off rate and we\u2019ll keep the spread meaningful. We look at macroeconomic factors and other externalities that would be 120 to 130 basis points over the trailing 12 months charge off rate.","So based upon that trends, you are right. We\u2019re going to see our overall reserve percentage to fall by the end of the year if we continue to see the strong improvements in charge off rates.","David Scharf \u2013 JMP","Okay. So just so I\u2019m clear by the fourth quarter, we are looking at LTM average loss rates around 5.5%. We should be looking at a provision rate at 7% or below at year-end?","Ed Heffernan","I think that\u2019s reasonable, yeah.","David Scharf \u2013 JMP","Okay. Implying a release in Q4. Okay. Thank you very much.","Ed Heffernan","You bet.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dan Perlin from RBC Capital Markets.","Dan Perlin \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Thanks. Just a couple of quick ones. I saw you launched a couple of databases in the quarter for Epsilon. That sounds good. I\u2019m wondering what the trajectory and the schedule looks like for the planned launches with your clients for the remainder of the year?","Are there any callouts we\u2019d be thinking about whether it be second or third quarter being slightly larger than what we would have seen in the current quarter for instance?","Ed Heffernan","Really, there is probably no real callouts. I mean we probably -- we had Northwestern Mutual but again the timing can always vary as to when actually it launches and you get the revenue stream. So, there is nothing in particular I would point to. Because with any top database builds, you\u2019ve got timing differentials that can obviously influence which quarter to fix.","Dan Perlin \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Right. But, I guess what I\u2019m trying to figure out is not all of them, it seems like have been as we schedule them through have been fully announced. And I\u2019m just wondering are there going to be a couple that come through that maybe we weren\u2019t thinking about. Northwest, obviously, we know about, but my sense was there is a couple of other ones that maybe what\u2019s on?","Ed Heffernan","Yeah. I mean if you look at the Northwestern, you look at Container Store, there are some clients and we\u2019ve always had this issue. Since we\u2019re going to Epsilon, some clients just do not want any of this stuff announced, it\u2019s little different than the other two businesses.","But on average if you want to ask us whether we are tracking to our goal of effectively signing 10 significant new large data base clients, that\u2019s our goal for the year, are we at least 25% of the way through that, I would say we are a bit of ahead of that.","At this point, we\u2019ve announced two. Hopefully, we\u2019ll get some more folks who will allow us to announce it but we like to do 10 significant data base builds announced and then we would also like to have 10 other announcements that may not have a data base component to them.","It could be a large agency, digital agency deal. It could be a data deal, it could be a large email deal. So effectively the bogey for Epi is to sign 20 new clients or in that expansions with existing clients and right now, we are tracking to that 20 bogie for the year.","Dan Perlin \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","And Ed, can we just stand up one for a second, are you seeing across your client base within Epsilon, historically it\u2019s retention of clients, it\u2019s cross selling\/up sell or you\u2019re going after new clients. And I\u2019m just wondering given the current environment where we\u2019ve come from what kind of shift have you seen if any and is that going to play a role in the profitability and or growth rate for Epsilon throughout the year?","Ed Heffernan","Yeah. I mean it\u2019s a great question. I think what you\u2019re seeing is if probably one of our strongest verticals which would be pharma, right, they have huge spend for direct to consumer. I would say that is absolutely coming under pressure that we haven\u2019t seen before. So one of our large verticals, we\u2019ve got 9 out of 10 biggest pharmaceutical firms in the world, that is coming a bit under pressure.","However, coming back what we\u2019re seeing is we\u2019re seeing a very strong growth in areas such as not for profit and now with Aspen on board, we are seeing very nice growth in the auto sector and the telecom sectors.","So I think what we\u2019re seeing here is, there is a continuation no doubt between dollars being diverted away from general spend to this type of highly sophisticated data driven marketing spend. But we\u2019re also seeing at the same time is you are seeing the verticals that are beginning to spool up are ones that haven\u2019t really started spooling up until this year.","So auto, telecom, not for profit, I would say are doing quite well. You have pharma which you\u2019re seeing some pressure and then you will see financial services, which is always a big player. I would say is having an okay year. So overall, you are going to see good results but they are going to come from different verticals.","Dan Perlin \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Okay. And then Bryan, are you seeing a benefit in average ticker per AIR MILES for the issuance side as a result of higher oil prices on year-over-year basis or is that just kind of de minimus as we look at the current quarter in the next couple of quarters.","Bryan Pearson","No. I mean it\u2019s a dollar based offer. So it\u2019s not a volumetric based offer. So as the fuel price goes up, basically depending upon the volume or the pricing, how extreme the pricing is you could see that there would be an impact on the issuance that would come out on the base side.","Having said that, I think Shell has been very supportive of the AIR MILES cash initiative, both from a promotion of it to get their customers signed off and also from a redemption side. And so I\u2019d say that the larger component of increase through the first quarter that we saw from Shell actually came from their promotional activity than it came from fuel price consideration.","Dan Perlin \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Okay. And they are on track to continue that throughout the year?","Bryan Pearson","Yeah. I mean there is always ebbs and flows with respect to budget considerations but that\u2019s kind of the nice thing about our business a little like Epsilon\u2019s business. We have a portfolio sector.","So as Shell spools up, we\u2019re balancing that against what may be happening promotionally in the grocery category or with the retail category. And so between seasonality and between sectors that spool up and spool down, we tend to have a nice balanced growth perspective over time. That\u2019s what we\u2019ve seen over many, many years.","Dan Perlin \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Okay. And then one last quick one for Charles, I think the gross yield on the portfolio was up 30 basis points on a sequential basis, anything to call up there or is it more sloppy payers in the quarter is mix, if you could just highlight that a little bit, I appreciate it. Thanks.","Charles Horn ","Nothing really to point you specifically. Obviously, some of it would be driven by late fees, which does get a little bit of more of the frequency coming through with your first cycle delinquency. Otherwise, I think your gross yield APR\u2019s are consistent, a little bit more coming through for late fee but nothing really to point out.","Dan Perlin \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Okay. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Bob Napoli from William Blair.","Bob Napoli \u2013 William Blair","Great. Thank you for sneaking me in there. Question on credit card, Ed and Charles, are you guys loosely I think over time have suggested that you would like to have -- you want -- didn\u2019t want credit card to be too big of the piece of your earnings. I mean you are generating obviously phenomenal returns in that business and you have lot of opportunity, so should we throw that thought out the window or I think you had talked about half of the earnings at one point?","Ed Heffernan","Yeah. I mean, again right for people who have known us for many years, you are going to have businesses here cycle at different times. We used to say if we could have two out of three cook in, that would be great. We are into a period now where all three businesses are contributing nicely.","Private label, however, is going to be contributing more than its fair share, both this year and next year for sure. We think for couple of reasons, one is as we talked about, you have lower than our run rate history in terms of credit quality. You have funding rates that are all time lows. And we are making it play for sure in private label to let a rip.","And that means let\u2019s get out there and not only sign our traditional clients and spool them up over a period of time, but we do see -- look, we have to be opportunistic here. We are going to leap at what we think is some low hanging fruit here, which are a number of clients that are going to be perfect for our business and we\u2019re going to get them and we are going to bring them on board. And you are going to have higher than anticipated file growth probably over the next two, three years.","That will no doubt swing the contribution from private label to a little bit higher than sort of what we target long term but I never want to turn down our great opportunity in the marketplace. So we\u2019re going to make hay where we can.","At the same time, if you think out just a little bit longer what\u2019s happening, well, we are getting Epsilon, all the pieces all stitched up nice. So we can hit \u201813 and \u201814 at a much stronger rate and that will start beginning to move the needle back the other way. And then obviously Canada is doing well but don\u2019t forget Brazil has been a drag and we are accelerating that, investing in that.","And then probably when the cycle and private label begins to diminish, you are going to see a very large contribution coming in from Brazil. I mean that\u2019s the goal is let\u2019s take advantage where we can and right now the advantage rests with some low hanging fruit in private label, we\u2019re going to grab it. And then we\u2019ll get Epsilon ready to rip it in \u201813, \u201814 and have Brazil come flying in at the end of \u201813 and \u201814 as well and then your balance will be restored.","So it\u2019s a function of we are on track for the long-term balance to remain the same but you\u2019re going to have years where some times the percentages are a little bit higher or a little bit lower. In the end if we can make more money doing it that way, we\u2019ll do it that way.","Bob Napoli \u2013 William Blair","Thank you. And with regards to Brazil, Ed, don\u2019t you have the opportunity when you expanded the new markets to increase your percentage ownership or how does that work. I mean you own 37% and do you want to get over 50%, is that right? When you move into new markets within Brazil, you get the opportunity to increase your ownership, is it?","Ed Heffernan","I don\u2019t think we can really get into the agreements too much. Obviously, right now we\u2019re just building the thing. So we are looking to start the creation of value and that will start to build as we continue to add new people as you go from no one to 1.5 million at the end of last year to 4 million at the end of this year doubling each year, you\u2019re going to build up a pretty valuable franchise down there.","Clearly, we certainly think is valuable. We certainly think there is more value than more we owned but at the same time let\u2019s not forget that there is a very, very strong incentive for the folks who are down there running this thing, very strong incentive for them to run as hard as they can and ramp this thing up. And so we don\u2019t want to do anything to dissent them from doing what they are doing today. And if the timing is right later on and some folks want to exit, we\u2019ll certainly be there.","Bob Napoli \u2013 William Blair","Thanks. And just last question on the card business, the charge-offs, I mean, the delinquencies are still plummeting for you guys and I guess maybe to some seasonality in the first quarter, some positive seasonality on that. Bryan, but it doesn\u2019t look like your charge-offs are going to stop at 5% right now and is that I mean you were in the fours if you go back to 2006 and delinquencies were higher. So I mean we haven\u2019t -- have we seen the end. I mean, when do you think charge-offs bottom and are we going to see and can we see another 100 basis points of decline before that time?","Ed Heffernan","Bob, I don\u2019t think so. I think you will see us on a seasonal basis bottom at the end of this year, early 2013. I think going back to what Ed talked about, we\u2019ll probably bump along for a year or two at these very low rates until we can actually get new originations coming back through.","And then over time, we are going to migrate backup slightly over the unemployment rate. So I don\u2019t think that there is a lot of additional declines to be coming through, but I do think it\u2019s going to moderate probably about the end of year and bottom.","Bob Napoli \u2013 William Blair","Yeah. I think really new thing about private label and the way it works in the way hitting this growth cycle right where we\u2019re hitting it is that, if you look at last year, the file didn\u2019t really go -- grow because of the high payment rates. But we got a great kiss from both funding losses -- funding rates coming down and credit quality improving.","This year we are trying to get in the benny of all through, the files growing again pretty nicely and you are getting a better credit quality and better funding cost. As Charles said, once that -- those other two begin to stabilize and sort of flatten out the next couple of years, the beauty is if we can execute the way we want to then you no longer going to get the kiss from better credit quality or from better funding cost.","But if we\u2019ve locked in our funding costs and the credit quality remains relatively stable for the next couple of years, then if we\u2019re executing on our growth strategy, you are going to more than make up for that with a file that\u2019s growing strongly in the double digits which we didn\u2019t see before. So it all sort of lends itself too, it should be a very, very strong run for the next two, three years we think.","Bob Napoli \u2013 William Blair","Thanks. I\u2019m sorry. One last quick factual one on Phantom shares because I still there\u2019s some confusion, a little bit -- when the amounts, it\u2019s 2013, do you have the exact dates, Charles, 2013 and \u201814, the amount of dollars that you are redeeming and you have all the capital now on the balance sheet for that. You don\u2019t need to raise any additional capital for the -- I mean, you obviously have the opportunity and the ability to raise a lot of capital, but it\u2019s $800 million went in \u201813, $300 million in \u201814?","Charles Horn","Correct. Bob, we already have enough money to fund the maturities as they can do. So you have $805 million that matures in August of 2013, $345 million that matures in May of 2014. So from a liquidity perspective plus the free cash flow we expect to throw off. We\u2019re in a very good shape even if we choose not to go back into the public markets.","Bob Napoli \u2013 William Blair","And of the Phantom shares, how much relates to \u201813, how much relates to \u201814. I know it\u2019s more \u201814 because of the strike price, but \u2026","Charles Horn","I don\u2019t have that stat with me Bob, but again the majority of it will relate to the \u201814 because it had a strike of 47 versus the 2013 debt having a strike, I believe, of around 71, 72.","Bob Napoli \u2013 William Blair","Thank you very much. Nice job.","Ed Heffernan","Thanks.","Operator","That concludes the Q&A portion of the call. We\u2019ll turn it back over to Mr. Heffernan for closing remarks.","Ed Heffernan","Okay. These are my closing remarks. Great quarter, it should be a good year. We will talk to you later.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect."],"1522":["Alliance Data Systems Corporation (NYSE:ADS) Q1 2019 Earnings Conference Call April 25, 2019  8:30 AM ET","Company Participants","Vicky Nakhla - Investor Relations Director, AdvisIRy Partners","Ed Heffernan - President & Chief Executive Officer","Charles Horn - Chief Financial Officer","Conference Call Participants","Sanjay Sakhrani - KBW","Darrin Peller - Wolfe Research","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust","David Scharf - JMP Securities","Ramsey El-Assal - Barclays","Operator","Good morning, and welcome to the Alliance Data First Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all parties have been placed on a listen-only mode. Following today's presentation, the floor will be opened for your questions. [Operator Instructions] In order to view the company's presentation on their website, please remember to turn off the pop-up blocker on your computer.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Ms. Vicky Nakhla of AdvisIRy Partners. Madam, the floor is yours.","Vicky Nakhla","Thank you, operator. By now you should have received a copy of the company's first quarter 2019 earnings release. If you haven't, please call AdvisIRy Partners at 212-750-5800. On the call today, we have Ed Heffernan, President and Chief Executive Officer of Alliance Data; and Charles Horn, Chief Financial Officer of Alliance Data.","Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on today's call and some of the responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties described in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC. Alliance Data has no obligation to update the information presented on the call.","Also on today's call, our speakers will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe will provide useful information for investors. Reconciliation of those measures to GAAP will be posted on the Investor Relations website at alliancedata.com.","With that, I would like to turn the call over to Ed Heffernan. Ed?","Ed Heffernan","Great. Thanks Vicky, and good morning everyone. Joining me today as always is Charles Horn, our CFO. We're going to update you on first quarter results, the pending divestiture of Epsilon, and provide some insights into the ongoing businesses, also some new news that we'll share with you regarding some of the initiatives we've undertaken here at the company to make sure that we have the appropriate footprint on a go-forward basis. So, lots of progress has been made.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Charles.","Charles Horn","Thanks, Ed. Let's go to slide 4 and talk about high level results. Revenue decreased 3% to $1.3 billion, adjusted EBITDA net decreased 9% to $317 million, and core EPS decreased 6% to $3.72 for the first quarter of 2019. These results exclude the Epsilon segment, which has been reclassified as discontinued operations. Overall, results for the quarter were consistent with guidance and reflective of our purposeful shift to more attractive growth verticals and clients within Card Services.","EPS increased 3% to $3.28 for the first quarter of 2019 aided by lower effective tax rate approximately 16% in the first quarter of 2019, compared to approximately 27% in the first quarter of 2018 due to the release of certain tax reserves.","As discussed in the earnings release, we have signed a definitive agreement to sell Epsilon to Publicis Groupe for $4.4 billion. We believe this is a good outcome for several reasons. One, it provides significant liquidity to return capital to shareholders and improve our capital structure. We anticipate a pro forma leverage ratio of about 1.7x.","Two, it allows us to refocus our resources on our market-leading high-growth, high-ROI Card Services business. Three, we can rely significant operational efficiencies at the corporate level, following the separation of Epsilon.","And four, it will be accretive to earnings in the first full year post-closing. Reported results will only have partial year benefits in 2019. In anticipation of the transaction we spent $223 million during the first quarter to repurchase 1.3 million shares of ADS stocks.","Let's go to the next page and starting with LoyaltyOne. Revenue decreased 10% to $204 million for the first quarter. Adjusted for the items highlighted on the slide, AIR MILES revenue was down 3% due to lower redemptions. AIR MILES adjusted EBITDA increased 7% primarily due to lower cost of redemptions of operations. We are increasingly outsourcing our product fulfillment in order to reduce inventory risk and help drive these operational efficiencies.","Issuance was up 3% for the first quarter, mostly driven by strong promotional activity within our grocery vertical. BrandLoyalty's revenue increased 3% on a constant-currency basis due to a strong program performance in Europe, Asia and Brazil. Adjusted EBITDA grew double-digits in constant currency, mostly due to better program mix, excluding the one-time restructuring charge related to lowering our fixed operating cost.","Moving to Card Services. Revenue was down 2% to $1.1 billion driven by lower gross yield, coupled with flat normalized average receivables growth. Adjusted EBITDA net was down 7% to $295 million, essentially in line with our first quarter expectations. Importantly, we are seeing improving net principal loss in delinquency trends. Net loss rates improved 30 basis points to 6.4% and delinquency rates improved 10 basis points to 5.25% signaling a stable credit environment.","I will now turn it over to Ed.","Ed Heffernan","Okay. If you could turn to slide 6, which is Q1 2019, I think overall, I mean, obviously, Charles has covered it, but the first quarter results were consistent with our guidance. We had expected revenue down mid single-digits and core EPS down in the high single-digits before the Epsilon transaction. And we came in at revenue $1.8 billion down 3% and core EPS of $4.07, down 8%.","Again, the entire decline you can attribute to the actions we took in Q4 of last year and that was removing over $2 billion of non-core clients from the card business. And as a result, obviously, you have a grow-over for the first three quarters of this year. But behind it you saw that the active accounts were up almost 11%. So that will fade as the year progresses of the negative drag, and we'll flip nicely as we move into the latter stages of this year.","As Charles also mentioned, we took in 1.3 million shares during the quarter and our corporate leverage ratio stayed a very comfortable 2.4 times. And that's a rate that on a pro forma basis is going to drift down quite a bit post Epsilon.","On the LoyaltyOne side, also the AIR MILES revenue and adjusted EBITDA are down 12%, but up 7% on the EBITDA side on a constant currency basis. We also had another adjustment where we had to net gross rev to net rev as we continue to outsource some of our merchandising.","AIR MILES issued was up nicely at 3% and that essentially will drive growth in the financials on a go-forward basis. The burn rate was 87% compared with 96% the year before. The lower burn rate pressures revenue growth in the short-term, but also gives us lots of flexibility to get people more excited on the ultimate redemptions and the programs that we run.","BrandLoyalty revenue and adjusted EBITDA were up 3% and 14%, respectively on a constant currency basis and that excludes a relatively modest charge that we took at BrandLoyalty to lower the fixed cost structure on a go-forward basis.","With that, we'll turn to Epsilon. And Charles why don't you walk us through the deal itself?","Charles Horn","Sure. So, let's flip over to page seven. And as we talked about we have now signed a definitive agreement to sell Epsilon for $4.4 billion and we expected to close either late Q2 or early Q3.","We selected Publicis -- I'll talk a little bit more about this since this is really our first time to discuss it openly with you. We selected them as one of the process due to a number of considerations, including certainty and speed of close, fully committed financing and the opportunity to develop a deeper relationship post-closing.","As you can see from the slide, we set it up so we can see it in two formats. It was an asset transaction from a tax purpose which means the buyer paid us for certain tax benefits received.","The calculation on the slide shows process of $4 billion which is without the tax benefit and $4.4 billion with the tax reimbursement. And when we evaluated it, we have to look at the multiple of the transaction. We also considered the reduction and cost at the corporate level from the infrastructure we no longer needed to support the Epsilon transaction.","So, if you look at the slide the EBITDA foregone is roughly $393 million. After this transaction we're getting either $4.4 billion if you want to look at it on a gross up basis or $4 billion on a net basis which is still a 10.2 to an 11.2 multiple, which we believe is very fair to our shareholders. ","There's been a lot of questions about the tax leakage seemed high at $800 million. Again, if you have to net it was an asset deal. We will pay $800 million in taxes via IRS. We received $400 million roughly from Publicis for the benefit of the tax yield. So, the net tax leakage was approximately $400 million.","The remaining amount we'll look to go for debt retirement. Anywhere from $1.9 billion to $2.4 billion will go to debt retirement. And then we also have a good amount left over for share repurchases in the range of about $1.1 billion.","Ed Heffernan","Okay. Slide eight. Let's go to Card Services. Again, if you look at the picture we're trying to develop here in terms of the momentum that cards is building as we move throughout the year, right now, it looks quite promising in terms of a number of key metrics the first being, of course, new client signings.","And a lot of this again from the client signings you've heard us talk about this the last couple of years, we have been pivoting fairly dramatically away from signings of additional as we call it mall based specialty apparel which is really coming under a lot of pressure. And we've been really diversifying the portfolio into what we believe are the healthiest high growth verticals out there that also have a strong desire for a loyalty type card program.","And so, you just look at the clients that we signed just at the beginning of the year Houzz, which is a very large e-com -- pure e-commerce home furnishings entity. We also signed Sephora, which I think everyone knows, in the beauty space. And then, we just released Burlington, which is in a vertical that is away from the mall, but is concentrated in what we call the discount department store sector which is actually one part of the retail space that is actually doing quite well. So, the off-mall discount department store vertical is something that seems to be resonating with consumers today. And so that's why I think this would be a very nice add. ","If you just look at the year-to-date signings, we're already at a $2 billion vintage, meaning that when these three names spin-up over the next three years to sort of a steady-state tender share, we would expect them combined to add roughly $2 billion to the portfolio. So, these are very significant clients. They're good clients in good verticals and consistent with our plan of -- let's just not grow the portfolio, let's grow it with the right sustainable strong partners so that we can move forward in this new retail environment.","Second is, if you were to look back over the last several years, again, the pressure that we all know is facing certain retail verticals, we noted that many years ago. And so we started this pivot, so to speak back in probably 2015. And between 2015 and the clients we just discussed, they now represent roughly $5 billion of the card receivables in our portfolio. When fully ramped up, we expect them to represent close to $13 billion. So there's a ton of runway to go here, on these newer healthier-type vintages that we've been signing over the last several years. So the future looks quite bright and we're seeing it in the growth and where the growth is coming in the file.","If you were to look at the active client receivable growth of approximately 11%, you can track that to the 5% decline in reported average receivables with the delta being the decision that we made in the fourth quarter of last year to basically say, look we can continue to have dampened growth going forward, or we can find those clients that can no longer benefit from our services and let's move them out, so we don't have a dampening effect for years to come. And that's sort of the big chunk that we took out in Q4 which will pave the way nicely for the newer-type vintages. What it means of course is that you have a grow over for the front half of this year and you'll see the reported number eventually start migrating towards the active number and by definition will equal the active number by the end of the year.","We do expect to exit 2019 at a 15% growth rate, which would put the portfolio ending this year at roughly $20.5 billion. And for those of you trying to tick and tie the math, it's fortunately in this case fairly straightforward. You've got roughly a 11% growth from the actives. We know that actives and reported will converge at the end of the year and so the question is, how do we make the final four points from 11% to 15%? And that's going to come from really two sources. If you just continue to grow the portfolio at the rate it's been growing, you'd end the year at about $19.9 billion. And so the question is how do we get from $19.9 billion to $20.5 billion which is about $600 million? It's not a large number, but it is a number that we're very focused on. And it's a combo of as we load on some of the newer client signings that will be some of the gap.","In addition, there are a number of modest-sized files that are out there in verticals that are very attractive to us, whether it's jewelry or consumer electronics places like that, that we think would tuck-in very nicely and get us comfortably to that $20.5 billion. And that's really, the whole game for the year is we want to exit this year with active growth, equal reported growth equals 15%, equals $20.5 billion. And that is the jump for 2020. So that will really drive the growth in the file, which of course drives the revenue and everything else.","And so then we turn our attention to okay, but what about on the expense side? Are there concerns there? Obviously, on the big question that is always out there in terms of what about credit quality? What's going on there? And I can comfortably say at this point that that is not an issue. You'll see that the credit quality is stable to actually improving. Now we assume stability as sort of the base case here, but we're actually seeing some improvement over prior year. And of course, those are the two metrics you look at delinquency and net charge-off rates.","Delinquency rates were actually below prior year at 5.25% on this last release. For those of you who had to suffer through our noise that was in the delinquency numbers for quite some time you'll recall we talked about the wedge and how the wedge needed to close and then there was noise in there. Well, the wedge was closed, or more so and it's a year-plus after we had anticipated. But fortunately, all that noise did not eventually flow through to the loss rates. So it truly was noise.","So delinquency rates are in good shape. Charge-off rates are actually running below prior year, and we're comfortably tracking to 6% or better for the full year, if people are concerned about well wait a minute, it's below last year and you came in at roughly 6%, but you're still running a little bit above 6% right now. That's a typical seasonal pattern for us. So it's very typical the front half. You're going to see, essentially the first quarter being above 6%, then you start trending towards 6% and then you start trending below it. That's just how the portfolio behaves. So that gives us a great deal of comfort on the credit quality side.","So again from the new signings of the healthier verticals, the burn-off of the non-core clients, we're on pace to have a nice jump-off of 15% growth going into 2020 along with that stable to improving credit quality all of which suggests, a very strong momentum as we move through the next couple of quarters of grow-over. A couple of other items, we have diversified our funding base for the first time. As most of you know, we have funded exclusively through the institutional market meaning asset-backed securities, bank conduits, institutional CDs things like that. But we have now opened up our own retail deposit platform as a new source of funding. It will help diversify things, give us some flexibility to\/or between different rates at the appropriate time. And that's spooling up pretty nicely.","So that was a big effort that is now officially online. And then finally, even though we're focusing on this sort of 15% jump-off rate, we're still targeting ROEs for the full year of 30% or greater. I mean, that's still our mantra of we expect to grow two to 3x what the marketplace does with ROEs of two to 3x, what other folks are doing. And so, so far from the core business perspective, we're very happy with the way our cards has kicked off the year. Okay. Charles?","Charles Horn","Yes, let's flip over to Page nine and talk about the first quarter credit metrics. And as we execute the strategy that Ed just delineated quite well, we will see some short-term pressure on some of our metrics. Specifically, we will see our credit sales decline as it takes some time for our newer healthier programs to spool up.","Let me emphasize this is purely a timing issue. Similarly, we saw an expected decline in the reported average receivables and gross yields and again as it takes some time for the newer portfolios to fully ramp. Our total gross yield is down 70 basis points primarily due to mix. New programs are growing much faster than our older programs and it really takes a new program three to four years to hit a run rate gross yield.","Longer term, the newer programs may ramp to slightly lower gross yields compared for older programs due to a couple of reasons: one higher average balances; and two better credit quality cardholders. So we would expect to mitigate any pressure there through lower net principal loss rates and lower overall operating expenses.","So ROE continues to be in good shape, if you look for the quarter 32% versus the prior year of 30%. We believe long-term the new programs can get to that 30%-plus ROE. If we turn to operating expenses, they were up 130 basis points from the prior year. That's primarily due to the mark-to-market accounting on the held-for-sale receivables. As you can see on the slide that was an 85 basis point impact.","It is important to note as we talked about that our credit metrics have improved and they continue to improve. Accordingly, our allowance reservable receivables has decreased to 6.2% at March 31, 2019 approximating 12 months forward coverage. We would expect that reserve percentage to be relatively stable as the year progresses. Ed?","Ed Heffernan","Okay. Thanks, Charles. Turning to slide 10, which essentially is just the picture of what we talked about. But I certainly find it has been useful in the past, which is your reporting portfolio growth of minus 5% should that be an issue? And the answer is well when you discontinue over $2 billion of these non-core clients, you're going to face this type of grow-over. So the active clients which is what we're all focused on and where the end of the year jump-off will actually be was up a healthy 11%.","Again I spend a lot of time on the newer types of healthy verticals that we've been signing. And even though we've signed a ton of business, it's still at the early stages of ramping up, but it's only $5 billion of our $17 billion file. This $5 billion will eventually be closer to $13 billion when everything's fully signed up. But they're growing quickly and the transformation of the portfolio frankly has been fairly dramatic.","So we think everything is on pace. And again, the delta from the 11% to our jump-off of 15% will be filled with a combination of some of the newer programs beginning to ramp up that we've signed recently as well as there's probably half a dozen modest-size portfolios out there. If we can get our hands on say two or three of them, we'll be in very good shape to plug the hole. So that's where we are. We feel pretty good about it.","The following page I always find helpful to look at half historically this business has delivered this sort of growth rate that we keep talking about this sort of strong double digit sometimes in the teens over and over. And again and if you look over the last eight years and where we expect to end this year on average we've grown 17% a year for an 8-year period.","So it's not something that's a wish and a dream, it's something that's actually happening. You'll see that in 2018 we took that big step backwards to say, okay let's clean out the clients that are in liquidation or bankruptcy or really could just no longer benefit from our services. That gives us a clean run to return to that very strong historical growth rate. And right now I feel very comfortable that that's where we're heading.","Next it's a little bit of a busy chart, but the loss rates obviously when they stabilize or improve versus prior year we get fewer and fewer questions about pressure on losses. I guess that's just a given, but we do want to remind people of what we're targeting, where we're at, where we want to be going forward. And again, if you go back sort of the 20 years that we've been doing this that 6% loss rate level for us is the appropriate level.","And you'll see that with 2019 we have been talking for the last couple of years of hey, it's returned to long-term trend. We're now three years in and very comfortably stabilized at 6% or slightly better. And we also get the question of why 6%? Why not 3%? Why not 4% like some of the large banks with their bank cards? And we do under-write to specifically target a 6% on purpose. I mean that's our goal is to be at that level. So, we don't view 6% as something we want to necessarily improve on. We have found over the last 20 years that 6% is the optimal rate for us. It provides us with the right mix of shoppers in the portfolios that provide us with the best lifetime value on a per-card basis on a PV basis while also providing us with a very steady ROE of 30% or higher.","So, we do this on purpose. It is a different animal than the traditional Visa\/MasterCard that the big banks do. That's not the sandbox that we're playing in, but that does lend itself to the obvious question of, oh my gosh, what happens if you're lending to higher loss rate customers? And the answer is well we're really not. And if you look at the Great Recession, what you'll find is that our volatility was quite a bit less than what you would consider the prime MasterCard\/Visa-type account whose losses went from say 4%, 3%, up to 10% and ours went from 6% to 9%.","And the reason behind that is we manage this focused on optimizing our ROE with minimizing the risk through credit lines and active management of those credit lines. And because we're not looking to be the number one card in someone's wallet or purse, we're focused on the brand and the value of the card at the brand.","And as a result, our credit lines are so much lower than a traditional bank card. And so during times of stress it takes five or six households in our universe to go bad to equal just one of the more traditional big bank card players.","And that's a very nice risk ratio that we're comfortable with and it actually played out in the great recession. So, think of us as managing to optimize ROE while minimizing the risk through very moderate-sized credit lines and it's worth quite well over the long-term.","Okay, now for the exciting stuff here which is guidance, run rates, how everything's going to mix together in this thing, and where we're going to come out on the other side. Clearly, this is for someone smarter than I, so, Charles why don't you go ahead?","Charles Horn","Thanks Ed. So, we're now on slide 13. And what we're doing here is we're breaking it up saying what would guidance be had Epsilon not been considered at the beginning of the year? And ultimately what do we think the pro forma run rate accretion is as part of the transaction?","So, on the top part of the schedule, you can see we reclassified Epsilon as discontinued ops as of 1\/1. We've removed in the top part of schedule to establish a new starting point for revenue and core EPS.","It's important to note that interest expense associated with $1.9 billion of senior notes we know we're going to retire has been allocated to discontinued operations. New guidance is now revenue of $5.8 billion and core EPS of $18.47 before we apply the use of proceeds in anticipated cost reductions. What we'll do is we'll update you each quarter as the guidance each quarter as actions were actually taken.","The bottom part of the schedule shows the pro forma -- on a pro forma basis the anticipated accretion of the transaction compared to our original core EPS guidance of $22 from 2019.","As discussed previously, we expect the net proceeds to approximate $3.5 billion. Subject to Board of Director approval, we initially planned to retire the $1.9 billion of senior notes leaving $1.6 billion available for additional debt retirement and share repurchases.","The projected adjustments above assume an additional $500 million in senior debt retirement and $1.1 billion in share repurchases. It also includes a substantial reduction in corporate expense related to this core of Epsilon. Run rate core EPS assumes these items occur as of 1\/1\/2019. The bottom-line is we believe the Epsilon transaction provides a 3% to 5% lift to the original guidance.","Now, if we go to the next page you'll see a number of different things. We've given you new guidance for the year excluding any potential actions or use of proceeds. We'll update that each quarter as we go financially execute. So, what that essentially means is you're going to see reported number for the year less than $22, but obviously, more than $18.47.","And then as we move forward as the pro forma, the run rate assuming everything's done as of 1\/1, you can see core EPS guidance of $22.67 to $23.17. All will eventually take place on 1\/1. We know that won't happen, but we do think it establishes a good jump-off point as we look at 2020.","The other point I'll make on this slide is the core -- is the GAAP EPS accretion is expected to be very strong 3x that of core. And if you think about the reason why Epsilon had substantial stock compensation and acquired intangible expense and with that going away that makes a pretty big difference it also really helps close the gap between core EPS and GAAP EPS. Epsilon represents close to 60% of the spread between the two and so you're going to see the numbers really start coming in as we move forward on a reporting basis. Ed?","Ed Heffernan","Okay. Let's finish up here. Again talking about the actual business itself, I think I've spent enough time talking about the move towards the healthier growth verticals. It absolutely is working the demand for the product continues to be quite strong and again there's a lot of runway between what's been spooled up in the portfolio of $5 billion versus the eventual $13 billion out of these vintages that we expect.","On the other side, the divestitures of the non-strategic clients was completed in Q4. We're now through two quarters of the grow-over. We've got another one or so to go and then we should be in good shape there and we'll no longer have to talk about active versus reported since they'll be the same.","Tracking to -- in 2019 at the $20.5 billion, up 15% which should be the run rate as we move into 2020, while at the same time looking at very stable to improving credit quality. With all of that, we're going to stick to our target ROE equal or better than the 30%. So that's really the bulk of the company.","LoyaltyOne is dead on with the plan that we planned for the year and so no change there. On the Epsilon side, Charles talked about the agreement to sell for $4.4 billion in cash. I can tell you that the process itself while lengthy, I think, we came out at a good spot. The idea of having $4.4 billion of committed financing and all cash with a high level degree of certainty of close were all very important factors going into this.","At the same time, the strategic fit for Epsilon within Publicis itself makes all the sense in the world, where Publicis is going to be using Epsilon as a core engine to then take those products out to its massive customer base which is one of the things that frankly we didn't have here. And so it certainly strategically makes a ton of sense from the side of Publicis.","One of the -- I guess, the new news here if there is any is the fact that we were unable to discuss one portion of the deal until really today, which is going along with this deal will be a $70 million run rate elimination in expenses for all those corporate expenses that went with all the various Epsilon acquisitions over several years. So we did not highlight the reduction -- the permanent reduction of $70 million of expenses until today, primarily because it has to coincide with a number of obviously, employees who will have -- who will be impacted by this and we wanted to make sure everything was coordinated.","So if you took the purchase price and you added in the benefits of the $70 million of savings in run rate which is $1 to $1.15 a share, you'll see where we came out where this is a very healthy multiple given what we're planning on doing. So that's probably the newest news that we have out there and we wanted to make sure everyone understood it. Obviously, we have some actions that we need to take at the company sooner rather than later.","Overall, the core EPS run rate is tracking as expected and will exceed the original guidance as we begin to move on these other items. And the GAAP EPS accretion is 3 times the core EPS accretion as Charles mentioned as these non-cash charges are -- a majority of them are over at Epsilon. So those go away.","I like the fact that the pro forma leverage is very significantly reduced from 2.4 to 1.7, which gives us a lot of flexibility as we move forward. That does not preclude us from doing the $1 billion plus more of additional share buybacks and that will also benefit shareholders. So we expect to exit this year and a lot of the noise and the moving pieces will be in the rearview mirror, but we're doing everything we can to make sure we have a cleaner narrative with a very healthy high-growth engine pushing into 2020 and that's pretty much it.","At this point, I think, we will now move to Q&A. Operator, Q&A?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Thanks. Good morning. And congrats on the Epsilon sale. Ed, could you just talk about sort of, the remaining strategic actions that might be contemplated in the future? Or is this it?","Ed Heffernan ","Yes, it's a fair question. I think Sanjay, frankly we're kind of focused on the run rate expenses we need to take care of in getting Epsilon closed and getting a couple more big names into the card portfolio right now. Obviously, there are other parts that we are continuing to look at. And to the extent there's something that we want to talk about when there's an announcement to be made if there is one we'll make it at that point.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Okay, great. I guess second question on the Private Label business, you talked about the retail deposit pool and how you're growing that. How large can you conceivably get in that part of your funding structure? Because a lot of your peers have a lot more of those types of deposits. Is the contemplation that you become majority retail-deposit-funded? Or is there any other action you could take to accelerate that?","And then my final question on the card business as well as the Publicis announcement, I guess, will there be any step-up in costs because you don't have Epsilon to run some of the marketing process? And then you mentioned the opportunity to work closely with Publicis in the future. Could you just maybe expand on that? Thank you. ","Ed Heffernan ","I'm trying to remember them all so I'll go with the first one which is the retail deposit platform. You're exactly right. It's something that's pretty attractive. It's a huge whatever it is $10 trillion market that's out there. You know, what's the right ratio? I think at some point, I think, it's fair to say Sanjay, a minimum of one-third of our funding we'd like to see come from that source and we can flex that up as we so choose.","Frankly some of this comes from our experience during the great recession. As I'm sure you can painfully recall when liquidity was drying up all over the place, for us having a combo platter of access to the asset backed bond market for longer-term funding, the conduit market, the jumbo CDs and then the retail deposit platform.","We do think all four of those are important liquidity devices for us. But certainly the retail deposit thing is going to grow, I would say to at least one-third before we make the decision of do we really want to crank it up to half? The next question?","Charles Horn","Epsilon support to Card Services.","Ed Heffernan","Yeah, the Epsilon support to Card Services. Cards will be a significant client of Epsilon. Those contracts have always been at arms length, and therefore they won't change going forward. Cards is going to be using on a go-forward basis a lot of the services used before, the technology used in the loyalty platforms, a lot of the digital communication technology, and probably the largest being the Conversant piece, which will allow us to go out into the marketplace and help source not only new card members but also new clients -- new customers for our clients.","So all those things have already been in place. They're a part of longer term servicing arrangements. So there won't be any step-up in costs from that perspective. And was there one other piece Sanjay? Okay next.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research. And analyst, please remember one question and one follow-up question.","Darrin Peller","All right. Thanks guys. Maybe just touch on first, the feedback you're hearing from your clients on the card side, just given the announcement of the Epsilon sale like I'm sure you've had some discussions with some of your legacy older clients. Curious to hear how it's coming back in.","And then guys just the capital structure that we should expect for you to be able to operate your business that you're comfortable managing the business going forward with and without Epsilon, I guess without LoyaltyOne potentially also what would be -- how would we think about that? Thanks.","Ed Heffernan","Yeah. I think from the feedback from the clients, I think it's been fairly muted other than, hey can I continue to count on the technology that we've been accessing in the past? And again that's the -- that Conversant piece to go out and find incremental new business as well as the loyalty platforms and the digital communication platforms.","And all of that is -- the answer is a resounding yes. We think it's one of the critical advantages that we have out there. And as a result as long as they're comfortable with that frankly I would say some of them are not displeased with the fact that we're continuing to really narrow the focus of our area of expertise into payment services and cards. So I would say from that perspective it's a bit cleaner story with the clients.","In terms of capital structure going forward, from our perspective we've always said that a leverage ratio of -- we didn't really want to creep above 3x in terms of leverage. The pro forma is going to take us down to 1.7. Obviously that's very comfortable in terms of flexibility.","What we'll do from that point going forward is we'll likely reduce it even more unless there's a big opportunity in cards that could offer us another step-up in growth. But from a capital structure you should consider there's going to be a lot of free cash flow coming off of this company and a combo platter of some deleveraging as well as we talked about some significant share repurchases is something that we'd be focused on.","Darrin Peller","All right. That's helpful. Just for my quick follow-up, you guys have done well signing new digital oriented fast growth clients. I mean, when we think about the 15% growth rate and you're even including some portfolio that's obviously the trend that would be for these faster growth types of entities.","I just want to make sure that even without Epsilon being exclusively tied to you guys, you have the differentiated -- because that really was differentiated offerings I think that helped you win some of these clients. Is there still some exclusive differentiation that Epsilon will just provide for you and the guys have built in-house that will allow you to keep letting those digital oriented online type clients going forward? And thanks again guys.","Ed Heffernan","Yeah. Obviously we can't discuss what the services agreements have, but this is what we do. I mean this is -- we're not -- you can almost think of what are the markets we're not going after. We're not going after these massive general purpose co-brand type programs that the big banks go after.","We're going after our bread-and-butter, which is the high touch personalized type service with the ability to communicate to the clients' customers on a one-to-one basis, which means all that digital stuff and technology, we still retain that 500 person group of experts within the card group itself that will utilize the Epsilon and Conversant technology. So the product offerings we have should continue to be unique in the marketplace.","Darrin Peller","All right. Thanks guys.","Operator","And your next question is from the line of Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust.","Andrew Jeffrey","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Ed, one of the things I think investors are trying to wrap their heads around is they envision ADS a pure-play Card Services business is just how you stack up versus the competition. I know quantitatively you've talked about ROE and relative growth. And I think those are important things. But can you frame up, why as you move toward this pure play model, investors should perhaps pay a premium for ADS versus some of your peers?","Ed Heffernan","Yeah. Again, I'd say we're a little bit different from our peers. But to hit your question dead on, the easiest way to put it is, yes, to the extent we keep pedaling the bike, the way we have been, you're going to see a growth rate that's 2x to 3x what the market's doing and you're going to have ROEs 2x to 3x what the market's doing. So from a purely financial metric perspective, that certainly would suggest that we're on a much faster track with much higher levels of cash flow generation.","Aside from that, from an actual product perspective, as you know, we have focused on a certain portion of the market that we think is quite large and that portion of the market does not mean necessarily massive clients with multibillion-dollar portfolios, but we're very good at those brands that are growing fast that are heavy in the digital space, but also have an offline presence as well.","We are focused on the high-end customer care, the high touch, as well as offering sort of the seamless frictionless-type experience for the card member. Those are things that you can do when you have that as your model. You have a platform that is used to dealing with clients that are -- that have a couple-hundred-million-dollars of receivables and isn't reliant upon massive balances and $10 billion-type portfolios.","And that's just what we're geared towards. So as long as there are growth opportunities with clients who want the high-end brand and loyalty program that aren't really attracted to the big banks, that's our sweet spot. And as long as we stay there, we think there's huge growth. We think it's about a $50 billion portfolio market and we're at around $18 billion right now.","Andrew Jeffrey","Okay. I appreciate that. And then, would you also argue that through a cycle, you can deliver attributes like you just described?","Ed Heffernan","Absolutely. I mean, the -- one of the best test cases for us was the great recession, which I know a lot of people don't want to revisit. But the fact is that, because the returns that we have are 2x to 3x, as you would call it, the peer group, we have a lot more leeway to actually take advantage of downturns when others pull in their horns and cut credit and everything else.","We actually use that as an opportunity to step in and actually grow and bring on even additional clients, because of that flexibility. And knowing that, our loss experience, the volatility is much, much lower than these big general-purpose bankcards that everyone thinks is so safe.","As I said, it takes five or six households in our world to equal the write-off of one big general-purpose player. So we use the times of weakness as growth opportunities and you should definitely expect us to put more capital into the growth if there's actually a pullback in the economy itself.","Andrew Jeffrey","Thanks a lot.","Ed Heffernan","Yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Scharf with JMP Securities.","David Scharf","Hi. Good morning and thanks for taking my questions. Two here. Ed, the first is on how you want to think about sort of visibility into closing out the year at that $20.5 billion portfolio level in the context of what we're seeing with credit sales growth.","And maybe the question is more a point of clarification. There are clearly timing issues, as you ramp up new programs, but the credit sales growth for active accounts seems to be decelerating. I mean, it's just at 4% this first quarter.","Is that just, sort of, a denominator, or just the effect of new programs that have been layered on that haven't started to ramp up yet? I'm trying to get a sense for come September, where that credit sales growth figure, the spending level for those active accounts should be for us to get comfort in closing out the year at close at $20 billion.","Ed Heffernan","Yes. No, it's an excellent question. I mean, over -- as I say, over the long term the growth rate in sales and portfolio growth should converge to the same growth rate, right? Now there are going to be times when your sales growth is less than your portfolio growth and times when your sales growth is going to be greater than your portfolio growth.","And, obviously, when you're in a period where you're spooling up a bunch of brand new clients from scratch, you're going to have a lot of sales, but it won't stick to your AR. So you're going to have much higher sales growth than AR growth.","We're in a position now where, yes, we have a lot of stuff spooling up, but we still have the very large core client base that's still sitting there. They're growing at a pretty modest pace. I would expect as the year progresses and we continue to see some of these, the Sephoras of the world and the Ultas of the world and IKEAs of the world and names like that that you'll begin to see the sales growth rate begin to pick up and accelerate as we move through the rest of the year. So I'd give it a couple of quarters and you should see that metric continue to creep up.","David Scharf","Got it and that's helpful. And just a follow-up on the loyalty side, I appreciate you kind of not necessarily dodging, but sort of kicking the can down the road a little on an earlier question about the ultimate state of that segment. But I'm wondering kind of lost in the bullet points here is this sort of $8 million restructuring charge at BrandLoyalty. And can you give us a sense for both BrandLoyalty and the AIR MILES business whether there are any others sort of excesses or restructurings that you think need to be undertaken either as a continuing operation or to potentially make it a little more attractive for a buyer?","A \u2013 Ed Heffernan","Yes. And I'm not offended. You can say I dodged it because I did. What we want to do is we believe that the AIR MILES business itself has characteristics of obviously a top three brand in Canada. Its longer-term growth rate, profile is one of mid-single digits topline mid-single digits EBITDA, very robust free cash flow, not a lot of CapEx. So that's sort of the profile there.","With BrandLoyalty, we need to get it back to what it has been traditionally which is essentially a 10% or more topline-type growth vehicle but much lower margins than the AIR MILES business. And so they've both been frankly a bit up and down and not consistent over the years. So what we're doing is we're trying to get the cost structures in place where we can return to those types of metrics for those businesses.","And as long as they deliver that type of profile that's something that would be extremely attractive both internally to the company or externally as well. But again the lesson from the Epsilon transaction when we tried to bring people along was that there seemed to be nothing, but a certain level of disappointment at how slow things were moving. And so at that point -- so we're just basically -- if there's something to say we'll say it. But we want to make sure first and foremost both of those businesses return to where they need to be.","Q \u2013 David Scharf","Okay. Thanks a lot.","A \u2013 Ed Heffernan","We'll take one more. Yeah, you bet. One more?","Operator","And your final question comes from the line of Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays.","Q \u2013 Ramsey El-Assal","Hi guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to ask kind of a broader -- ask for your sort of broader view on the addressable market and maybe in the context of the portfolio repositioning that you're undertaking. Has the addressable market now that you've kind of ring-fenced off pieces the retail market that is a little bit challenging, has that impacted your kind of the way you're viewing the addressable market? Has it shrunk? Is the same -- is there the same runway in the business that there was prior?","A \u2013 Ed Heffernan","Yes it's a great question. Actually you're exactly right. You had -- the traditional core for us has shrunk. The newer verticals which thankfully everyone seems to be climbing on the bus of \"hey I don't understand my customers as well as I should. Hey I want to communicate with them. Hey there's a lot of clutter out there. How do I communicate them -- with them on a one-to-one personalized basis with an offer that has the right discount or the right number of important points at the right time with the right cadence, all that stuff that we specialize in?\"","And so I would say that two, three years ago, we view the overall market -- our sandbox so to speak is roughly $40 billion for the portfolio. If you shrink what we traditionally went in but you added in the big new verticals of pure e-comm of beauty, travel areas like that we're currently running around $50 billion, $52 billion seems to be the appropriate market size for us right now. So you take away from some. You add some others. And right now, it looks like we're -- it grew a little bit.","Q \u2013 Ramsey El-Assal","Okay. And then just last quick follow-up for me. Can you comment on Charles' role now and the amount of time he'll be sticking around? Will we be graced with his voice on the next earnings call? Is he sticking around through maybe some of these strategic options that you're exploring? Or is there a search underway for a replacement?","A \u2013 Ed Heffernan","Yes. I mean he's like gum on my shoe, right? I mean it's -- Charles is -- I mean he's sitting right across from me, so I'll probably let him chime in here. But he had expressed an interest I think it was last fall that he's done his 10 years and he thinks that's probably enough. We've kept asking him to hang around because we had some additional stuff going on here. How long he chooses to stay is his call, but for sure we're not assuming he is going to be hanging around here forever. And I'll kick it over to you Charles in terms of what you want to say.","A \u2013 Charles Horn","Sure. So the way I look at it is obviously we've been quite busy with Epsilon. We have a number of other initiatives underway as well. Obviously, a lot of moving pieces. So what I agree to do is stick around through August. Obviously, I'm prepared to help anyway I can support in the search for the employment of the next CFO. I think maybe a little bit longer just provide some continuity as we execute some of these initiatives.","A \u2013 Ed Heffernan","Yes. So there's no hard and fast but it's -- every time we ask him to kick the can down the road, he seems to be getting a little bit more cranky. So we're heading in the right direction, no worries.","Q \u2013 Ramsey El-Assal","Thanks a lot.","Ed Heffernan","Okay. Thank you everyone. We look forward to our next update. Bye-bye.","Operator","Thank you again for joining today's conference. This does conclude today's call.

[Operator Instructions]. In order to view the company's presentation on their website, please remember to turn off your pop-up blockers on your computer. ","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host for today, Ms. Vicky Nakhla of AdvisIRy Partners. Madam, the floor is yours.","Viktoriia Nakhla","Thank you, Operator. By now, you should have received a copy of the company's fourth quarter and full year 2018 earnings release. If you haven't, please call AdvisIRy Partners at 212-750-5800. On the call today, we have Ed Heffernan, President and Chief Executive Officer of Alliance Data; and Charles Horn, Chief Financial Officer of Alliance Data. ","Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on today's call and some of the responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties described in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC. Alliance Data has no obligation to update the information presented on the call. ","Also on today's call, our speakers will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe will provide useful information for investors. Reconciliations for those measures to GAAP will be posted on the Investor Relations website at alliancedata.com. ","With that, I would like to turn the call over to Ed Heffernan. Ed?","Edward Heffernan","All right. Thanks, Vicky, and good morning, everyone. Joining me today, as always, is Charles Horn, our CFO. He's going to update you first on the full year results. I'll wrap up '18 and then we'll shift over to '19 with our guidance and our thoughts. We'll keep this relatively brief, so that we'll have plenty of time for Q&A. So Charles?","Charles Horn","Thanks, Ed. Pro forma revenue increased 5% to $8.1 billion, adjusted EBITDA net increased 7% to $2.1 billion and core EPS increased 17% to $22.72 for full year 2018. Revenue came in short of our initial guidance. Conversely, our core EPS achieved the midpoint for the year. EPS increased 24% to $17.49 for full year 2018, aided by a lower effective tax rate, approximately 27% in 2017 compared to approximately 21% in 2018. We were active during 2018 transitioning Card Services toward more attractive clients and verticals. We sold $1.2 billion of held-for-sale receivables during 2018 and ended 2018 with $1.95 billion in held-for-sale receivables, with the goal of selling the majority of the balance early in 2019. ","From an accounting perspective, held-for-sale receivables are removed from card receivables and the related allowance for loan loss. They also no longer impact delinquency or principal loss rates. In addition, provision for loan loss expense is no longer recognized after the reclassification to held-for-sale but, rather, the market value of these receivables is continuously adjusted through a charge recorded in operating expenses. ","The mark-to-market charges on held-for-sale receivables were over $100 million in 2018. Optically, the different classification makes provision expense look low and operating expenses look high. During 2018, we spent $443 million on share repurchases and $125 million on dividends. In addition, we reduced our corporate debt by $342 million during the year, lowering our corporate leverage ratio from 2.7x to 2.3x, well below our covenant of 3.5x. Turning into the segments on the next page. Starting with LoyaltyOne, pro forma revenue increased 4% to $1.4 billion. AIR MILES pro forma revenue decreased 3% versus the prior year, primarily due to lower redemptions. AIR MILES issued were flat for the year, as we saw a pullback in promotional activity by our sponsors in the fourth quarter. BrandLoyalty's revenue increased double digits for the year, but product mix and higher-than-expected expenses kept adjusted EBITDA essentially flat. ","Epsilon's revenue decreased 4% to $2.2 billion, while adjusted EBITDA was $475 million, consistent with last year. The decline in revenue was primarily due to double-digit declines in our agency and site-based product offerings. Despite the top line decrease, we were able to maintain adjusted EBITDA due to expense control and a positive shift in product mix. Lastly, Card Services revenue increased 10% to $4.6 billion, while adjusted EBITDA net increased 11% to $1.5 billion. ","Average receivables increased 8%, while active card receivables increased to robust 23% for 2018. Net loss rates were 6.1%, the same as the prior year, aided by an improving recovery rate. The reserve rate at year-end was 6.1% on reservable receivables, down slightly as a rate from 2017 due to improving loss trends. The delinquency rate remains elevated due to a slowing growth rate in cards receivables, one the industry we call primarily growth map. ","I will now turn it back to Ed.","Edward Heffernan","Great. Thanks, Charles. If you'll turn to the slide entitled 2018 Full Year. A bit of this is repetitive, but just to hit the key bullet points. For the non-card segments, which would be the Epsilon and LoyaltyOne parts of the company, again, with Epsilon about $2.2 billion in revs and $475 million on the EBITDA side. It is a business that has a mix of growing and stable as well as declining products. And primarily on the declining side, the agency and the traditional site-based display offerings are in decline. but the margin itself continues to improve as we're shifting to the more tech-based solutions. On the LoyaltyOne side, again, that consist of two primary businesses: one, the AIR MILES business based out of Canada; as well as our BrandLoyalty business based out of the Netherlands. Combined, we call that LoyaltyOne. They did $1.4 billion in pro forma revenue and a little over $0.25 billion in adjusted EBITDA. BrandLoyalty, which, again, does a lot of the shorter-term grocery loyalty programs across the world, the revenue was up double digits, and AIR MILES revenue was down slightly. ","On the EBITDA side, essentially flat with the prior year. Really, the nice step-up in revenue from BrandLoyalty was largely offset by higher expenses. AIR MILES issuance, which is a key metric because it's essentially how we get paid, was effectively flat with prior year, primarily because in the fourth quarter, a number of programs were kicked by our sponsors into the earlier part of '19. So that's more of a timing issue. But that's sort of a wrap-up on the non-card segments. ","Let's turn now to the full year discussion of Card Services, which had a good year. The revenue of $4.6 billion in adjusted EBITDA, again, it's a term we use in cards, but it does reflect the cost of both funding the portfolio or cost of funds as well as the provision expense for credit losses. If you put those in there, you'll still net to $1.5 billion, and that's a very solid double-digit growth rate in both revenue and EBITDA. ","We had a record number of new client signings. We're running at 2x sort of the already elevated historical run rate that we talked about. And I think, probably, most importantly, about this one is the signings are all in growth verticals where we have a proven track record of winning, such as home d\u00e9cor, children's, beauty, jewelry, e-comm, areas that actually are doing quite well on the retail landscape. If you look at some of the names, such as IKEA, Wyndham, Academy Sports, Floor & Decor, Penn Gaming; pure e-comm players, such as Appliances Connection and Adorama; as well as 3 more that we've signed we haven't announced yet, but very, very good year for signings and also is a good step, as we continue to transition the portfolio into healthier, higher-growth-type brand. So nice progress on that, and those will be spooling up as this year -- as 2019 unfolds and we move into '20 and '21. ","Tender share remained strong. A lot of people ask me what tender share means. Tender share is nothing more than the dollars that flow that are being spent at that retailer, what percent are flowing through the card product. And if you look at the clients that we've signed in '15, '16, '17 and '18, we're seeing nice tender share gains of roughly 120 basis points year-over-year. So that's what we want to see. ","At the same time, the core vintage, which, again, is the portfolio that has brands from 2014 and prior, we continue to hold very solid tender share, roughly in the mid-30% range. So roughly 1\/3 of all sales will flow through our product. ","Importantly, also, credit quality was stable and was similar to prior year. And as we look ahead, and you talk to the folks whose job it is to watch over this stuff, you're not hearing any types of red flags in terms of consumer distress. And so we think that this, as we call it the normalized loss rate or our long-term loss rate of roughly 6% right around, seems to be a good number. That's what it was in '17-ish, '18-ish and as we move into '19. So that's a good sign. ","We are, as I mentioned, moving towards the more attractive clients and verticals, was largely completed in the fourth quarter. Again, we're signing those types of clients. But at the same time, we are also moving out certain clients that can no longer benefit from our services, and many of them are having difficulties in today's changing retail landscape. So think of it as we're accelerating this pivot into the healthier verticals by moving out over $2 billion of card receivables in these troubled verticals. ","Overall, reported average receivable growth of 8%. But what we look at here from a longer-term perspective is how about those active brands that we have, those that we're going to be relying on to keep us going well into the future. And that was up well over 20%, which bodes extremely well as we move into the latter part of '19. ","If we can turn now to the credit metrics. Charles, why don't you hit this one?","Charles Horn","Sure. So we're over on Page 8, and I thought we'd talk through some of the key performance indicators for the year. I think it's important to start with normalized average receivables for the simple fact it includes our held-for-sale receivables. And that's a relevant metric because, really, we continue to earn revenue and incur expenses on held-for-sale receivables until sold. So really, in evaluating gross yield, operating expense leveraging, you have to consider the held-for-sale receivables, which were about $1.95 billion at year-end. ","Our gross yields were down slightly, about 30 bps, and that's primarily due to vintage mix. What that means is more of our receivables growth are coming from younger vintages, and it takes a younger vintage about 3 to 4 years to really hit a run rate gross yield. ","Operating expenses, we actually were good on the leveraging there. They were up about 10 basis points year-over-year, even though the charge was 70 bps, as we talked about before, about 60 bps is due to the mark-to-market adjustment occurring value for the held-for-sale receivables. ","Lastly, the delinquency rate, which we talked about a little bit before, continues to be elevated on a year-over-year basis, primarily due to the slowing growth rate in card receivables. That pressure should moderate as card receivables growth reaccelerates. And we're anticipating that will be more in the third quarter back half of 2019. ","With that, I'll now turn it back over to Ed.","Edward Heffernan","Okay. So I'm on Slide 9, Card Services, the average receivables growth. This is what we use here to sort of gauge, are we heading in the right direction as we pivot the card business itself. And if you look at the active clients, those are the brands that we're counting on to drive the longer-term growth of the business. It's masked quite a bit by the fact that we did, as we've talked about, discontinue our relationship with a number of brands. And if we turn back to the active clients, you'll see is a very healthy year for growth, up over 20%. That's nice. ","What probably is more important is what does that mean for the future. And you'll see to the far right that roughly 1\/3 of the growth coming from these newer vintages in the healthier, probably more exciting verticals that we've been talking about, and that's up 200% from the prior year. ","So what's it all mean? What's it all mean is that the 2015 to '18 groups of clients that we signed represented roughly $4 billion of the portfolio in '18. And when those things are fully ramped up, because many of them are in these early stages, that's going to be roughly $11 billion to $12 billion. So there's a lot runway there with these signings. ","We mentioned the various verticals that we're excited about, names such as IKEA and Wyndham and Academy Sports and Penn Gaming. But also in there are some of the earlier signings, such as the Wayfair and the Ulta Beauty and the Signet Jewelers, Williams-Sonoma, Diamond International, Build.com, Viking Cruises. As you can see, a lot of different verticals from what we've been known for, for the first probably 15, 18 years of the company, which was primarily mall-based specialty apparel. So it's -- we've made a lot of progress. And we're going to see the benefits of that play out as '19 moves into the latter part of the year. ","All right. So let's move to Slide 10. I think this captures it succinctly, which is if you were to look at what is the benchmark in the industry in terms of growth rates in -- yes, if you want to put in general-purpose cards, you want to put in co-brand, you want to put in Private Label, most of it is captured in revolving debt. Revolving debt has been growing around 3% or 4% if you go back 7 or 10 years. And against that, we've been growing 18%, and that even includes the divestiture of those noncore brands that we talked about at length earlier in the call. So even with the $2 billion removed, we borrowed roughly 18% growth versus an industry that does 3% to 4%, and we expect that to be one of the attributes of this company going forward as well.","We believe that we play in a sandbox that will allow us to grow at a significant multiple above the industry as a whole. A lot of this has to do with where we play in terms of our clients tend to be much smaller than the very large co-brand card programs that are out there. And if you were to look at our portfolio of $18 billion, that's spread over 160 different brands. So again, these tend to be smaller portfolios, very focused on brand and on high-end quality service, and that's our specialty. ","Additionally, to the industry-leading growth rate, our industry-leading return on equity. So our ROEs are 30% and\/or more, which is anywhere between 2 to 3x what the industry is at. A lot of people keep sort of scratching their heads saying, \"How can you be growing so fast and have ROEs that are 2 or 3x the industry?\" And the answer is, again, we play in a sandbox that, we believe, we have unique advantages. And the uniqueness of our advantage is the fact that everything we do is in-house, from the actual network itself, we don't outsource that. The customer care is done in-house. The collections are done in-house. The marketing, the database -- the databases that we build, they're all done in-house. And with that, that allows us to approach the industry in a holistic manner and allows us to have the uniqueness that comes with a close-loop type network that can extract not only who the customer is of the client, but also what she purchased down to the SKU level. And we use that type of information to then go back on a one-to-one personalized basis through the various digital channels as well as some of the more traditional channels to drive that incremental purchase. And it's those incremental purchases that sort of set us above and apart from sort of the more traditional banks and card players in the industry. ","And so that's -- we're not for everyone, but we believe that the total addressable market, or the TAM, that we're going after is about $50 billion. And so we've got a long way to go to get there, and that gives us a lot of runway as we look forward. And when we talk about the TAM for our business, we're not talking about these big co-brand programs. We don't really play in that area. We believe that the Private Label offering is really the type of offering that is sought after by the client base that we're after. We'll occasionally do a co-brand as in a combination for some of those clients who already have a PLC, or Private Label card. But otherwise, we're trying to remain very disciplined in the products we offer and the deal terms that we'll except. And that's why we believe that even moving into these newer verticals and healthier in faster-growing verticals, we're keeping the same types of discipline, such that those ROEs can remain at that 30%-plus level. ","Okay. Let's move into a little discussion about losses, which, I think, is always -- garners all sorts of different questions of why do you run the portfolio at a 6% loss rate, not a 3%, not an 8%, not a 1%. And the answer is we've tried to find sort of what we believe over the last 20 years to be the right level to run the portfolio, to garner both significant tender share and, therefore, value for the retailer, while at the same time not going too far out on the risk spectrum. And so if you're to look at the typical cycle, I always get asked about the cycle, the typical cycle for our business would be we run at a 6%-or-so loss rate. And a lot of folks thought that, \"Oh, my gosh, the last couple of years, losses are creeping up. And what does that mean? Is the portfolio getting worse?\" And the answer is no. What basically happened if you go back to the Great Recession was that losses ran quite a bit higher than they typically do. And as a result, you effectively drain the pipe in terms of potential new customers. And as a result, you wound up going from above trend to well below trend. And all that happened over the past several years is we've returned to our long-term trend line. It's nothing more than that. ","We think the fact that '17 and '18 were very stable, '19 looks to be stable as well that we're at trend and we want to keep it right around that level going forward. So it's not going to jump up too much, not going to jump down too much. This is where we want to run the programs to optimize what we talked about earlier. ","Also Charles touched briefly on delinquency rates, which we're running around 60, 70 basis points above prior year. As we exited 2018, there were some noise in that number. What's going to happen is you're going to see that start stepping down pretty quickly. And so we expect that to drift down as we move throughout 2019 and we lose the noise. ","In terms of the outlook for '19 for loss rates, again, we expect it to come in, in that 6-ish-type range for the year. The trends look good. From a seasonality perspective, just sort of a heads up, the way it works in our Private Label business is first quarter tends to be sort of the high watermark. And you'll be in the 6s there, and then you'll start drifting down. So look for about mid-6, maybe a little bit better in Q1, and then we'll drift down. And for the full year, we'll wind up right around back at that 6% level. So that's that. Finish up 2018. ","We now move to 2019. To the extent there are no transactions completed, if you were to just look at status quo for the noncard businesses, we would expect to see mid-single-digit growth in revenue and adjusted EBITDA. I don't think that status quo is going to be what we're going to see, and we'll talk about that in a little bit. ","So let's go to Card Services. We expect to exit 2019 at roughly $20.5 billion. It's up a little bit from last call where we thought it was around $20 billion. So about $20.5 billion compared to exiting this year at 17 -- this past year at $17.9 billion. Or said differently, we expect that both active as well as reported growth rates will converge at the end of the year as we push through this $2.1 billion discontinued programs. And both metrics will show an exit rate in the mid-teens, which, again, sets us up for a nice run exiting this year and going into next year. ","As importantly, the new vintages that I talked about earlier, these are the clients from '15 to '19 that we're excited about. We now expect them by the end of the year to account for over 40% of the receivables. So in terms of pivoting the portfolio, it's going very, very fast, and that's both from the new signings as well as the discontinued programs. It's a little bit of pain that we need to go through in terms of getting to the first part of the year without those programs that have been discontinued. However, the end result is clearly a much healthier and stronger portfolio. '19 also assumes a modest level of growth coming from some relatively small files that are out there that we have our eyes on. And we assume that we'll take a few of those in-house, nothing too significant, however. ","We talked about the transition to the home d\u00e9cor and children's, beauty, the jewelry, again, away from that sort of mall-based specialty apparel sector that's having such a difficult time. Importantly, we are keeping very strong discipline in terms of signing for these new vintages. And although, obviously, it takes them a while to ramp up, we are building the models and signing deals, keeping similar ROE characteristics. So we do not expect that to be an issue going forward. ","We talked about the stability in credit quality and the loss rates being relatively flat, with delinquency rates year-over-year beginning to come in as we move throughout the year. So the net result is it should be a very strong year for the cards in terms of these critical metrics that we look at: active growth, the convergence of active and reported growth to 15%; exiting the year losses; delinquencies. But it will be dampened, especially in the first half, on the disposition of those card receivables. So that's sort of the price that we've decided is necessary to get us pivoted in the right direction as fast as possible and get this behind us. ","All right, Page 13, the 2019 outlook. For the Epsilon divestiture, obviously, people are very curious as to how that's going, and I need to be somewhat brief in my remarks. Obviously, '18, we spent a good deal of the time with the board coming up with our overall strategic review of the various businesses. It was quite clear that Epsilon has many valuable assets, both from a technology side as well as a people side, that seem to have more value or is ascribed more value out in the marketplace than it was within the company itself, I think, primarily due to the size of cards. And so the decision was made to go ahead and move towards a divestiture to capture that value and find the right home for Epsilon. The strategic review took a good chunk of the year. We did, in the fall, hire bankers and lawyers and all sorts of folks. And in November, we moved to a very -- to a formal process. ","Where are we today? The process continues to move. We did have a great deal of interest in the businesses. Initial bids have been received. We are currently finishing the selection of the final round. The process is moving smoothly. And I have to say, if consummated, the use of proceeds will be focused on a combo of further debt reduction as well as significant share repurchases. And the only comment I can make on that is it's -- it was good to see, as we move into the final round, interest from both the strategic side as well as the sponsor side. So stay tuned. We're moving into the final throes on that. ","All right. We're getting near the end here. In fact, I think I'm actually on my last slide. So if you go to the last slide on 2019 guidance. The initial annual guidance that we're going to throw out there is a little over $8 billion of revs and $22 as the base case in core EPS. We expect, as we talked about, very strong growth in ending card receivables. What that also will mean, however, is you need to build a provision for that big growth. And that will -- is one of the reasons that earnings will be slightly dampened this year. ","Additionally, obviously, you had a couple billion of receivables that were generating income for us in '18. Those have been moved out. And so as a result, that's the other reason why you're going to see some dampening of the earnings. Both of those are timing issues, which is good. The first being the provision buildings that the newer vintages are ramping up nicely, and that should pay off as we move into the following year. And then the dispositions that we talked about, again, we are doing that thoughtfully. But we wanted to do it and get it over with. We don't see anything else on the horizon. ","First quarter revenue will be down mid-single digits. Core EPS will be down high single digits, primarily due to the dampening effect of the divestitures of those -- the $2 billion-plus of receivables. Normalized average card receivables, again, will be down because of this divestiture. However, what we report from an active perspective should be nice and healthy in terms of growth rate. ","Importantly, from a guidance perspective, it's -- you're going to have quite a bit of movement, I believe, on the guidance as we start moving through the year. If you were to assume that there is an Epsilon divestiture coming up in the use of proceeds, the timing of that, how it's used, is it debt, is it equity, et cetera, et cetera, that's going to change things quite dramatically. And so we're trying to sort of give everyone enough to start their models and give enough color with the understanding that you should expect things to be updated and changing, both Charles and I believe, fairly dramatically as the year unfolds. ","So from a summary perspective, the divestiture of certain card receivables will create some near-term headwinds. We've talked about that at length, and this was done on purpose to make sure that we can move faster to get this thing back to very healthy, strong, mid-teens-type growth on the file. We are -- the repositioning, as we've talked about, the brands that we sign suggest that we're on the right path. And as a result, strong double-digit growth in active clients throughout the year. The gap that we've talked between our reported receivables and the active receivables, we'll obviously, by definition, now to 0 by the end of the year and should go back to that 15%-plus, as we finish that anniversary. ","Credit quality is stable. We've talked about the ROEs in the business. Again, the newer clients, the disciplined approach we're taking would suggest that we expect those ROE -- ROEs to remain at elevated levels, vis-\u00e0-vis the industry. ","The Epsilon divestiture, again, we think we will find a good home, the right home, while, also, at the same time, unlocking a good deal of value for our shareholders. And at the same time, it does help the narrative in terms of beginning to make the whole story a bit easier to explain and a bit more focused on what we're trying to do. So I'm going to wrap up now just with a thought or 2, which is what we're going through right now in terms of repositioning the card portfolio into -- to reflect where the health and the growth are in today's retail environment is something that needed to be done. And we very aggressively are pursuing that approach. And I think the payoff will be superb, as we move towards the back part of the year, as well as taking a look at other businesses within the company that may not be valued as highly -- as part of Alliance as they could be outside of Alliance as well as potentially complicating our overall story. ","To some, it may seem like this is an awful lot of stuff going on at once. It is. But for those of you who've been around, this is not so different from what we did roughly 10 years ago, back in the '08, '09. In the teeth of the Great Recession, we divested three separate businesses that were viewed as noncore, simplified the story. We then did a massive share repo at recession-level pricing. And so those two moves paid off quite handsomely for our shareholders. I view today as sort of act 2 sort of 10 years later. At the end of the day, the critical things as part of the strategic plan are that we're pivoting the portfolio to healthier verticals. We're exiting those brands that we can no longer help and they can no longer benefit from our services. ","Additionally, we are divesting businesses that have value -- higher value elsewhere and probably have not gotten the type of attention that they needed within Alliance. And then when it's all said and done, frankly, we'll be taking advantage of these, what I view, as recessionary-level valuations to benefit our longer-term shareholders with proceeds from these divestitures. So a little bumpy, but strategically, it's a sound plan. We believe very strongly that it will pay off, especially for those who recall that it's not so distant, which what we did 10 years ago.","With that, I'll put the pen down and will open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And your first question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.","Sanjay Sakhrani","I guess, I've got one multi-question on card and one on Epsilon. On card, could you just walk us through this noise on the delinquencies and sort of why you're confident it'll improve over the course of the year? And then as far as, like, the provisioning is concerned into 2019, I know it's probably going to be a headwind from the growth, but any cadence associated with that, Charles, would be helpful. And then as far as the profile of the customer of these new partners that are growing -- you're growing with, has that changed in any way, like the demographic profile? Because it used to be that this customer that you'd get would have a secondary income or additional income that they wouldn't have -- that they wouldn't sort of notate and they'd have a very good credit quality profile. Is it sort of consistent with the same in low lines?","Charles Horn","You want to start off from the delinquency?","Edward Heffernan","Sure. I'll take the easier one first. And then I'll give the hard one to Charles. But in terms of the type of customer we're seeing in the newer verticals, no, I don't think the quality is any different. In fact, since we have the right to maintain a certain level of quality within the overall portfolio, Sanjay, we can obviously adjust the knobs as necessary to sort of track to that goal of roughly 6%. So I would say, the only big thing that has shifted -- when you -- when the vast majority, when 90% -- plus are -- of our cardholder base are women, I don't see that changing a lot. But what we are seeing, obviously, as we're moving into the wayfair.coms and in some of the pure e-comm plays is -- as you might expect, is you're going to begin to skew down more into the millennials, and you're beginning to see what the Ulta Beauty and stuff like that, the Gen Zs or the iGens. And so for those types of clients, we're getting them in the door a little bit younger. And so you would adjust your credit lines accordingly.","Charles Horn","And on the delinquency, Sanjay, you know quite well when AR growth decelerates, it pressures delinquency trends. You have less receivables going into your current bucket. And then when you get back to a point where AR growth is accelerating, it gives you some benefits on your delinquency trends. Based upon the profile we see now, I think you'll still see pressure on delinquency rates until you start moving into the growth periods of Q3, Q4. And I'd say, the same will be true of your provisioning. Most of that will be more back-half weighted. Again, as you saw, we expect receivables to be down Q1, Q2, accelerate in Q3, Q4, with quite a bit of growth based on the time, what we see now, in fourth quarter. So I'd expect it to be your largest quarter in terms of provisioning expense.","Edward Heffernan","And I think on the delinquency side, Charles, check me if I'm wrong here, but we should see the year-over-year spread begin to narrow, like, very soon. So I think that's in the release.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Hope so. And then on Epsilon, I know you guys are limited to what you can say. But could you just characterize if you're reasonably pleased with the bids and if you envision a total or partial fail?","Edward Heffernan","Well, I've got counsel sort of hanging over here. But no, I think we've probably said all we can. I mean, clearly, if you're going into -- if you're selecting final bids, final round for bidders, you're not displeased with what you're seeing. So I think I'll probably have to stop there.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research.","Darrin Peller","Let me just start off. I understand the split and the rationale on the restructuring on the -- from the card side, obviously. Just -- can you give us a little more of an idea when do you expect the held-for-sale portfolios could actually get sold? And then thinking about the freed-out capital there, should we consider that being invested in growth receivables? Should we think about portfolio acquisitions? Is there even anything out there?","Charles Horn","So I'll start with the held-for-sale. You saw there, we sold $1.2 billion during the course of the year. We ended the year at $1.95 billion. A chunk of that relates to one bankrupt retailer that's in liquidation we're working on. I think that one could get done in the first quarter. And then I think a lot of it can be addressed first half of 2020. It's just some of it may take a little bit longer. What was the second one?","Darrin Peller","Just the freed-up capital plans.","Edward Heffernan","Yes. I mean, clearly, if we're expecting the -- both active and reported to hit that 15% growth rate by year-end, clearly, we're deploying that capital back into the business. A lot of it will be, obviously, to fund the continued ramp-up of the '15 to '18 vintages. However, to your point, Darrin, there are a handful of files that are not likely to attract the attention of the big banks, but very nicely in our wheelhouse in terms of size. And I think you can expect to see a combo platter from us in terms of both the organic vintage ramp-ups as well as a handful of these smaller portfolios coming in.","Darrin Peller","Okay. And just one follow-up. When we think of the pro forma entity for the restructuring for Epsilon, I mean, we have a large card business now and we'll have, obviously, the LoyaltyOne business. So when we think about that, I mean, is the LoyaltyOne business still going to operate as a standalone business under the EC Alliance Data umbrella? Does it make sense to keep it? Does it makes sense to -- I just -- I never really saw a ton of synergy between that and the card business, so I'd just be curious of your thoughts there.","Edward Heffernan","Yes. No, it's a fair comment. I think -- I guess, the easiest way to explain it is we had a lot of balls in the air right now, and so we're taking things one step at a time. You've got -- sort of what can we say has been completed in terms of the overall strategic plan. We've completed sort of the necessary divestitures of those brands that we talked about in the card business. And we've set the card business up now, in my opinion, to have a very strong run for several years. We also have determined that there's a lot of value in Epsilon that we can unlock, and so that's sort of number two on the list. Obviously, there are further discussions going on about what else could we do in terms of continuing to focus and clean up the narrative on a go-forward basis. Are there other assets that may or may not fit? And at this point, we're getting around to that. But right now, cards was first; Epsilon, second. And that's sort of what we're focused on right now.","Operator","And your next question comes from Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays.","Ramsey El-Assal","I'm going to try again on Epsilon. Can you share any details on potential timing? Is this something that we should expect prior to the next earnings call, somewhat imminently, in terms of some resolution there on Epsilon?","Edward Heffernan","I guess, we can keep trying to answer the question the same way. But I guess, the best way to think of it is talk to your banker friends. And when someone says they're going into the final round, you can take from that how long it usually takes from final around to when a potential announcement could come out, and we're likely to be on that track. So that's about as much of a nonanswer as I can give you.","Ramsey El-Assal","Okay. And if the end state of the entity here, let's just say that you have Epsilon and that, potentially, LoyaltyOne is to follow. I mean, at some point, does it make sense to change your corporate structure from this ILC structure? I mean, would that not unlock quite a bit of trapped capital that could be put to work? I was just curious about your philosophy of kind of the long-term maintenance of that ILC corporate structure.","Edward Heffernan","That would certainly be a possibility.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dominick Gabriele with Oppenheimer.","Dominick Gabriele","Just as you continue to develop your relationships with the card partners and their needs, many of these partners are seeing more sales online -- on the online channel. Can you talk about how the -- how ADS' capabilities in a post-Epsilon world can continue to help your partners drive sales through the online channel? And also what did Wayfair see in ADS and your capabilities that some new perspective partners in the card business may also gravitate towards?","Edward Heffernan","Sure, and it's good question. I think, obviously, we've had the capabilities for quite some time to do omnichannel-type transactions, whether it's bricks-and-mortar or catalog, online, whatever it is. To us, they all flow into the central bucket. You're absolutely right. We're seeing -- even with our traditional bricks-and-mortar, you're seeing a larger and larger footprint on the online space. You're seeing, at times, our online sales representing 40% of our overall sales volume. So it is an enormous piece of our business today. What we're trying to do on the online side is continue to develop those tools that will make it, if you want to call it, an effortless transaction on behalf of anyone who shops online. We've all been in that position where you've got the screen pops up and then you get all these fields to fill in, and it takes you forever. And so the abandonment rate is huge.","People just get frustrated with that. So what we do is you have your card and you have your number and your ability to get in there and sort of that one button, one-push-type transaction, which is so critical to closing the sale, that type of technology, we have rolled out or in the process of rolling out across all of our clients. Additionally, the ability to understand who is shopping online and offer right then and there a personalized-type discount or earn point or something that we get them to, what we call, a trigger marketing to make that one extra purchase that they normally wouldn't have done is critical. And so to sort of answer your question of what do we do that others don't, it really comes down to, again, understanding who the customer is, whether online or in the store, and proactively offering up a very, very focused offer that could trigger that one incremental purchase that they otherwise wouldn't have made. And so our whole business is driven off of driving incremental sales as opposed to saving money from the client on interchange or something like that. And so the data itself and how we use the data won't change, whether Epsilon is part of the overall ADS or outside of ADS or either be a service arrangement or, frankly, we've built a 500-person division within cards itself over the years of folks, whether data scientists or marketing experts, to help drive that. So that's sort of the special sauce.","Dominick Gabriele","Right. And then just one more, if I can. You just talked about the average balance size that you have currently versus where this average balance size could go when you keep moving away from specialty retail. And that -- how much do you think that piece of the loan growth story in '19 and '20 is attributed to that?","Charles Horn","I don't have that off the top of my head. I can get that for you once we go offline. I just don't have that number.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Napoli with William Blair.","Robert Napoli","Ed, maybe I'm not sure if you could answer this or not, but I'll try. With Epsilon, would you -- with the company, would ADS not sell Epsilon if they didn't get offers that were within -- had a valuation that added significant value to shareholders on the -- with the capital deployment you would make? Are you committed to selling this? Or if you got the bids that were insufficient, would you pull back?","Edward Heffernan","I think that there's no question there, it's a floor. And it's got to be above the floor, for sure. And so we wouldn't be moving to final rounds with bidders, unless we felt comfortable we're heading in the right direction.","Robert Napoli","Okay. And then just on -- I think last quarter, you had put out kind of a 2020 receivables number. Just first of all, are the new assets generating the same returns that you've generated historically? Are they a little bit lower? I mean, 30% ROE is wonderful. But as we try to think about earnings growth into 2020, yes, as you're -- you build the portfolio, how should we think about the returns relative to the historical levels that ADS has delivered?","Edward Heffernan","Yes. I mean, I think, look, we're pretty -- there's a lot of deals that we walk away from, obviously. And what we're trying to do is keeping the pricing discipline where it has been in the past. And so far, as long as -- frankly, as long as we stay within, I keep calling it, our sandbox, we seem to be maintaining that level of ROE hurdles that we've had in the past. Now clearly, when you're taking a very mature portfolio that's been around for 15 years, not really growing, it's throwing off a lot of cash and profit. But longer term, obviously, it's not the healthiest. But those are being divested. And you're spinning up the newer brands, which take a little bit of time before they can actually generate those types of returns, right? I mean, it's the nature of these vintages. So -- but steady-state, no, we -- we're keeping the same discipline we've seen before. And frankly, the people who are looking for the special sauce that we're -- that we offer, they're pretty focused on how you're going to drive that incremental sales and prove it to me. And as a result, I think we're -- we should be in good shape on the ROEs.","Robert Napoli","Last question, real quick. On the $22 guidance for next year, and I understand there's a lot of moving pieces there, you're going to change that as we move through the year, but does that include share buybacks?","Charles Horn","It does not.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dan Salmon with BMO Capital Markets.","Unidentified Analyst","This is William on for Dan. Just following up on Epsilon with a more fundamental-oriented question. You called out agency and site-based displays obviously being weak. But I was wondering if you'd go into more detail about areas of strength and which offerings are showing the most promise right now.","Charles Horn","The way I'd break it down is Technology Platform, which you remember is really the older part of Epsilon, has -- was very stable this year after being down the prior year. The 2 big drivers last year really were the auto vertical and the CRM -- Conversant CRM. We did not see the same level of growth this year with those 2 growth drivers as we did the prior year. But we still see building backlogs. We still see a big runway for them to develop. But even with our 2 bigger growth drivers, they didn't really produce as much in '18 as what we thought they could.","Edward Heffernan","Yes. I mean, the big growth drivers going forward would be the CRM engine, the more traditional tech platforms, which are building the big loyalty in CRM databases and then the auto as well.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust.","Andrew Jeffrey","With regard to the ongoing discussions around Epsilon, and I wonder if you can just comment on sort of how broadly, or from a high level, you're thinking about the pieces of that business that historically have been important to driving the value in card and whether or not -- or how you contemplate the sustainability of your ROE and the value prop, which we, I think, understand so well in the context of selling the entirety of Epsilon perhaps. Just how intertwined are those businesses?","Edward Heffernan","Yes. It's a great question, Andrew and, obviously, something that we give a great deal of thought to. By \"unlocking\" the value with Epsilon, are you, in fact, going to hurt the offering in cards? And so what we've done is a number of things. First out of the gate, as I mentioned, over the last several years, we've built up a, what I would call, mini Epsilon within cards itself. So you've got a 500-person dedicated division of marketing and data scientists who, you could say, normally would be over at Epsilon. But since cards was so big, we built it in cards. So that won't suffer. It's more on the technology side. So all of our brands in cards use the Epsilon platform for the various reward and loyalty programs. That will continue to be the case. It will be a service level agreement -- service agreement between the 2 entities. Additionally, these brands would use the various digital channels, whether it's Conversant or whether it's the digital e-mail platforms. Again, those would be direct service agreements with Epsilon. And then finally, a lot of the demographics, psychographic data that is housed within Epsilon, again, would be a service agreement between the two entities. So to put it succinctly as I can, which is always difficult, Andrew, it would be the people-based stuff, we think, is all taken care of and housed within cards. The technology and the data that we need from Epsilon, we are carving out very specific contracts and agreements between the two entities. So the goal is not to have anything that disrupts what we offer to the client set.","Andrew Jeffrey","Okay. That's helpful. And then Ed, I just wonder, I think becoming a pure play or closer to a pure-play in value-added Card Services makes a ton of sense for Alliance shareholders. Are you -- but is there a question about where we are in the cycle as you get more of a -- as you become more of a pure-play in a credit business?","Edward Heffernan","Yes. I mean, I think that's a lot of the stuff, right, that has sort of hit valuations of the financial sector and consumer finance companies. And all we can do is, frankly, what worked best for us should a recession approach in the next couple of years, what worked best for us in the Great Recession if -- to do around, was the fact that we actually grew. We basically did not pull in during the Great Recession. In fact, we expanded and actually grew the portfolio and took advantage of the environment to, frankly, get some really nice clients with very good ROEs over the longer term. And my guess is we are positioning the company right now, if you think about it, as we deleverage and take advantage of what we believe are very attractive valuations out there for us. I don't see us doing anything differently. So we're going to play through in terms of right now, times are good. And so we're going to continue to sign and to grow to the extent there's some types of recession on the road. When you're making the returns that we're making, losses from a recession, you're probably talking 1 point, maybe 1.5 points at most, which still leaves a ton of profit flowing from the card business. So we would follow the exact same game plan as before and deploy as much, if not more, capital towards growth if there's a downturn. All right. Okay. Thank you, everyone. Appreciate it, and we look forward to our next call. Bye.","Operator","Thank you again for joining today's call. This does conclude today's conference.

If you haven't, please call FTI Consulting at 212-850-5721.","On the call today, we have Ed Heffernan, President and Chief Executive Officer of Alliance Data; and Charles Horn, Chief Financial Officer of Alliance Data.","Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on today's call and some of the responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risks and the uncertainties described in the Company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC.

Ed?","Edward Heffernan","Great. Thanks Eddie, and good morning, everyone. As always joining me is Charles Horn, who is preparing himself for about the 20 questions on tax. And we will also update you on the fourth quarter full-year results. I'll give a wrap up of 2017, and then we're going to get right into 2018 and the trends we are seeing by business, and we are going to get after it. So with that being said, I\u2019ll just kick it over to Charles right away.","Charles Horn","Thanks Ed. Revenue for the fourth quarter came in strong at 15% growth to $2.1 billion. For the year, revenue increased 8% to $7.72 billion, slightly soft to guidance due to Hurricanes Harvey and Irma negatively impacting revenue at Card Services by approximately $80 million. Core EPS increased 34% to $6.26 for the fourth quarter and 14% to $19.35 for the full-year.","Excluding the net tax benefit, core EPS increased 12% to $5.24 for the fourth quarter and 8% to $18.33 for the full-year, better than our guidance of $18.10. The recently enacted tax reform lowered the provision for income tax for the fourth quarter of 2017 and full-year by reducing our net deferred tax liabilities, essentially reducing cash taxes that we would have had to pay in the future.","Tax reform also benefits us moving forward as we expect our effective tax rate to drop to 26% to 27% in 2018 and that compares to 33% in 2017 prior to the adjustment we just talked about. We also anticipate the cash benefit to approximate $100 million to cash flow in 2018. Our net corporate debt ended the year at approximately $5.9 billion, while the corporate leverage ratio ended the year at 2.7 times consistent with the last several years.","Let's move on to the next slide and talk about LoyaltyOne. It was a mixed year for LoyaltyOne. AIR MILES made expectations and we restored the profitability of the level we anticipated, while BrandLoyalty results were unexpectedly poor. We entered the year knowing that we needed to retool the AIR MILES business model following the breakage assumption reset at the end of 2016.","We were successful in introducing small changes that allowed AIR MILES EBITDA margins to return to the mid-20's range. On the other hand, AIR MILES issued came in short of expectations, down 4% for 2017. Softness in promotional activity, especially in the grocery vertical, caused the shortfall. We will need to stimulate promotional activity in 2018 in order to drive issuance growth.","Turning to BrandLoyalty, revenue decreased 12% in 2017. The weakness is due to several reasons; one, key markets Germany and Russia were off due to the absence of events such as the Euro Cup and Olympics, which reduced the number of programs executed. Two, North American expansion into the U.S. do not manifest as it is taking longer to establish the foothold here than we anticipated. And three, the rollout of Disney product offering was delayed to 2018. On a positive note, the backlog for the first quarter \u2013 first half of BrandLoyalty looks good in 2018.","Let's go to the next slide and discuss Epsilon. Our goal for Epsilon entering [indiscernible] top and bottom line growth. The strong finish to 2017 allowed us to hit the 5% revenue growth target, and on apples-to-apples basis, we also achieved the 5% adjusted EBITDA target. The difference to the reported decline of 1% is the restoration of $29 million in incentive compensation versus zero last year. Essentially, it\u2019s a one-year grow over that we had to play through that we needed to restore bonuses in order to maintain highly competitive compensation packages going forward.","The story line for 2017 is all about the faster than expected stabilization of the technology platform business, which finished strong with 7% growth. Revenue growth in the fourth quarter as the offering stabilized through the sale of more packaged offerings and record volumes through our harmony digital messaging platform. The other two big drivers of growth Auto and Conversant CRM finished the fourth quarter and year with double-digit revenue growth. Auto continues to benefit from ongoing penetration to new OEMs, while Conversant CRM cross-line efforts continue to gain traction, in particular, as this digital capabilities are now embedded in both auto and technology platform offerings.","Let\u2019s flip to the next slide and talk about Card Services. Facing the headwinds of the second year of credit normalization, Card Services still delivered with double-digit growth in both revenue and adjusted EBITDA for 2017. Looking at the key performance metrics, credit sales increased 6% for the year with apparel brand partner showing consistent improvement as the year progressed, culminating a strong holiday performance.","Tender share grew more than 160 basis points in Q4 and more than 100 basis points for the full-year. Average receivables increased 15% for the year. The growth rate in the fourth quarter dipped slightly to 13% as we divested approximately $800 million of non-core program receivables in December, which hurt receivables growth by about 2%.","Operating expenses were up 7% compared to revenue growth at 13%, so very strong expense leveraging. The net loss rate was 6% for the year at 90 basis points over 2016, 60 basis points of the increase was due to lower recovery rates and 30 basis points due to higher gross losses.","Gross loss rates stabilized as 2017 progressed as we reached the end of the credit normalization cycle. The delinquency trend or wedges we call it closed within 10 basis points at year end, excluding the transitory impact of the hurricanes.","Turning to the all important holiday season, overall credit sales increased to 8% with strong performance from our recent vintages. On a comparable brand basis credit sales were up 5% over last year. The growth was fueled by continued non-store spend, up 11%, which includes digital and web channels.","Non-store sales growth was driven by both the increase in buyers and spends per buyer and that's 3% and 2% respectively. This growth came from an increase in omnichannel buyers reflecting our continued strategy to help brands engage customers in all relevant channels.","Card Services continue to expand and diversify the portfolio brand partners, signing nearly $3 billion vintage in 2017. The new partners we have signed this year been a great reflection of where the market is growing and what consumers value, brands like IKEA and Viking Cruises being valued for the product and experiences they provide and Build.com been a strong e-tailer in a growing category for ADS.","A key initiative for 2018 is to develop a consumer direct funding program for our Utah Bank. It would allow us to take savings accounts and other non-demand deposits diversifying our funding sources and helping funding rates.","With that, I will turn it over to Ed.","Edward Heffernan","Great, thanks Charles. If everyone could turn to the slide titled 2017 full-year, this is sort of more of the commentary part of the call. I don't have a lot to add from the numbers perspective, but I would call out two items on the slide. First up would be under Epsilon. When as Charles mentioned, the goal for the year was mid single-digits top and bottom on an apples-to-apples basis, we believe we accomplished that.","Again the delta between the reported number for EBITDA and the 5% growth rate is the restoration of the incentive comp or bonus program. So if you - said differently if you went back the prior year, there was zero payout, which we don't believe is sustainable in this market and therefore we wanted to make sure we were highly competitive as we move into 2018.","But we didn't want to cloud the actual performance and frankly exiting the year to plus seven topline is a very good signal as we move into next year. So we think we're getting a handle on that sort of mid single-digit growth rate. And overall, feels good. Card Services as Charles said even with 90 basis point increase in loss rates, still managed to deliver EBITDA, net of all these provision costs and funding costs and everything else of double-digit, so nice job there.","And then finally, on the earnings per share, we had guided to roughly $18.10. We came in at $19.35. The differences are the following. Over performance would have brought us in it $18.33, so ahead by $0.23 and then a little over a buck coming from the tax benefit, which consisted both of the benefit itself less about $12 million that we allocated to non-executive bonuses coming out of the Tax Reform Act. So overall, I think it was \u2013 certainly \u2013 it was an exciting year and I hopefully as we move into 2018 it will be a little less exciting and a little more fun.","So let's now turn and talk a little bit about the businesses themselves. First, we talk about LoyaltyOne, which consists of our Canadian business AIR MILES as Charles again sort of highlighted. In my mind, we setout to do five things, and I think four out of the five came through. Most importantly after the crisis last year, we stabilized the model with number of changes that we made and specifically we came in the mid 20% EBITDA margins, which was our goal, and very pleased to see that that has stuck.","Second, we renewed our largest client Bank Montreal, which is critical to the ongoing success of the program. Third, we wanted to make sure, coming out of the crisis that we retained our clients and we had 100% retention rates, so congrats there. And then finally, we wanted to get the folks excited about the program again and that comes through with active collectors. Active collectors were all the way back to pre-crisis levels by Q4. So we\u2019ve set the table pretty nicely.","Probably the couple of things that we still need to work on, one is, look the model stabilized, but it has not yet kicked into adding to our growth rate at ADS. So we want to move it back. Now that it's been stabilized into growth rate mode and that\u2019s the job for 2018.","The one goal where we came up short was promotional spend from our clients, which represents about a third of all the miles that we issue was quite soft. And that's something that we are working on right now to make sure that it's not just the every day spend that gets rewarded, but we want a big chunk of the promotional spend as well. So overall, I would say the Canadian business did a nice job, following the crisis the year before.","BrandLoyalty unfortunately had a \u2013 frankly there is no other way to put it. It was very, very poor here. And I think we got a little bit comfortable with three straight years of strong double-digit growth of topline and EBITDA. The program just kept rolling along and then we just had frankly it fell off a cliff in 2017 and we had very poor results.","The big question for me was that in air-pocket or do we have a fundamental issue with the program. Fortunately, we now have visibility on the fact that we've got a huge book of business for 2018 and it looks like it's more like an air-pocket. So we are looking forward to having a very robust snapback from BL in 2018.","All right, let's go to Epsilon. Again sort of that mid single-digit organic top and bottom line is what we\u2019re looking for. That's what we brought to the table. That's what we\u2019re looking to continue into 2018 and start building up a level of consistency that people feel comfortable with.","Again, for those of you who recall the end of 2016 that's when \u2013 that was a big question on our largest chunk of the business with technology platform, which is about over a quarter of all of Epsilon Conversant, and that was a bit of a melting iceberg at that point is down 13% year-over-year in Q4 of 2016.","Team did a wonderful job of turning it, not only getting the pricing at a level we want. Setting up the office in India. Also, moving from a very customized model where things take 15, 17 months to get to market to a more standard package where we are talking about two to three months. And as a result, what we saw was steady progress and actually exited the year at plus 7% growth for their business. So that's probably the big story there.","Also as Charles mentioned, our two big growth area is digital CRM and the auto offerings were both up strongly double-digit. There was a bit of a concern in Q3 whether the digital CRM, which had fallen off in terms of growth rate, whether that was an air-pocket. Fortunately, it was and as a result, you saw a nice pick up in Q4.","On the negative side, I would say it's a bit more from a macro perspective. We've got a lot of folks. It's both a tech offering, but it's also a services offering and from a macro perspective, we're going to be watching very carefully the impact of the tight labor market for hard skills. A lot of folks competing for this type of talent and we want to make sure we are on the top of the list.","And then finally, we want to have more consistent better visibility on the financial results. I think 2017 was a good start, but this still works there. All right, Card Services, as Charles mentioned the fabulous wedge that we put out, I don't know 15 months ago which is our best predictor of future losses, as everyone knows. We started it was up year-over-year about 50 basis points and that's where we sort of said look we think losses will be up about 50 basis points.","By the end of the year, for me, it should have closed. That would have been a nice finish to the year. Unfortunately, we came within 10 basis points. We did have some noise from the hurricanes, but look the trends are friend at this point and it's effectively closed. That means that the outlook for 2018 gives us comfort that stable loss rates will follow.","Growth rate in the book of business is quite strong 15%. Frankly, I feel that's a good number for us to shoot for on a yearly basis. If you were to look back the last five years, I think the numbers are closer to 20%. But I think 15% is a very solid number that gives us a lot of flexibility when it comes to signing new clients and also being very selective on renewals.","We did have a record new vintage this year close to $3 billion for those of you who don't live and breathe in the Card business. $3 billion essentially means if you took all the signings that we did over the past year whether it was an existing file or whether it was a file starting from scratch and it takes three years to ramp up. After three years all of these clients together will add roughly $3 billion to the portfolio, and that's how we look at it. We have a number of vintages each year that are screwing up.","If you look at the clients, it's interesting that they differ across verticals and across physical presence versus strictly e-commerce. Obviously, Signet, Build.com, Viking, Guess, Diamonds, Adorama and IKEA represent sort of what we're beginning to see now which is different from the more traditional model of mall-based soft good apparels. So we continue to see the interest coming from many different areas, and that gives us a lot of comfort on what we're going to do going forward.","Double-digit adjusted EBITDA growth, so obviously that includes absorbing the 90 basis point increase in losses, and frankly getting that done I thought was outstanding. On the negative side, what did we miss? We missed the third-party recovery market which I'll talk about in a little bit, absolutely plummeted. And as a result, it lowered our recovery rates dramatically. And if you look at that 90 basis point increase in net losses, we thought it would be more like 50 basis point. What it turned out to be was gross losses were only up 30 basis point, and so we lost it on the recovery side when the market cratered.","And then finally, more macro issue, obviously, everyone knows about the retail environment. So we just need to keep our eyes open in terms of what's going on with our core clients as well as signing the new ones. Full-year, decent year, revenue up 8%, core EPS up 14%, while the tax penny, up 8% excluding the penny. Leverage at the corporate level was very modest at 2.7 and that included the impact of funding over $1 billion for buybacks and capital for growth in the portfolio, so good generation of free cash flow for the company.","Frankly, the biggest news that everyone is been waiting for is the stabilization of the credit loss rate where there after two years of absorbing increases, and we\u2019re poised now to return to mid-to-high teens core EPS growth rate in 2018, which quite frankly is our long-term model. So it's been a bumpy couple of years and we're right where we wanted to be for the slingshot for 2018. We are raising the cash dividend 10% to $0.57 per share starting in Q1 and with that let's put 2017 behind us and move right into 2018 and talk about guidance.","So petty straightforward of course there's always a little wrinkle, but the revenue itself looks quite strong. We're looking at double-digit revenue growth of roughly 12%. Against that there is an accounting adjustment that does not affect cash flow or EBITDA or earnings per share, it's merely geography. But it does change the recognition of roughly $350 million in our business in Canada.","And I'd like Charles to just very briefly talk about it.","Charles Horn","So essentially this revenue standard has been out there for quite a while, but it was really in December when AICPA came out with a whitepaper, that basically said that if the locality program does not take inventory risk, meaning we don't \u2013 own it we don't carry the inventory into the point of redemption we should record it net, meaning the gross revenue minus the cost of the product redemption to get to a net revenue.","LoyaltyOne travel is definitely fit that that threshold. So would have forced us to do is to look at the travel related redemptions going into 2018, recognize will now have a net recordation for it. To Ed\u2019s points, no impact at all in terms your earnings, any of your earnings metrics obviously bumps up your EBITDA margin appreciably, but it's purely shifting to a net presentation. This was something that came very late in the year. We not anticipated to early, not a big impact overall to ADS in terms of revenue, and like I said, no impact to profitability.","Edward Heffernan","Okay, so again from our perspective and from how we're going to be presenting on earnings and stuff, pro-forma, the norms and from our perspective, it's a 12% topline core EPS. Even with the big bump up in 2017, from the $18.10 to the $19:35. We're still looking at 16% to 19% growth in 2018. If you want to go back to the original guidance, we said we wanted to do $18.10, this past year bumping up to $21.50 for next year. The new guidance is we came in at $19.35 and we're going to bump up 2018 to $22.50 to $23 of share, representing 16% to 19% growth.","All right, big question, tax bill, tax bill, tax bill. The tax bill will provide us with $100 million, roughly $100 million a year in additional free cash flow. And that's roughly $1.78 per share. We're going to take that $100 million and obviously flow through, roughly two-thirds of it and we're going to take between 30% and 33% in cloud that back into the company.","We're going to put it back into the Company in three different buckets. The first bucket would be to accelerate some existing projects that we have on the board. The second would be to establish an innovation fund to get \u2013 to make sure one on the leading edge of the various digital payment products that are out there, and then the third would be to bolster some employee benefits whether it's getting the 401(k) participation rate up or holding down any increases on the benefits. The premiums on various healthcare packages for the employees we want to help out there. So it's \u2013 we're trying to live the spirit of the agreements as well as what we believe is the appropriate thing to do and we can talk about that during Q&A.","So let's go into specifically guidance. Let's talk about LoyaltyOne, which is our Canadian business and BrandLoyalty, we expect high single-digit revenue, low double-digit adjusted EBITDA growth. AIR MILES, we talked about has stabilized. Now we would like to see, it begin to return to incremental growth.","Second BrandLoyalty as we also talked about usually runs at a solid double-digit top and bottom. We did have a very poor year in 2017, which means we expect a very strong snapback in 2018. We think the World Cup, the Olympics, and the Disney deals that we have, it\u2019s already looking like the number of deals we signed is going to be our record.","Epsilon, consistency, consistency, and consistency, we want to see minimum of mid single-digit top and bottom. We expect the tech platform, now that it\u2019s turned to actually turn into growth along with auto and the Conversant CRM. Those three businesses are almost 70% of Epsilon, Conversant.","In Card Services, growth math as they say, we expect roughly mid-teens growth or 15% growth in average credit card receivables. I get a lot of questions about, how do you do the math? And if you look at the signings from 2015 to 2017, those signings are ramping, and let's say combined.","They add about $2.5 billion to the growth rate in 2018 plus the core we expect to be in growth mode, modest growth mode, add another $1 billion, so you're at $3.5 billion, and then we have budgeted about $1 billion of what we consider folks that either are going bankrupt or we don't feel the renewal process is favorable to us. And so we've put in a fair amount of squish there to get us to the 15%, which means it could be a tad bit higher or right at 15%, but that looks like a good number. Growth shields are very stable.","And then let's get into the credit stuff, stable delinquency rates, best predictor of future losses. Again we started 2017 at about 55 basis points higher. By Q4, you get rid of the hurricane noise. It just about close to 10%, and that's sort of what we're seeing going forward here.","We expect stable delinquency rates and that will lead to stable loss rates. And so if you look at the loss rates in the composition of loss rates, what you'll see is, it's kind of interesting that the gross loss rates were up only 30 basis points last year and better than the 50 basis points we had initially forecast.","The consumer is quite healthy. We are seeing very good behavior from the consumer. But really where the 90 basis point increase came from, two-thirds of it came from, again, as I talked about the third-party recovery market, which fell off a cliff.","The recovery market for sales of written-off accounts got to be very challenging for us. And again for people who don't live this there's two stages. One is, when you go delinquent, some people call that a recovery process for the first \u2013 for the next 180 days. We've always done that 100% in house. I'm guessing we always will. It's certainly one of our advantages, but what we are talking about is post write-offs. So after 180 days after we write-off the account, we sell some of that paper to the third-party. That market collapsed. We normally recover between 22% and 25% of gross losses.","So if you look on the chart here in 2016, 1.8% meant to roughly 26% of gross losses were recovered. In 2017, we received much less when we sold those accounts, our recovery rate fell to 16%, and therefore, it added 60 basis points to the net loss rate or two-thirds of the total.","So similar to the past, we know we can do better in house. That process started in earnest in late fall and will be complete by Q2 of 2018. All right, what's it all mean? We're trying \u2013 Charles and I are trying to answer every single delinquency loss question here. So we don't have 100 of them after the call.","What\u2019s it all mean? Q1 will be noisy and will be elevated. The final hurricane flow through will cause gross losses to be elevated, while we will also be refraining from any third-party sales of written-off accounts, which would normally have lowered \u2013 which will in fact lower the recovery rates versus prior year.","Basically, we want to recover those ourselves, which means it will come a little bit later in the year. So expect an elevated loss rate in Q1. This is noise only. The delinquency flows suggest stable gross losses and in-house recovery process will be done by Q2. So after an elevated Q1 to these transitory items, Q2 through Q4, we expect flat to better versus prior year on loss rates and to make up for the Q1 noise with favorable comps in Q2 to Q4.","The 2018 summary is the two-year credit normalization process is over. We are back as a company to mid-to-high teen\u2019s earnings growth. Free cash flow will be very robust with over $1.5 billion. Right now, we've only allocated roughly 500 of that to support regulatory capital and dividends. So over $1 billion of unencumbered free cash flow, and we feel very good about 2018.","And we appreciate your patience, and we'll open it up now for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Darrin Peller with Barclays.","Darrin Peller","All right. Thanks guys. Let me just start off on the Card business, from an outlook perspective, and you're talking about mid-teens receivables growth, the like again. And I know the year ended off with a slightly slower growth rate and it was closer to 10% in the December month. I just want to understand where the confidence is coming from in terms of the portfolio growth and the underlying trends in retailers you're seeing right now? And then just a quick follow-up on the LoyaltyOne business after please?","Edward Heffernan","Yes, sure. What we do is, obviously, we've got roughly 160 clients, actually a lot of the core clients that we had wound up doing a bit better in [indiscernible] holiday than I think a lot of people had anticipated. So we are seeing a little bit traction. There also what we do is, we look at, Darrin, the vintages that we've signed not just in 2017, but 2016 and 2015 and see how they're ramping up and when they're going to layer into the 2018 growth pipeline.","And so you sort of wrap it all together and what we're seeing is even factoring in at roughly $1 billion that could go away due to a client going bankrupt or renewals that we don't want to pursue. We've looked back, Oh! Gosh, if you went back prior five years, our average growth rate has been 22%. If you layer in the vintages, what you're seeing with the ramp up of the IKEAs and stuff like that the 15% looks certainly doable.","Darrin Peller","So it's really organic, I mean in terms of the strength you're seeing is actually organic additional clients?","Edward Heffernan","Yes, we have not factored in any acquisitions of portfolios in 2018.","Darrin Peller","Okay. I was going to ask about \u2013 I appreciate that. On the LoyaltyOne side, just to be clear, I mean I understand BrandLoyalty has a ton of different new business coming on World Cup, Olympics, Disney et cetera. Just give us more color on the overall confidence on that business, not just, I mean on the LoyaltyOne, on the AIR MILES side specifically in terms of the overall guidance high single-digit revenue. What do you need for the AIR MILES business to do for that business overall LoyaltyOne to deliver the guidance, you are giving high single-digit revenue growth. I mean can you give us a little more confidence on what you're seeing there to give you the conviction in that?","Edward Heffernan","Sure. I think the Canadian business we\u2019ve set the bar I think at a reasonable level. So the goal for 2017 was stabilized, get the margins back to the mid-20s. For 2018, frankly Darrin we\u2019re talking 2% to 3% type growth which should certainly be doable. The BrandLoyalty frankly is going to be the engine driving this bus and based on what we're seeing in terms of the number of programs signed versus the folks who decided to take a pass last year and sort of wait for the Olympics and World Cup and everything else. It looks pretty robust.","Darrin Peller","All right. Thanks. Charles, just last question and I'll turn it back to the queue. But on the tax side, it's great to see your guidance unchanged backing out the tax benefit implicit in your 2018 guidance. Just curious in terms of the assumptions for the tax benefit, I mean I think we had estimated a little bit higher than the $1.50 or so you're guiding? And I know there's a $0.50 reinvestment. But even with that, is there any other items we should just be aware of in terms of conservatism in your tax profile adjustments or tax estimates for the year?","Charles Horn","So if you look at 2017, our effective tax rate was 33%. We're guiding to 26% to 27% effective tax rate in 2018. To Darrin\u2019s point, it does assume that will get a little pressure from the States. You\u2019ve read what's going on in New York, New Jersey, California. They could \u2013 the States could look to grab some of that federal savings. So there is a little bit of conservatism built in there, but the state rates could go up in 2018 versus 2017, which is why we set the bar at 26% to 27% effective tax rate in 2018.","Darrin Peller","All right, so it\u2019s maybe another 100 basis points or so above what it otherwise would have been or\u2026?","Charles Horn","I can't quantify Darrin.","Darrin Peller","Okay, well, that helps. Thanks guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Thanks. Good morning. Maybe this goes back to spirit of some of Darrin questions. But Ed, maybe you could just talk about where you see the largest risks to your outlook? I know there's a lot of positive things happening underneath it all, but maybe you can just talk about what you're worried about to the extent that you are worried about anything. And then as far as tax reform, can that help Card Services in Epsilon as consumers benefit from that and businesses look to reinvest? I'm just trying to think through the impact?","Edward Heffernan","Yes, I think they are fair questions. Look, we don\u2019t \u2013 the areas that we need to continue to show consistency that would be Epsilon and Conversant; we've had a good run in 2017 frankly. I think we need to demonstrate, we can do that again in 2018 before people get really comfortable.","From what I'm seeing it looks pretty good. Obviously, the BrandLoyalty thing was probably the thing that took us all by surprise. And I can \u2013 I see the number of programs we've signed, based on prior year, we know how that will flow into earnings growth. I don't think we're going to say much more until we actually just print the numbers because we missed so badly during 2017.","If there's one place of risk at the overall level, it's certainly not with the consumer. What we're hearing out of the 1000s of folks who are in our collection areas is that the consumer is quite strong, quite healthy. So I would say Sanjay, the only thing that would pop up to me of our 160 or so Card clients, we're assuming a handful and we watch them pretty closely are going to have a very difficult time, couple may even head towards bankruptcy to the extent on the retail side that estimate is off and there's another handful that we haven't thought about.","I don't think it will hurt 2018 per se, but what we will do is, we will make for a tough grower for 2019. So from a macro perspective, it\u2019s more retailer specific, a handful we've sort of identified, it's no more than a handful.","Charles Horn","And on the tax reform Sanjay, we would say, you've seen many companies come out announcing, they're going to put more money in the hands of their associates, which could lead to cardholders spending more money in 2018, which could be beneficial to our Card operations.","Sanjay Sakhrani","How about Epsilon, are businesses looking to reinvest some of the upside?","Edward Heffernan","Yes, I think from some of the reinvestments, I would call out probably two areas. The first in terms of reinvestment would be \u2013 we have always given the size of the Card business today. It was a lot easier when the file was a couple billion as opposed to heading towards $20 billion.","We will be rolling out and launching a new source of funding, which will be on the consumer deposit side, out of our ILC facility in Utah and obviously that requires consumer platform. It requires marketing. We\u2019ll have to come up with some fancy slogan or catchy slogan I guess that will get people excited about what's in their purse.","And then the other area would be the CRM business at the Conversant side of it. Given the growth rates there, we will probably \u2013 not probably, we will absolutely be ramping up the size of the sales force effort and perhaps focusing even more on \u2013 not just the large clients, but also mid markets. So those would be the two big areas I would see initially for investment.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Caintic with Stephens.","Vincent Caintic","Hi, thanks. Good morning, guys. So first I have to ask a question on credit, but on the in-house question efforts that you've had so far, so I know its early days, but given the 60 basis point headwind you had in 2017. What are you seeing so far in your experience that maybe can give us some encouragement? And then also how you think about the level of credit reserves that you keep? We've had some good provision performance recently, but just kind of wondering how you think about credit reserves. Thanks.","Edward Heffernan","Sure. Great question. Yes, we went through this whole recovery in-house versus selling to third parties, post great recession where we raised same type of issue and we had to bring things back in-house. All right, it's pretty simple math at a certain level. It's more profitable to push it outside. What we have found so far because we're about six months into this process is that much like we had anticipated. If I were to put a number on it, the recovery rates internally are probably somewhere around 20% to 22% of your gross loss rates.","So against our marketplace that was paying us 25%, it certainly made sense to go outside. However, that 25% dropped all the way down to 16% during 2017. So as we gradually move that up to the 20%, 22% in-house that's what we're seeing, and that's why I think we feel very good about where the net loss rate trend is going to be this year, from a gross loss perspective, it\u2019s going to be flat.","Charles Horn","In terms of credit reserves, we tend to carry 11 months to 13 months in terms of forward loss coverage based up on the trends we see in losses. Beginning back in 2015, we carried up to 13 months coverage all the way through the third quarter of this year. We trimmed it back to 12 basis points favorable trends. Fourth quarter, we kept it to 12 months forward coverage, which is likely where we\u2019ll stay until we see it stabilized and potentially drop lower.","The key thing to keep in mind and looking at the reserve quality of the reserve coverage is that Signet fall came on late in the year, close to $1 billion. The losses embedded with the forward recorded net, so there is no reserve attributable to it. So you always have to focus on the reserve divided by the reservable AR, which would not include the bulk of Signet in that number.","Vincent Caintic","Okay. Got it. That makes sense. Thank you. And in separately on the \u2013 I mean the loyalty programs and kind of a loyalty updates, you talked about 15% AR growth in the card side and the signings activity that you're getting. I am just kind of wondering how \u2013 also that might translate into some growth on the Epsilon side. It seems like there seems to be more engagement in the overall loyalty offering that you have and if you can just get more perspective on that? Thanks.","Edward Heffernan","Sure. Yes. I mean, 100% of our card clients are on the loyalty platform developed by Epsilon. The various digital distribution channels such as e-mail, our card clients would use the Epsilon. We are right now beginning a bigger push to get the unique sort of identification platform that is Conversant CRM into the hands of our card clients.","So we would expect that to be a big area for us to push. I would say across the board, our card clients are asking not only for the type of insight into their existing customers. But they also want to be able to say let me take a look at my best customers. How do I go out and find people similar to that that may not be customers today.","And that's the beauty of what Conversant can do with its unique ID. We can take all those characteristics and then go find these folks, and on behalf of the clients get something really exciting that could motivate them to show up either online or in store at our clients. And that's sort of a new area that we're really beginning to expand.","So it's not just taking care of the existing best customers that's obviously job number one, but it's now moving into help me take a profile of my best customer and then go out into space there and find someone similar and then get them all excited about the brand. And that is an area that's getting our clients very excited because it's going to drive sales and that's sort of the bottom line. So that's the big push.","Vincent Caintic","Got it. Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jason Deleeuw with Piper Jaffray.","Jason Deleeuw","Yes. Thanks and good morning. So I just want to be clear on the credit recoveries. It sounds like we have some noise with the hurricanes maybe in the first quarter, but taking it in-house and the changes you made, I mean, shouldn\u2019t the recovery rate shouldn\u2019t there be a tailwind to your net charge-off rate or are you expecting that still kind of flat versus the 2017 level?","Edward Heffernan","Absolutely going to be \u2013 when it's fully up and running, it should be \u2013 you should think 22% versus 16% that we did in 2017. So from that perspective if you had flat delinquencies which we have and you're going to see flat gross loss rates and you get this tailwind on the recoveries. As the year progresses, it certainly suggests that we're going to be in decent shape.","Jason Deleeuw","Good. Thanks for that. And then just on Epsilon, the technology platform revenue it grew 7% in the quarter, so it was a nice improvement on the growth rate there. Can we sustain that level and can you just help us understand kind of the drivers of that and then kind of the margin profile of that revenue versus the rest of Epsilon?","Edward Heffernan","Sure. I let Charles do the margin. In terms of the product itself, what we basically had there was the traditional Epsilon product release, big iron type database is in loyalty platforms that were highly customized for each and every client and they were just massive, right. They dealt with tens of millions of customers or clients, all the bells and whistles in the world, and they were frankly pretty cool.","The problem was, they cost an awful lot of money and it took anywhere between nine months to 15 months for these things to be delivered and cranked up for the customer. That just wasn't feasible anymore. We were frankly a bit slow to make the pivot to transition to a lower cost, quicker delivered product and that's what took us a full-year maybe 15 months to do. We opened a large office in India which helped with the price point brought us very competitive with some of the SaaS-based solutions out there.","In addition to that, we frankly could no longer sit there and spend six months getting all the bells and whistles on these platforms and we said here's what we can deliver in a two months timeframe. And so we sort of modularized the offering, and lo and behold with the new price point and the time to market being brought from 10 months to two months. We found a very receptive audience because a lot of these folks frankly don't want to run the things in-house.","There's a big market for companies that want to run and they get SaaS-based solutions and they hire IT staff and they go do their things. It is also a very big market as long as we can hit the price point and we can deliver in a timely fashion where they're saying, look, I don't want to be the ones responsible for figuring out how the watch is made. I just want to know the time. And so that's why I think this is something that right now certainly seems sustainable based on the book of business we signed.","Charles Horn","Yes, Jason from an EBITDA margin standpoint, think of technology platform being in the 18% to 20% range.","Jason Deleeuw","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of David Togut with Evercore ISI","David Togut","Thank you. Good morning. Could you drill down a little bit more into the mid-teens portfolio growth assumption for 2018 for Card Services? More specifically, could you talk about your assumption for same-store credit sales and what the breakdown of that would be between expectation for same-store sales of your existing retailers versus expected wallet share gain?","Edward Heffernan","You bet. I think David we are taking a fairly conservative view based upon what we've seen over the last year or so. So for the core clients, the folks who've been with us for three or more years, what we have seen is they've gone from probably negative 2% or 3% to the last quarter. They were probably, which is broke the surface of the water probably 0% to 1%. So we're assuming same-store sales are probably not going to be better than 1% for those core retailers.","With tender share, we should be able to get to somewhere between about 4% to 5% in terms of sales that will sales growth on our cards from those core and so as you know you go back half a dozen years or so that 5% used to be closer to 8% or 9%. But it looks like factoring in same-store sales of about a point, we will get tender share of course and so we're thinking 4% or 5%, and then the rest will come from the big books of businesses that we've signed in 2017, 2016 and 2015.","David Togut","Got it. And then just a follow-up on capital allocation, Charles, you highlighted $1 billion of unencumbered free cash flow, how are you thinking about capital allocation priorities with your stock at its current price? Let\u2019s say balance against potential acquisition and\/or divestiture opportunities?","Charles Horn","I would say David we're going to be flexible in how we use that. I'd say right now, M&A is probably pretty low on the radar screen. We could use some for buyback. We could use some to pay down debt over the course of the year. Really the focus that I have is to make sure that all three of our segments are fine and back on track and based upon those trends will determine how we deploy that capital.","So I'd say conservatively expect it can go, it's just paydown debt, delever a little bit, even though we're in a very good shape now, it makes sense. We could do a modicum of buyback obviously the dividend that there is well. But I would say is expect M&A to be a relatively low priority at this point, really the focus is to get all three of our segments back fine.","David Togut","Got it. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust.","Andrew Jeffrey","Hey guys. Good morning.","Edward Heffernan","Hi, Andrew.","Andrew Jeffrey","Really nice to see Epsilon back in the mid-to-high single-digit range, I'm wondering if you could provide just a little more color and Auto has been really strong, CRM is doing well. So I guess a couple of questions. First on auto, could you characterize how you think about the cyclicality of those \u2013 of that end market versus sort of structural demand? And then within the CRM offering, are there any verticals in particular that you'd call out as being important drivers? And again I'm just trying to get a sense for the sustainability of the growth in those two really important drivers of Epsilon?","Edward Heffernan","Yes, good questions. On the Auto side, what's interesting is the bulk of the work that we do both for the OEM and for the various dealerships, thousands and thousands of dealerships. Really is more after the sale is made, so it's much more in terms of service. So that doesn't have the type of variability you'll have with everything is driven off of sales, new car sales.","So where the folks who will sit there and hopefully use predictive analysis and more and more the telematics, the data that comes out of the dashboard that basically will say, let's through a text on an email or a big card in your mailbox, it say, hey Andrew, it looks to me like you're about a week and a half away from when it's time to get your oil changed come on over to the dealership and we'll give you a great deal. That's the type of stuff that we will be doing.","As more and more data comes from the telematics side of it, we'll be able to bug you all day long about your mission level and all these other things that we will be making sure you don't break down out there in California. So that's sort of it on the auto side from the CRM side. So the auto side shouldn't be all that cyclical. From the CRM side, look the huge verticals thus far have been retail. Auto is certainly looking bigger. What else Charles?","Charles Horn","Financial.","Edward Heffernan","Yes, financials of the banks for sure. There's a couple other verticals we\u2019re beginning to look at that whole promise. So we want to take the offering and move it from just sort of a retail type offering to auto financial services. CPG looks promising. Those are the verticals we'd be focused on.","Andrew Jeffrey","Okay. Thanks. And just one quick one if I may. In technology side \u2013 to the extent you're winning more there and your win rates look better. Are these competitive takeaways or are they buy versus build decisions that you're swaying?","Edward Heffernan","I would say it's less competitive takeaways. I think it's that the market continues. It's a growing market, right, as you know, it really comes down to the CMO needs to decide whether she wants to have the thing built in-house and have a big tax back, meaning let's get a SaaS-based solution and surround it with 100 tech people or now that we can have a similar price point to that offering and do it ourselves.","Is it okay to give up controls of the guts of this thing and just have the results forward through into her shop. So he or she can just have a bunch of analysts to look at the results. So the sandbox itself is getting bigger and bigger, so I would say the vast majority of it are more and more folks who are getting into the whole concept of hey, we can use this data and loyalty platforms to understand the customers and market to them. It's a huge.","Andrew Jeffrey","Terrific. Thank you.","Edward Heffernan","All right. We will take one more.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of David Scharf with JMP Securities.","David Scharf","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in here. Hey, first question on the card side, just a point of clarification. Ed, when I look at the components of your portfolio growth guidance this year, is the $1 billion subtraction for retailers that ultimately may become non-core, non-growing, is that just a guess in a cushion or are there specific programs you've identified?","Charles Horn","Yes. I think it's a case. Think of it David, we divested $800 million in December. So you know for the full-year in terms of average this going to be part of it. So basically it means that there's another $200 million potential over the course of the year that we could look at evaluate, do a held-for-sale or it could be a retailer that goes away. So simply the bulk of it was the divestiture we made at the end of December.","David Scharf","Okay. Got it. In the mid-teens, Charles that's a 12\/31 versus 12\/31 guidance average apples-to-apples?","Charles Horn","Average 2018 over average 2017.","David Scharf","Got it. And then lastly, shifting to Epsilon, you noted that tightening the labor market, curious \u2013 you obviously took a lot of initiatives in recent years on the offshoring side to address that? Did you feel like based on the mix of skill sets that are needed the composition of Epsilon as it exists today? Is off-shoring as an option pretty much run its course or are there additional opportunities there?","Edward Heffernan","Yes. Again, we view it a little differently from offshore. I think it\u2019s actually an office that we've built over there these are Alliance Data employees just like the folks here. So it's very much keeping it within the family type approach. I would expect we're going to have 2,000 folks over there and no I don't think it's on its course in terms of the cost model itself.","The proportion that of our associate base that\u2019s over there versus here is probably getting to be at the point where we find it\u2019s comfortable and I don't think there will be a huge shift either way going forward. But in terms of the benefits on working across both India and here in the States, we're just beginning to see that. So I would expect while there's a nice chunk that we picked up thus far there's probably another chunk to go.","David Scharf","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And just last question quickly on the AIR MILES business. You've noted obviously for several quarters the challenges in issuance growth associated with the Grocery segment. Is there something structural that's changed among a number of the large sponsors in terms of how much they're willing to spend on promotional activities or did you feel like 2017 may have just been a breather on their part as they assessed maybe the fallout from the expiry events. Trying to get a sense for visibility there?","Edward Heffernan"," I think David it's hangover from what took place in the fourth quarter of 2016 around the expiry. I think that's really what it was. Obvious we had a number of things going on this year. We need to get Bank of Montreal renewed, which we did around the third quarter that should help. And I do think in the grocery vertical, we just need to get them back satisfied, get the consumers back in their stores and that by itself will lead to getting promotional activity back, but I would attributed to purely hangover from the Q4 2016 event.","David Scharf","Got it, got it. Thanks very much.","End of Q&A","Edward Sebor","Okay. Thanks everyone. We\u2019ll see at Q1.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's conference.

Sir, the floor is yours.","Steve Calk","Thank you, operator. By now you should have received a copy of the company\u2019s first quarter 2016 earnings release. If you have not, please call FTI Consulting at 212-850-5721.","On the call today, we have Ed Heffernan, President and Chief Executive Officer of Alliance Data; Charles Horn, Chief Financial Officer of Alliance Data and Bryan Pearson, President and Chief Executive Officer of LoyaltyOne. ","Before we begin, I\u2019d like to remind you that some of the comments made on today\u2019s call and some of the responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties described in the company\u2019s earnings release and other filings with the SEC, Alliance Data has no obligation to update the information presented on the call.","Also, on today\u2019s call, our speakers will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe will provide useful information for investors. Reconciliation of those measures to GAAP will be posted on the Investor Relations website at www.alliancedata.com.","With that, I would like to turn the call over to Ed Heffernan. Ed?","Edward Heffernan","Thanks, Steve. With me today as mentioned is Charles Horn, our CFO and Bryan Pearson, Head of our LoyaltyOne business and that includes both the AIR MILES business in Canada as well as the BrandLoyalty business headquartered out of the Netherlands. Charles will update you on the quarterly results and Bryan will give you some color into the various businesses of LoyaltyOne and I\u2019ll wrap it up with a score card Q1 results as well as my outlook for full year 2016 based on past comments we\u2019re going to move with pace, so we can have more time for questions at the end. Take it away Charles.","Charles Horn","Thanks, Ed. Turning to slide two, we\u2019ll talk about the first quarter results and they were pretty much as we expected with revenue up 5% to $1.68 billion and core EPS of 5% to $3.84. It was a quarter with several positives, but also a few negatives that tempered overall results. One of the negatives foreign exchange rates reduced both revenue and core EPS by about 2 points for the first quarter. The good news is that FX rate seem to have stabilized and the drag could drop to near zero in the back half of 2016. ","Looking forward we expect growth in each quarter to accelerate as 2016 progresses. Revenue growth of 5% in Q1 is expected to increase to 8% in Q2 and then double-digit growth in Q3 and Q4. Adjusted EBITDA and core EPS were expected to follow a similar trend. Now why do we believe this? Putting this side improving foreign exchange comparables there were several reasons.","First, gross yield compression at card services should lessen each quarter as we anniversary several program changes made last year. Second, loss rates were expected to drift downward from first quarter highs. Third, BrandLoyalty has passed its most difficult comparable if you remember in the first quarter of 2015 the revenue was up over 100% on a constant currency basis. ","Lastly, Epsilon\u2019s agency weakness should lessen coupled with a record CRM backlog for second half delivery. During the quarter we acquired 2 million shares under our repurchase program for approximately $440 million. The buyback program remains our top capital allocation priority and we expect it will be executed somewhat ratably over the remainder of 2016.","Essentially we will look to deploy our free cash flow while maintaining the leverage ratio of less than 3 times.","With let\u2019s go to next slide and Bryan will walk you through LoyaltyOne results.","Bryan Pearson","Thanks, Charles. LoyaltyOne had better than expected quarter as revenue decreased 2% to $381 million, but adjusted EBITDA increased 10% to $85 million on a constant currency basis. Breaking it down further at AIR MILES our revenue increased 4% and adjusted EBITDA increased a robust 11% on a constant currency basis and that was driven by favorable issuance mix and prudent cost controls. ","As expected at BrandLoyalty revenue was down 9% on a constant currency basis due to program timing differences. Encouragingly, adjusted EBITDA increased 9% on a constant currency basis due to higher margin programs that were driving a 300 basis points expansion in adjusted EBITDA margins. ","AIR MILES issued increased a robust 5% or 57 million miles over the same quarter from last year, issuance was particularly strong with our financial vertical as we continue to convert Vimeo [ph] MasterCard holders to the premium World Elite Card that has a more compelling consumer proposition and higher AIR MILES earn offer. This strong growth was achieved despite economic uncertainty in Western Canada as a result of the declining global oil prices, but as the negatively impacting activity at our grocery partners and also the suspension of point issuance on prescriptions in British Colombia. ","Looking ahead we anticipate a 2% decline in issuance growth for the second quarter due to reduced promotional activity and the one-time conversion of the Sobeys legacy program that happened in 2015, which of course would not be repeated. ","As we\u2019ve stated previously, quarterly results can vary based upon the timing of promotional activity. But our target remains a full year issuance growth of mid-single-digits. AIR MILES redeem increased 6% compared to the first quarter of 2015 with our AIR MILES cash program that instant reward option driving approximately half of the increase as its liquidity feature resonates with collectors in the current macro environment.","For the full year, we anticipate redemption growth to be in line with issuance growth. For the year, we anticipate full year constant currency revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth for AIR MILES to be in the mid-single-digit range as well. ","Now, turning to BrandLoyalty, we anticipate a very strong second quarter whereby revenue could be up as much as 50% on a constant currency basis. On the North American expansion front, BrandLoyalty continues to increase its presence in Canada with six promotions that have been planned for 2016 and this represents a significant increase in sales over last year.","In addition, we launched our first pilot in the U.S. late in the first quarter. We are pleased with the results to-date and look forward to additional programs in this market. The full year expectation for BrandLoyalty continues to be mid-teens growth in both revenue and adjusted EBITDA as compared to 2015 on a constant currency basis. ","Lastly, let me update you on dotz and Precima. Starting with dotz our Brazilian coalition program where we continue to see steady growth in our collector base to over $18 million currently. In November of last year, dotz successfully launched the coalition program in Rio De Janeiro with the Cencosud grocery banner called Prezunic as a key partner. Cencosud is the third largest grocer in Brazil and collector reception has been positive with over a million collectors now enrolled and active in Rio. Precima, our data analytics unit continues to fire on all cylinders, recently signing the deal with Morrison one of the UK\u2019s top four grocers, where we will apply data intelligence and shopper insides to help Morrison\u2019s more effectively apply their customer centric retailing approach.","In closing, LoyaltyOne achieved solid first quarter results with a positive outlook for the remainder of 2016. I\u2019d like to take this opportunity to congratulate the entire team on a great quarter and look forward to their commitment to our valued clients and to LoyaltyOne awesome job to everyone. I guess it\u2019s back to you Charles. ","Charles Horn","Thanks, Bryan. Let\u2019s turn to slide four. Epsilon's revenue decreased 2% to $493 million and adjusted EBITDA decreased 22% to $81 million for the first quarter of 2016. Results in this segment were mix at three fourth of the business digital and technology platforms grew about 8% during the quarter while the remaining one fourth agencies and reforms with revenue declined by 23% versus the first quarter of 2015. Adjusted EBITDA increased $23 million from the first quarter of 2015, primarily due to higher payroll cost, staffing levels increased the anticipation of revenue that is yet to occur. ","Before we dive into the individual portion, you see that we have a new reporting format here. We felt that the old formats where we used to talk about database and data and so forth really is not reflective of the way we go to business these days. Specifically is the broad portfolio of offline, online services Epsilon delivers are packaged or bundled omni-channel solutions it just doesn\u2019t make sense for us to give it to you in that format.","So what we\u2019ve done is we put this together, where we\u2019re going highlight two categories that represent the underlying services and assets deployed to serve our clients. The first category digital and technology platforms, consists of businesses which is primarily derived from revenues tied to one of the many core data and to our technology platforms that Epsilon and Conversant manage. These platforms were used to house and manage data in real time to analyze the model data and to automate the usage of that data across a variety of channels whether it be through a loyalty program with the email communication or an online message delivered on mobile or desktop devices.","The remainder of the business, agency media and services consists of services which are primarily focused on supporting the agency sector. Both media services delivered to agencies on behalf of their clients as well as agency engagements in which Epsilon acts as the primary agency directly on behalf of its clients. ","Now let\u2019s turn to the digital and technology portion of this segment where quarterly revenue grew by $28 million year-over-year or about 8%, mostly due to continued success of the cross-sell efforts and onboard of the strong CRM backlog within Conversant. The products offered within the CRM business continue to resonate with both new and existing clients as 50 new contracts have already been signed this year versus 30 all of last year. The 2016 vintage thus far includes G&C, Brooks Brothers, Coach and Sears is a great follow-up to last year\u2019s efforts. These clients along with others such as Wolverines are connecting with real people as a result of combining an atomized first-party with third-party data and 80 billion daily online interactions to develop a persistent consumer ID. ","Moving on to agency media and services revenue declined 23% from the first quarter of 2015. For Epsilon\u2019s traditional agency business we saw broad-based weakness, especially in the Telco, CPG and retail verticals.","In addition the agency business at Conversant, which is the non-data driven traditional display business was down as large agencies push more programmatic buying due to our internal trading platforms versus using third-party DSPs. We do not know if this bubble or is a bubble within agency or more structural needs to play out as the year progresses, if it\u2019s structural we will have to be more aggressive on going after a cost cuts to maintain our earnings. Although we are likely continue to see volatility within agency on a quarterly basis, it is a key part of the CMO selling process, which attracts more broad and less IT centric relationships. ","Now let\u2019s go over to the next slide and talk about Card Services. Card Services delivered strong financial results achieving a 17th consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth. Revenue increased 17% for the first quarter of 2016, driven by 27% increase in average receivables. Adjusted EBITDA net grew 9% dampen slightly by the provision bills. Importantly, principal loss rates were 5.2% for the quarter 10 basis points better than our original guidance. ","Focusing on the key drivers for our growth, credit sales increased a healthy 25% driven by our proven ability to build customer loyalty for both our long standing and newest brand partners as well as favorable weather and an early Easter. Our core business brand partners with us from four years or more continues to contribute roughly half of our credit sales growth. ","Importantly, we continue to grow tender share up over 200 basis points for the first quarter by leveraging our large understanding of our brands along with a deep data analytics we bring there. Most of the tender share pick-up has been driven by card members that have been engaged with our card for multiple years and offer new accounts. In other words, these are 10 year card members with a proven spending and payment history and they are demonstrating increased spend for the brands they love. This is a testament to the power of our customized marketing programs and the value they deliver to our long standing partners; it is also a key differentiator and critical element in our ability to welcome with new partners. ","Looking at the remaining drivers of our performance, we talked about revenue grew 17% driven by the strong AIR growth. Importantly, we realize strong operating expense leverage as we are able to drop our expense ratio by 70 bps for the quarter. As expected, gross yields will experience some compression driven primarily by brand mix, accounting for acquired files and lower late fees as we have seen several declines for several months in our first stage delinquency bucket.","This pressure is predominantly in the first-half of the year and we expect yields to normalize as we anniversary these items. Managing losses was key in the first quarter and we exceeded guidance previously outlined. Losses delinquency levels and funding cost were all in line with both expectations and seasonal trends.","During the quarter we decided not to renew the card programs net renewal at year end. The related receivables, net of the allowance for loan loss, have been reclassified to assets held for sale at March 31, 2016. Accordingly $430 million has been removed from card receivables and $15 million has been removed from the allowance for loan losses. Our reserve for loan losses was 5.7%, our receivables at March 31, 2016 up from 5.5% at December 31, 2015. Reserve dollars dropped by $15 million from December 31 due to the reclassification previously discussed.","In closing, for Card Services, we delivered another stellar quarter with all the key metrics outpacing the industry and consistent with our expectations. We are positioned for another record year, in line with our strategy of 20% plus credit sales and AIR growth leveraging both organic growth and new partnerships.","With that I\u2019ll turn it over to Ed.","Edward Heffernan","Thanks, guys. When we turn to first quarter score card and the goal of course is to have more greens and yellows and reds and right now we are tracking with 30 being green. I would say in terms of Q1, a couple of general comments; one is as Charles mentioned, this was obviously our toughest quarter; comp versus last year was very difficult and putting in a plus five top, plus five earnings was right on the money of what we wanted to do and our view into the rest of the year looks solid. So it\u2019s good to get that behind us. Also you\u2019ll find that it was kind of a mix bag in terms of what it got us from A to B, but at the end the plus is sort of out way the minuses and we got where we wanted to be.","As we move into the second quarter and the rest of the year things are accelerating nicely. We have good line of sight into the rest of the year. From a first quarter perspective consolidated we came right in where we said in terms of guidance at about $1.7 billion top and about $384 million on earnings, that included getting hit on the FX side with about $26 million in top and about nickel on earnings from FX, which if it holds we\u2019ll fortunately start to anniversary as we move into the back half.","We talked about the toughest comp of the year is now behind us and we were pretty active in the buyback taking in a bunch of shares which we thought were pretty cheap. So overall consolidated we got where we wanted to be and we remain on track for the year in current services. Just the highlight of course the portfolio continues to grow very quickly with over 20% growth revenue in the high teens and then obviously due to the fact that we\u2019re growing so quickly we need to obviously set up reserves and that tends to be a damper on EBITDA.","Nonetheless that did grow 9%, yields gets the yellow. It was a little over 200 basis points due to multiple factors that we can talk about. Again the good news there is that it\u2019s already beginning to burn away and we expect less compression as each quarter goes by for the year and we have pretty good visibility into that as well. So more of a Q1 issue.","The loss rate, we spent the first three months of the year here in dealing with two questions that people were spooked about. The first being credit quality and the second being Canada going into a depression and what\u2019s interesting is those are the two items that probably perform best during the quarter. Credit quality actually came in a little bit better than we had anticipated. We now expect it to drift downwards as the year progresses from a seasonally high Q1 and similar to what we\u2019ve said three months ago we\u2019ll say the same thing now, we check with our collectors and everyone else, there is zero pressure that we are seeing coming in that would suggest that there is any type of stress on the consumer at this point.","So we are just not seeing it, we didn\u2019t see it before and again we are just normalizing the lost rates in the file, which right now we are tracking nicely to that. I will emphasize and explain which is tender share, that\u2019s often lost in all these discussions about growth and are you growing too fast, too slowly, how are you growing, is it good quality, bad quality and all that other stuff.","Tender share is up 200 basis points, which means if 30% of the sales at a retailer were on our card a year ago now it\u2019s 32% and that is not being moved by putting on a bunch of new accounts. And in fact what it essentially means is that when the retailer is growing 2%, 3% we are growing 10%. And so the first 10 points of portfolio growth are coming from a deeper penetration of that retailer sales base and the next bullet point to me really brings at home the 80% of this tender share gain they are coming from the mature accounts.","They are coming from accounts that have been with us for 20-24 months or more, which means they\u2019ve passed the peak sort of loss point and they are very mature and our ability to get in there and motivate incremental spend is what it\u2019s all about and that\u2019s the data driven targeted marketing and I think that\u2019s probably the most important takeaway is that this is not coming from tossing on a whole bunch of new accounts or changing underwriting or anything like that it\u2019s coming from driving those very long-term loyal customers to visit more often and spend a bit more on each visit.","So that continues to work out well. The pipeline, we expect another year of $2 billion in new vintages. We have a bunch that have been signed haven\u2019t been released then they will be released over the next couple of quarters. So the pipeline was good.","And as we move to Epsilon on the next page that\u2019s where we run into probably if you were to ask me about where the concern is for the year, it certainly not on the credit side, it\u2019s certainly not Canadian side, it\u2019s certainly not on the technology and data and digital sides of Epsilon Conversant. We are focused however on some weakness on the agency side, which is about a quarter of Epsilon Conversant. And what we saw there was sort of a general pull back in a number of the verticals.","And we\u2019re going to watch that carefully as Charles said we don\u2019t know whether that\u2019s just a result of CMOs taking a breather in the first quarter given the turmoil or whether that\u2019s more structural in any event if it is structural we\u2019ll make sure that earnings will be remain on track, which means we would have to focus on the expense side. So we don\u2019t know right now and we\u2019re not going to need jerked at this point.","On the other side of it, the digital technology platform stuff up 8% that\u2019s three quarters of Epsilon Conversant and we continue to see very, very strong take up in terms of the data driven targeted display offerings from Conversant, the number of wins that we\u2019re seeing right now are already half of they were for the entire year last year. And then from an expense perceptive and flexibility perceptive our India office is up and running and we hopefully continuing to staff that up as the year progresses and that will finally begin to move the needle on the expense side towards the later part of the year.","LoyaltyOne I think Bryan covered that obviously BrandLoyalty is a very choppy business it\u2019s had a frankly a little bit better Q1 from the EBITDA perceptive than we had initially talked about, but recall last year Q1 was when revenue was up 100%. So it was then down in Q2 this year will be more of the reverse where it will have a very strong Q2 for BrandLoyalty and it\u2019s all driven by when the grocers have decided to put the programs on the calendar.","Bryan also talked about the BrandLoyalty expansion into North America, Canada is doing quite well and moving nicely towards our goal there. And the U.S. actually we\u2019re beginning to make some nice inroads there as well. So good news on that front. The -- again the concerned on the AIR MILES side in Canada was that issuance would fall off as consumer spend was weak what we found was the reverse which was issuance was very strong and specifically issuance in the financial services space, which had been lagging before actually came back quite strongly. So it looks like Canada is still alive and picking is doing quite well.","Revenue and EBITDA plus 4, plus 11 frankly constant currency basis was the best we\u2019ve seen in years. And so it looks like the business up there is back in growth mode. Overall for those of you who have covered ADS for a number of years, it\u2019s kind of a typical ADS quarter. You\u2019ve got a bunch of things then went a little bit better than expected. You had some things that went worse than expected. And the end results is they kind of even out. And we meet or we beat our guidance and that\u2019s pretty much been our track record for the last 15 years. We expect that to be the case going forward as well.","If you look at it in the cards group the yields were a little bit worse than we had anticipated, but losses are a little bit better. And then at Epsilon, the digital and tech platforms remained on track, we talked about agency and media was weak that was offset by the fact in LoyaltyOne that AIR MILES was better, our BrandLoyalty was tracking.","So again with us you can pick and choose whatever data points you want, but at the end of the day, the pluses and minuses hopefully even out to get to a double-digit growth rate for the year. And as we turn to our full year guidance that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re saying. It\u2019s very straightforward now with Q1 behind us we have even a higher level of confidence in how the rest of the year is going to play out. ","And we feel very comfortable reiterating our full year guidance of revenue of $7.1 billion, up 10% and earnings of $16.75, up 11%. And the nice thing about it is the slowest quarter is behind us. We\u2019re going to ramp to high single-digits in the second quarter and then we\u2019ll do double-digit top and bottom Q3 double-digit top and bottom in Q4. And that will give us a nice jump off into 2017 visibility is quite strong. Q2 guidance revs around $1.6 billion, up 8% and earnings also up about 8%. I think those are good numbers to start the acceleration.","From a card services perspective, you\u2019ll see the principal loss rate forecast that we gave a while ago. And loan behold it seems to be playing out at that level if not just a snitch better, which is good. We expect for the year Card Services to once again deliver double-digit growth in revenue and adjusted EBITDA net of funding. Yield compression, which I am sure we\u2019ll get some questions on will lessen each quarter as the year progresses. So that we wind up at the end of the year with a very modest impression, which is how we want to take it into \u201817.","And then we said the pipeline is very robust and that we\u2019ll get into a little bit about our decisions around who to renew, when to renew at what levels will we renew clients given that there is a certain amount of capital we want to put into the business, but we want to maintain a sort of a 20 plus growth rate in the file. And that means maybe our capital is better spent on other areas and we don\u2019t renew certain folks.","So that\u2019s where we are on Epsilon. We talked about digital and tech platforms are three fourths of the business, we expect that to continue clipping along in the high single-digits. The signings for the Conversant CRM vintage if you recall last year was about 30 wins and a very strong vintage signing of 80ish plus once they fully spooled up. We expect to lease that this year if not a little bit better which would be great. And then the agency stuff, look we\u2019re going to watch it and we\u2019re going to see the people intensive business to about quarter of Epsilon Conversant from what we\u2019re seeing it looks soft, but it looks already like it\u2019s lessening in terms of the softness as we progress into Q2 and the rest of the year. ","Okay, last slide full year, LoyaltyOne, BrandLoyalty Q2 is the big one for them. So expect very, very strong double-digit rev and EBITDA. And then in AIR MILES, we remain comfortable that issuance, which is the key metrics there it\u2019s how we get paid is going to be up about 4% for the year, which will drive on a constant currency basis low single-digit revs and EBITDA for year, which again would fly in the face of sort of the weakening consumer in Canada.","Overall, as I mentioned several moving pieces, but full year is shaping up nicely. We are seeing zero stress on the consumer side; we are not seeing weakness in Canada. So those two data points are consistent with last quarter and the quarter before that. I just would talk a little bit about the model itself for Alliance. From 2007 through 2015 we\u2019ve produced annual growth rate of 15% and 18% for revenue and earnings per share respectively every single year. And for \u201816 and \u201817 as losses normalize and with a huge growth in the file we\u2019re setting aside reserves for future losses, which are essentially doing is knocking that growth rate down a bit, but you\u2019re still looking at low and double-digit growth rates in top and bottom. So this year we\u2019re looking at 10 and 11 and that includes some drive from FX.","And then in \u201818 it\u2019s in fact we\u2019re right and these rates have stabilized then there is no reason to doubt that it would snap right back to the prior model and you can have re-acceleration in growth rate. So if you look at long-term for the company you\u2019re looking somewhere mid-teens to high-teens revs and core EPS then when you are in a period of normalization and building reserves you\u2019re probably looking at the low end, top and bottom double-digits. And then you snap back sort of mid-teens when that normalizes.","So overall not too shabby of a model you\u2019ll also find with us that we tend to have different levers in different businesses, cycle up and down at different times, but overall the model holds together quite nicely for guidance on the last slide. We\u2019re keeping at the same and we\u2019re not going to spend a lot of time going through the nits and nets of how we get there, but it looks pretty solid at plus 10, plus 11 and that puts our organic growth rate actually quite a bit above our 3x GDP target it looks like cash flow looks very nice, very strong we shared about $1.4 billion.","And when it comes to FX and all that other stuff we\u2019ll adjust it when it becomes meaningful as the year plays out, but again we\u2019re not going to be tweaking everything, every quarter we\u2019re going to try to get this thing going on a consolidated basis.","So that\u2019s all I had, why don\u2019t we open it up for Q&A. Operator? ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. ","Sanjay Sakhrani","I guess my first question is on the agency side of Epsilon, I guess Charles you mentioned that you\u2019re not sure if it\u2019s structural or not in terms of the weakness there. And maybe Ed or Charles you can talk about a little bit more I mean is that weakness specific to Epsilon or other seeing similar weakness obviously adjusting for maybe one or two large clients that have unique issues?","Edward Heffernan","It\u2019s a good question don\u2019t know enough yet at this point, we do know I mean I\u2019m going to say what happened in our business, which was across a number of our verticals CPG and Telco and Retail it was interestingly also a pull-back in Q1.","It looks like it\u2019s beginning to trickle back in as we start moving into Q2, but it\u2019s still little bit soft. So we don\u2019t want to call it yet, but it seem like a lot of people just stepped on the breaks in Q1. So I just don\u2019t know what the others are seeing out there right now Sanjay, but from us it looks like Q1 people just pulled back and then as we\u2019re looking at Q2 it looks like it\u2019s beginning to loosen up a little bit. And so if it continues to loosen up we\u2019re not going to need to take any action if it continues to stay soft like this we\u2019re going to have to take some internal actions.","Sanjay Sakhrani","And I assume you\u2019re assuming continued softness for the rest of the year in your guidance?","Edward Heffernan","We\u2019re assuming for the three quarters of Epsilon Conversant that\u2019s the tag in digital and everything else we assume they\u2019re going to continue to be quite strong at about plus 8. And then on the agency side to your point we\u2019re assuming in our guidance that it will be soft, but not nearly as soft as Q1.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Got it. And then just second question, my final question, just on those two portfolios that you closed, are they are not renewing in card. Could you just talk about how that unfolded, kind of why and how tenured were those relationships?","Edward Heffernan","Yeah, it\u2019s a good question and we are kind of at the point now where we\u2019ve got the business growing the files growing 25% a year, which is pretty much we don\u2019t want to drift much higher than that, but we are also finding that the pipeline the number of opportunities that are out there as people shift their dollars to the data-driven targeted spend. Frankly there is a whole bunch of business out there and there are times in the past where we\u2019ve had some clients who have decided not to pour all their energy and efforts into driving tender share growth and card growth, that usually comes with a change in management, other times it\u2019s a change in strategy and normally we\u2019ve just sort of said that\u2019s fine we\u2019ll go with the flow.","Right now we\u2019re dealing with how do we allocate our capital and if we want to continue to grow the business the files 20 plus percent a year, how do we maintain the type of returns that we expect. And frankly there are a couple of programs there that based upon how do we stay as the comments being made about the dollars that folks are willing to put into it in the direction of those businesses. It didn\u2019t look like the best use of our capital. And so we\u2019ve reallocated that capital to a couple of wins that we think are I think more down the fairway for us.","So it\u2019s a nice, I\u2019m trying to be a polite way of saying there is going to be sometimes where the capital is better used elsewhere and this is one of those times. We\u2019ve just never been capital constraint. But we are at the point now where the growth rate in the file is pretty much at our max level.","Sanjay Sakhrani","And how does it affect the growth assumption for that business? Does it?","Edward Heffernan","Doesn\u2019t effect. No, there is no effect at all. It\u2019s already been spoken for and I know we had some already some questions about whether it was which client it was and obviously we haven\u2019t negotiated anything in terms of where we are going to put the file. But it\u2019s just FYI, it\u2019s not any client on the left coast. So that\u2019s all I can say on that one.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Darrin Peller with Barclays.","Darrin Peller","Thanks, guys. Let me just quickly follow-up on the F1 side. I mean if you can give us a little more granularity booked into the strength of the second data side there and I know Conversant in the pipeline look strong still. But I mean I guess just want to make sure that\u2019s sustainable in terms of you\u2019re opting here the same clients on the agency side pull back any at all on the tech side obviously the growth doesn\u2019t show that yet. I mean then if you can give us a little more color on the levers that you have capable of pulling from a cost standpoint in Epsilon if it has to start next quarter. I guess how much room do we have, it seems [ph] like an area that you\u2019ve tried to cut cost in the past and outsource things to India, et cetera. So I love to hear more color on how much room there is?","Edward Heffernan","Yeah. I mean right now what we are seeing is continuation of strong demand for the digital products at Conversant, specifically sort of the SKU level data-driven targeted display offerings. It\u2019s very strong. In general the more core Epsilon big loyalty and customer database builds are strong and data offerings are strong. So all that heavy tech stuff demand continues to be strong, we expect that to continue for the balance of the year.","On the agency side, look we need to be very careful, we don\u2019t meet your [indiscernible], if it\u2019s an air pocket, then great and we are back in business if it looks like it\u2019s softer than we expect then it\u2019s a very project intensive, people intensive business. You would have to move quickly to make sure that revenues and expenses sync up. But what we\u2019re seeing right now is the softness in Q1 is already lessening a bit as we move into Q2. So we\u2019re going to hold off knee jerking this thing and if in fact Q2 comes in very soft on the agency side, we\u2019ll still make our nums for the company from a guidance perspective for us. But we\u2019ll have to take some expenses out to make sure we make our nums for the year. ","Darrin Peller","Maybe I just missed it, but in terms of the 5% what was your overall Epsilon outlook for the year now in terms of organic growth for all segments?","Charles Horn","What we talked about for Epsilon is mid-single digit plus on top and bottom. I think we\u2019ll stay there. ","Darrin Peller","Same, okay. Alright, thanks. Let me just shift and then I\u2019ll turn it back to the queue. But on the private label on the card services side, I guess first on growth do you agree I mean co-branding I know is tougher now from a competitive understand point. So just revisiting the addressable market in terms of opportunities. Obviously giving your investing I think this is the first time I remember hearing you guys investing a couple of portfolios, based on better opportunities to probably go profitability elsewhere. But either way I mean I guess just revisiting the addressable market would be helpful given it seems like it\u2019s more probably a little more focused than co-branding now. And then on that note, yield compression as a combination of things like you guys mentioned automated payments and new vintages and also co-branding. With all of those things anniversarying and co-branding potentially moving lower now as a percentage of the mix should be yield potentially rise in \u201817 or it must be stable?","Edward Heffernan","I think the yield will be relatively stable in \u201817 exactly to your point. As we\u2019re burning through these compression issues and it seems to anniversary and to your point exactly a little less emphasis on the co-brand side. You won\u2019t have that sort of large compression that you\u2019ve seen in the last couple of years of 100 basis points or so on the yield side be significantly less than that. And that has to do again with we\u2019re looking to optimize the portfolio, which means that at this part of the cycle you\u2019ve got an awful lot of miles proceed when it comes to co-brands.","So that isn\u2019t quite as exciting to us at this point in the cycle. We\u2019ve seen this play out before. So we\u2019re looking to optimize the file continue the growth at 20 plus percent and keep the compression much more modest on a go forward basis. And based on the pipeline and what we\u2019re signing and what you\u2019ll see released later this year, we feel pretty good with it.","Darrin Peller","Alright that\u2019s helpful guys. Thank you. ","Operator","Does that complete your question?","Darrin Peller","Yeah. ","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Kevin McVeigh with Macquarie.","Kevin McVeigh ","Great, thanks. Hey nice job guys. In terms of Charles, the improvement in credit to 10 bps. What would drove that and how should we think about that over the course of the year still sticking with kind of the 5-5 or should we kind of expect some improvement there as well?","Charles Horn","So what we gave guidance to is a 5 as a loss rate for the year.","Kevin McVeigh ","5 loss rate. ","Charles Horn","We came in a little bit better in Q1. I think you\u2019ll see we could come in a little bit better in Q2 and Q3. It could be up a little bit in Q4 compared to original guidance. But I would say we\u2019re right on track to hit the 5% for the year. In terms of mid-teens doing better by 10 bps in the first quarter some of its timing. But I\u2019d say for the year we\u2019re tracking right the 5% the loss rate that we gave as guidance.","Kevin McVeigh ","Got it. And then as we think about the mix of private label versus co-brand going forward, we still come in the range you talked about historically more of a shift on the private label side.","Charles Horn","I\u2019d say we\u2019re still around 20-80, 80% private label 20% co-brand. To Ed\u2019s point before we\u2019re doing less co-brand that\u2019s where the most of the competition is. So we\u2019re focused more on private label. You know us private label were secret soft that\u2019s where we have all the expertise. And so you\u2019ll see more growth coming there, which long-term should benefit the yields going back to Darren\u2019s question before. ","Kevin McVeigh ","Awesome. Thanks I\u2019ll get back in queue. ","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Bob Napoli with William Blair. ","Bob Napoli","Thank you. Good morning. Hey Ed just and Charles are the additional buybacks in your guidance, so you bought back about $400 million, you said you\u2019ve had $500 million and I think you expect to buyback closer to $800 million to $1 billion.","Charles Horn","So the second piece of our authorization is not considered Bob. So the initial $500 million was considered the second $500 million is not considered in guidance.","Bob Napoli","Okay, thank you. Then on the tender share improvement, the 80% for mature accounts that\u2019s very helpful with, but are you -- is that piece being driven by increasing credit lines for those individual that are using the line and obviously since the mature accounts they I am sure they\u2019re performing well, credit wise.","Edward Heffernan","Yeah. I mean, it\u2019s -- we\u2019re not passed enough lines. We\u2019ve never had really an issue with an open to buy I think Charles you know better than I, but we have a $500 balance we may have an $800 line. So there is plenty of room on the open to buy and we rescore all $40 million accounts every quarter. So it\u2019s not a credit line issue, it\u2019s more of if I have $800 line and a $500 balance and I\u2019m growing it normally 5% a year, how do I get it to 7% or 8% and that\u2019s basically the whole tender share gain, which is how do I get her to make one more visit if they\u2019re not visiting the store itself a lot of our tender share gains or I\u2019d say the bulk of it is coming through online sales where we reach out to her and make some type of compelling offer to her and she will go online to buy it. A lot of this has to use the lingo again, she is snacking online meaning that we\u2019re seeing a lot of incremental purchases that are relatively small in size, but they\u2019re happening very frequently.","Bob Napoli","Okay, Great. Thanks. And then just last question on the agency business on the Epsilon business on the Epsilon business, is that -- I mean have you lost, is this just pull back by client, have you lost some clients are you losing share of a client to another competitor or piece? So what\u2019s going on there, I don\u2019t think the industry is pulled back, as much as we saw in your business in the first quarter and who are you primarily competing with today in those sectors?","Edward Heffernan","It\u2019s a good question, one quarter doesn\u2019t a trend make, so it\u2019s still up in the AIR, in terms of what exactly, all we did see was we saw project business basically dry up in the first quarter that we accounted on and as a result the business we needed to close to make agency hit Q1 didn\u2019t happen. Now are those projects beginning to drift back in it looks like they are slowly drifting back in. So that\u2019s all we know at this point.","Bob Napoli","Who you are seeing is your -- I mean by sector, the agency versus tech, who would you point out as your two or three largest and toughest competitors?","Edward Heffernan","I think, it\u2019s all over the board in terms of when it\u2019s pure agency you could have the big Madison Avenue players involved there, you could have some of the other digital smaller agencies involved there. But for the most of part what we do is we like to link the agency as sort of the tip of the arrow to get in the door with the CMO to flow through to the big heavy duty, high visibility tech platforms that we build for them. The project based stuff on the agency side as you can tell us the stuff that can jerk around quite a bit on a quarterly basis.","So that\u2019s sort of -- but we\u2019re seeing the big tech platforms continued to be built and it\u2019s just these projects on the agency side that we just saw a softness in Q1. So we just don\u2019t want to get out in front of this thing and start saying oh my gosh we\u2019ve got long-term weakness in agency when it could very well just be one quarter phenomenon.","Charles Horn","So Bob, the only thing I would add is, it\u2019s not a case where we\u2019re losing clients, it\u2019s not a number clients gone away she is spent. So in the first quarter we really saw less spend going back to Ed\u2019s point where on a project basis CMOs cut their budgets with us for whatever reason.","Bob Napoli","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Andrew Jeffrey and he is with SunTrust.","Andrew W. Jeffrey ","Hi, good morning guys. Thanks for taking the question. Ed, I guess I want to ask a big picture strategic question with regard to Epsilon is there as you think about agency irrespective sort of the quarterly volatility in that business is there still the same sort of competitive strategic rationale for having agency as part of Epsilon as you might have thought there was five years ago? Has your thinking changed on that at all?","Edward Heffernan","No I think it\u2019s absolutely critical that we have that skill set because that\u2019s the skill set that can get in the door have the conversation with the CMO and that will then lead to the pull through to the big client database where it\u2019s the big Loyalty platform builds the big CRM business at Conversant. So, no I think the skill set there is critical in order to pull through for the other parts of Epsilon it\u2019s almost like if even though it\u2019s a bit soft this quarter my view is if you take it away, what you\u2019re going to wind up is you\u2019re going to cut the head off the rest of the big tech pull-throughs at the rest of Epsilon and the whole thing will eventually slowdown.","Andrew W. Jeffrey ","Okay. And is there with regard to again agencies there are customer concentration issue you think within that business is that part of the reason we see the volatility is there anything you could about it if there is? ","Charles Horn","It is part of it Andrew if you look our biggest clients in Epsilon are all on the agency side of the business. So when they pull back on any project or maybe not supporting us with a particular offering they can move the needle quickly and be in project based they can do volatility in for a quarter quite a bit for the year you can pretty well estimate what they\u2019re going to do. But they can basically open up it fast sort of close it quite quickly based upon what they\u2019re wanting to do with the marketing spend. And so what we saw in Q1 was they basically closed this ticket we think that they will open it up as the year progresses. So we\u2019re not sending alarm bells, but it is big companies, big budgets and they can flux it quite quickly. ","Andrew W. Jeffrey ","Okay. And then quickly with regard to your outlook for what maybe a loss rate plateau in \u201818 and beyond, can you dig a little bit into the rationale of the thought process that gives you confidence that we might do something that\u2019s pretty unprecedented historically in terms of stable charge-offs?","Edward Heffernan","Yeah I mean if you look at it it\u2019s a great question, the fact that as we talked about the bulk of our growth the 10% in the quarter growth that we\u2019re seeing is really coming from accounts that are very mature have been well seasoned, well passed the peak charge-off cycle we are normalizing the loss rate. I think maybe two more stats might be helpful, which is look we thought before the great recession our normalized loss rate was 6.5% we\u2019re seeing it\u2019s 5.5% now.","Why is that why are we comfortable that that\u2019s our long-term run rate and that\u2019s what we\u2019re normalizing towards probably a couple of interesting stats there one is, with the new mix of co-brand which carries a higher scoring customer as well as some of the higher end type retailers that have joined us we\u2019re attracting cardholders that tend to skew a little bit higher on the credit spectrum.","So for example if you were to compare all of our active accounts today versus 2007 the scores today on average are higher than they were in 2007 even with some of -- a lot of the accounts we\u2019ve added recently. So from an active account basis the average score is higher. Also if you look at it from a balance perspective the average score for balance today is higher than it was in 2007. And so you put those two together and that\u2019s how you get to we\u2019re not going to normalize out at 6.5% we\u2019re going to normalize out at 5.5%, but look it\u2019s not like we\u2019re trying to keep it lower. The fact is you give up some yields by not being at a higher loss rate. So I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s a strategy of ours to keep it at 5.5% it\u2019s just the way the file is playing out right now.","Andrew W. Jeffrey ","Okay, appreciate it. Thank you. ","Operator","Thank you. And your next question comes from Ashish Sabadra with Deutsche Bank. ","Ashish Sabadra","Thanks. Just a quick follow-up on the agency weakness here. So the agency has both conversant as well as core Epsilon. I just wondering if the 23% decline that you saw that was consistent across both of those segments. And then Charles, you mentioned that there is intra-quarter volatility there depending on the projects. Is there something you can do strategically going forward to lower that volatility or is it just that as tech continues to grow faster it will be bigger portion of the revenues. I was just wondering how should we think about the volatility coming down in the agency. Because it has been volatile over the last several quarters now.","Charles Horn","You\u2019re right Ashish we\u2019re going to have to grow the technology piece of the business quicker that\u2019s just frankly where it\u2019s going to be agency in a good year is going to grow 3%, technology in a good year is going to grow 10 plus. So from a mix standpoint you\u2019ll basically take some of the volatility away from it. If you look at the breakdown it was weakness in both categories. We saw weakness in traditional agency for Epsilon where we saw weakness across many verticals. I couldn\u2019t pinpoint anyone client because it was broad based.","On the Conversant side, on the traditional display, we\u2019ve definitely seen fewer people trying to use our private exchange. You\u2019ve got the big agencies trying to push the programmatic buying through their own and trading platforms. So regardless of the quality of the impressions we can provide, they\u2019re trying to stuff it through their own system and we just saw a general pull back there.","So that was a little bit unexpected. So I\u2019d say it was both sides of it. We do think we\u2019ll get some stability as the year goes on, but there is really going back to Ed\u2019s point out not any particular we can point to aside from it just seem like there was soft spend in Q1.","Ashish Sabadra","Okay. Just quickly on the margins for the Epsilon business, you highlighted couple of reasons for the margins being lower. But how should we think about margins going forward? Technically if agency pertains to be a lower margin, tech was a higher margin business and as tech is growing faster, you would expect the margins to grow up going forward. So just wanted to better understand how should we think about the dynamics for Epsilon margins over the next several quarters, but also the longer term?","Charles Horn","So the way you look at it is basically you\u2019re right. Agency will grow slower it\u2019s the lower EBITDA margin, your technology will grow quicker is the highest EBITDA margin. So it\u2019s from a pure mix standpoint, you should get some EBITDA margin expansion this year and in the future. Clearly, we\u2019ll have to look at the agency and play through it this is the short-term hiccup or air pocket as I said before. Or is a case where we have to structurally cut back on cost to get our margins back where they need to be. That\u2019s a little bit unknown at this point. But long-term I would expect the margins to expand slightly based on mix.","Ashish Sabadra","Okay, that\u2019s really helpful. And one final question on the grocery compression. So the late fees have been weighing on or the lower late fees have been weighing on which is actually better because it helps you or it reflective of a better consumer environment. But just how should we think about that compression? Like how much visibility or how much confidence that you have that comes off in the second half and going into \u201817? Thanks. ","Edward Heffernan","Yeah we have very good visibility into this as we go into the second half. A large chunk of it probably half of it relates to what I called consumer friendly programs, which I probably should fund. It basically as we look at all of our practices and basically said how do we continue to see the premium provider in the marketplace, the most customer friendly provider in the marketplace as we continue to ramp up.","And so there is a bunch of things that we put in place as we went into the back half of last year. So for example, it doesn\u2019t seem like a lot, but it does move the needle in terms of if someone gets paid on the 15th of each month, but their ability to do on the 13th. Well that doesn\u2019t work out all that well sometime. So what we\u2019ve done is we\u2019ve given everyone the right to move their due date to later on in the month if they wanted to.","And that again it\u2019s doesn\u2019t seem like much, but it actually does affect the late fees and -- but at the same time it also helps our OpEx as you see with the leverage, because we have much lower talk time of people calling up saying hey, I need a couple of more days. So you have that you have people who are calling in where they used to be a fee. If you are paying by the phone we decided that wasn\u2019t best practices, we took that out as well. And so we just took a number of things out of system that\u2019s frankly caused more grief than they added. We got a lot of it back in lower OpEx in terms of talk time and everything else and we have a much happier client in customer base.","And so I think that\u2019s sort of what it is, none of it was dictated by any regulatory authority. It was something we proactively went out just did and we think taking the hit now for it and seeing in anniversary in the back half is probably the best thing to do and hopefully that will pay dividends down the line.","Ashish Sabadra","Thanks Ed.","Edward Heffernan","One more.","Steve Calk","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. And your final question comes from David Scharf with JMP Securities.","David M. Scharf","Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I\u2019ll apologize in advance because it\u2019s sort of a repeat of some that have been asked, but I just want a clarification. On the agency side can give us a sense for how much of the business for agency is so called project based versus I guess worth that you would deem to be well not an annuity pretty reliable and recurring. Obviously it\u2019s all based on CMO budgets. But is the vast majority of the business things that you would deem to be quarter-by-quarter project base whether is it necessarily great visibility?","Charles Horn","Definitely on the Epsilon side of it that\u2019s the case where it\u2019s you got one or two year contracts, but it\u2019s project to project on the conversant side it\u2019s not going to be a more volume driven because it\u2019s basically side display. Basically you\u2019ve got a lot of unpredictability when you get to agency you can have a longer term contract, but it reflects based on volume, predicting what it\u2019s going to be on a quarterly to quarter basis is just a difficult thing to do David.","David M. Scharf","Got it. And when we think about the cost structure and obviously the agency business has always had the least amount of operating leverage given it\u2019s people intensive. But you\u2019ve talked about in the disclosure that agency is roughly maybe a quarter of the Epsilon segment the traditional Aspen business plus Conversant. But from the standpoint of the percentage of fixed cost, how should we think about it?","Charles Horn","I would say your premise is right, David. It is a higher fixed cost business, it\u2019s more of a people driven business. So variability is pretty low, for the reason why you saw that our EBITDA was down quite a bit in the quarter was because the revenue was down on agency and it doesn\u2019t flex very much. So you are right I don\u2019t have an exact percentage, but you can assume it is our highest fixed cost business would be within agency. So if we see it\u2019s a structural issue in the market then we\u2019ll have to go through and address the fixed cost and we can do so pretty quickly if we need to.","David M. Scharf","Okay. And as we think about the description of a lessening degree of revenue decline in Q2. I mean 23% is a big number, I mean should we be thinking 15% to 20% down or more closer to 10%, just trying to get a little bit of context.","Charles Horn","Yeah I don\u2019t think we are in a position to really say that at this point as to what it\u2019s going to be. We do feel good, it\u2019s going to get better we had a difficult comp in Q1. So we know it\u2019s going to be less in Q2. But at the stage it would be very difficult for me to quantify it Q2, Q3, Q4 as you know David we look at our guidance in total, not in any single piece.","So just like in the first quarter we had over performance in some areas and weakness in other. We would look for the year to be the same way. So it\u2019s very difficult for me to quantify that for you by quarter David.","David M. Scharf","Got it. And as you referenced a little bit of loosening in Q2, maybe some of the project based expected or hope for backlog is starting to materialize again. Are those coming specifically from those larger clients that may have pulled back unexpectedly or these new wins new contracts?","Charles Horn","I\u2019d say it\u2019s little bit of both. You do have some new wins coming through and we\u2019ll look to focus on that during the course of the year and I do think you are going to see budgets open up a little bit with us as the years progresses as well. As I said before we think it was a little bit of nature of reaction with CMOs in Q1. I know I was told over and over we\u2019re heading into recession quite quickly in the U.S. So I think many people listening to the rhetoric and I think it\u2019s on project based, discretionary based marketing, I think it pulled back a little bit in Q1. ","David M. Scharf","Got it. And then just lastly on the card side, it sounded like some pretty guarded or crafted language regarding the two programs that will be renewed, but is it fair to say I mean should we think of that as two retailer partners that perhaps are not willing to commit as much marketing push behind the product as before basically deemphasizing the store card is one of their marketing tools.","Charles Horn","Yes. ","David M. Scharf","Got it, okay. Thanks very much, guys. ","Steve Calk","Okay. All right everyone, thank you, we will see you next quarter.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining today\u2019s conference and thank you for your participation.

If you haven't, please call AdvisIRy Partners at 212-750-5800. ","On the call today, we have Robert Minicucci, Chairman of Alliance Data; Charles Horn, Executive Vice President and Vice Chairman of Alliance Data; Melisa Miller, President and Chief Executive Officer of Alliance Data; and Tim King, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Alliance Data.","Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on today's call and some of the responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risks and the uncertainties described in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC.

Reconciliation of those measures to GAAP will be posted on the Investor Relations Web site at alliancedata.com.","With that, I would like to turn the call over to Melisa Miller. Melisa?","Melisa Miller","Thank you, Operator, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to welcome the folks that are with me here today, and I'd like to begin with an important update on our overall business transformation, including the progress Card Services is making in our journey to reposition the portfolio, as well as our consolidated financial results. Tim will then cover the segment results, and I'll close with 2019 and 2020 guidance.","Let's turn now to slide four. We can all agree that change was necessary, and if there is any message that you take away from our time today, it should be that we are indeed making tangible progress. First, I'd like to acknowledge that this road to transition has been lengthy, and at times, bumpy for our stakeholders. The Epsilon divestiture, tender offer, and corporate restructuring are complete. Our Card Services business has expanded into healthy verticals, and credit metrics have normalized. Within Card Services, you'll see progress in three important areas. We've successfully shifted our focus to healthy brands and verticals. We continue to serve the modern consumer with digital tools adding new offerings, and our streamlined operating model will allow us to do more with less, and to get paid for the value we bring to the table.","As I mentioned on our last call, we have been making the touch yet critical decisions in the short-term to deliver on the long-term health and viability of the business. With transformation can come disruption, so we've kept this very simple, and think about our efforts in three pillars. A streamlined operating model, ensuring we offer differentiated value, ultimately leading to consistent, sustainable growth. Now, while Card Services has been executing against its strategy to transition the makeup of the card portfolio, we've considered our broader operating model as well. This transformation is a companywide effort. We've examined all lines of business globally to streamline our various operating models, and each has emerged with a leaner, simpler structure.","Earlier in the year, we announced corporate reductions resulting from the Epsilon divestiture. That run rate is now an estimated $100 million. Additionally, a companywide expense reduction initiative is well underway. These reductions will contribute more than $100 million in incremental cost savings for 2020. Our approach to human capital, which includes increasing both our global delivery model and digital workforce is in progress. We are fully leveraging automation and artificial intelligence to create efficiencies and expand our self-service offering for brands and consumers, and this is exactly what you would expect from a company with data as our middle name. We are not like any other player in our space. We are deliberately different. And that differentiation is why we win the marketplace.","An improved operating model and expense structure will allow us to invest more deeply in technology and in the digital space to ensure we will continue to win with the modern consumer and brands. As a result, we expect to have incremental solutions in the market in the near-term, strengthening our current payments products and our in-house marketing and loyalty expertise. All of this when added together results in the larger more valuable programs we're known to deliver. So what have we done to position ourselves for 2020 and beyond? Over the past several quarters, we've spoken about Card Services' shift to growing vibrant verticals and brands, and in a moment I'll walk you through the progress that we've made.","Note that we will continue to expand where and how we grow by building on our success, testing new markets, and taking full advantage of the dozens of new emerging brands entering our space. Our new business pipeline contemplates these healthy new brands, and there's a strong demand in the market for the solutions that we offer.","Let's turn now to slide five. We'll spend some time on the progress Card is making in positioning our portfolio. As Tim and I spend time on the road visiting with investors, a question we often hear is how will you continue to grow given the uncertainty within retail? It's a question we've asked ourselves. We believe it's a fair question for us, and it's precisely why we altered our strategy, beginning in 2015. At that time, we made a deliberate decision to expand our reach into winning new brands and verticals to include, among others, beauty, home goods, and eTail. On our call today, we'll be more specific about the outcomes and the overall impact on the complexion of our portfolio.","I call your attention to the far-left bar on the top chart. In 2016, less than half of our card receivables came from these newer verticals. And if you follow the dark blue bar all the way to the right you will see that in each progressive year our concentration of A\/R in these healthier verticals continues to build. Today, these vibrant verticals and brands make up greater than 60% of our card receivables. This did not happen by accident. We got here by signing a new grouping or a vintage each progressive year.","Now, looking at the far-left bar of the bottom chart, you'll see that in 2016, less than 10% of our card receivables were coming from our newer vintages. Today, that's grown to over 35%. Essentially, all of our growth is coming from these newer vintages. We made the shift intentionally. And in just in four short years we've deliberately altered our portfolio. We no longer rely on our important but slower-growing core programs. Instead, we've secured our future growth with newer programs in growing brands and verticals. Importantly, some of these newer programs were startup programs, so our ramp to fully mature tender share has tremendous reach.","Now, before we leave this slide, we also wanted to cover the map and how we build the bridge from where we are today to our projected year-end card receivable. Important to note, we now project our end-of-period receivables to be roughly $19.5 billion down from our prior quarter forecast, largely due to the softness in the core programs I just mentioned. Generally, with normal seasonal trends, we expect to see a 10% to 12% increase from Q2 end-of-period receivables to Q4 end-of-period receivables. Our 2019 Q3 ending position, of $17.9 billion, puts us well in the range of $19.5 billion by the end of the year. We thought it was important to spend some time on the deliberate shift that Card has been making these past few years. As I mentioned, these moves were intentional. We have exited some verticals that we are not winning or no longer core. And admittedly, these actions have caused noise. However, we have also entered new verticals that are healthy and growing. And evidence of that is illustrated here. Ultimately, we are building a stronger, more diversified portfolio with room for growth and stability.","Now, let's turn our attention to the consolidated results for Q3 and move to slide six. Let's begin with the revenue line. Revenue increased 1% to $1.44 billion and EPS decreased to $2 41 per share. Tim will speak to the components of revenue on the next slide. So let me address the decline in EPS numbers. EPS from continuing operations declined significantly due to the restructuring charges of $55 million pre-tax primarily related to our non-card businesses, and a $72 million pre-tax charge related to early debt retirement, the combined after-tax effect of these two items was $1.86 per share.","In addition, in our card business, we had a $100 million increase in provision expense related to the A\/R build, which Tim will address on slide eight. The after-tax effect of this one large item was approximately $1.50. When combined, the impact of these two items was $3.36 per share. The provision expense also negatively affected core EPS, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted EBITDA net of funding.","Moving to net income, we were further away affected by the expenses related to discontinued operations in connection with the Epsilon sale. The Q3 after tax effect of this item dropped our EPS from a positive $2.41 to a loss of $2.13. Finally, 2019 had a higher effective tax rate of 26% versus the 16%. We saw in 2018, causing an additional $0.33 of year-over-year pressure. Q3 was a noisy quarter, and I understand how it can be difficult to reconcile due to the number of one-time events.","So Tim, let me turn it over to you to provide more detail on our results.","Tim King","Thanks, Melisa, and good morning to everyone. As Melisa just mentioned, there are factors negatively impacting us in 2019. Well, not under plan to ease, the underlying metrics on the businesses are improving. So starting with LoyaltyOne, we see reported revenue decreasing 6% to $246 million for the third quarter. Adjusting for the unfavorable foreign exchange rate and the shift to a net revenue presentation for certain reward products, revenue increased to 1%.","Looking at Card Services, revenue was up 3%. And in line with the increase in normalized AR, it is important to note that both of our businesses are positive revenue growth on an organic basis. Moving to adjusted EBITDA, LoyaltyOne's number were negatively affected by product mix, resulting in an 8% decrease in adjusted EBITDA.","I'll now move to slide eight. So I'll go into more details on Card Services. As I mentioned in the previous slide, revenue is up 3% in line with the increase in normalized A\/R. This is important turnaround versus a prior quarter, where we saw revenue down 4%. In Q2, we had both lower yield and lower normalized average receivables. This quarter our average receivables are up and yields are stabilizing, resulting in positive revenue growth.","Operating expenses were flat year-over-year. And as Melisa mentioned, we have taken dramatic steps to increasing our operating efficiency. In this quarter, our revenue growth outpaced our operating expenses by 300 basis points. We had a $100 million provision increase compared to last year, which was largely the cause of Card Services year-over-year negative performance. This was driven almost entirely by the difference in the A\/R growth trajectory.","Let me walk you through the math. In 2018, our Q3 reservable A\/R decreased by approximately $430 million. In the third quarter of 2019, our reservable A\/R increased by approximately $630 million. In 2018, P&L benefit firm benefited from the decline. Conversely, in 2019, we needed to build the provision for the incremental A\/R. As we're now back to growing our book, we need to post up allowance for loan losses. Without this expense, our quarterly performance would have been slightly better than 2018 and in line with our average receivables bill.","Now turning to slide nine, I'll focus on cards key metrics. Starting with credit sales, Card Services was up 6% on a reported basis. Compare that to Q1, where we're down 7% and in Q2 where we are flat, also showing improvements from the prior quarters are the A\/R metrics. Specifically, end-of-period A\/R was down 5% in Q1 down 2% in Q2, and that is now up 3% in Q3, as Melisa mentioned earlier, we're still expecting robust growth for the year, but along our year-end, receivables expectations to $19.5 million. While year-over-year, gross yields are negative, they too are showing improvements. In Q2, we were negative to 2018 by 90 basis points.","In Q3, we are 20 basis points lower than the prior year. This pressure is coming from the ramping up of new programs. By Q4, we expect this pressure to largely abated, and that we will be positive year-over-year. As we've guided before, we do expect gross yields to be bound slightly on a full-year basis.","Turning to operating expenses, after adjusting for the mark-to-market and held-for-sale receivables, we saw strong improvements of 100 basis points. We expect this number will continue to improve as a result of the efforts Melisa has mentioned. Both metrics of credit quality are showing stability on improvement, our charge-off rates improved 30 basis points and our delinquency numbers were up slightly. And for the remainder of the year, we do expect our charge-off to be flat versus the 2018 levels. As a result of the lower income numbers we did see our ROEs below 30% on a quarter. This is temporary, and this number is being affected by the mark-to-market expenses. And we do expect to take some hits in Q4 for restructuring charges, but again, temporary on the ROE.","So in summary, there are some issues we need to work through. But the underlying businesses are strong. LoyaltyOne's organic revenue is up slightly. Product mix is causing some noise, but it's generally stable business. Card service has increasing sales in A\/R, normalizing yields, improving expenses and stable credit metrics. And we've successfully executed large cost reduction efforts to the corporate level.","I will now give it back to Melisa who will speak to guidance for 2019 and 2020.","Melisa Miller","Thank you. And as Tim mentioned, there are a number of one-time factors affecting this year's statement. If you turn now to slide 10 first, we did not contemplate the Fed lowering the prime rate twice. In fact, like many in the industry, our early forecast predicted a rising interest rate environment. Second, we are now expecting a larger markdown on our held-for-sale receivables than previously anticipated. However, we are committed to moving forward with the sale of these portfolios to clean up our balance sheet. Third, we've seen some credit sales deterioration in our core programs which is leading to a slight reset in our average accounts receivable. We still fully expect to exit 2019 with yields higher than the previous Q4, yet down slightly for the full-year. We are tackling these disruptions now and they are all fully reflected in our guidance for 2019.","The combination of these factors is driving both the revenue and a core EPS reset, where we guided to revenues of $5.8 billion, we now believe we will be flat to 2018 at $5.6 billion. On core EPS, we are now targeting a range of $16.75 to $17 even per share. On a pro forma basis, we are targeting $20.50 to $20.75 EPS. So, despite some pieces, I hope you heard that we have made tangible progress in improving our business model and repositioning the Card Services portfolio. We are shifting our focus to faster growth verticals and will be implementing new offerings and doing more with less at a lower cost. Our efforts will ultimately restore the health and vitality of the company and we're confident that growth will follow.","And finally, moving on to slide 11, we will enter 2020 with a more focused, streamlined business. We have put the building blocks in place to ensure this is our future reality. We see significant runway ahead. Based on our current visibility, we expect lower operating expenses from our streamlined operating model, low single digit revenue growth, and mid- to- high 20% growth in core EPS.","Core EPS will be up high single digit versus 2019 per forma Core EPS. Breaking it down by segment, in LoyaltyOne, we expect to see consistent stable performance as we will be operating with a reduced cost structure and are making the necessary adjustments to improve performance. We expect Card Services revenue to be up mid to high single-digit as our newer vintages continue to drive gain with single digit growth in average card receivables and flat total gross yields.","Credit quality is expected to remain stable. Our road to transition has been bumpy at times. And this road has been cleared and we now near its end. This has positioned us to declare a new beginning. And we expect 2020 will be a strong growth year in terms of revenue and profit. We look forward to hosting an investor day in early 2020, and we are working through some growth initiatives that we look forward to discussing in more detail. So, timing will be firmed up as we get closer.","Operator, that concludes our prepared remarks, I would ask that we now open up the line for Q&A. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Thanks. Good morning, and thank you for the all context as we look into next year, but I wanted to just clarify maybe your confidence on some of the guidance data points that you provided, both in terms of revenues and expenses for each of these segments, I guess one point I was thinking about is when I look at your rate assumption for no rate reductions, no more further rate reductions, it seems like the market is assuming there might be two to three more. So, should we think of that as putting risk to the EPS target range for 2020 if that's the situation? And then how should we also think about capital ratios, and how you would manage capital going forward into 2020? I have also got one follow-up after. Thank you.","Tim King","Hey, Sanjay. So, let me start with the rate question. So, we do not expect any yield compression without contemplating the Fed, any further action by the Fed. So that would put risk on us if the Fed does lower rates. So that's answer one.","Two, as you start thinking about big guidance, going back to the yields, we expect yield to stay flat. So, our yields and therefore our revenues should be very consistent with our A\/R growth, meaning we don't expect any degradation, and our yields are built very much in line with our A\/R. That's going to flow through to our EPS, and the EPS is of course going to also benefit from the cost savings. So, if am going to - if I just use -- and I going to use pro forma and I can switch back if it's easier, but if I use the pro forma that we put out as $20.50 to $20.75, we would expect our flow through on that pro forma, because we contemplated expense reductions in our pro forma to be up 6% to 8%.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Okay. And I guess what are the asset and liability betas if you have further rate cuts, like how does that flow into revenues and expenses for card?","Tim King","I am not following your question. Are you asking how rate sensitive we are on the asset side versus the liability side?","Sanjay Sakhrani","Yes. As rates go down, like how should we think about the impact?","Tim King","Yes. We are about 70% t 80% variable rate on our book. It takes about six months for our liabilities to catch up to the rate reductions, meaning to reset our liabilities. So, in essence, we have exposure for about three or four months as did the liabilities start catching up and obviously our asset reset more quickly.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Okay. And maybe some more color on sort of how we should think about capital management and ratios. And then my follow-up question is also I saw an 8-K that that Kelly Barlow from ValueAct is stepping down from the board, and it doesn't seem like there are disagreements with the company, but maybe you guys can talk about the relevance of that and how that might affect the path forward?","And also, Melisa, I thought I heard you say you guys are done with the corporate restructuring. Does that mean that any further sales or divestures are up off the table? Thank you.","Tim King","All right, so I'll take the capital ratio, we'll turn over to Rob since he's here to talk about Kelly, and then we'll switch back to Melisa as far as any further strategic conversations. So the capital ratios, Sanjay, I really think about that in three very distinct buckets. I obviously think about the balance sheet, making sure the balance sheet is very healthy; we have enough cash on that balance sheet. We also think about any type of strategic investment, so anything we might do in card or the other LOB as far as looking at doing some type of investment to obviously shore those businesses up or continue to grown those businesses. And then finally, of course, we look at stock repurchases. So we look at those three different buckets and we just balance the three of them out.","Melisa Miller","And Sanjay, if I might add to that, we also consider the capital strategy with the overall business strategy, so they're not -- we don't separate them, they actually go hand-in-hand. And so as we look forward and ensure that we are making the right investments back into the business that will influence how and where we allocate capital. We see them going together. And then I'll pick up on the corporate restructure question, Rob, after you.","Robert Minicucci","With respect to Kelly Barlow of ValueAct, Sanjay, this week Kelly informed us that earlier in the year he took on new responsibilities. He was named a co-portfolio manager of a new fund of ValueAct that focuses on social and environmental problems. He continues as a partner in the master fund. You said it in your comments; Kelly has been a significant contributor to the Board. There are no issues in terms of strategy differential, financial or operating differential perspectives. He was very effective in raising and our -- changing our strategy and our pivot and the management changes. And so I think now with our path defined, he's going to devote more time to his new role at ValueAct. So, clearly we're grateful for his service, and wish him the best.","Melisa Miller","And Sanjay, if I might come back around on the corporate restructure question. I appreciate you giving me a chance to follow-up. What we were attempting to articulate was that the corporate restructure actions in connection with the Epsilon sale were complete. So if there would be anything in the future, of course, we would reevaluate what would be required. We mentioned previously that we had a number of initiatives that were under strategic review, and that really is still what we would say where we are today. Does that answer your question?","Sanjay Sakhrani","Yes. Yes, thank you very much.","Melisa Miller","Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research.","Darrin Peller","Hey guys, thank you. Just to maybe start off with what you might be contemplating in 2020 guide with regard to either portfolio acquisitions or the type of growth from different types of retailers, how much flexibility do you actually have on portfolio acquisitions also would be helpful? And then should we be expecting any more portfolios to move into held-for-sale, and just overall how is the health of the portfolio?","Melisa Miller","Good morning, Darrin. In terms of portfolio acquisition, currently our 2020 guide does not contemplate any large scale acquisitions. So, that could be an upside opportunity. Moving forward, our long-range plan, certainly we would be evaluating that which is available in the market. We do expect however to be signing a very healthy new vintage next year. And some of those programs that we signed this year will be coming up next year, and that is also fully contemplated in our 2020 guidance. And then with respect to held-for-sale portfolios, we did have a strategic non-renewal, but sitting here today there isn't one that we know about. We'll always be selective in what that looks like, and that's largely why we are really committed to moving forward and clearing up the balance sheet with those that are there today.","Darrin Peller","Okay. Just a quick follow-up on that, when we think about the profile of those new vintages with respect to the credit quality of those loans as well as the yield and the tradeoff between the types of yield you want to get for that credit. I mean is it basically the same? And I imagine we should be expecting the ROE to get back to north of 30%.","Melisa Miller","A great question and the answer is, from a credit quality perspective, we are actually seeing a bit of an improvement in some of the newer vintages over the rest of the book, but we would expect that over time we would say it would be stable. And the exact same with the yields. They just take a time, as you well know, to spool up, and it really depends. If we have a startup program you're looking at about three-and-a-half years-ish by the time we get to steady state versus of course a full scale conversion where we have productivity right away.","Tim, anything to add there?","Darrin Peller","Thanks. Now there was just question, and I'm sorry if I missed this earlier, but I was just trying to find the breakdown on the revision to EPS guide this year, specifically from the held-for-sale. I mean I'm sure I could find it or you may have said it earlier, but if you could just reiterate that?","Tim King","Sure. And Darrin, obviously our reset, Melisa outlined three specific items that caused our reset. One is going to be the held-for-sale mark. Two, is going to be a slightly lower average receivable, and then the third -- why am I drawing a blank?","Melisa Miller","Primary.","Tim King","Primary, thank you. So, and each of those are about the third each.","Darrin Peller","Okay, all right, guys. Thanks very much.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Bob Napoli with William Blair.","Bob Napoli","Thank you. I guess the -- Melisa, what is the right revenue and earnings growth rate for this business over the long-term, I mean do you have -- can you give some color on what you think the right model is?","Melisa Miller","Yes, that's a great question, Bob, and I'm glad that you asked it, because as we bring forward our long-range plan, for us it's not growth at all costs, for us it's not deliberately throttle growth back because you have a short-term gain. It really is what is the best for the long-term viability of the business, and we would say long-term, high single digits both in terms of revenue growth and throughput, and of course our sales in A\/R would be slightly different depending upon if we have a year with many conversion or many startups.","Tim King","Yes, Bob, there're some other factors too, you know. When we start growing in the high single-digit, and certainly if we have some opportunistic things presented to us, and certainly if we go over slightly that number, that's fine, we don't end up hurting our organization. We have infrastructure we need to put in place, we have capital requirements. Certainly we need to make sure that we have a compliance organization to keep up with that. So we start thinking long-term where high single digits, it'll bounce around a little depending on the opportunities we see.","Melisa Miller","Part of our enthusiasm -- go ahead, please.","Bob Napoli","No, I was going to say if you look at that high single-digit revenue growth, and with your strong ROE, I mean do you get some operating leverage on expenses, and then capital return drives like low double-digit earnings growth and EPS growth, is that the model or is that -- ","Tim King","So, that is our model. If you go down the P&L, obviously when I start looking at the A\/R growth you get the high single digits; I expect my revenue to be in line with that. We are not seeing any degradation in our yields at all. As you go down to our operating expenses we are pushing efficiencies there, so we'll get a little pickup there. Charge offs have been very stable, so our provision expense and our charge offs have been very stable. A little bit of pressure in the last few years in cost of funds, which certainly is abating now. So by the time you get down through that, yes, you should have a flow-through that's better than your growth on you're A\/R.","Bob Napoli","Okay, my follow-up question is just -- and I appreciate the presentation on the shift in the customer mix, but it's still a very choppy retail market out there. And I mean I would guess that as you look at your portfolio that -- I mean, I'm sure you guys know which customers could be at risk and not at risk. How do you get confident, I guess, in that long-term model that even as you're still converting or adding more stable retailers that you're not going to have some significant fallout? Some of your larger customers still are, that are in that active or not exactly performing with all cylinders going I guess you would -- ","Melisa Miller","Yes, that's a fair observation. And that just a few thoughts we'd bring forward. First, some of the divestitures, particularly those that we executed against that last year actually helped to de-risk our portfolio. We closely monitor the viability and the financial health. And of course there is a list or a watch list that we carefully consider. But when we really think about the risk to the organization, Bob, we look at it in the form of EBT risk. And so what we have done is that as we've built our long-range plan and our guidance for 2020 we have assumed that there will be some percentage of brands that will not make it, and that is fully contemplated in our 2020 guide and our long-range plan.","Bob Napoli","And I'm sorry. I need to sneak one more in. I guess the buyback that you did, why do the buyback, when you did, and the way you did with them, and I think, knowing that there's some clean-up to go, and I think you'd like raised your guidance a little bit last quarter. Why do the buyback at the point that you did, and not wait until you had a little more understanding or control over the business if you would?","Tim King","So, obviously, we looked at a variety of options, working with the board as far as what was the right return to shareholders, we felt that tender auctions was the best way to get some return back to the shareholders with considering a lot of variety of different options, and it seems like the best to us at the time, and I'll tell you, our view is, we successfully executed that Dutch tender. The stock was trading about $155 a share when we executed that we were able to buy close to five actually a little more than 5 million shares at below the market price of $148, and think a lot of people judging that versus where the stock is now, but if you look at the circumstances when we executed that Dutch tender we felt with a nice return to our shareholders.","Bob Napoli","Thank you very much. Appreciate it.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of David Scharf with JMP Securities.","David Scharf","Hi, good morning, thanks for taking my questions. Melisa, I'll kind of echo some other comments in expressing appreciation for Canada, the deeper dive into the portfolio shift. I did want to follow-up on that a little bit. And one of the hallmarks of the traditional retailer base net, notwithstanding all the secular challenges that you've had to pivot away from is that over the years, there's a remarkably high retention rate among all those traditional mall-based retailers. And as we think about the 60% of A\/R now, that's coming from these newer verticals. I'm wondering if, as a start, you can perhaps give us a sense for the timing of those renewals. I mean, since these, a lot of these are newer companies are not necessarily startups, but things like Alta and so forth that has experienced such rapid growth recently. Can you give us a sense for the contract lengths of a lot of these and perhaps, what percentage of that A\/R might be up for renewal in 2020 and 2021?","Melisa Miller","Great question, thank you, and good morning. So again, our guidance for 2020 would fully contemplate any programs that we would bring forth, or consider up for renewal. So that would be important. And on average, it does depend on the vertical, and it does depend on the product type, whether it's a co-brand program or a private label, but there anywhere seven to 10 years, there are a few programs that are five years and that's largely driven by us, because we want to ensure that it's a vertical into, which we would like to play. Does that answer your question?","David Scharf","Oh, yeah. No, no, that's helpful. It sounds like there isn't any imminent bubble of renewals necessarily in the next 12 or 24 months?","Tim King","They're spread over the term. So we start thinking of seven-year, eight-year, on average for our renewals, you look at, we look at this fairly often is don't look at make sure we don't have a big bubble in 2023 or 2024. They're spread fairly consistently over the terms, which is nice because we don't have any big -- we don't risk in any given year. We look at the big renewals and small renewals co-brand PLC's, we look at all of them, I'd say we don't have the city to risk other than it's just, it's peanut butter, for lack of better term over the like seven years, eight years.","Melisa Miller","And David, I appreciate the comment about remarkable renewal rate. I actually wrote that down, I'm going to have to put that on our office wall. What and we appreciate the acknowledgement, we retain 100% of the brand partnerships that we want to retain. So if we are in a situation where we are parting ways it really is because there's a fundamental disconnect and how we view the value and the viability of the program.","David Scharf","Got it, that's helpful, and that's a good segue to my follow-up. As it relates to the held-for-sale, by my calculation, based on kind of the efficiency ratio, the OpEx the 8.7%, I calculate the markdown on that held-for-sale at about $60 million. Can you give us that obviously has implications, not just in valuation but potentially timing. I seem to have jotted down in my notes that the expectation a quarter ago was that most of that held-for-sale would be disposed of by the end of this calendar year. Is there any update on your latest thoughts on timing?","Tim King","Yes, obviously, we're actively negotiating on the portfolios right now. Clearly, we're not going to do something that would be silly economically for the sake of December 31, but we would very much like to clean-up the balance sheet by the end of this year.","David Scharf","Got it. Thank you very much.","Operator","And your next question comes from Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust, and we are limiting the questions now to one question with one follow-up.","Andrew Jeffrey","Hi, thanks for taking the question, good morning. Tim, can you help us at all with how your core EPS outlook might translate into GAAP, it strikes me a lot of investors are waiting to understand what your GAAP earnings are to make ADS more comparable with peers and I know there are a lot of moving pieces, but can you help us with that at all?","Tim King","Yes, this should be if I'm doing this quickly in my head, but there should be no difference in my improvement in my GAAP versus my core EPS, there's not a big difference as I go from my GAAP as I walk down to GAAP from my core, so you can get the same type of improvement.","Andrew Jeffrey","Okay, that's certainly helpful, and then as a follow-up, when I sort of want to dig in a little bit on the reserve build, and I recognize again that CECL may change the dynamic here a little bit, but should we expect as the portfolio grows, that we're going to see sort of this stair step pattern? I'm just trying to understand why there would be, what sounds like what's the catch-up in 3Q and how reconcile that with growth going forward?","Tim King","Yes, and I realized that was a difficult math exercise to go on an earnings call. Don't be ridiculous, Andrew. We talked before, I know you understand it, but just for the audience, when I'm comparing Q3 of 2018 to Q3 of 2019, the difference in the end-of-period receivables build which is what I have to put the provision for is a billion dollars, I decrease $400 million last year. I increased $600 million this year and a normal reserve rate that's just as standard reserve rate is going to cost you $60 million to $65 million hence the $100 million was also last year, we got a benefit of lower rates we declined in our rates, we got even better last year because again, I'm comparing year-over-year. This year I have very stable credit, so I didn't have any issues there but last year, I got a lower rate and lower receivables. This year of course I had higher receivable stable rates, the difference was $100 million between 2018 and 2019, there's nothing, there's no credit issue there, it's 100% based on the receivables.","Andrew Jeffrey","Okay, thanks.","Tim King","That helps?","Andrew Jeffrey","Yes.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Dan Perlin with RBC Capital Markets.","Dan Perlin","Thanks. Can you just kind of help remind us how you plan to get back to growing again versus kind of its cost rationalization story and then what would be like the trigger for underperformance that would require you to get rid of it? I mean, I know the question was asked about this position of assets. But I'm just trying to get a picture of how this all plays out as you think about this kind of long-term calculus for the business?","Tim King","Yes, I think it really comes back to a couple of things Dan, first if we look at AIR MILES, you know the model, it comes down to miles issues. So miles issue drops cash flow drops, future revenue recognition. We've had some major client renewals. We have a major renewal of issue with Bank of Montreal. I think that will then position us to get back to really driving growth and getting more promotional miles issued. With it, we're also looking for ways where we can improve the value proposition to our collectors to get them more active, get them more engaged and actually increase our burn rate to some degree, and that will drive the top line. On top of that we had made several reductions to the cost structure in Canada, which is going to help us on a profitability standpoint. So we are looking for improvements across the board with AIR MILES in 2020.","With brand loyalty, let's be frank. It's been a rough three years, frankly in terms of performance, this year, it will be up year-over-year in terms of EBITDA, there're still some improvements to do. We've made several changes there in terms of the cost structure, and we're looking to further rollout some digital initiatives to further drive basically, client engagement. We think that's going to be good going into 2020. I could still see a situation with brand loyalty where the revenue is down year-over-year as we reposition it in the market, but we do believe that EBITDA will be up just based upon the revised cost structure we put in place.","Dan Perlin","Okay. Did I hear you say the Bimo renewal is still yet to happen, that was my follow-up, I want you to clarify that, but that happened in 2019?","Tim King","Yes, Q4.","Dan Perlin","Yes, Q4, okay. Great, and then the second question, Melisa, as you talked to, kind of the portfolio, right, so it's pretty bifurcated. You got this great new opportunity of clients. You got some of these legacy clients struggling. I'm trying to understand the conversation that you have with them to kind of drive growth. So you've got legacy clients where you're trying to sustain, I guess in a lot of ways, but also help them through their process. And I'm wondering what that conversation is actually like today versus this, real growth opportunity, which is this rate of change story that you're telling? Thank you.","Melisa Miller","Yes, that's a great question, Dan, of course, every brand partner is different. You would almost have to look at each one of those dozens of programs individually, because there are brands within our core file that are growing, high single, and in some cases low double year-after-year. They are however, massive debt by the partners that are not growing. So, for us, it's all about making sure that we have the right campaigns in place that are getting the consumers to spend more often make an extra trip and spend more when they make a trip. In fact, if you look at our year-over-year metrics, number of buyers up, spend per trip up, retention rate. That's a little brand dependent, but by and large, it's either flat to up, so our partners do listen is the wrong word, our partners do count on us to be there for them during these times of weak sales. The card program for many of our partners is the bright spot. When someone has one of our cards in good times and bad for our brand, they spend one and a half to three times as much as a non-cardholder. So these card programs are very, very valuable to the partners we serve.","Dan Perlin","Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Eric Wasserstorm with UBS.","Eric Wasserstorm","Thank you for taking my question, Melisa, my question relates to just the go-forward economic model of ADS, relative to the historical. And I think one of the things that the Investment Committee is I think struggling with a little bit is understanding how ADS contemplates value creation. Historically, the emphasis was on earnings growth and adjusted earnings growth, which resulted in high double-leverage and an emphasis on share repurchase, which of course, accelerated EPS but was largely disruptive to book value, and now that you are predominantly a lending company and book value is a relevant valuation metric. You look very expensive on book, even as your PE optically is very low. So, can you just maybe help us understand on a go forward basis, how we should think about and measure value creation at ADS?","Tim King","Sure, Eric, if it's okay I'll take that, and Melisa will jump in. So the value creation, I'm just going to go right to the top with the revenue clearly by if you're thinking value creation as far as shareholder return increasing the EPS, so I'll go to book value in a second, but going straight through growing our book by 9%, 10%, 11%, high single digits, and having that flow straight through and then getting to my revenue having like, my earnings, obviously, increasing my leverage on my operating expenses, you get your earnings per share, you then go back to saying, well, boy, I'm concerned about my book to my overall, my book value, and that is very much as you said, a financial institution metric.","We still do have two other divisions, we still very much think and that's obviously I'm quoting core EPS, I'm not quoting the GAAP EPS, that is who we are currently, if we were ever to go to an institution that didn't have those, of course, we would look at our tangible book value, but then I'd come back and say tangible book value is going to be a function of the trying to value all my assets at what they are carried, and I would say we start looking at our receivables. Our receivables have dramatically higher yield, dramatically higher returns. That when you start looking at book value versus our peers given how are ROEs are and our growth are, I don't think that's a fair comparison. I think obviously we should trade at a higher multiple just given our performance. So with that, I am happy to walk through kind of more metrics with you if you would like because you are in land of boy tangible book values as opposed to what the value of the underlying assets are. That helped?","Eric Wasserstorm","Okay. No, thank you for -- yes, thank you for that, and just to follow-up on one point, just with respect to your leverage position, what -- can you help us understand whether the priority is to continue to reduce your debt or in fact to accelerate leverage through incremental share repurchases?","Tim King","Well, clearly that's the conversation when we start thinking about the cash flows than repurchase that we are balancing. I am going to take a little bit of the newbie card and say 120 days. I am obviously working with the board making sure we think about debt repurchases -- debt shares repurchases. So we are working through that.","Eric Wasserstorm","Okay, great. Thanks very much.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Vincent Caintic with Stephens.","Vincent Caintic","Hey, thanks. Good morning. Hi, guys. Just first a quick clarification just because I know there are a lot of numbers, but the 2020 outlook, EPS mid to high teens that's based on the 2019 core of $16.75 to $17 shares, is that right?","Tim King","Yes. So if you are going to use core EPS and go to core EPS in 2020, the core we had was mid 20, so call 25 - 24, 26 range to high 20s, call to 28 range. That's -- we are guiding in that zip code.","Vincent Caintic","Okay. And the core \u2013- the year-over-year core is the 16 -- it's not the per forma number just because I know this. Your pro forma of $20.50 versus the core, okay.","Tim King","Yes. When I answered the question for Sanjay, when I switched to pro forma, that's when I said the 6 to 8. So you want to use a pro forma then $20.50 to $20.75, it would be 6 to 8.","Vincent Caintic","Okay, got you. Okay, very helpful. Thank you. And my broader question is so appreciate all the things that are changing and all the detail. And I think the investor day, I think people look forward to that because it seems like a lot of things are evolving. So just wondering kind of similar to maybe it's similar but a different take to some of the other question is so you have got active receivables growth still in the mid teens range. You have got your maybe the total portfolio is shrinking. How should we expect that go into 2020? And then when you think about your -- I guess your stocks now indicating 114 pre market. When you think about buybacks there versus renewing some of these accounts that might be struggling, just how broadly do you think about that part of business? Thank you.","Tim King","So, let me talk about receivables growth. Clearly, we are looking at the average receivables growth. You will see that we are down 1% on a reported basis. But then end of period up 3%, the trajectory we are showing and hence the position we are taking in the earnings call was or if you go back to look at Q1, down dramatically. Q2, getting back to flat, Q3, end of period. And then if you just use the guide of 19.5 versus the end of period last year, we are going to up 9%. And so, part of what we are trying to convey and we hope folks takeaway is that all that -- all the we are selling portfolios all those different things we have done back in 2018, we are working our way through that. And we are back to a growth profile with our A\/R. That should then translate in too because we think our yields are fairly flat meaning then you translate into a growth in your revenue that is commiserate with your growth in your A\/R. The business model from our perspective is pretty simple, grow your A\/R, keep your yields, keep your charge-off and obviously get some leverage in the OpEx and you will obviously grow your EPS. And that's what we are trying to convey here.","Vincent Caintic","Okay, great. Thanks very much and I look forward to the Investor Day. Thanks.","Tim King","Okay. Yes. Thanks a lot.","Operator","And your final question comes from the line of Jamie Friedman with Susquehanna.","Jamie Friedman","Hi, thanks for all the detail. I just wanted to ask you, Melisa, with regard to that Slide 5 your voice was noticeably more excited, enthusiastic. I had two questions related to that. One, I will just ask upfront, the distinction you are making in sequencing of the vertical versus the vintage; it looks like the verticals go before the vintage. I just want to make sure I understand why you point that out. And second, if you could just share some more used cases. You talked about building home goods, retail and e-tail rather in your prepared remarks, but some more will be helpful, so, the vertical versus the vintage and then the used cases. Thank you.","Melisa Miller","Sure. So the part of the reason that we tried to separate the two is we -- if we go to vintage first, we have found that there is huge demand in the marketplace for what is it that we bring to the table, but if the vertical itself is not growing or not changing with the modern consumer, then three years from now we are going to be back to the same place.","So we deliberately tested into what are the wining categories where we believe there's market and consumers are going to want to stay. Another example could be children. So, those of us that are on the phone that are parents, the one thing that we always do is we want to be sure that our children had before we do. So that would another example of a vertical. Not all are winning, but that is a vertical that is going to endure. So then when we go down to the vintages, by the time that you conclude that a vertical is viable, you develop a list of healthy candidates, go through the selling and on boarding journey, you are looking at about an 18-month timeframe before you get that first dollar if you will of revenue. So that's why you will almost always see that vintage shift lack the vertical shift or lagged the vertical shift.","Does that answer the question?","Jamie Friedman","Yes, that's really helpful. Thank you.","Tim King","Okay, thank you.","Jamie Friedman","Thank you.","Operator","And at this time, there are no further audio questions. We will go back to the speaker for closing remarks.","Melisa Miller","Well, I certainly want to thank everyone's time for today. I understand there were a number of moving peaces and messages that we asked you to consider. We want to acknowledge again that this road has been long for many on the phone here today, and our goal is to make sure that you are confident that we are making the progress that we know that we are making and that we will finish this year strong and it will be a jumping point off for 2020. So, thank you everyone. And we will talk next quarter.","Operator","And thank you. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Presenters, please hold moment."],"1518":["Alliance Data Systems Corporation (NYSE:ADS) Q1 2018 Earnings Conference Call April 19, 2018  8:30 AM ET","Executives","Emily Liu - IR, FTI Consulting","Edward Heffernan - President and Chief Executive Officer","Charles Horn - Chief Financial Officer","Analysts","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette and Woods, Inc.","Ramsey El-Assal - Jefferies LLC","Daniel Perlin - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Robert Napoli - William Blair & Company, LLC","David Togut - Evercore ISI","David Scharf - JMP Securities","Jason Deleeuw - Piper Jaffray","Jeffrey Meuler - Robert W.

Following today's presentation the floor will be open for your questions. [Operator Instructions] In order to view the Company's presentation on their website, please remember to turn off the pop-up blocker on your computer.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Ms. Emily Liu of FTI Consulting. Ma'am, the floor is yours.","Emily Liu","Thank you, operator. By now, you should have received a copy of the Company's first quarter 2018 earnings release. If you haven't, please call FTI Consulting at 212-850-5682. On the call today, we have Ed Heffernan, President and Chief Executive Officer of Alliance Data; and Charles Horn, Chief Financial Officer of Alliance Data.","Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on today's call and some of the responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risks and the uncertainties described in the Company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC. Alliance Data has no obligation to update the information presented on the call.","Also, on today's call, our speakers will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe will provide useful information for investors. Reconciliation of those measures to GAAP will be posted on the Investor Relations website at www.alliancedata.com.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Ed Heffernan. Ed?","Edward Heffernan","Great. Thanks Emily. Joining me today, as always, is Charles Horn, our CFO. He'll give you an update of the first quarter results. And then I'll come back on and update everyone with our 2018 full-year outlook. We'll keep our prepared remarks fairly short, so that we can have plenty of time for Q&A.","Before I turn it over to Charles, I do want to discuss probably one of the questions we've been getting quite a lot of, obviously, with the whole issue surrounding data in Facebook and everything else. I think that folks tend to mistakenly lump us in as a data broker, and that's not what we do as a business. And so probably, the best way to explain it, I guess, would be to give an example of what we do as a company.","So for example, let's say, Epsilon works with a major hotel company. And the hotel company might provide data about its own customers to Epsilon for use in developing and implementing some type of marketing and loyalty campaigns. It's key to note that these customers have already opted in through the hotel company itself.","So this type of data is known as first-party or self-reported data because the hotel company's customers would have provided the information when they filled out their profiles for the loyalty program and, most importantly, given their consent for marketing purposes.","Now what we'll do is we might combine that data with compiled data, such as demographic information from public records or transactional data, such as purchase data, to help the hotel company's ads or messages reach consumers who are most likely to be interested in that offer. The bottom line is these are overwhelmingly programs that are run using data that has already been opted in on behalf of the clients' consumers.","And so from a data broker perspective, again, that's not what we do. There is a very, very small piece of Epsilon, which is less than 1% of ADS, where there are some third-party sales to outside players, but, again, it's de minimis and really doesn't relate to our business, whatsoever. So I think we've got lumped in with a bunch of other folks when, in fact, what we do is we overwhelmingly use folks' opt-in information for our programs.","So with that, being said, why don't I turn it over to Charles.","Charles Horn","Thanks Ed. Pro forma revenue increased 4% to [indiscernible] for the first quarter of 2018 led by strength at Card Services. EPS increased 14% to $2.95, while core EPS increased 13% to $4.44 for the first quarter. As expected, higher loss rates associated with our decision to in-source collection and charged-off accounts to press first quarter core EPS by approximately $0.60 or 15 points of drag on growth. While the shift in strategy was punitive to the first quarter, we believe that will benefit net loss rates and earnings moving forward.","Let's go to the next slide and talk about the various segments. Starting with LoyaltyOne, pro forma revenue decreased to 8% to $305 million. If we break down the quarter, AIR MILES pro forma revenue increased 30% from the first quarter of 2017. Issuance was basically flat for the first quarter of 2017, where consumer sentiment continues to improve and promotional activity has started to pick up.","BrandLoyalty's revenue decreased 22% from the first quarter of 2017, essentially hangover from a soft fourth quarter of 2017. Customer bookings have accelerated and now aggregate 90% of the number needed to hit the 2018 revenue target.","Turning to Epsilon. Revenue decreased 4% to $509 million. We expected a modest start to the year, as we had a tough grow-over. It was a very strong first quarter of 2017. In addition, agency revenue dropped over 25%, primarily due to CPG pressure, creating a 5 point drag on total revenue growth. On a positive note, the shift from lower profitability agency business increased adjusted EBITDA margins by 2 points for the quarter.","Lastly, Card Services revenue increased 13% to $1.16 billion, consistent with the growth rate in average card receivables, while adjusted EBITDA net decreased 4% to $319 million due to a $50 million allowance built or reserve built and approximate $25 million downward adjustment to the carrying value of our held-for-sale receivables.","The first quarter 2018 should be the high watermark for the net loss rates. Thus, the reserve rate should drop over the remainder of 2018, and we do not expect to need further adjustments to the carrying value of the held-for-sale receivable.","Let's go to the next page and talk about a few of the key credit metrics. The first we'll talk about is credit sales, which increased over 3% aided by an 85 basis point increase in tender share. Average card receivables increased 13% to $17.7 billion with 60% of the growth coming from our newer vintages. Gross yields decreased 70 basis points from the first quarter of 2017 due to fair value accounting associated with the acquisition of the Signet portfolio in the fourth quarter of 2017. As the acquired portfolio turns, gross yields will increase.","Operating expenses increased 90 basis points due to higher payroll expense and the $25 million mark-to-market we just talked about on the held-for-sale receivables. Lastly, delinquency rates remained elevated due to the hurricane air pocket, which will abate by the end of Q2.","Let's go to the next slide and kind of break down the loss rate, which is where investors always saying what's changing and what's going on. And I think this chart gives a pretty good bridge. There is three important things I want to highlight - important points I want to make here. So first is the increase is all due to lower recovery rates. It's 50 basis points. This is from the transition to internal recovery and should only negatively impact Q1.","Second, gross loss rates actually declined or improved 10 basis points. And third, if we strip out the hurricane FEMA zones, gross loss rates actually improved or lowered 25 basis points. While there will be some noise in the second quarter loss rate due to residual hurricane impact, the credit normalization thesis appears to be on track.","With that, I will turn it over to Ed.","Edward Heffernan","Great. So why don't we go back now and talk about 2018 full-year guidance and what's changed or not changed. Essentially, nothing's changed. So what we laid out beginning of the year continues to be the case. And as we mentioned, Q1 at 13% growth and 4% pro forma topline growth, which should be at their softest of the year. From an overall consolidated basis, we continue to look for overall reported revs of about 8%.","And then on a pro forma basis, we do apples-to-apples for the accounting adjustment. We're looking at closer to 12% topline growth and core EPS growth of anywhere between 16% and 19%. Those numbers look solid to us today. And if you were to look at it by how we're going to sequence it first quarter, your pro forma revenue is about 4%.","We expect that to trip to about 10% in Q2. And we expect core EPS to continue to move up into mid-teens or a bit higher. And then from there, we expect, obviously, as losses and, therefore, reserve rates continue to start drifting downward, we would, obviously, expect an acceleration thereafter. So overall, I think the year looks solid from what we initially had thought and so far, so good.","In terms of Slide 9, the individual units themselves, LoyaltyOne, no change there, we expect high single-digit pro forma revenue and low double-digit adjusted EBITDA growth. We expect BrandLoyalty, which has had a very difficult year last year, will return to strong double-digit growth in the current quarter right now.","And AIR MILES issued actually came in a bit better in the first quarter, was essentially flat, and it's trending in the right direction as we go through second quarter and into the back half of the year. So we want to see that metric finally turn to a nice 3% or 4% growth rate as we move to the back part of the year.","So LoyaltyOne looks in pretty good shape. Epsilon, as everyone knows, tends to be fairly choppy, and first quarter was no exception. it was light on revs, usually, due to the grow-over from last year, but it was very strong in terms of falling what was there down through nice earnings growth, and that include - includes, of course, any type of accruals for incentive comp and executive comp and things like that. So it's a very good quarter in terms of cash flow growth at Epsilon and it will tend to go back and forth that way. Overall, should track to mid-single-digit revs and adjusted EBITDA growth.","In Card Services, right on track for the mid-teens revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth, for the year, the portfolio growth, which started off pretty nicely, I think, is about 13% growth will tick up a couple of points as the year progresses and some of the newer stuff starts pulling up.","But overall, we're targeting about 15% growth for the year. I also want to address, just very briefly, the issue on the credit sale side, the 3% growth, which seems relatively muted given the overall growth in the portfolio. It should be noted that, that was comparing against a quarter last year, which had a number of clients that have now moved out of our client base.","So for example, through a merger or through an acquisition, Virgin America, obviously, was acquired; Gander Mountain went bankrupt; and the PayPal business was sold. So those are a handful of clients that contributed to sales last first quarter. If you took those out and look at just our active client book, our sales would have been up - credit sales would have been up 11% year-over-year. So that's probably a decent metric to keep in the back of your mind.","So overall, cards looks like it's going to have another very strong year. The pipeline remains quite robust. There'll be a number of significant announcements that you'll see over the next couple of quarters. I don't see any real drop-off in interest in this type of program, at all. So it looks like the interest remains quite high. We spent a lot of time, it seems, on loss rates and, probably, a good reason that we are.","But first quarter, our loss rate was, as Charles mentioned, at 6.7%. It was 40 basis points higher than prior-year first quarter and was due entirely to the investment we made in ramping up internal recovery. Said differently, we used to sell - once accounts were charged off, we would sell that paper to outside third parties and receive fees or percentage, and we would book that as recoveries. Those rates went down dramatically last year. Therefore, we shifted everything in-house. It took several quarters to do it, which meant there was a significant period of time where our recovery rates were well below long-term trend. We now have that process complete.","And the first quarter is the last quarter, where you're going to see a big drag due to that. It actually - gross losses were actually a bit better in Q1 than they were prior year, but the recovery rates still hadn't quite spooled up and dragged on the overall loss rate by 40, 50 basis points. And so that starts to dissipate. Right now, we've got all of our collectors up and running. And we're doing it all in-house, and we like the results right now.","So what you'll see is that tailwind will move to neutral and then will move - I'm sorry, that headwind will move to neutral and then will be a tailwind, as we move through the latter part of this year as well as next year. So this is a long-term investment that we made. It's a little painful for everyone to see the higher norms and the reserve rates. We had to put against it, but that is dissipating, and it looks pretty good in the back half.","To put it in perspective, the investment that we made that kept the loss rates elevated, 40, 50 basis points, had we not made the investment and everything had been normal, and we weren't getting hit on the outside market, it would have added 11 points to the EBITDA growth rate. And our earnings growth rate would have been closer to 30%.","So it was a big investment, and I do think it's worth it. And we expect, as we said, this is going to be paying off, long-term, with a nice tailwind as the year plays out. So where are we in the process, Q2? We are looking at the final piece of the bubble from the hurricanes, so you're going to see elevated delinquencies for a couple more months and then that should drop dramatically.","And you'll probably looking at a Q2 loss rate that's maybe [indiscernible] something like that, so it's getting better, and then in the back half of the year, we'll be nicely in the 5s, which would keep us on track to be about 6% for the year - flat to the year. What that means is, as we tend to set up our reserve rates, we tend to do it fairly conservatively. And as a result, we look at the current quarter's loss rate as well as the 12-month loss rate, and that's why our reserve build was so high this quarter.","As these headwinds tend to dissipate over the next quarter, what you'll see is, obviously, we don't need to keep those types of reserve rates. And as a result, you're going to have a pretty significant acceleration in the earnings growth. So the trends are a friend at this point. And I think, with that being said, it looks like it's going to be a good year. And having the first quarter as the softest means that things progressively get better from here, which is something that all of us are eagerly looking forward to.","So with that being said, why don't we go ahead and open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Thanks. Good morning. So I guess, to me, the story is really about your comfort on revenues for the non-card businesses and, obviously, the provisions for the card business. Perhaps, on the first point, the guidance that's up for a back-half loaded boost in the revenues in the non-card businesses. What is the risk that those aren't achievable? Maybe some of the execution or risks associated with not achieving those targets.","And then on the provision, it seems like we should see a meaningful decline in the delinquencies given the hurricane charge-offs in the second quarter that come off, right? And so that should give us confidence on those. And then on the recoveries, could you just maybe just help us think about whether or not that would be a benefit in the second half since you've been building up inventory associated with that? Thanks.","Edward Heffernan","Sure. I'll take a stab. And then Charles can add some color to it. In terms of the non-card businesses, I think that what we're seeing in the AIR MILES business in Canada was that the issuance level, which we expected to be a few points negative in the first quarter, actually came in relatively flat. It looks like we're going to break our head above water as we move into the summer based on some promotional activity that we didn't see last year that we now know is in the pipeline. And so that gives us some comfort that the Canadian business is finally moving back into growth mode.","In terms of BrandLoyalty, which is our European-based business, which had a very disappointing year last year, it's all about the book and how much of the book has been built. And we're looking at about 90% of the book. It is solid at this point, which suggests your downside risk is relatively modest if the final 10% doesn't come through.","And then on Epsilon, I mean, it's the same type of story in terms of it does chop a little bit quarter-to-quarter, but their toughest comp was the first quarter. And it should get progressively easier from there. And based on what we're seeing in terms of new clients signed and attrition rates, I think the type of growth that we're targeting is certainly doable.","Charles Horn","And Sanjay, on the delinquencies, you're right. As the hurricane impact flows out in the second quarter, you should see delinquencies come in. What that means is from a reserve rate, we were at 6.8% reserve rate in Q1. That should drop over the course of 2018. I could see it being very similar at the end of the year to what it was at the end of 2017. On recoveries, you're correct that toward Q3, it could be a net benefit to our loss rates based upon some of the trends we're seeing right now.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Is there any quantification you can give on that, like now it's a headwind, it will become a positive impact effect?","Charles Horn","I guess, the way we'd break it down, if you look at the recovery rates, it was a single-digit number in the first quarter, think of it 8%, 9%. Let's say, when you move into the second quarter, mid-teens. Then you're getting close to anniversary-ing what it was the prior year, where we run around 16%. So that means by Q3, Q4, we should be in a position to be beneficial. Meaning, it's going to be north of what it was the prior year. Could be 17%, 18%. As Ed talked about in the last quarter earnings call, could be at a run rate end of the year north of 20%.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ramsey El-Assal of Jefferies.","Ramsey El-Assal","Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about the Epsilon performance this quarter and the slowdown in the agency business you called out. If you could provide some incremental color there and focusing on whether you think it's a lasting headwind or something that was somewhat fleeting in the quarter. And they maybe if you could just more broadly talk about the degree to which that agency business, it seems like an element that introduces some volatility into the model lately. How strategic it is for you to be there?","Charles Horn","Yes, so it's a great question. So if you think about agency, the entire business, so basically around the world has been soft the last couple of years. You've seen a lot of companies consolidate the number of agencies that they use. What we see with agency is still a battle. Part of what we do, it does help us cross-sell some of the other products that we sell, such as our Conversant CRM. To your point, though, it's volatile. It can be choppy quarter-to-quarter. It can be down one quarter, up the next quarter, and that's what Ed was referring to earlier, which is Epsilon can be a little bit choppy.","So what I would look for is somewhat stabilization of the agency model in the back half of the year or the remainder of the year for Epsilon. I would look for strength still in auto, the Conversant CRM, some steady improvements coming through in technology. But agency is always going to be one that's going to bounce up and down on a quarterly basis. But we still feel it's an integral part of the product offerings we provide.","Ramsey El-Assal","Okay. I wanted to ask also about potential strategic alternatives for the business. It just still feels like you're not getting a multiple for your kind of normalized earnings profile. Is there a particular inflection point you could identify where you'd say there are higher returns to be had by moving down a different path? And just purely hypothetically, is there an alternative viable possible path that could unlock returns for shareholders?","Edward Heffernan","Yes, it's a fair question. We've been, obviously, getting a lot of it over the last year or so given the multiple compression. We talked at the board level every quarter about different options that are out there. At the moment, I think the biggest drag that we're hearing about is the fact that people really need to see the credit stabilize and normalize.","And frankly, we were off by probably five or six months from what we had initially thought a couple of years ago, and that was primarily moving recoveries in-house and then the final residual impact of the hurricane. I think once those get out of the way and people are very comfortable that the core book is running nicely stable to where it was a year ago, you'll know that all those earnings, all the revenue growth will now flow directly into earnings growth, and you're off to the races.","I think there is still a wait-and-see out there, and we want to see that one play out. And - but at the same time, if that doesn't excite people, then, obviously, we'll continue to have those discussions at the board level.","Ramsey El-Assal","All right, great, thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question comes from Dan Perlin with RBC Capital Markets.","Daniel Perlin","Hey, guys. I want to check in on the idea of deleveraging your balance sheet versus buybacks. I mean clearly, as you said, these docs compressed quite a bit and historically, when that happened, you guys have been pretty aggressive on buybacks.","But the kind of stated goal this year, it sounds like the pay down debt, which would seem to be more to set up to kind of separate the business. But I just want to know where you guys are still in terms of deleveraging the balance sheet versus buyback.","Edward Heffernan","Yes, again you look at the free cash flow of the company or operating cash flow, Charles doesn't like when I round, but I'll round anyhow. It's roughly $1.5 billion or so. And then we'll use the first 1\/3 of that to fund growth in the card business and leaves you with around $1 billion, maybe a little bit less than that for either debt pay down or buybacks. And we had initially set up the year to say, all right.","Let's just run hard from an operations perspective, print four clean quarters with sequential increases in growth rates and really put in a strong momentum for the year.\" Obviously, we didn't expect things to remain depressed at these levels, and so we can't give specifics. But you can expect from us that there will be a bias away a bit from purely debt pay down. And there will be some activity likely on the buyback side. I think that's all I can really say, but we're certainly painfully aware of it, Dan.","Daniel Perlin","Understood. One quick question on gross yields, I know the hurricanes seem to impact Decembers as well. Can you just help us out a little bit in terms of the cadence? I mean, it was down 70 bps. I think, this quarter, the revenue numbers you guys have projected to get the mid-teens suggest that has to be up maybe even meaningfully in the back half of the year. So any kind of directional trend there would be super helpful? Thanks.","Charles Horn","Sure. So if we look at it on an annual basis, we were at a 24.8% gross yield in 2017. It would have been about a 25% gross yield if you took out the hurricane impact, which affected the back half of the year. We think with some of the changes this year, in terms of interest rates going up, we've talked about how we have a variable APR that's beneficial. We do have a little drag initially from the Signet portfolio acquisition, which burns off over the course of the year. So you put it together, we would say that we're probably tracking more to a 25.2%, maybe a 25.3% gross yield in 2018.","Q2 and Q3 should be up year-over-year. Q4, you always get a little bit of a drop in your gross yield just due to the growth of the denominator effect. But I would say yes, I would say Q1, obviously, is the biggest year-over-year delta with improvements Q2, Q3, Q4 tracking to around 25.2%, 25.3% for the year.","Daniel Perlin","And then just one quick one that you mentioned that the - can you just remind us to the extent that we do get, again as rising rate environment? I think, in the past, you said 80% of your cards are - that portfolio has roughly variable rate, but you got like 60% or 70% on your funding cost that's fixed. Can you just remind us of that spread and how positive that could be in a rising rate environment? Thanks.","Charles Horn","Yes. So you're right. I won't get into numbers, but the way you would look at it is our asset book, the AR, will reset within $1 billion to $2 billion cycles. Whereas to your point, Dan, the debt is 70% fixed, let's say to 2-year duration. What it means is in the first year of increase is very beneficial to ADS. The second year, more flattish. Third year, it can move a little bit negative on us in terms of the impact if we don't have any further rate increases.","Daniel Perlin","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust.","Andrew Jeffrey","Hi, guys, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Ed, appreciate you proactively addressing the credit sales. I just wonder there are some puts and takes, obviously, this quarter. How are you thinking about, I don't know if you think a lot about it, sort of the competitive positioning and relevance of the Card Services offering, recognizing that there will be M&A and customers do go bankrupt and so forth? I mean, are you comfortable with the sustainability of, say, mid- to high single-digit credit sales growth and as an underpinning for the kind of portfolio growth that you're anticipating?","Edward Heffernan","Yes, I mean it's a fair question. Again, the model has shifted to one where you're relying upon, really, the big vintages or the big signings that you've done over the prior 3 years for the bulk of your growth and much less so from the more traditional core book. And that's going to change that's been going on as you look at the client base and saw the retail landscape changing so dramatically.","So the folks that we've been signing over the last 3 years, the ones you're going to see us announce this year, the vast majority of them are in growth mode, which means that you're going to have a very nice type of sales growth. What you're really dealing with is sort of the bottom of funnel, as I call it, of those retailers who are either distressed or just have really to sales given the environment.","And the goal is to make sure that the folks who are bringing on can overwhelm that to the point where we can grow the portfolio, AR, mid-teens each year, which can require sales growth, as you said, certainly, 8% to 10%. And that's where we are - And I think from what we're seeing, you have two trends that are ones going against us, which is the pressure on your more traditional mall-based retailers.","And then you have the trends - the secular trend going the other way, which is a lot of new verticals and retailers are coming to the realization that they need to get into one-to-one personal marketing. And so their budgets are migrating from the TV commercials and the newspaper ads and billboards and radio and stuff like that and into what we do for a living. So thus far, we've been a net beneficiary of it. And based on the pipeline, I think that's where we're going to be for a while.","Andrew Jeffrey","Okay. Thank you. As a quick follow-up, with regard to the internal collections efforts. Are there some benchmarks or mileposts that you're looking for internally? I mean, I guess, the real question driving at is, is there a risk that you don't get a meaningful lift in that efficacy in recovery rates having brought all that functionality in-house?","Edward Heffernan","Yes. We're watching it pretty closely. And what we're seeing is as our jump-off to Q2, we expect to move, as Charles said, from sort of a mid-single, as a percent of gross charge-offs to mid-teens and what we were seeing right now as we right on track for that. And then you know the final thing we want to see is we want to actually see it - that rate creep up above where it was last year, as we move into Q3, Q4. And then that means you've got that nice tailwind in the back half and moving into the following year. I mean, that thing is, as you know, we did this once before.","We did it right after the Great Recession. So fortunately, we've been there, done it. And what we're seeing so far, because it's been, as everyone is painfully aware of, we started this last summer. And so it takes a while to really build up the experience and the expertise and find the few hundred folks that we need. And what we're seeing right now is the curve compares almost identically to what it looked like post-Great Recession. So, so far, so good. But for sure, we're watching it like a hawk.","Andrew Jeffrey","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Bob Napoli of William Blair.","Robert Napoli","Thank you, and good morning. Follow-up on a prior question. I think if you look - I think part of your valuation is - a big chunk of it, besides credit, is the health of the customer base and the view of the health of retail, in general. If you look at your closest Private Label peer, their multiple isn't that different. But if you look at your portfolio, we obviously have some very good retailers, Children's Place, Williams-Sonoma, RH, DSW, IKEA coming on. But then, you also have a lot of troubled retailers, whether it's a Bon-Ton or Ascena pieces of or New York. I mean, if you look at your portfolio and you look at it historically, do you have, like, it's - what is the mix of troubled retailers today versus non-troubled, I guess, if you would?","And if you segment the growth rates for troubled versus non-troubled, then theoretically, some of this should cycle out over time. And having it one way or another, right, you're going to have a much higher quality portfolio a few years from now and the others will be gone. But is there any way to put - quantify that and try to get - if investors had comfort in the health of the customer base and then you put credit on top of that, that's going to be worth a couple multiples, at least?","Edward Heffernan","Yes. No, it's a good question. And it's a question we get a lot. And I don't think there's a perfect answer to it. But in terms of those who are distressed versus those that aren't, I think the first item to discuss is the fact that, look, the bigger issue with some of the distressed retailers has nothing to do with the fact that they may be sitting in a mall and everyone seems to be going online and everything else. The vast majority of the distressed retailers got that way because they built - overbuilt stores and increased their footprint by third or something like that and used debt to do it or they were part of an LBO.","And as a result, what's bringing down the distressed retailers today is really their capital structure is just very much under pressure because of leverage and there's too many stores out there. I mean, I think most people believe that the store counts need to come down by 30% before we've hit equilibrium. So as you said, those are going to cycle out. And I think the way we set up the business for this year is that we assume that there's probably, I don't know about $1 billion or so in portfolios that will, in fact, as you said, cycle out of the business, which means we need to grow the rest of the portfolio about $3.5 billion.","And it looks like the bulk of that is going to be coming from the big accounts we've signed over the last three years. So from our perspective, I think we've factored in a fairly good size cycling out, as you would call it, above to $1 billion of portfolios going away. And the huge vintages that we've been signing over the past three, four years, which the secular trend that's in our favor, would suggest that's about $3.5 billion of growth, and you're netting out at about a 15% growth rate in the file. So we absolutely will factor in the number of distressed folks. My guess is there's probably five or six that are on the bubble there - about five or six last year that were on the bubble, and that's a how we come up with our $1 billion drag that we see.","Charles Horn","Yes. I think the key takeaway Bob, is this is nothing new. We've been cycling out of clients that didn't fit our profile or were underperforming through the years, 2015, 2016, 2017 and we still have been able to maintain this good growth rate. So it's nothing new. It's nothing unique. It's just something that's cathartic. We could grow the file quicker, but we like to where it's growing right now. And we always take the opportunity that if it's a client that we don't feel comfortable with, then we cycle them out using that [indiscernible].","Robert Napoli","Thank you. And just one follow-up on Epsilon, the - I mean, the agency understood, but the biggest pieces of this business, I think agency is less than 10% of revenue there. Auto and CRM are probably 40% of revenue, maybe a little more than that, and the tech platform, another 25%. How are those three businesses trending? I mean, the CRM had a high-growth trend. I think you were looking for double-digit growth of auto.","Edward Heffernan","Yes, I think from a guidance perspective, CRM and auto, to your point, which is probably half of Epsilon, is probably running - they're going to run double digits this year. And the tech platform, which is about - to your point, about a quarter, which was sort of that melting iceberg a year or so ago, we'd like to see a couple points of growth coming out of that. And then you've got the remainder as well as agency and their agency is definitely declining right now.","So if you put all that together and mix it in, you probably get like a 5%, 3% type growth rate for the year. The goal would be frankly, we think we've got that third piece, the tech platform piece, nicely stabilize. The price point is good. Time-to-market is good. We would like that to turn into the third growth engine for the business.","So if we could have auto, CRM and tech platform all in decent growth mode, that's when you'll start moving Epsilon from sort of a mid-single into the high single organic growth, which is really the goal, quite frankly.","Robert Napoli","Okay. Thank you.","Edward Heffernan","Yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Togut with Evercore ISI.","David Togut","Thank you. So you called out 85 basis points of tender share gain year-over-year in the quarter. That's below your trend line, which has been more in the 100 basis point to 150 basis point gain, historically. What are the reasons for that? And are there any new technologies or offers that you can put out to your retailers' customers to drive faster tender share growth?","Charles Horn","So there are a couple of things there, David. One that Ed talked about, which is the grow-over impact to the programs we walked away from, such as Bon-Ton that filed bankruptcy pulled quite hard back during the quarter. That will abate over the course of the year.","You're correct in the fact that we will support client programs. You'll probably see us do programs. You'll probably see us do a little bit more discretionary marketing out of our Card Services division to stimulate sales in the back half of the year. But really, it's more of a case where, as we know, Bon-Ton was a fairly good-sized client, when they filed bankruptcy that really pulled in the credit sales, when they started looking to move toward liquidation that pulled in as well.","So really, it's more of a grow-over impact from the loss of clients that we voluntarily walked away from or they filed bankruptcy that we're growing through in the first quarter, and that should increase over the remainder of the year.","Edward Heffernan","Yes, I think, also, and it's a good question, of we are in the process of helping as many of our clients as possible enhance their online capabilities because so much of our sales are coming online, right? During the holiday, it's almost 40% of our sales are online from the marketing. And a number of folks have, to put it nicely, fairly clunky online systems right now.","And what we're working to do, from a payments perspective, is to integrate the payments and loyalty directly into the website and make it a frictionless-type experience, so that we don't have the types of abandonment - card abandonment that you see all over the place. And that's a big initiative on our part. And I think if we can get some traction there and get the focus of our clients to put some IT dollars in it as well that, that would be something that can incremental move the needle for sure.","David Togut","Understood. As a quick follow-up, what was the same-store sales number for your retailers in Q1 within Card Services?","Charles Horn","I don't know, David. I'd have to get with - I don't have that number off the top of my head.","David Togut","Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Scharf with JMP Securities.","David Scharf","Hi, good morning. A lot of might have been answered, but a few follow-ups. Charles, just want to revisit how we ought to be thinking about the reserve rate. I know you've mentioned earlier that as we cycle through the year, we could conceivably end where we were at the end of 2017 at [indiscernible]. Could you tell me what is the reservable balance that is driving the 6.8% reserve rate? And is there anything other than just the Signet receivables that with - that we should be pulling out of your total AR when calculating that?","Charles Horn","So the reservable AR at the end of March was 17 - let's round it to $17.2 billion. So that's where you get your reserve of $1.169 billion, which is how you get to your 6.8% reserve rate.","David Scharf","Okay. And is the delta between that reservable balance and the total gross of $17.8 billion the remaining Signet? Okay I got it.","Charles Horn","Yes, Signet reserve.","David Scharf","Okay. Back to just sort of the demand side on credit. Is there a credit sales growth number if we actually - I guess Signet wasn't present in Q1 last year. So the 11% credit sales number is sort of the correct apples-to-apples when we pull out some of the programs you left, correct?","Edward Heffernan","I think you would include Signet, so you're probably more like high single digits.","David Scharf","Okay. And I guess that I mean historically, Ed, I mean, when you think about all the factors at play, the profile of the newer programs that are ramping, kind of what's in the pipeline, tender share as well as what you're seeing in terms of commitment level from your retailers in terms of promotion, what ultimately get you to kind of mid-teens AR growth this year coming off a little lighter than expected growth in the first quarter? And what are the biggest factors?","Edward Heffernan","Yes, I think the biggest factors, unlike - if you go back 5 years, where 95% of it was all driven by the core that's been sitting there for many years, the vast bulk of what we're looking at is really the spin-up of the big vintages of 2017, 2016 and 2015 where you're bringing on the types of clients that, combined, will add $2 billion, $2.5 billion of growth to the portfolio.","So you really don't need a whole heck of a lot out of the core anymore, which is a very different model than we used to have. So it's really a function of you're almost cycling out of some of the more distressed retailers and cycling into the retailers that are experiencing solid growth rates and are focused on the personalized marketing and the investments and all that stuff. It's happening naturally. It's just we've never seen so much of it coming from the most recent signings. And we don't expect much growth coming from the core.","So as long as we're signing our $2.5 billion vintage each year, it's probably safe to say that the growth in the core, less the attrition in the core, probably leaves the core relatively flat. And you're looking at about a net $2.5 billion growth or 15% coming from the newer vintages. And I think - I don't think anyone was expecting - we didn't give quarterly on the AR growth of - I think 13% is, frankly, right in our wheelhouse of where we want to be and that will creep up a little bit as the year progresses. So it's just a - it's a different structure from what we're used to, for sure.","David Scharf","Yes. And part of the question was related to thinking about the back half of the year in relation to that 13%. I'm wondering, so much of the hurricane focus has been on credit, the delinquency roles, the timing issues. I'm wondering, have you actually seen any increased pressures on just spending levels in those FEMA areas? I mean, once again, thinking about that 13%, like you said, it's in your wheelhouse. But to the extent it was a little bit below the full-year guide, are there any increased pressures just on the demand side on consumers, even if they haven't rolled into delinquency buckets? Are they spending at the kind of levels they were a year ago?","Charles Horn","Yes. I think what you saw a little bit of reciprocal flip of what you're talking about. What we'll be looking for is a lift in consumer spend as they come out of the hurricanes. So it's going to depress your credit sales for a period of time. And then you're going to see the lift as they start to buy furniture for their new homes and so forth. That part, I can't tell you if we'd really seen yet. But it could be a benefit in the back half of the year.","David Scharf","Okay. Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jason Deleeuw with Piper Jaffray.","Jason Deleeuw","Yes. Thanks. Good morning. Just wondering on any APR changes in Card Services with rates. How do you balance that versus your receivables growth targets and just your retailer client wishes?","Charles Horn","So Jason, we're a variable APR. It's tied to primary the majority of our programs. So it's not a case, where we're looking to change any spreads. Basically, the APR will be moving up or down based upon what's going on with prime rate.","Jason Deleeuw","Got it. Thanks. And then we're just kind of thinking about the pipeline of new card portfolios that you're targeting over the coming years. What types of retailers? Are there any change in the characteristics of portfolios you're going after? Just any thoughts on kind of what's out there in terms of opportunity. And is there anything that's kind of different from what you already have in the portfolio?","Edward Heffernan","Yes, it's a good question. In terms of the interest that we're seeing, a lot of the more traditional mall-based folks, for the most part, were the traditional Private Label customers. So you could say that, that market is much more penetrated than others. But what we are seeing, again, because everyone and their brother is talking about how do I understand my customer down to the individual level, which means the SKU-based program that we run, what you're seeing is kind of - it's very interesting. You're seeing verticals that you never saw before beginning to show a lot of interest.","So for example, like cruise lines, like Viking Cruise lines, very interested in understanding who their customer is. That would be a new vertical for us. Retailers that have a very different model than their traditional mall base, so more of a - they have their standalone separate boutiques, like in Ulta Beauty, something like that, that are doing extremely well. Those are our new types of verticals for us away from sort of that mall-based model. The IKEAs of the world, again, very different from what we're used to and then finally, you have the pure dot-com players, the wafer dot-coms, the build dot-coms of the world. Again, they didn't exist a while ago.","And so what you're seeing is the interest in the product itself, because of the information they can get on their individual customers, is now - the appeal is broadening well beyond the traditional base that we had before, which is sort of - it's a great secular trend that will keep the growth rate in the mid-teens of the portfolio, which more than offset sort of some of the dampening that you're seeing in the more traditional retailers.","Jason Deleeuw","Great, thank you.","Edward Heffernan","One more.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of Jeff Meuler with Baird.","Jeffrey Meuler","Yes, thank you. Can you just run through the delinquency rate trends over the last couple of months? And I guess, what I'm wondering is, is the increase largely due to higher delinquency rate trends because of the financial impact on consumers in FEMA zones? Or are there other impacts from the hurricanes or other things? And to the extent to which that's the case, can you just comment on what's the year-over-year trend right now in the FEMA zones for the delinquency rate trends versus outside the FEMA zones?","Edward Heffernan","Yes, I mean I can give you the overall picture and then Charles can give you a little bit more color. But in general, your delinquency rates to be up 50 basis points at a high level, higher as this sort of bubble is moving through the pipe. And so you can expect to see that April, May, let's call it. And then it should drop off dramatically as the bubble clears and those accounts flow to write-off. And then you're going to have delinquencies that are, more or less, in line with where they were a year ago. And that's all hurricane-related.","Charles Horn","Yes, if you think about it, the lag between delinquencies to loss rate is about one quarter, as we talked about before. So as Ed talked about in the slides, we expect the hurricanes to hit us about 40 basis points net loss rate in Q2, which means you would expect your delinquency rates to be up 40 basis points, 50 basis points year-over-year in Q1. So basically, it's just a leading indicator that the bubble or air pocket is coming through will clear out in Q2 then you will see improving delinquency trends.","Edward Heffernan","Yes, you'll still have sort of April, May at elevated levels. And then by June, again, the delinquencies ought to clear the deck.","Jeffrey Meuler","Okay. And then can you just comment on the financial implications to your Card Services business from having increased churn in the client base, meaning clients - more clients going out of the base than you had, at least going back, I don't know four, five years and kind of prior to that? So what I'm thinking is, like, new client launch cost and impacts like that if - to the extent to which that's more part of the model and a higher churn model. What are the implications to you? And has it been fully felt at this point?","Edward Heffernan","Yes, it's a good question. The - if it was just a churn out the bottom, and that was the secular trend, then I'd be pretty worried. But what we're seeing is, as we talked about, other secular trends sort of coming in from the different verticals and people that we never even knew existed are coming in wanting to know about their consumers.","And so we're getting a lot coming in, as I call it, in the top of the funnel to more than offset what is churning out the bottom of the funnel. And so we are in a position that frankly 10 years ago, we weren't in, which is we can be a bit more selective in terms of when it comes to renewal times, in terms of if there are owners' demands, we may choose to put our capital elsewhere, and that's been the case with a couple of folks. So I would say, overall here, you're seeing pretty robust returns. We wouldn't expect that to change much.","Charles Horn","And if you think about it, Jeff, we've been onboarding double-digit new clients for years and years and years. The churn cost or the onboarding cost are not material.","Jeffrey Meuler","Okay. Thank you.","Edward Heffernan","Okay. Well, that's it. And we'll see everyone or talk to everyone in Q2.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call.

So Charles, take it away.","Charles Horn","Thanks, Ed. During the first quarter earnings call, we discussed an expectation of growth acceleration as 2014 progressed. During the second quarter, we delivered on that expectation with over 20% growth in both revenue and core EPS. That is the trend we were talking about and that is the trend we expect to see continue during the remainder of 2014. ","For the second quarter of 2014 revenue increased 23% to $1.27 billion driven by double-digit organic growth and strong contribution from BrandLoyalty, which added 13% to revenue growth. ","Adjusted EBITDA, net increased 8% to $332 million with solid expense leveraging in both Epsilon and Private Label. However the growth rate was dampened our reserve build to Private Label due to the significant increase in credit card receivables. The related provision expense increased $39 million or 67% from the second quarter of 2013 despite a 20 basis point improvement in principal loss rates. ","EPS and core EPS increased 28% and 20% respectively, aided by an 8% decrease in diluted shares outstanding which dropped with the maturity of the convertible notes in May. There were still 2.7 million phantom shares in the diluted share count for the second quarter due to the average calculation. Starting in the third quarter, that impact will be gone and the diluted share count should be about 60 million shares. ","Let\u2019s flip over to the next page and talk about LoyaltyOne. LoyaltyOne\u2019s revenue increased 62% to $356 million for the second quarter of 2014, driven primarily by BrandLoyalty, which added $136 million to the top line. AIR MILES business continues to be hampered by weak Canadian currency which reduced its revenue by $14 million compared to the second quarter of 2013. On a constant currency basis, AIR MILES had a robust second quarter with revenue up 6% compared to the previous year. ","Adjusted EBITDA increased 32% to $87 million for the second quarter. BrandLoyalty contributed $26 million gross or $60 million net of non-controlling interest to the quarter. Its adjusted EBITDA margin was 19%, up 600 basis points from the first quarter, reflecting BrandLoyalty\u2019s largely fixed operating cost structure and its ability to leverage revenue growth. ","Adjusted EBITDA for AIR MILES decreased 6% compared to the second quarter of 2013 but was flat on a constant currency basis. We expect improvement in adjusted EBITDA margin for AIR MILEs as the year progresses. ","AIR MILES issued were flat compared to the second quarter of 2013 as the growth rate was primarily dampened by two items: Number one, the SoBe\u2019s purchase of Safeway negatively impacted issuance as numerous Safeway stores were closed in order to comply with government regulations. As legacy SoBe stores rolled into the AIR MILES program, we expect to see this pressure abate. And two, new regulations in one Canadian province limiting the awarding of the incentives for prescription drug purchases. For the year we still expect issuance growth in the 3% to 4% range, driven by increased promotional activity by our sponsors and new initiatives [indiscernible] reward program such as the new e-voucher program which is delivered via email and could be used to gift redemptions. ","AIR MILES redeemed increased 11% compared to the second quarter of 2013 primarily due to increasing popularity of the instant reward program. We expect year-over-year increases in AIR MILES redeemed for the remainder of 2014. ","Batch [ph] BrandLoyalty had exceeded expectations in the second quarter with over 20% organic revenue growth driven by growth in core markets as well as success in developing ones. With the majority of programs already [indiscernible] for 2014, we have a clear sight of line into the second half and expect this momentum to continue. ","In addition, BrandLoyalty provides a platform to generate opportunities for growth in other areas as LoyaltyOne, what Ed and I refer to as revenue synergies. Precima, a consulting analytics firm specializing in shopper insights is now leveraging BrandLoyalty\u2019s grocery relationships to grow its top line. While currently a small of LoyaltyOne, Precima is rapidly growing by signing multiyear contracts with major Canadian and overseas grocers. ","Turning to Dotz for a quick update. The Brazilian-based business added another half million collectors in the second quarter bringing the total number of enrolled collectors to 12.5 million, 18 [ph] ahead of our year-end target of 13 million. In addition, the program expanded into a 10th market during the second quarter with plans to expand to 13 markets by year end. ","With that, I will turn it over to Mr. Kennedy to discuss Epsilon. ","Bryan Kennedy","Okay. Thanks, Charles. For Epsilon, revenue increased 8% to $357 million for the second quarter of 2014, which is really driven by growth in our technology offerings. ","Technology revenue increased a very robust 14% year-over-year, which was really primarily due to the conversion of a number of earlier pipeline wins that rolled into revenue and began to contribute. Importantly, Harmony also made a nice contribution with email volumes up double-digit for the second quarter of 2014 which compares to a double-digit decrease last year for the same quarter. ","The success of the launch of Harmony has really effectively carved attrition. As Harmony\u2019s cloud-based micro segment and multichannel market capabilities are beginning to get a great traction in the market. Reception has been extremely strong, and we\u2019re pleased that with such I a short time in the market, Harmony can make such a nice impact on the results with our email volumes for the quarter. ","Looking forward we expect continued growth of Harmony in the back half of the year as we\u2019ve got about a dozen clients on board today and a dozen that are actively in the process and a very nice pipeline ahead of us. So a tremendous progress on the harmony front.","Turning to the agency. Revenue slowed just a bit during the second quarter of 2014, up 6% versus last year compared to a first quarter increase of 9% versus last year. We expect the on-boarding of new clients, including the announced relationship with FordDirect will aid the agency\u2019s growth rates as the year progresses. ","Lastly, our data offering fell back just a bit during the second quarter, after a nice strong first quarter where data revenue increased 5% compared to the prior year. It dropped about 2% in the second quarter of 2014, which was due primarily to circulation cuts that negatively impacted our Avoca\u2019s [ph] catalog offerings as well as a bit of a lowering of demand which was primarily due to one client in our off-line data offering. ","However what\u2019s encouraging for me is that as the distribution of our data goes up and that data gets used in more digital channels, value and importance of our data offering continues to increase as part of Epsilon\u2019s overall offering. ","Turning to profit. Adjusted EBITDA, net increased 6% to $68 million compared to the second quarter of 2013 while margins remain essentially consistent with the prior year. Double-digit growth in our high-margin technology business helped to mitigate a $2.5 million expense drag associated with the onboarding of new clients such as FordDirect. As the current backlog of [inaudible] rolls out margin pressure should begin to abate as new client revenue starts to flow to the bottom line. ","So lastly, what we\u2019re seen in the marketplace is that trends continue to move steadily towards data enabled targeted marketing and a more clear understanding of who the customer is. As a result of that, our clients focus is evolving towards engagement - that is how to market to a consumer by one, leveraging the most effective touch points or channels, and two, using insight-driven creative messaging to truly enhance the brand experience. I believe Epsilon is superbly positioned to meet these needs by offering a full-service end-to-end targeted marketing solution. And that service positioning element really differentiates us in the marketplace. ","All right. Now let me turn back over to Charles for Private Label. ","Charles Horn","Thanks, Bryan. Private Label's revenue increased 16% to $557 million for the second quarter of 2014, representing the 10th consecutive quarter in double-digit revenue growth. Revenue growth was driven by a 17% increase in average card receivables, the majority of which was organic. ","Adjusted EBITDA, net increased 5% to $210 million for the second quarter of 2014. As expected, we saw operating expense leveraging during the second quarter. While revenue increased 16%, operating expenses increased a lesser 15% compared to the second quarter of 2013. This leveraging reversed the trend whereby expenses were growing at faster rate than revenue due to the need to add infrastructure and advance a substantial receivable growth expected in the back of 2014. We beefed-up [ph] staffing levels largely already in place, we expect continued expense leveraging as 2014 progresses. ","Conversely, the provision for loan loss expense increased 39 million or 67% compared to the second quarter of 2013. This increase is driven by receivables growth, not deteriorating credit quality. As you can see on the next page, credit quality actually improved during the second quarter of 2014. The bottom line is as long as card receivables are in high growth mode, the provision for loan loss expense will lead revenue growth, just have a dampening effect to adjusted EBITDA net.","Turning to funding costs. We continued to see improvements as we replaced maturing tranches of debt with new less expensive funding. Our funding rate for the second quarter of 2014 was 1.5%, 30 basis points better than last year. ","Let\u2019s go to the next page and look at some of the stats for Private Label. Total gross yields for the quarter compressed 30 basis points compared to the prior year as new programs continued to affect yields. We would expect some continued compression throughout 2014 as we onboard a record number of new programs. As it relates to the new programs, it takes about three years what we refer to as a vintage period to really reach our desired yield levels. Growth continues to be strong across the board - credit sales up 22%, average card receivables up 17% and ending card receivables up 18% all compared to the second quarter of 2013. Importantly this growth is balanced. ","Credit sales were record programs, meaning we\u2019ve had them at least three years, increased 11% during the second quarter or roughly more than doubled the sales growth rate of our brand partners. This is [indiscernible] pickup of over 100 basis points. The other 50% of our growth has been driven by the newer programs which are being actively supported by the new brand partners and being [ph] and resonating with our clients. ","Lastly credit stats continue to look good with no indication of future upward pressures. Normalized principal loss rates decreased 30 basis points to 4.5% for the second quarter of 2014, helped by strong receivable growth rates and a higher mix of co-brand receivables. The related allowance for loan loss reserve remained strong at June 30, 2014with approximately 15 months of forward coverage. ","Delinquency rates increased moderately to 4%, up 10 basis points compared to the previous year. Based upon current trends, we expect stable principal loss rates for the remainder of 2014. ","Let\u2019s go to the next page and give you an update on liquidity. Liquidity at the corporate level remains very good at 700 million at June 30, 2014. Year-to-date we spent about 500 million on the BrandLoyalty acquisition and the share buyback program. We will likely look to bolster our liquidity via new debt during the third quarter of the year. ","I'm happy to say the convertible notes are now gone. The notes were settled in cash 345 million from ADS and about 1.5 billion from our counterparties in May of this year. With the call option settled, the phantom shares dropped from our diluted share count. The warrants we owed to the counterparties are currently being settled with an August 11 end date. ","As you probably noticed in the June 8-K, we paid a small fee to our counterparties to shorten the settlement period end date from November to August. The shortened period reduced the dilution risk if our share price runs up later in the year. ","Liquidity at our banks remains strong at 2.7 billion. We continue to take advantage of the receptive debt market to not only lower our current funding rates but also lock in longer-term fixed rate money. Approximately 75% of our bank borrowings are fixed rate with an average maturity of about 25 months. ","Lastly, the buyback program kicked in, in the second quarter as we saw an opportunity to buy during the temporary fall back in our share price. Year to date we spent 202 million of our 400 million board authorized program. ","I will now turn it over to Ed. ","Ed Heffernan","Great, thanks, Charles. Thanks Bryan. I think if we could move to the page on 2014 updated guidance, I will give you a little color on where we\u2019re seeing things. Obviously Q2 I think across-the-board came in a bit better than we had anticipated, which is good news. I think the quality of [inaudible] the earnings is very strong. Specifically you know you're dealing with a reserve build which is an expense in Q2 of this year where last year we actually had a reserve release. So not only were the results from a growth perspective very strong but it was against the tough comp from that perspective, also against a tough Canadian dollar comp as well. ","So overall I think very, very high quality earnings results and better across-the-board from what we had anticipated. So that gives us comfort as we move through the rest of the year. I know there were some rumblings or concerns when we posted Q1 and gave guidance for the rest of the year. Three months ago that it looked like there was some spec [ph] there, there was some risk in the back half, hopefully folks now see that things are going out quite nicely and in fact, things have moved up a bit and we\u2019re seeing better results earlier than we had anticipated. So we feel very good about the year. ","I think it's comfortable that we've moved the guidance from its original 12.20 to 12.25 to now 12.35 a share which will give us a topline growth of 23% and core EPS growth of 23% as well. That also reflects a hit of roughly $0.17 from the Canadian dollar. So overall 20.20 is what we\u2019re looking for. Within that you'll see the little note on the side of plus 9% organic, that\u2019s our base. I think we'll probably do plus 10, plus 11 on the organic side or comfortably running 3X GDP growth rate which is our goal. ","Let's go ahead and turn to laying out to the quarters which we usually don't do except for the fact that I think it's important that everyone is comfortable with how things will flow. You'll see that the growth rates by quarter on the face of it looked like oh, my gosh, there looks like \u2013 there is a big Q4, Hail Mary pass in there when in fact that's not the case. You saw growth rates now have accelerated from 9% in Q1 to 20% in Q2. We look for about that same type of growth rate in Q3 and then in Q4 sort of the difference between going from the low 20s up to the 40% you're talking probably about $30 million in terms of what we\u2019re looking for, and two thirds of that is pure seasonality out of BrandLoyalty. ","Q4 is BrandLoyalty\u2019s strongest quarter and it is significantly stronger than Q3. So two thirds of that bump between Q3 and Q4 is just seasonality within BrandLoyalty and then additionally at Epsilon, we expect the other third as the Ford deals truly spulls [ph] up and we get the type of growth that we want. So I get the message here is I think hopefully Q3 looks pretty reasonable compared to Q2, 20% to 22% and then as you move into Q4, that bump up there is almost exclusively seasonality from BrandLoyalty which hasn't been introduced until this year. So I guess the net result is there is no spec in the back half. ","The guidance we\u2019re giving is stuff clients that have been signed, contracts that have been signed and therefore as we look at the rest of the year this is solid and we\u2019re beginning to look at the jump off for 2015. So we feel very good about that. ","Let's move along and get a little bit of color on rest of the \u201814 outlook. Starting with LoyaltyOne, we talked about the seasonality at BrandLoyalty with Q4 being by the far the heaviest quarter but overall I would say that AIR MILES we think when you factor out the Canadian dollar, it\u2019s going to do plus 3, plus 3 top and bottom which is sort of a bit below where we like it to be long-term. We think it's more of a plus 5 top, plus six EBITDA type growth business where we should get back to that in \u201915, but plus 3, plus 3 is about where we\u2019re looking at now. The Canadian dollar drag is lessening as the year goes on. So we\u2019ve got probably two thirds of it behind us with another one third to go in the second half.","BrandLoyalty, very very pleased with how that is playing out. They are running for sure 20% plus organic top and bottom for the year and the growth is coming both from their core countries as well as emerging markets as well. So these things got some legs to it. ","And then finally, even though it\u2019s not in the gnomes, because we only own 37% for Brazil, we\u2019re on track to grow revenue of about 40% and again this is a land grab in terms of we\u2019re trying to grow as fast as we can in terms of memberships. We started with less than 2 million in \u201911, we now expect 2014 to be north of 13 million members. So this continues to spool up, it\u2019s I guess you could view it as a very valuable asset that is not in our financials. ","At Epsilon, as Bryan talked about, we\u2019re looking at high single-digit revs and mid to high single digit on EBITDA growth. Where we\u2019re getting sort of the best traction this year as Bryan talked about is in the technology side, which are the big loyalty platforms that we\u2019re building. There's a huge amount of interest coming from not just sort of the core verticals and big, big multinational clients that we\u2019re used to servicing, but we\u2019re getting into newer verticals where we didn't see that much interest in prior years, beginning to see everyone is getting more and more excited about, hey, I need something that will give me some insights into who my customer is and that requires some type of loyalty application. So we\u2019re seeing a lot of movement in the retail vertical as well as the food segments, both QSR and casual dining. And then we\u2019re also seeing sort of the mid tier or mid market firms that traditionally couldn't pony up the type of dollars that are needed to have one of these solutions. They are making the decision to that this is too important not to have. And so we\u2019re seeing a lot of movement on the midmarket side of dollars switching over and making the big investment in this type of program. ","So it bodes extremely well going forward and I would say our biggest challenge at Epsilon right now is making sure that we have the growth in the sort of hot skilled personnel that we need to bring this all to fruition but very pleased there. ","And then the second thing is our new digital platform Harmony that Bryan talked about is off, we can finally call up [indiscernible] Epsilon and say green light on Harmony, we boarded a dozen clients of which one is a very very large client, maybe as much as 10% of all of our permission-based email volume up and running, no issues. So we think this will be an industry-leading solution and very happy about that. ","So I think Epsilon \u2013 you know it cycles right, you\u2019re going to have in some years its data leading the charge, other years it\u2019s the agency, other years it\u2019s database loyalty, email leading the way, this year looks like technology is going to be the \u2013 get the gold star. ","Finally, if you turn to the card business, we continue to see very, very strong growth and again you have a backdrop of a card industry that\u2019s barely growing maybe 1% to 2% a year. We expect our credit sales to be north of 20% for the year. We expect our average file to actually be higher than the sort of 15% we were thinking about, we expected to actually grow more of 20% for the year and that will be accelerating as the year unfolds. So we did about a 15% file growth in Q1, 17% in Q2, 20% in Q3 and we will exit the year at a 25% growth rate, which will be extremely positive as we go into \u201915. ","Again we always get the question of how come \u2013 how does this work, why is this working so well in an overall environment where consumer spend is modest at best, consumer revolving debt is growing a couple of points and that\u2019s it? And the answer I think Charles talked about earlier is a lot of it has to do with what's happening in our core client base. When you're seeing the pressure that on our retail base and you see that their same-store sales are growing 2% to 3%, maybe 3% plus and yet we\u2019re looking at double-digit sales growth at the same retailers, something is working. And that has captured the attention of a lot of other folks and that is I think a big reason why they are signing up for the Alliance solution because again whether it\u2019s at Epsilon, whether it\u2019s at LoyaltyOne or whether it's in our card group, across the board the interest in understanding who the customer is, which requires a data-driven analytical approach has never been stronger. And so the trends are friend, we expect to keep riding it for many years and so far so good. ","Again I'm looking frankly more at \u201815 at this point and that means that I need to focus on how is the vintage, how is the sign-ups doing this year, has it dropped off or not? The answer is no. We\u2019re probably somewhere around 1.3 billion, 1.4 billion that we signed up in terms of vintage. For this year we expect to have another 2 billion -- we expect to have a 2 billion vintage for all of this year, which means three years from now there is another 2 billion of growth added to the file. So pipeline remains strong. You should see a bunch of good announcements coming out the door. ","In summary, not much more to add. Revenue and core EPS up 23% respectively, the organic growth rate is running about three times GDP. All the segments are growing. I would say our fastest-growing segments would be BrandLoyalty for sure, followed by the card group, followed by Epsilon, followed by AIR MILES. So I think that we\u2019ve got a nice portfolio of growth engines and I guess I probably should say that Brazil is probably edging out even BrandLoyalty but that's not in our numbers. ","So -- and hopefully everyone feels comfortable now with how we laid out the back half of the year. I think doing 20% growth on earnings in this quarter does a lot to assuage people's concerns about the back half. So the seasonality of BrandLoyalty, getting past the Ford ramp up should give us very good visibility as we go into the back half of the year. ","So I am going to leave it there, other than to say that if you look at the way things are playing out for \u201814 and the fact that there is no back in our gnomes for the back half of the year. What I am probably most pleased with is we had a couple of big question marks this year. Probably our largest was the very significant investment we made in our all-digital platform, Harmony which Bryan can talk about, and needless to say we were positive about it but until you flip the switch and get things up and running and actually jam through huge volumes you just don't know. And so we feel very good about the net results there. ","Probably another area that we wanted to make sure played through was the fact that hey, this huge run in our current business with these massive vintages that we\u2019re signing, is this a one and done or is this thing for real? I think at this point, we jumped from signing of 400 million vintage three years ago to a billion 2, years ago to 2 billion last year and another 2 billion this year. So this is for real. We expect it to continue for some time. The BrandLoyalty was probably the third area where I wanted to make sure that we didn't have issues there as a lot of folks have with acquisitions. And frankly it's performing much better than even we had anticipated. ","So i think probably those are the three areas where they say kept us up at night little bit. And I think we can check the box on all three for now, and now it\u2019s a function of what their jump off for \u201915. ","So that\u2019s it. Why don\u2019t we turn it over to Q&A and we will open it up. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","","(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.","Sanjay Sakhrani - KBW ","Thank you for all the numbers -- the color on the numbers. I guess stepping back and thinking about next year and I know you guys saved that for the next call. It seems to me like the EPS growth rate we\u2019re seeing this year as very achievable if not beatable as we look out. Is that a fair statement? And I guess secondly, just thinking about free cash, you guys have repurchased I think $200 million worth of stock and there is still fair amount of free cash that\u2019s been generated or will be generated throughout the year, how should we think about that excess over the remainder of the year?","Ed Heffernan","Well, you know we want people to show up for the Q3 call, Sanjay. So I probably won't go too far out on a limb for the earnings growth rate. But I think clearly people can see the trends, we would expect \u201815 to be a strong year and just bear with us until we get to Q3,when we give official guidance in terms of free cash flow. Charles? ","Charles Horn","You can see we\u2019ve been fairly active this year, Sanjay, again with the buyback program of about $200 million, with the BrandLoyalty 60% acquisition of about 300 million. I think you'll see us continue to support the buyback program as necessary over the course of the year. Obviously we are more active when we have pull back in our share price, which allows us to continue to look for acquisition opportunities whether it be aboard in Europe, something to flush out the Epsilon model little bit further. or even in the US I think some opportunities are coming to our attention that could make sense. But you know what, we like to deploy our free cash flow, we will find a way to do so during the course of the year. And so just expect us to continue to look at our main competencies which is buyback, M&A we will have a little bit of cash to support the growth of Private Label from a regulatory standpoint, and those would be the three usage.","Sanjay Sakhrani - KBW ","I guess \u2013 there is a question on Harmony -- on Epsilon, in terms of Harmony, could you just talk about how much of a contribution you're expecting from the remainder of the year from the rollout and then how beneficial it could be next year?","Bryan Kennedy","Sure, Sanjay. I think as we grow through the back half of the year it\u2019s obviously going to ramp. So if you think about Q2 Harmony contributed in the low single digits in terms of volume that we would push out the door by the time we get to the end of the year. That should be into the double-digit range and then as we roll into \u201815 you\u2019d see I think better than 50% of our volume next year would come from Harmony and I think the natural follow-on question to that would be how much of that is clients that you're converting from old platform to new platform, how much of that is new clients? And the interesting thing that we\u2019re seeing right now is the majority of the Harmony activity is coming from new clients, and that's a bit because our existing clients have been, just as Ed said until they saw us in production and in market [inaudible] excited about what Harmony brings to the cable but they have been slower to come versus new clients. So we should see some nice acceleration as we move out of this year and into next year as they jump on board. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller with Barclays.","Darrin Peller \u2013 Barclays","Well, just to be clear, I mean the ramp up through the year into the fourth quarter, you did a good job I think laying out but really BrandLoyalty is the majority of that. But it also seems like I mean Ford is rolling out in a big way, Harmony as you mentioned multiple times it\u2019s rolling up in a big way. So what kind of organic growth should we be looking at from an Epsilon standpoint? When you think about -- right now it\u2019s growing, you\u2019re saying high single digits but when we factor in Ford and Harmony, I mean for next year and the exit run rate we\u2019re going to see in fourth quarter, is that the right way to look at this business to the growth rhythm? And secondly to that, just a little more on Harmony, just one [ph], I mean I think the overall opportunity for new clients, can you \u2013 Bryan, just give us a little more color on what this actually means for the business after the expenses you built out, what kind of is actually good for growth?","Charles Horn","Darrin, I will take the first one. You do have a valid premise, for Q4 you could see low double-digit organic revenue growth as some of the ramp comes through that you talked about, going into \u201915 we will keep it pretty conservative high single-digit organic revenue growth, that\u2019s kind of the target we have for Epsilon. If you think about data enabled market in the US growing 6% to 7% which is the bulk of Epsilon, digital growing 20% per year which is a piece of Epsilon, that gets you more to the high single-digit number run rate number and that\u2019s what we will look for in \u201915. ","Bryan Kennedy","Yes, I think just to chime in on that, Darrin, we've had a bit of an ankle wave that we\u2019ve been dragging around for the last couple of years in terms of our existing email business, which has been healthy but not contributing to the growth. So \u2013 and I think of the Epsilon offering to the portfolio and they are going to cycle which is the point Ed made earlier. We've had one major engine which is the email engine which hasn\u2019t really been contributing. Now you\u2019ve got something back in the portfolio that has nice growth ahead of it, which kind of insulates us against risk as some of the other offerings will bounce around in terms of their growth rate. So what that can do long-term obviously we\u2019re going to push hard and heavy. But I think more broadly if you think about Harmony, it's less about what can that one offering do for us from a revenue perspective and for us it\u2019s more about how it becomes a part of these large enterprise relationships that we\u2019re pushing for, which cover multiple channels, multiple offerings, which are on everything from data to database to our strategy and analytics and creative and then distribution. And in this case distribution is email. And so we see it as a good cross-sell, up-sell engine that should help to reinforce some of those enterprise relationships. ","Ed Heffernan","Yeah, the final piece I\u2019d throw in there is \u2013 look, we've had a heck of a good run on the agency side with the auto vertical, huge wins, lots of big new auto platforms being built and with new car sales ripping along in the US the last few years, all helpful, I would say, Darrin, quite frankly the number that Charles gave you is sort of a hedge against sort of the auto sector of the business kind of slowing down a bit. So we would expect the digital \u2013 pure our digital side to pick up the slack there. If auto doesn\u2019t slow then, sure you\u2019ve got a little kiss to those numbers. ","Darrin Peller \u2013 Barclays","Yeah, now that\u2019s helpful. I mean it just seems like between the strength you\u2019ve seen in agency is now picking the email business from what was meeting on the headwind but a slower growth through a normalized growth rate environment, the rest [ph] are better, it seems like that business should set to accelerate beyond the even high single digits but that\u2019s a fair point. Just one follow up and I will turn it back to the queue. On the Private Label side, I mean you guys mentioned ending the year at 25% growth, I guess end of your receivables growth, we imagine there's a fair number of deals coming down the pipe in terms of portfolio acquisitions that have to flow into that, can you give us a sense of the profile of these deals in terms of -- are they co-branding, or are they as profitable to the other one\u2019s credit profile, and we look at sustainability of that kind of the growth rate for the receivables side of the business, then it has to get 18% organically the last couple of months, layering on these deals, I mean is this the kind of new growth for this business we should see for a while?","Bryan Kennedy","","Well, again that\u2019s a big -- the big question we thought when we signed the billion dollar vintage that boy, that was pretty exciting and maybe it was one and done, and we doubled it to 2 billion, this year it would be 2 billion. I think as you look into Q4, yeah inherent in those numbers are probably three very modest sized files, 100 million to $200 million type files that are pretty standard for us. So there is no big file that\u2019s in that year-end number that we have. So think of it as you know \u2013 and includes probably three modest sized files that are out there and should be good growth and it\u2019s on a go forward basis. It's going to be a combo of both Private Label and co-brand depending on what the clients want. But I would say going forward that if we could sustain a mid-teens file growth rate for years to come that would be very exciting for us, because then you're talking double-digit type financial return. ","So I think that would be our goal and right now based on the vintages obviously it's going better than that. But I would assume that most of the clients that you\u2019re signing are going to be clients who have abandoned the program because it didn\u2019t work in the past or clients who are brand-new to the scene and let\u2019s about some major -- let's hope for big portfolio acquisition, we\u2019re not really counting on that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dan Perlin with RBC Capital Markets. ","Dan Perlin - RBC Capital Markets ","Just got a couple. One, Charles, can you maybe tell us what you\u2019re forecasting for the full year, that you have to absorb before the Ford switching cost [inaudible] in this quarter but my sense was it was somewhere 7 million, 8 million for the year and that obviously will be a duplicative expense, what will be the next? Can you just give us what that number would be?","Charles Horn","That would be right. Yes, that\u2019s a good range. It\u2019s around 8 now.","Dan Perlin - RBC Capital Markets ","Okay and then the margin profile of BrandLoyalty in the current quarter was a lot better than I would have anticipated given kind of the investment and the growth rate. Is that kind of the right run rate or with the hockey stick in the fourth quarter a bit, is there significant investment pool that needs to go into there and therefore the margin comes in a little bit or is this kind of where we should be thinking about going forward?","Charles Horn","Think of this way, Dan, as this is the high fixed cost business, so it leverages the revenue growth very well. So if you look at Q1, revenue was little bit lower, ramped up in Q2, good expansion, now I expect it to pull back on revenue a little bit in Q3 and then ramp up in Q4. So for the year around 18-ish in terms of EBITDA margins, probably a little bit of a pullback in the margin in Q3, good expansion in Q4. So in Q4 it\u2019s likely you could see EBITDA margins in the 20% range, so for the year expect it around 18 with fixed cost structure. ","Bryan Kennedy","Yeah, if you look at overall LoyaltyOne, which consists of sort of the international business, there is the Canadian AIR MILES program, BrandLoyalty which is primarily Europe as well as some Asia, and the Brazilian coalition program, you\u2019ve got Brazil which is running 40 plus percent topline but very little earnings at this point, because it\u2019s in pure growth mode. You got BrandLoyalty which is running 20 plus organic top and bottom but that still means the margin as Charles said in the sort of high teens. And then you\u2019ve got the traditional AIR MILES program which is growing 3%, 4% has mid to high 20s, high EBITDA margin. So you squish it altogether, to use the financial term, and what you\u2019ve got there is a very nice double digits organic top line growth and double-digit organic bottom. So that\u2019s sort of where we are after.","Dan Perlin - RBC Capital Markets ","And I think Charles, you mentioned the tender share growth was a hundred basis points, is that a function of this built-out of this multi-tender database, or is this up and different?","Charles Horn","This is just basically the basic blocking and tackling we\u2019ve been doing. The multi-tender database really is still under development, something we\u2019re looking to get closely done by the end of the year. That is an opportunity maybe in \u201915 going forward but really will not be a contributor to \u201914. ","Dan Perlin - RBC Capital Markets ","And then lastly as I was kind of looking back to some of my notes and we are thinking about vintages going into \u201915 to get some line of sight, am I right to assume that you got about $500 million file that was from \u201813 vintage that you\u2019re going to roll in, it looks like in the \u201915, maybe back half of \u201915, that\u2019s not even in \u201814 numbers.","Charles Horn","That\u2019s correct.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tulu Yunus with Nomura.","Tulu Yunus - Nomura","Just one question on clarifying the guidance for a second. So I think for the quarter you guys beat your published guidance by about $0.20 actually, and you\u2019re raising the full year by 10, you know just trying to reconcile that it doesn't seem like there's anything in the report that suggests you\u2019re actually lowering your back half view? Was it just that there\u2019s just some conservatism baked in as sort of -- as your style or is there something else that we should be thinking about?","Charles Horn","That's always the piece of it, Tulu but also you don\u2019t always exactly know how things will sequence between quarters, going to back to what Ed said before, we had a little bit more coming to Q2 than we originally expected, which is just about Q3, Q4. But I\u2019d say it's a combination of both. We always like to try to keep little conservatism in there, so we like to do the beating rates but sometimes you can\u2019t exactly sequence your quarters exactly -- exactly right.","Tulu Yunus - Nomura","And then just on the credit trajectory, actually just a question there, so I think last quarter your outlook really was that the loss rate should be sort of flattish to down from those levels, looks like the DQ rates have done really quite well, beating seasonality and so forth. Can you just give us an update on your outlook for the charge-off rate?","Charles Horn","We\u2019re still expecting improvement in the loss rates, last year it was a 4.7% charge-off rate. This year we\u2019re trending more toward a 4.5% loss rate and I think that pretty much stays on track. ","Ed Heffernan","I think for modeling purposes we've been saying this for the last year or so, I mean the good news or the bad news of declining charge-off rate and declining funding cost, we don't factor that in as we look into \u201815 and \u201916. We assume this thing has straight bottom which is probably a good assumption in that the growth that we\u2019re expecting is going to be coming purely out of just driving very large increases in the file from all the signings that we have in the tender share pickups from the core.","Tulu Yunus - Nomura","And then just lastly on Brazil, you know obviously tracking very nicely, I guess what is the \u2013 but your ownership kind of remains where it was, just what it is that you kind of need to see before you can sort of -- perhaps take that in and invest a little bit more into that business, I guess what type of collector counter you really are looking for \u2013 basically that\u2019s it.","Ed Heffernan","Yeah, it\u2019s a fair question, I think it's a classic dilemma right of you know, would you like to own a majority of something that you hope will work well or a large minority piece where the owners are also the operators and have a huge incentive obviously for themselves and the associates to grow this thing profitably and quickly. And frankly I would prefer to own 37% of something where the ownership is as highly motivated as possible to make this the most valuable asset that they can, and if that means at some point down the road they would like a liquidity event we\u2019d be more than happy to offer that but we are not aggressively pursuing that. We would prefer to build up the asset to be as valuable as it possibly can, and if that means we pay a little bit more down the road I think that's a good -- a good play.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ashish Sabadra with Deutsche Bank.","Ashish Sabadra - Deutsche Bank ","Solid quarter, just had a couple of quick questions. The receivables growth of 20% in the third quarter, does that include a Coldwater creek receivables, are you planning to migrate those over and convert those over?","Charles Horn","Yes, yes.","Ashish Sabadra - Deutsche Bank ","Can you just help us size how big that is remaining?","Charles Horn","I\u2019d say it\u2019s still in the 250 million plus range, we will look to do obviously try to covert the cardholders into other programs and retain utility of those cardholders. ","Ashish Sabadra - Deutsche Bank ","That's great, and so there's definitely an opportunity for you to convert those over to other programs, then that should help grow your receivables further, is that the right way to think about it?","Charles Horn","That is correct. ","Ed Heffernan","Yeah I mean 20 would be sort of our base, hopefully there will be little better news coming up on that.","Ashish Sabadra - Deutsche Bank ","Definitely, and then the second question on the reserve build, so in this quarter, the provisions were higher than the charge-offs, and I believe the reserve build is associated with receivables growing so fast. So how should we think about the reserve built through the rest of the year, just wondering if you can just comment on the provisions for the rest of the year?","Charles Horn","Let me look at my cheat sheet, I think you're basically going to be in a situation where you are on a solid reserve build Q3 and Q4 just based up on the growth rates we\u2019re experiencing. So even though the loss rates aren\u2019t expected to move, we said that\u2019d be he stable for the remainder of 2014 with the sheer amount of growth we\u2019re expecting to see you will be in a reserve build situation. ","Ed Heffernan","Yeah, it\u2019s kind of like -- sometimes people ask could we flow through more, is there chance for margin expansion? The answer is it's a real simple thing, if we slow our growth you will see a flood of earnings coming through because your reserve build always front runs the earnings coming from the file. So it is one of those things where the reserve builds that we\u2019re going through certainly dampen current period earnings but at the same time we would expect that -- the goal here is sort of long-term earnings generation and so we expect that the builds are good sign going forward but you\u2019re just not going to see any margin till we start slowing.","Ashish Sabadra - Deutsche Bank ","And just quickly on the M&A pipeline usually you tend to do one or two tuck-in acquisition every year, I was just wondering when you look at the M&A pipeline both on the portfolio acquisition front as well as maybe some tuck in acquisitions, how do you look at the pipeline, and if you just could comment on your plans?","Ed Heffernan","Yeah I mean on the M&A side, obviously in the card business we\u2019re not \u2013 we don\u2019t do a lot of it, we will do as we talked about some pretty modest size files that there's out there, 100 million, 200 million, we have one in \u201815 that\u2019s coming on board, that\u2019s about 500 million. So we\u2019re not assuming that there's going to be a lot of M&A there which sort of leaves the other two large segments from an M&A perspective and clearly I certainly wanted to make sure our European adventure via BrandLoyalty was successful before we dip our toe any deeper into the water and needless to say we are more than happy with how that's going. So that gives us more confidence that maybe we beef up Europe a little bit more, at the same time that our clients are asking for a larger footprint in Europe as well as in Asia because these are global clients. So we need to be aware of that. At the same time it's always the question \u2013 do we build or buy in terms of beefing up digital assets. If prices are crazy we\u2019re certainly not going to get involved in that, we prefer to build it. If there are opportunities where there are reasonable valuations and that means accretive to us, then we will buy. So that's about as close as I can get. ","Ashish Sabadra - Deutsche Bank ","That\u2019s a great segue into my last question, just on the synergies between BrandLoyalty and Epsilon business, can you talk about your plans fixed [ph] and Epsilon in Europe and Asia and maybe bring BrandLoyalty in the US, if you could just provide some color on that front?","Ed Heffernan","Yeah, there is no question \u2013 I will take the first piece, Bryan can take the second -- there is no question that BrandLoyalty which exclusively is with the big supermarkets hypermarkets what everyone call them over in, primarily in Europe as well as some in Asia, we are already getting traction in Canada first, which would make sense, given our presence up there, as well as beginning to look at opportunities in the US. As part of this deal, we certainly wanted to use our relationships in North America to help the footprint of BrandLoyalty. I think what you'll find is that in Canada will be their first jump off and that will be sooner rather than later and in the US would be next. ","Bryan Kennedy","I think from an Epsilon perspective just to give you some color, Epsilon today already has a nice healthy footprint across Europe and APAC but as a percent of revenue, that\u2019s a fairly small piece of our business. We have been growing that -- originally many of those relationships were centered around our email offering, and as our multinational clients grow \u2013 we are growing with them by adding personnel and adding services in all of those locations which enables us to broaden what we do internationally beyond email to database and data etc. So that\u2019s something that\u2019s going to be critical for Epsilon going forward is to continue strengthening those international offices so we can grow with our global clients. ","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust.","Andrew Jeffrey \u2013 SunTrust","Hey Ed, I think your comments on Epsilon are particularly telling vis-a-vis the strategic positioning of business, Harmony from a long-term sort of cross sell synergy perspective, this is clearly critical. Could you elaborate a little bit on a competitive basis when you look at the broadening of the revenue base from whom do you think Epsilon is taking share and who do you see in the market as your primary competition?","Ed Heffernan","Yeah I will take a stab at it but I won\u2019t do a justice of \u2013 I will let Bryan finish up. But there is a large chunk of the growth in Epsilon that is coming from not dissimilar to what we talked about in the card business as well, it is coming from a shift of dollars away from your much more traditional channels of marketing, your brand advertising everything else, when we\u2019re looking at especially in the midmarket space which we've never really had much traction, because this stuff is expensive. But what we\u2019re finding is people are going to pony up the bucks to get a solution that will provide them with using all types of data to get good insights into their customer base, they are taking money out of those traditional channels. So I would say Andrew, to answer your question it\u2019s less about against whom we compete, it\u2019s more about a shift that\u2019s taking place out of traditional spend and into data-driven sort of targeted marketing and loyalty, that\u2019s the biggest. But now I will let Bryan hit the \u2013","Bryan Kennedy","Yes I think Ed is right. I mean so we see a little bit more in the category of market expansion than stealing market share. I mean indirectly for sure if you\u2019ve got for example Ed talked earlier about the food vertical, quick serve and casual dining and retail, I mean you are seeing in those clients a shift in spend which is basically away from general advertising into these data-driven forms of marketing and in that regard I guess you\u2019re indirectly stealing share from traditional advertising agencies, you would have supporting those channels. But really it's we think of it more as new spend in these data-driven categories and in particular loyalty which Ed emphasized earlier which is a lot of runway to it, and it\u2019s a big driver of the growth in our technology business. And beyond that you see competitors in the categories that we cover, which would range from data companies to database, marketing services companies to agencies and Epsilon\u2019s emphasis and our market position is about integrating all those services together in one end to end platform. We think that's a winning formula because our clients are looking for somebody who can insulate them from all the complexity in the marketplace and we believe we\u2019re one if not the only one of the companies that has the broadest reach across all of those channels and categories. So it's a good position for us to take, and that\u2019s helping to drive growth. ","Andrew Jeffrey \u2013 SunTrust","The Precima business is a relatively new business, I haven't heard you talk a lot about that. Can you talk about the opportunities for growth sort of on that I guess more of a bespoke or one off or closed loop kind of offering, is that something we\u2019re going to be hearing more of in terms of loyalty\u2019s long term growth?","Ed Heffernan","Yeah, I think it is the natural growth -- outgrowth of the AIR MILES business itself, in the sense of what Precima does is it gets a lot deeper into the behaviors and spending patterns of the existing clients. And so you're really getting down into for example at a grocer, the individual SKUs and trying to figure out how we should do product placement, to who we should be offering the big promotions to, how we should be tearing those promotions. Again think of it as adding another level of detail for those clients enough clients can either be a part of the coalition or outside of the coalition itself. So some clients don't want that level of detail, those who do Precima is the solution. So yeah i would say given the trend in the amount of information people want I would say Precima is a legitimate new growth vehicle for the LoyaltyOne segment.","Andrew Jeffrey \u2013 SunTrust","Great, thank you very much.","Ed Heffernan","Thank you everyone.

[Operator Instructions] In order to view the company\u2019s presentation on their website, please remember to turn off pop-up blocker on your computer.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Daniel Haykin of FTI Consulting. Sir, the floor is yours.","Daniel Haykin","Thank you, operator. By now, you should have received a copy of the company\u2019s fourth quarter and full year 2014 earnings release. If you have not, please call FTI Consulting at 212-850-5709. On the call today, we have Ed Heffernan, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Charles Horn, Chief Financial Officer of Alliance Data.","Before we begin, I\u2019d like to remind you that some of the comments made on today\u2019s call and some of the responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risks and the uncertainties described in the company\u2019s earnings release and other filings with the SEC.

Ed?","Edward Heffernan","Great. Thanks, Daniel. Joining me today is Charles Horn, our always exuberant CFO and Charles will kick it off and talk about our operating results for the fourth quarter and full year of \u201914. I\u2019ll do a quick summary of \u201814 and hit the high points and low points, and then talk about the guidance for \u201815.","So, Charles, take it away.","Charles Horn","Thanks, Ed. To use an Ed-ism [ph], it was a boomer of the fourth quarter as revenue increased 30% while core EPS and adjusted EBITDA net increased at even stronger rates of 44% and 32% respectively. Better than expected performance by BrandLoyalty, our European loyalty operation and improved credit quality of private label led to the profitability acceleration. ","The acquisition of Conversant which closed December 10 added about $0.09 to core EPS for 2014. Before anyone gets too excited, $0.09 accretion in 22 days, you need to keep in mind that 4.6 million shares were issued as part of the acquisition consideration had not fully burned into the fourth quarter share count. Being an average calculation, only 1.1 million of these shares impacted the fourth quarter diluted shares. So overall, we think we are still on track for about $0.50 of accretion in 2015.","Core EPS excluding Conversant\u2019s step period contribution was $3.36 for the fourth quarter beating guidance by $0.08. This beat was accomplished despite a $0.05 drag from unfavorable FX rates, which were down 8% from the prior year quarter and 4% from the third quarter of 2014. EPS decreased 52% to $0.86 for the fourth quarter 2014. It was negatively impacted by a couple of one-off charges aggregating $2.05. Dual costs which are investment banking legal and accounting fees pertaining to Conversant acquisition aggregated $7.3 million, while the strong performance by BrandLoyalty triggered a $106 million earn out charge.","Overall, a nice charge to take because it reflects how well the acquisition has performed with adjusted EBITDA up over 50% compared to pro forma 2013. As you may remember, this was a one year only earn out arrangement. Excluding both from EPS calculation, EPS increased 63% for the fourth quarter of 2014. Let\u2019s go on to the next slide and talk about LoyaltyOne.","LoyaltyOne had a better than expected fourth quarter with revenue up 62% and adjusted EBITDA net of non-controlling interest of 41%, compared to last year. Notably adjusted EBITDA margins expanded during the fourth quarter to 29%. One of the things I like about BrandLoyalty is its largely fixed operating expense structure. Sequentially, mainly compared to third quarter \u201914, its revenue increased $76 million, while its adjusted EPITDA increased $25 million, or a 33% flow-through rate, very solid.","As it has been all year, FX was a headwind to the fourth quarter reducing our revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth rates by 8%, compared to last year. The U.S. dollar continues to appreciate, so we will face this headwind again in 2015. However, in 2015 we will encounter translation risk with both the Canadian dollar and the euro, which really didn\u2019t come as the planned \u201914 since we did not own BrandLoyalty in 2013.","AIR MILES issued increased a solid 11% during the fourth quarter helping establish a positive growth year albeit only a 1% increase compared to our expectations of 3% to 4% for 2014. The growth rate in the fourth quarter was driven by increased promotional activity by few of our larger sponsors. Entering 2015, we should get some help from the grocery vertical as Sobeys is now a national sponsor after joining our programs in Ontario and Western Canada.","The addition of these stores take the place of the Safeway stores closed earlier in 2014. We talked about that being a lost opportunity and now we can make that up in 2015. 2014 was a year of tremendous collaboration between our international loyalty platforms, Precima, our Canadian analytic solution worked extensively with BrandLoyalty throughout the year to develop deeper customer insights, which we believe contributed to BrandLoyalty\u2019s terrific year.","Conversely, BrandLoyalty entered in late 2014 in order to offer a complementary product offering to our existing AIR MILE clients, as well as other potential clients in the market. We believe this tag team approach will enhance growth opportunities in 2015.","Let\u2019s flip over and talk a little bit about Epsilon. For Epsilon, revenue increased 18% to $440 million for the fourth quarter of 2014 aided by the 22 days that we owned Conversant. Overall, a solid growth quarter with organic revenue growth of about 5%. Adjusted EBITDA net increased 9% to $102 million for the fourth quarter reduced for approximately $3 million of integration cost incurred during this sub-period and that would primarily be severance.","As Ed\u2019s quote in the earnings release stated it was a mixture for Epsilon. For the year strong organic revenue growth is 7%, produced organic EBITDA growth of only 1%.","While some distraction existed with the acquisition of Conversant, the primary driver for the lack of EBITDA flow-through was a rise in human capital cost. For 2014, average headcount increased about 4% while total personal cost increased about 8%. For 2015, we will look to moderate the growth rate and human capital cost through some modest offshore initiatives.","Notably, Agility Harmony continues to gain traction in the marketplace, its volumes increased 39% compared to the fourth quarter of 2013. Harmony\u2019s unique features allow its ingest both structure and unstructured data across channels then drive intelligent highly personalized tailored messaging to consumers in the digital channels that generate superior measurable results for our clients. I can\u2019t finish the discussion of Epsilon without talking about the biggest acquisition ever for us, Conversant. It is a company we have watched for many years.","While Conversant may have had its critics its three year CAGR for both revenue and EBITDA is in the double digit range when discontinued operations are excluded; that meets our hurdles. However, more importantly, we see a compelling opportunity and the combination of Conversant\u2019s unique assets with ours, we put ourselves in the position to observe billions of digital interactions on a daily basis across Vista, mobile browser, mobile in app, social and video channels.","With our unique and deep trusted position of managing clients first party transactional data paired with Conversant\u2019s leading cross device common ID, we are extremely well positioned to identify our clients consumers online, reach them at scale and digital channels and personalize messages in a way that drives sustainable ROI for their marketing budgets. We view it as competitive advantage in the marketplace.","Now let\u2019s turn over to the next slide and talk about Private Label. As we expected, Private Label finished the year strong with revenue up 24% and adjusted EBITDA net of a stronger 43% both compared to the fourth quarter of 2013. Breaking down the results for the fourth quarter, we saw nice acceleration in the growth rate of average card receivables, which increased 30%. This compares to growth rates of 15% in Q1, 17% in Q2, and 22% in Q3.","This was the accelerating growth profile we have talked about all year. With the growth in receivables we delivered nice operating efficiencies with operating expenses of 21%, compared to revenue of 24%. Probably a better way to evaluate our operating efficiency given this substantial growth in card receivables is offering expenses divided by average card receivables, which improved 70 basis points compared to the fourth quarter 2013.","Another area I want to highlight is the improvement in credit quality as loss rates decreased to 120 basis points, compared to the fourth quarter of 2013. This improvement has benefited our provision expense, which increased 10% for the fourth quarter, but was still up 23% for the full year.","Now let\u2019s do a deeper dive into our receivables growth for 2014, as a number of different factors contributed to it. First, we were able to increase our active card holder base by about 10% to $35 million at year end. Card programs added during 2014 contributed about 3.5% of that growth rate, meaning pre-2014 programs added 6.5%. That is a good sign and reflective of an improving economy. Second card holders are carrying slightly higher balances upon average 8% to $500 in 2014, still a very modest number. Third and last we continue to expand beyond traditional bricks and motor sales and to the digital channels.","Our digital credit sales expressed as a percentage of total credit sales increased over 25% in 2014, an increase of approximately 200 basis points compared to 2013. Looking into 2015, we expect many of these positive trends to continue. 20% plus growth rates in receivables combined with stable loss and funding rates. As it pertains to our cost structure, we experienced some growing pains early in 2014 before we ultimately grew into it. We do not expect to repeat this in 2015, but rather will look to drive further operating efficiencies.","Before I turn it over to Ed, I will point out a couple of things on the slides that will help you with your modeling. First would be you see we acquired about 550 million of portfolios during the fourth quarter and they were onboard in November. Keeping in mind from the accounting standpoint they are fair valued, meaning we record them net of any anticipated charge-offs so we did not carry reserve against those receivables.","The second thing is when you look at the reserve coverage 5.4% reserve at the end of 2014 that is only on reservable AR, which would exclude these acquired files and it would account the same methodology we used in 2013, which is the trailing LTM charge off rate of 4.4% at a point spread to a 5.4% in the reserve, so basically we follow the same methodology we did in 2013.","With that I will turn it over to Ed. ","Edward Heffernan","Great. Thanks, Charles. If everyone could turn to the page 2014 wrap-up, this is where I chat a little bit about what went well, what we are working on, and then we will get into the outlook for \u201915. So, from a financial perspective it was a heck of a good year, you\u2019ve got top line up over 20%, you\u2019ve got organic growth at 4X GDP, which is ahead of our 3X goal and you got earnings per share up in the mid-20s.","So, financially heck of a year, obviously our focus is on the individual businesses and how they did and what they could do better. Going forward we start with LoyaltyOne, which consists of primarily our AIR MILES program out of Canada and then our BrandLoyalty business, which is primarily our European platform.","And overall, organic top line growth when you combine everything is about 9% and that\u2019s in both constant currency and what we did is we dropped in pro forma BrandLoyalty for 2013. So apples-to-apples, the combined entity grew about 9% organically. BrandLoyalty itself was the big driver and far, far exceeded all of our expectations. And as Charles mentioned, because it over performed so much, it actually triggered an earn-out charge to us haven\u2019t quite figured out how over performance figures a charge, but the fact of the matter we\u2019ll do that all day long.","Then, we also want to talk a little bit about Brazil which is not in any of the financial numbers because we own slightly less than 40% of the entity itself, but it continues to school up very nicely as collectors are up over 30% to 14 million. It\u2019s quiet in terms of not flowing through the financials but the program itself continues to move nicely into a significant asset for us. Those are all the positives.","On the negative side, it would be tough to get excited about the key metric that we use that drives the financials in Canada which is the number of miles or points or whatever you want to call them, the number of units that get issued which is how we get paid. Frankly, it was a disappointing year. We are not at all happy with coming in at a plus 1% for the year. We like to run somewhere around plus 4%, plus 5%. I guess if you want to put a silver lining on it, Q4 came in quite strong, up double digits which suggest that as we move into \u201915, hopefully we can get back to that plus 4%, plus 5% for the year. I do think in \u201915 we are going to see that. ","As Charles alluded to, we now have a national grocer relationship which we hadn\u2019t had before. The issues with the pharmacies issuing miles, that\u2019s off the table for now. We are continuing to issue through all the pharmacies and there seems to be a fair amount of promotional activity bubbling up on the financial services side. So we need to make that a top priority for 2015 and it is, believe me. Obviously, from the FX perspective in \u201914 wasn\u2019t much of a hit but always still $0.15 in earnings per share from the weakening of the Canadian dollar.","So then we move to Epsilon. As Charles also mentioned, pleased with the organic top line growth of around 7%. We like to think of high single digits as a nice number there. Also very pleased with the success of our new digital platform, the Harmony platform, it\u2019s been very successful. Volumes are quite high and continuing to grow. And I think the ability to link the Harmony capabilities and platform with the Conversant capabilities is something that we are looking forward to as we move forward. ","Obviously, again the Conversant acquisition is an important one for us because it immediately gives us a very significant amount of scale in areas where quite frankly we weren\u2019t had scale. So while we were very heavy in things like permission based email, we were not heavy at all or heavy enough in areas of targeted display, mobile, social, video and that\u2019s what Conversant can bring to the table. So we\u2019ll see how that plays out over the next year or so.","And then I would say on the negative side, again we like to call out both the pluses and minuses. We were not at all satisfied with the EBITDA growth associated with the revenue growth at Epsilon over the past year. The inability to flow that top line growth down through to EBITDA is our top priority that we want to focus on \u201915.","To put it in perspective, I think we were probably $15 million or $20 million short in terms of what we were hoping to print on EBITDA growth and that\u2019s something that for Epsilon will be the top priority for \u201915. I think revenues look good there. I think Conversant is off to a decent start, but we need to make sure we get the human capital cost under control as you might expect. With 5,000 people, these are expensive folks and as a result we will continue to grow the U.S. footprint. But at the same time, we will also look to offshore modestly certain components within Epsilon and hopefully recapture the dollars that we need to get the successful flow through from revenue down to EBITDA. So that\u2019s the top priority for Epsilon in \u201915.","And then, as it relates to our card services business, not a lot to say there other than good things. Clearly, sales, portfolio growth, revenue, EBITDA everything was up dramatically and we are very pleased also with the fact that we invested in the future by signing an additional vintage in 2014 that would school up to an additional $2 billion in file growth within three years. ","What we are seeing out there very, very stable in terms of both loss rates as well as funding cost and we are comfortable in saying that if rates move up this year, we certainly aren\u2019t going to get dinked on the funding cost side. In fact we would probably get a little bit of a kiss in terms of the revenue side as our APRs actually reset upward. So again rising rate environment would be slightly positive for us and from what we are seeing there, no issues from a credit quality perspective.","Okay, let\u2019s turn to the next page which is sort of I guess the summary of the summary. Just going through very quickly, we are a growth company and that\u2019s what people know us for and we added $1 billion of top line growth to the company this year and certainly want to do bit more than that during 2015 but \u201914, we added $1 billion. We talked about the fact that organic growth was actually north of our usual target of 3X GDP. We are running closer to 11% this year which is quite a bit stronger than we had anticipated.","If you broke it down again pro forma for BrandLoyalty, you got 9% there, Epsilon did 7%, Private Label did 15% even when you exclude the files that were purchased, and that\u2019s how you get to the 11%. So very pleased with the organic growth rate. In addition to being a growth company, we are also a company that brings that growth to the bottom line in terms of cash flow and you saw that in our earnings increasing 26%. We do that with modest net debt levels, our leverage ratios are still hovering around 2 times and we have very nice visibility into \u201915.","Then before we get into \u201915, this is how we step back and look at our guidance and where we successful in providing investors and analysts with good guidance throughout the year. We started way back a year ago, October or I\u2019m sorry when we released Q4 in January, beginning of February with roughly $12.20 looking for about 22% growth. We took a $0.15 FX hit, so you add that back we got a benefit of about $0.09 from Conversant so take that out. And what you are left with is, we came in about $0.30 above the original guidance. So I think that\u2019s fairly consistent with us giving guidance that is a relatively if not conservative and certainly solid, and then hopefully meet and beat as we move ahead and as the year unfolds.","So what that means for 2015? Last October, we gave the following guidance for \u201915. We said revs were going to be up about $6.6 billion, about 25% increase; roughly about 13% core growth and the remainder from the Conversant deal. Adjusted EBITDA and EBITDA net of funding costs were going to be about $2 billion and $1.8 billion respectively and core EPS we put it in a range of $14.80 to $15.00, roughly 20%.","Clearly, I think people have heard this quite a bit by this point, but there is a headwind with FX issues that is going to be a challenge for us in 2015. If you look at where we have exposure to FX, the Canadian dollar being the biggest one, the loony was at par to the U.S. dollar couple of years ago, now it\u2019s down 20%, the Euro was at 1.40, now it\u2019s at 1.14 so that\u2019s down 20%. These are very, very big moves and moves that really I\u2019ve never seen happened so quickly especially over the last six months.","So we want to talk a little bit about what it means to us and is it true economic issue for us or is it more of an accounting FX translation issue for us? Obviously the latter is the case. When it comes to guidance, I think \u201914 serves as a good model and that is once you went through the puts and takes, we outperformed our initial guidance by about $0.30 and delivered 25% earnings growth. And based on the current trend, I do think the blueprint for \u201915 will follow a similar path and the only difference being that our true economic results will be more muted by FX translation issues.","Recall that in \u201914 FX hit us for $0.15 while in \u201915 we are looking at an FX hit of about $0.40. As the dollar has soared or said in other way the Canadian dollar and the Euro have tanked and they have tanked roughly at 11% just since our last guidance. So to keep everyone on the same page here, here is what I call the back-of-the-napkin math that I\u2019m using. The original guidance had revs up 25% to $6.6 billion. ","I do think that we are nicely on a path to over perform from that perspective and I think we have about another $100 million in over performance along the way which would put us at $6.7 billion, up around 27% from a true operating or economic perspective. Then against that our financials will get hit with about $200 million of FX translation losses, the result being reported revs of around $6.5 billion, up 23% over last year. ","Moving on to core EPS, our original guidance was $14.80 to $15.00. To keep it simple, let\u2019s take the midpoint call it $14.90. Same thing is in 2014, let\u2019s say it\u2019s another good year and let\u2019s say we are looking at some pretty nice over performance which I believe we are. We\u2019ll probably add another $0.30 to that resulting in what we normally would print would be about $15.20 per share representing 21% growth. However against that, the FX chews up about $0.40 and will probably print about $14.80, still up 18% but masking true business over performance. So that\u2019s where we are today.","And then let\u2019s specifically talk about Q1. We expect revs on a constant currency basis to increase 30% to $1.6 billion. After taking an FX translation hit of about $65 million, we would expect to report about $154 billion in revs, still up 25%. For earnings, we expect $3.52 per share on a constant currency basis which would be up 26% and reported earnings after FX of $3.40, up 22% year-over-year.","So I think we are off to a really good start. It\u2019s one of those things where we\u2019re going to spend more time talking about FX from an accounting perspective and probably anyone wants to, but the fact of the matter is the businesses themselves they do look like we are heading in the right direction in terms of those issues we needed to address and continuing the momentum that we saw in 2014. So I do expect over performance as the year close out which is typical for us.","If you then move to the next slide which is a pie chart, basically shows the different pieces of Alliance and it shows hopefully what you are seeing there is balance. And what we\u2019ve done over the past several years is, we focused on making sure that we have a balanced offering that would appeal to all the verticals that are out there. So again whether it\u2019s a coalition program like AIR MILES, whether it\u2019s a short term loyalty program like a BrandLoyalty, whether it\u2019s a long-term loyalty platform like Epsilon, whether it\u2019s a loyalty program that has a credit component like card services, it\u2019s all the same stuff. ","But it does appeal to very different verticals and so what we want to be able to say to the marketplace is, regardless of the vertical you\u2019re in, we\u2019ve got the platform solutions for you. I think the pieces that we were missing over the last two to three years, one was a strong international footprint which we now have with BrandLoyalty and also having sufficient bulk in scale in the digital space which we now have with Conversant. ","So we\u2019ve got the platforms, we\u2019ve got the products, the ability to pull the first party SKU data across all the different verticals is all in place and then the ability to do the analytics and the targeted marketing through all the different channels that are out there is also in place. So I think overall the model of \u2013 we\u2019re in a marketplace where you\u2019ve GDP relatively muted. I think that if we are doing three or four X GDP, that\u2019s comfortable for us going forward.","Alright, let\u2019s go to really the last slide and then we\u2019ll open it up for questions. And if you look at this slide, it gives you a sense of the balance that we have across the company. If you look at the first one, that\u2019s loyalty one, which is our AIR MILES and BrandLoyalty businesses. Again if you take out FX and look at just constant currency and your pro forma BrandLoyalty for 2013, what you are seeing is actually pretty good, 10% organic top line growth from \u201913 to \u201915. Same thing for Epsilon where you got a sort of 7%, 8% and that includes doing a pro forma for Conversant and so we expect that to contribute nicely to \u201915. And then obviously the over performer of the last couple of years has been in the card services group, and you\u2019ve got very strong growth rate there as well.","So again what we are shooting for here is balance, consistency and the ability to bring that sort of 3X or 4X GDP growth down to the bottom line. You should note however because we do get questions a lot on Brazil and how that coalition is going, that\u2019s not in any of these numbers. As I mentioned earlier, growth has been solid. If you were to look at expectations from \u201914 to \u201915, we actually expect another year of 30% growth in the member base from 14 million to 18 million. So it\u2019s different right along there.","From a revenue perspective, I will give it in the Brazilian currency and so that will not make me go back and figure out what the FX translation is. But in the Brazilian currency, we are looking at somewhere around mid R300 million which is going to up about 30% also from 2014. So this thing is moving along pretty nicely and it\u2019s beginning to hit critical mass.","In summary, then we\u2019ll open it up to questions, the sort of the five takeaways from the company and how the model is doing. One is, we continue to be who we are which is a growth company. We expect to be well north of adding another $1 billion to our top line. We are looking at 27% constant currency basis, probably 23% reported basis, and nice solid EPS growth of 21% constant currency and 18% after FX.","Organic, we are looking at double digit organic growth probably around 10-ish, 11% again which is significantly ahead of the market and the S&P. Balance, I think I addressed that, all the businesses are growing, clearly they cycle differently. But when you put them all together, it does give a nice flow to the earnings and that is probably the next point which is consistency.","We are going to have same cycle at different times. We are going to have FX one year, we are going to have credit quality another year et cetera, et cetera, et cetera but again the portfolio of businesses that we seem to have cycle at different times and as a result the earnings growth seems to be relatively consistent. ","Then finally, free cash flow, if we are going to do around $1.8 billion or so of net EBITDA, if you take out CapEx and cash interest and cash taxes, we will probably be around $1.3 billion of free cash flow and of that $1.3 billion we will use some for obviously incremental capital needed to grow the card services file, additionally buybacks and then we will look to increase our stake in BrandLoyalty each year over the next three years, while also maintaining modest leverage across the business of about net debt to EBITDA of about 2X.","So, we will keep plenty of dry powder and overall we feel pretty good about things. I mean, it\u2019s the consumer spend that we\u2019re seeing is pretty good and so I think that the bulk of the business that especially is in the current services side, the individual consumer seems to be doing quite well and we expect that to carry through 2015 and I\u2019d say probably most important to us in terms of growth is the existing clients that we have. Our ability to use data and data driven targeted marketing to grow our tender share at our existing clients is a fair amount of importance to us that\u2019s the nice juicy stuff so to speak and so if retailers are growing sales 3%, 4% year-over-year we will look to grow sales at those retailers more like 9% to 12% and that\u2019s what we are seeing.","So, overall off to a good start and with that being said, I\u2019ll open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.","Charles Horn","Hello.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Do you hear me guys.","Charles Horn","Yeah we do now.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Okay cool, sorry. Thank you. I guess first question is on Epsilon, how should we think about margin improvements in 2015 and beyond as you\u2019re thinking about outsourcing initiatives as far as headcount is concerned?","Charles Horn","Well you\u2019re going to have a couple of things going on there, Sanjay. The first will be Conversant layering in. Conversant carries a pretty good margin as you know so that\u2019s going to be beneficial to us, so we will go up just purely from the addition of Conversant for the full year. Go beyond that we will look to get some leveraging in the base Epsilon model coming through as well in 2015. So, when I look at it, I think it\u2019s reasonable to think that EBITDA margins for the combined entity can probably be in the 24% range in 2015.","Edward Heffernan","Yeah, which if you were just to do a standalone Epsilon you\u2019d be about 150 basis points I think versus where we are this year. ","Sanjay Sakhrani","And then as we see the trajectory move from 2015 onwards you expect to get decent operating leverage?","Charles Horn","I do. I think the combination of the model, obviously with digital out of Conversant\u2019s get lots of leveragability to it. The ability to offshore some of our more roads programming I think is going to be very beneficial with the price differential. So, I do think with Epsilon here to service model we will benefit from the moderate offshoring, with Conversant by driving volume through that operation you\u2019ll get lots of leveraging from it. So, I do thing incremental leveraging down the road next two or three years is very realistic. ","Sanjay Sakhrani","Okay and then just final question on the card business. When we think about the pipeline as far as inorganic growth is concerned, can you just talk about it and maybe just relate it to kind of how we could see some operating leverage in that business as well, thank you.","Edward Heffernan","Yeah, I will do the sales side. And again on the Epsilon Conversant just to finish up, Conversant\u2019s probably running, help me out Charles, low 30s in margin and we hope to get up to around 20-ish, so you put the two together and you\u2019ll get your sort of mid-20s that Charles was talking about. So, we are looking to get about 0.5 or so out of Epsilon, you combine it with 33% of Conversant and you should have a very nice lift on the margin side going forward. ","On the card services business, if you look at sales growth, which I think is going to drive obviously file growth as well, we typically are, you know the past two three years we\u2019ve been running about 20% file growth. I think this year we\u2019re probably going to running somewhere between 25% and 30%, so it\u2019s a bit more of a hyper growth environment for us. ","From a sales perspective, the way to build up the sales side would be take the core which is two-thirds of the business and you have the retailers growing 4 points in sales. We will do more like 10 points at those retailers. So that\u2019s 10% sales growth. Then you have the existing clients that are ramping up from nothing, which is our preferred way of growing that will probably add another 8 points of growth and then you have the acquired files that will probably bring you another 7 points or 8 points of growth and that\u2019s where you\u2019ll be in the high 20s in terms of sales. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller with Barclays.","Darrin Peller","I\u2019ll start off by following up on Private Label for a minute, given how strong of a driver that\u2019s been, you know I think Ed you just reconstructed a bit of the growth profile for this year, how you can get to the 20% plus coming up, it\u2019s great to see, I guess just bigger picture longer term, I mean where are we in that in terms of your penetration, you\u2019ve updated us before talking about I think $30 billion of receivables that you can potential raise as a market opportunity. Is that really still, I mean how competitive has that dynamic become is that something that you continue to see in opportunity for a real portfolio acquisitions, you know maybe not the same degree as we saw in \u201914, but are there low hanging fruit out there, can you give us a little more color on the trends at \u201915.","Edward Heffernan","Sure. What we are seeing out there is more of the same. Again I think there is this sort of secular movement out there focused on the retailers moving away from the traditional brand spend to promote their products to the highly targeted data driven marketing, which requires having that first party skew level information, so that\u2019s a mouthful, but it\u2019s basically saying that trends are friend. We continue to see very robust pipeline.","I would say probably though, where most opportunity is and it doesn\u2019t sound like it\u2019s really the sexiest stuff to talk about because it\u2019s not about portfolio acquisitions or big new signings, but the core itself, growing tender share itself is a huge driver of our growth; and so if we can grow our tender share such that the retailer does their 4% growth and we\u2019re doing 10%, 11% growth and it\u2019s two-thirds of our business, that\u2019s a huge piece.","We are nowhere near the saturation point on tender share. We\u2019re probably in the high 20s today. We have clients, we are roughly half of all spend is on our card and so if we can continue to grow tender share, you know 150 basis points a year there is your first 10% of growth in both the file and sales. Do I think that 30 billion is reasonable? Absolutely. Where is it going to come from for us? It\u2019s going to come from tender share from the corp, it\u2019s going to come from programs that we are starting from scratch, and I would say between those two that will be, Darrin probably 80% of our growth.","I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a lot of files out there that are all that attractive to us. You are looking at probably one or two files per year, is about what we are thinking about at this point, but I would say 80% of the growth is going to come from, if you want to call it the organic, the tender share gains and the starting from scratch. In 2015, you\u2019ve got Zales, which we\u2019ve announced, which is coming on board and there may be one other file, but we are just not going into the game with the banks to bid things through the roof that\u2019s not how we\u2019re going to keep our margins up.","Darrin Peller","And then on credit quality, I mean, there\u2019s been some other banks talking about, you know early signs of building reserves on provisions and you guys, you know you had a good quarter from reserving, I know next quarter it will be bigger given the receivables you bought, but bigger picture, I mean do you see any sign or expectation that this a year where we will start to need a bigger reserve bill for any reason.","Edward Heffernan","Well, we certainly will be building reserves because of our growth, but from a credit quality perspective, we expect it to be flat. There is nothing that we\u2019re seeing from either aged write-offs, recoveries or personal bankruptcies that are suggesting there is any type of upward pressure on the loss rate. So sort of that mid-4% level sounds about right for us and we reserve about a point above that.","Darrin Peller","Alright, just last question, thank you. Just a couple of things I may have missed, but how much revenue did Conversant and BrandLoyalty like actually contribute in the fourth and perhaps if you can give us some expectation of what you think it will contribute to your 2015 growth?","Edward Heffernan","If you look at Conversant, it would have added about $46 million in revenue, that\u2019s how you get to a 5% organic growth for Epsilon in Q4.","Darrin Peller","Alright, thank.","Edward Heffernan","For BrandLoyalty, it would have been \u2013 and I\u2019m kind of drawn a blank here Darrin, BrandLoyalty had a very nice Q4. They flow through about a $187 million of revenue.","Darrin Peller","Okay, alright. That\u2019s great. Thanks guys.","Edward Heffernan","Yeah.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Napoli with William Blair.","Bob Napoli","Thank you and good morning. Just on the \u2013 following up on the private label business, looking at the revenue guidance, is the yield down? It looks like the revenue isn\u2019t growing as fast as receivables. And I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s all U.S., are some of these newer programs or the co-brands coming in at somewhat lower yields? ","Edward Heffernan","I think it\u2019s all U.S. so we\u2019re good there.","Bob Napoli","Yes.","Edward Heffernan","And yeah, what you\u2019re going to basically see is if you\u2019re growing the file, make it up 20%, you\u2019re going to have revenue lag that and probably grow around 17%, and then your flow through to EBITDA will be a couple of points below that. So the 20%, 17%, 15%, something like that sounds about right. The yield itself, you have a couple of things going on.","One is the growth rate and with the growth rate even accelerating from 20% to 25% or 30%, that\u2019s going to dampen your yield, because these programs need to spool up a little bit and also on the co-brand side as those spool up, those do carry a lower yield, but higher balances. So expect what \u2013 60, Charles? 60 bps, something like that is about the right number.","Bob Napoli","Okay, pretty modest. And then on gas, I mean you don\u2019t have any gas or very little, right? I mean if I imagine, in your customer, I mean I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re seeing anything in January, but your customer and your products should be benefiting eventually from lower gas prices, I don\u2019t know if you are seeing that now, but I mean \u2013 at one of your co-brands, do you have \u2013 I mean, gases got to be less than 1% of your spend right on this?","Edward Heffernan","Yeah, we have virtually no exposure to gas. As you said, it\u2019s the lower gas goes for us, you would think two things could happen, one is that the consumer decides they want to pay down debt, you will have a little less growth in the file, but you\u2019ll have lower losses, because people are less delinquent. At the same time, you would also free up discretionary spend and a lot of our card client\u2019s focus on the discretionary spend. So I think we\u2019re good there. In Canada, from a gas price perspective, we do have obviously a very large relationship up there, a couple of relationships there and those are primarily driven off of volume as opposed to price.","Bob Napoli","Okay. And then just the last question, the M&A pipeline and thoughts around M&A and I understand the way you guys are \u2013 I mean you\u2019re always looking at and I\u2019m sure you have people modeling 20-plus companies, you are keeping a close eye on. What types of things are you looking to add another \u2013 is there any more impetus to add another leg or are there opportunities to expand through M&A, any of your business in 2015?","Edward Heffernan","Yeah, I mean, you sort of summed it up, I mean the Get out of Jail Free-Card is, sure we\u2019re looking at everything all the time and who knows what could happen, but what we\u2019re seeing right now is \u2013 I don\u2019t see anything that is jumping out at us right now, a year from now that maybe different. But right now, our focus is really on digesting not only the BrandLoyalty piece within our LoyaltyOne business, but also the Conversant piece within Epsilon, additionally getting our AIR MILES to be a significant contributor once again is important in getting the flow through to Epsilon margin is critical in spooling up Brazil. So a very long winded way of saying, I think, it\u2019s unlikely you are going to see anything of significance from us this year on the M&A side. We\u2019re pretty comfortable with what we\u2019re seeing.","Bob Napoli","And Conversant is performing as you expected, it\u2019s early on, the third quarter look a little bit light just in their top line, but are you getting so far what you expected on the top line and bottom line for Conversant?","Edward Heffernan","We fully expect Conversant to deliver what we\u2019ve said to the market, which is about $230 million on EBITDA and about $670 million on top and that\u2019s our expectation and we\u2019re going to hold to it.","Bob Napoli","Great. Thank you. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust.","Andrew Jeffrey","Hi, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question.","Edward Heffernan","Sure.","Andrew Jeffrey","You\u2019ve talked about digital sales being up about 25% in 2014 in you private label business. Can you elaborate specifically what actions you\u2019re talking about and how that might as we roll forward into 2015 and beyond accelerate tender share, which is obviously such an important driver of your private label business?","Edward Heffernan","Yeah. With our retailers, it\u2019s really \u2013 Andrew, a lot is driven by the retailers, right? They\u2019re not sitting back. They\u2019re basically saying look we got to get in the game here and so the percentage of their sales that are not bricks and mortar is now at about what, Charles, 25%, which is growing pretty dramatically.","So the retailers are investing a lot in the online channels. And as a result, that\u2019s one of the areas where we\u2019ve invested a lot of money in whether it\u2019s something as straight forward as applying for a card when you\u2019re in the store, we can do that as you shop, whether it is pre-screening as you\u2019re shopping online, we can help you out there, but our view is you need to have an omni-channel approach and that\u2019s what we\u2019re looking to support.","And so, the Conversant deal provides us with the ability to go to a specific retailer and say we know you\u2019re pushing hard to get into this space. Obviously, a lot of the growth or most of the growth in the retail has been online and here the tools that you need and now we can offer scale across the spectrum from permission-based email, mobile, social, video, targeted display, whatever and that\u2019s sort of the tool box that we\u2019re bringing to the clients.","Andrew Jeffrey","Okay. And so, 25% meaningfully oversamples for your private label customers, the total U.S. economy where e-commerce, for example, might be 10%, is that the right way to think about it?","Edward Heffernan","Yeah, for sure.","Andrew Jeffrey","Okay.","Edward Heffernan","Yeah, if you look at the way I guess we look at it, you will get total retail sales, right, only about 10%, it gets so much pressed, but only about 10% is actually non-store related, non bricks and mortar of that 10%, 70% of that are from retailers who have actual storefronts and the remaining 3% are just internet only, which is primarily Amazon. So the store format may change, but between online presence and their store format, you\u2019re still looking at 96%, 97% of all retail sales are captured by these types of retailers and so it\u2019s a big piece.","Andrew Jeffrey","Okay. And looking at Epsilon, the organic revenue growth slowed a little bit in the fourth quarter, I know you\u2019ve had a recovery in some discretionary categories like auto, but can you just breakdown the specific categories and how they\u2019re growing and whether you\u2019d expect to see that growth rate bump up a little bit this year?","Edward Heffernan","Yeah, I think high single digits Andrew is still a comfortable number for us. From an Epsilon perspective, in terms of the areas that I\u2019ve really blown it out over the past year or so, I mean auto is huge, right. I mean auto has been a very, very big one for us plus on boarding. Folks like Ford, those tend to be big spenders. We are seeing a resurgence from the financial services side. So banks are beginning to crack open the wallets again for these very large scale loyalty type programs and that\u2019s where we\u2019re going to see some growth in \u201915 as well. ","So I would say auto, I would say I think retail also is an area where we are seeing a lot of interest again. It\u2019s in these multi-tender databases where essentially whether you are using our private label card that captures a third maybe of your sales. Retailers are saying I need a bigger picture and so what Epsilon can do is it can look at multi-tender types. And if there is a loyalty program layered on top of that, we can get a view on to 80%, 85% of the clients spend at that retailer. So that\u2019s a great interest and so how many else, Charles, we\u2019ve got auto, we got financials, we got retail, those are probably the three biggies.","Andrew Jeffrey","Okay, great. I\u2019ll get back in the queue. Thanks, guys.","Edward Heffernan","Yeah.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ashish Sabadra with Deutsche Bank.","Ashish Sabadra","My question, question on Conversant. I was wondering if you could provide some color around the pipeline for Conversant and any initial conversations you\u2019ve had around cross selling Conversant into your existing customer base.","Edward Heffernan","Well, we haven\u2019t owned it for all that long, but we are sort of moving in \u2013 I think of it on three fronts. First is to continue sort of that consolidation and transformation within Conversant itself so that the sales force is out there really discussing the full suite of digital products that they offer as opposed to having a video sales force and a display sales force and a mobile sales force. The idea is to put it all together and that\u2019s sort of the transformation they were undergoing.","So the first front is, continue on letting the Conversant folks hold their product set together and sell that. The second front and we are already often running here is, setting up a joint sales team identifying your top dozen big client prospects on the card services side, we are often running there and then also probably your top 15 or 20 prospects from the large Epsilon client side. And so between those three, we ought to get some pretty good traction and we\u2019ll keep you updated as the year unfolds. It\u2019s a little bit early at this point to start saying whether the big cross sells are working or not, but there sure seems to be a lot of interest.","Ashish Sabadra","That\u2019s great. Thanks for that color. Quickly on fiscal year \u201915 guidance, so essentially you are raising your guidance by 2% on constant currency basis if I understood it correctly on the revenue side. And on the EPS side also on a constant currency basis, you would be raising it by $0.20 but it is essentially the FX headwinds. Just wanted to \u2013 did you provide the EBITDA guidance for fiscal year \u201915 and just wondering if you could provide that?","Edward Heffernan","What we gave before was EBITDA net amount controlling interests and funding cost about $1.08. You are still going to be in that ballpark still rounding. So we just basically didn\u2019t really address it. Again, the gives and takes to get for the core EPS can come from a number of areas. So we just basically left at what we gave in the last quarter.","Charles Horn","1.7","Edward Heffernan","Yeah.","Ashish Sabadra","Okay. I mean that sounds great. And just one final follow-up question to Epsilon question to that earlier, what was the component of the data technology and agency revenues within Epsilon? And as you think about \u201915, how do we think about \u2013 like what\u2019s going to be the driver? Is it going to be the technology which is going to drive, which can also be margin accretive going forward?","Edward Heffernan","I do think it\u2019s going to be the technology that drives it. The reason we did give the historically categories is, with Conversant, it kinds of blows it up as we move things around to really integrate it.","So you will be looking for your digital applications to drive a lot of your growth in 2015, database is going to be very solid and they are in that 7%, 8% top line range and then the data is going to be sitting there more in that mid single-digit, lower to mid single-digit.","Now the thing we are trying to do, Ashish, is refine the data, make it towards the strong offline data that we sell as well as now refined online anonymize data could be an opportunity for us, but I think digital will lead the way in 2015.","Ashish Sabadra","Thant\u2019s okay. Thanks.","Edward Heffernan","Yeah. Take one more.","Operator","Your final question will come from the line of Dan Perlin with RBC.","Dan Perlin","Guys, I just wanted to revisit the comment around Epsilon becoming more labor intensive. It sounded \u2013 I know you talked about a little, but it sounded like you kind of came up in surprise, you guys have been maybe more than you\u2019d have expected. So, one, is that a correct kind of characterization? Has the business changed a little bit in terms of its mix just completely forgetting Conversant for the moment?","And then, secondly, you talk about shifting your labor pool. I\u2019m assuming you are going after hires in digital analytics. I\u2019m just wondering how you plan to present yourself, I mean a lot of the IT service companies, you are doing the exact same thing, it\u2019s a little different, but still going after that same talent pool? Thanks.","Edward Heffernan","Yeah. I think you characterized it correctly, Dan. I mean it did take us a bit by surprise in terms of how fast the labor cost did move up vis-\u00e0-vis the revenue and we missed it. It\u2019s that simple. I think we were probably off $15 million, $18 million from where we thought and that was solely due really to \u2013 you know, the type of individual we are bringing on is more expensive than we had anticipated.","So going forward, we are not going to make that mistake again. I think what we are going to do is we will continue to grow the U.S. footprint and along with Conversant for sure. We are going \u2013 Conversant though is not nearly as labor intensive as Epsilon. Epsilon has over 5,000 people, Conversant has 1,500. So it\u2019s a completely different model. It\u2019s a much more leveragable tech model.","So I don\u2019t think the labor issue will be a big one over at Conversant. But at Epsilon, we will \u2013 if we are growing in the high single digits, we would like to keep the workforce growth in the U.S. probably into the low single-digit and then the incremental piece, we will look to do some modest offshoring, you put the two together and that should get us back on track.","Dan Perlin","Okay. And can I ask another question? In Epsilon, I thought you were carrying some duplicative costs from some of your large conversions. Have those gone away or is that part of the benefit that we might expect in 2015? And then, the other part of the question separate of Epsilon is, I just wanted to get your thoughts on FX impacts from a consumer behavior perspective, forget translation for the moment and just think about purchasing power behavior in Canada and then the BrandLoyalty asset? Thanks.","Edward Heffernan","Sure. I will try to remember part A through F here.","Dan Perlin","I\u2019ve taken the liberty since I\u2019m the last.","Edward Heffernan","Yeah, clearly. I will start with the FX stuff first. From what we are seeing in Canada, which seems to be your question, I mean what we are seeing up there is that you\u2019ve got consumer discretionary spending. Canada has been weak for the past couple of year. We expect to continue to be weak. Most of the dollars seem to be going into housing as housing prices continue upward.","So we are assuming a relatively modest amount of consumer spend in Canada and that\u2019s why we have to make sure that we\u2019ve got the additional sponsors spooled up and there is a lot of promotional activity that you saw hitting Q4, my guess is you will see a lot of that throughout 2015 as people are promoting the heck out of things to get that relatively limited consumer dollar. In terms of \u2013 what was part A again? The Epsilon?","Dan Perlin","Duplicative carrying costs with some of these large clients that you converted over?","Edward Heffernan","Yeah. In terms of \u2013 the biggest piece would be on the email platforms, right. We\u2019ve got quite a bit of legacy costs. If you look at the Harmony platform, we probably got a third of our volume is flowing through Harmony, which is a huge chunk, but we\u2019ve got two-third that need to migrate over, over the next probably 18 months to 24 months and those are \u2013 that will get rid of many, many millions of sort of cost that we are incurring today.","Dan Perlin","Great. And then just remind us the amount of portfolio funding cost that\u2019s locked down?","Charles Horn","Let\u2019s see, we are about 70% of it is fixed rate, you have close to $1 billion of revolving that will be coming due and they don\u2019t have a lot of term debt coming due in 2015. I can get you to that afterwards when we talk to them.","Dan Perlin","Okay. Thank you very much.","Charles Horn","You bet.","Edward Heffernan","Alright. Thank you, everyone. I know everyone has got a bunch of stuff to get back to and we will end it there and we will look forward to seeing a lot of you on that road.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That does conclude the call for today. You may now disconnect."],"1212":["Alliance Data Systems Corp.

At this time, all parties have been placed on a listen-only mode. Following today's presentation, the floor will be open for your questions.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Steve Calk of FTI Consulting. Sir, the floor is yours.","Steve Calk - Managing Director, FTI Consulting","Thank you, operator. By now, you should have received a copy of the company's second quarter 2015 earnings release. If you haven't, please call FTI Consulting at 212-850-5703.","On the call today, we have Ed Heffernan, President and Chief Executive Officer of Alliance Data; Charles Horn, Chief Financial Officer of Alliance Data; and Bryan Pearson, Executive Vice President and President of LoyaltyOne.","Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that some of the comments made on today's call and some of the responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties described in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC.

Reconciliation of those measures to GAAP will be posted on the Investor Relations website at www.alliancedata.com.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Ed Heffernan. Ed?","Edward J. Heffernan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Steve. Joining me today is Bryan Pearson, President of LoyaltyOne, which houses both the Canadian AIR MILES program as well as our European platform, BrandLoyalty; as well as Charles Horn, our always eloquent CFO. Bryan is going to give an update about LoyaltyOne, and Charles will walk you through the quarter, and I will discuss the year-to-date performance, critical goals, where I think we are in the year, and updated 2015 guidance.","That being said, Charles?","Charles L. Horn - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Edward. It was a solid second quarter with revenue up 19%, importantly 11% organic, and adjusted EBITDA, net up 18%, a good flow-through of the revenue growth. On a constant currency basis, the growth rate for revenue adjusted EBITDA net were an impressive 23% and 21% respectively. Core EPS increased 14% to $3.32 for the second quarter, exceeding our guidance of $3.20.","Accordingly for the year, we are passing that through and raising our annual guidance from $14.90 to $15, a 19% increase compared to full-year 2014. EPS was down slightly to $2.11 due to non-cash expenses related to the Conversant acquisition completed in December of last year. Generally, we expect acquisitions to be accretive to core EPS in year one, the GAAP EPS in year two.","A quick update on the share repurchase program. During the second quarter, we bought 451,000 shares for total consideration of $134 million. Year-to-date, we bought 2.5 million shares for total consideration of $699 million. Currently, we have reacquired over half of the shares issued as part of the Conversant acquisition late in 2014.","With that, I will turn it over to Bryan to talk about LoyaltyOne.","Bryan A. Pearson - Executive VP & President, LoyaltyOne","Thanks, Charles. LoyaltyOne's revenue declined by 15% or $54 million to $302 million, and adjusted EBITDA declined 24% or $21 million to $66 million for the second quarter. Of course, the strong U.S. dollar continues to be a significant headwind for LoyaltyOne, reducing our revenue and adjusted EBITDA by $49 million and $10 million respectively. On a constant currency basis, our revenue was flat and adjusted EBITDA declined by 13% versus last year as the AIR MILES low-single digit revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth was more than offset by the program timing of BrandLoyalty.","However, when reviewing the AIR MILES and BrandLoyalty businesses separately, the results to date and the outlook for the balance of the year are predominantly positive. So let's start with AIR MILES. The AIR MILES business enjoyed a strong second quarter as issuance increased an exceptional 235 million miles or 19% over the same period last year. This is the highest mile increase in any quarter of our history and it's a critical driver of our profitability over time.","Leading the charge was the robust performance of our grocery vertical, which is really attributable to two key reasons. First, the launch of Sobeys in Western Canada which continues to perform well with increased promotional activity happening at both Safeway and the Sobeys banners in that market. Second, the launch of Sobeys Ontario late in the first quarter of this year and the conversion of its legacy called Sobeys points to AIR MILES coupled with incremental activity from the existing grocer, Metro, as they share the category in the Ontario region.","The Ontario grocery segment really highlights the role that co-exclusive agreements are planned with sponsors as they look to fend off some of the industry's largest competitors. Finally, issuance growth in the second quarter was also fueled by other sponsors that participated in a very successful promotion in the market and from our relationship with BMO, who launched a new AIR MILES World Elite MasterCard product into the market. To date, the results are very positive as it has a compelling consumer offer in the very competitive premium card market.","For the balance of 2015, we anticipate that base issuance and spend in the program will continue to be strong. However, we believe the extensive bonus activity from the fourth quarter of 2014 will not repeat itself.","As we've said many times in the past, we look at the full year issuance as the key metric in the business since the timing of promotional activity can significantly skew results in any given quarter. We still expect full year issuance for growth for 2015 to be in the mid-single digit range.","AIR MILES redeemed also increased 10% compared to last year and this was primarily due to AIR MILES Cash, our instant reward option. The cash program continues to be a very popular reward offering, and it enjoyed a 60% increase in redemptions over the same period last year. We should note the cash redemptions are prevalent in our grocery partners and so it's following the same growth trend that we are experiencing for issuance in the segment. For the full year, we anticipate redemptions to increase by mid to high-single digits primarily based on the strength of AIR MILES Cash.","So now, let's turn to BrandLoyalty. On a constant currency basis, both revenue and adjusted EBITDA were down compared to the second quarter of last year, but they were in line with management's expectations. As we mentioned in the \u2013 on the first quarter earnings call, some clients pulled forward programs that were executed in the second quarter of last year and this \u2013 and they were pulled forward in the first quarter this year, creating some bad year-over-year comps, again timing.","Keep in mind that BrandLoyalty's revenue is actually up 41% and adjusted EBITDA is net \u2013 is up 29% for the first half of 2015 versus the first half of last year on a constant currency basis. Based on the results to-date and the book of business, we see plan for the balance of the year BrandLoyalty is still very much on track to achieve the full year projections of double-digit top and bottom-line growth, again on a constant currency basis.","And now, a couple of updates on our North American expansion efforts with BrandLoyalty. We're in the final stages of establishing the U.S. pilot program later this year and this represents an important milestone in our U.S. strategy as we build on both our Canadian and U.S. experience through this year. Additionally, the Canadian programs that we first announced in the fourth quarter of last year are progressing well with proven results, and we plan to roll out additional programs in 2015 in that market and maintain a 100% customer retention.","Last, let me update to you quickly on dotz. We continue to see steady growth in our collector base and are tracking to reach approximately 18 million collectors by year-end that would be up 30% from the end of 2014. In addition to the continued member growth, the level of sponsor interest is also building and it could be a catalyst for expansion into one of Brazil's largest markets over the next 6 months to 12 months.","In closing LoyaltyOne, while the second quarter was a bit choppy due to timing, we've achieved solid year-to-date results with 17% and 7% growth in revenue and adjusted EBITDA net respectively on a constant currency basis. While the strong U.S. dollar continues to be a headwind for both units, we have great visibility on how our clients will engage with our loyalty platforms over the remainder of the year and into 2016. I would like to personally thank the leadership teams of both organizations for their continued commitment to both our clients and to the success of LoyaltyOne. Great job, everyone.","And I'll just pass it back to you now, Charles.","Charles L. Horn - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Bryan. Let's flip to the next page and talk about Epsilon. Epsilon's revenue and adjusted EBITDA increased 39% and 66% respectively compared to the second quarter of 2014. Big increases but not yet where we want them to be. Looking at the legacy Epsilon business, results were close to our expectations with mid-single digits growth in both the revenue and adjusted EBITDA, a little short on top-line growth but with solid flow-through to EBITDA. Turning to Conversant, revenue was down about 9%, while adjusted EBITDA was flat compared to the second quarter of 2014 on a pro forma basis.","We are running a couple quarters behind on revenue growth, but did see some positive developments during the second quarter. First, we gained traction with our cross-sell initiatives signing over 10 contracts including names like Hormel, Cornerstone, Nine West, Ann Taylor, Sally Beauty, and Helzberg, to name a few.","We estimate that the annualized run rate for all these new programs will be in the $50 million range which will drive return to revenue growth in the back half of 2015. While we work to return the top-line's positive growth, after pruning some lower margin offerings, the shift to more profitable business led to a 300 basis point expansion in the EBITDA margins at Conversant.","Looking forward to the remainder of 2015, we expect organic revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth in the mid-single digit range, down from our beginning of the year expectation of 7% to 8%. Unexpected softness in our agency offering where we have a couple of very large clients that can move the needle quickly is the primary reason. For Conversant, we are expecting return to revenue growth by the fourth quarter, led by strength in the CRM offering, and solid adjusted EBITDA growth beginning in the third quarter.","Page 9 lays out our expectations for the turn, which Ed will talk about later. Let's flip over and talk about Card Services now. For Card Services, we continue to see very strong results, with the revenue increasing 27%, which translates to a 20% increase in adjusted EBITDA net. This now represents the 14th consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth.","Just as importantly, revenue outpaced expenses by 6%, as Card Services continues to drive operational efficiencies, while delivering on commitments to clients. As a percentage of average card receivables, operating expenses have decreased a full point to 9.8% compared to last year. The provision for loan losses increased 61%, primarily due to the substantial growth in card receivables as we held the reserve rate essentially consistent with last year.","Fueling these impressive results, we saw credit sales increase 34%, which translated into equally strong average receivables growth of 33%. The fundamentals remain very strong, despite a relatively early Easter that pulled some sales into the first quarter. Where measurable, we continue to see tender share gains of more than 175 basis points.","Tender share is the key business metric we track closely as it demonstrates our ability to not only grow with our clients, but also help them grow through overall business and program. Importantly, the growth in credit sales was balanced.","Our core sales, those are the clients who joined us in 2011 and prior, grew 9% in the second quarter, driven equally by stronger traffic and increased spend from existing card members. This is a continuation of our 3x client growth strategy for credit sales. Growth in the core added about seven points to the total growth. Intermediate sales, meaning clients who joined us 2012 to 2014, grew about 36% (13:02) during the second quarter, adding about 10 points to overall growth. The balance came from the acquired programs added in the latter part of 2014. These programs already seen stronger card acquisition providing momentum for continued upside.","From a credit quality perspective, we continue to see low delinquency rates and principal charge-off rate trends remained stable, and in line with seasonal expectations. Funding costs continue to be very stable and should remain so for the remainder of 2015.","In summary, for Card Services, the results continued to be strong. The pipeline of new partnerships remains robust with sales gains expected to run close to 30% for the remainder of 2015 and 20% or greater for the next several years.","With that, I will turn it over to Ed.","Edward J. Heffernan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Great. Thanks, Charles. If everyone can turn to the slide that says first half summary, I think this is, frankly, a pretty helpful slide in the sense of it begins to even out some of the choppiness you'll see in the quarters, and it gives you sort of the first half report card on how the overall company is doing. If you were to go through the individual pieces, again, I know everyone's getting tired of hearing about the dollar, but at the health of the business if we look at Bryan's group, LoyaltyOne, again, there were a number of timing issues where Q1 was (14:30) Q2 was a little bit \u2013 was down, but the end result is through the first six months, you're looking at plus 40%, plus 30% in terms of top and bottom. We certainly expect this business to continue to deliver double-digit top, double-digit bottom on a full-year basis. So, they're scooting along pretty nicely.","Then, we move to Canada, and again we're seeing \u2013 beginning to see the positive growth develop in both revenue and EBITDA. And again, the critical thing there is the 13% increase in miles issued over the first half. Compare and contrast that to minus 2% during the first half of last year, and for those of you who don't live in this business, miles issued is the key metric that will drive future revenue and earnings as we get paid when miles are issued, and that payment is brought into the P&L over a period of time. So, overall, on a constant currency basis through the first half of this year, we're looking at plus 17% top, plus 7% for the LoyaltyOne business, which I think is certainly healthy.","We then move next to Epsilon, again, the big issue with Epsilon that we were focused on this year was last year's inability to flow revenue growth through to cash flow growth or earnings growth and that's where we've really been focused. Epsilon delivering plus 5% top, plus 5% EBITDA in the first half of the year. I would say the plus here is that the flow-through to earnings is in fact happening pretty nicely, and we're seeing that generation of cash flow growth that we didn't last year. Where I think we're short is I think Epsilon is still a couple of points off of its potential in terms of top-line. As Charles mentioned, the database, the loyalty, the data, the digital, all those areas are doing quite well. We did have some softness on the agency side. So we want to be focused on that as well, but the flow-through looks good.","Conversant, I'm going to spend some time on. In terms of what we're looking at through the full year, it's going to be an interesting ride. I think we've got in terms of visibility we're feeling more comfortable now than we did three months or six months ago, and we're waiting for that to flow through. What we're seeing right now is that we have completed the pruning of really the low margin or no margin revenue, which seems to plague ad tech in general, and we're focused on making sure that the real sticky stuff with the high margin stays with us and that seems to be happening as well as signing a very significant book of new business.","And finally, in Card Services, again, it's the same old thing of just \u2013 they're performing better than anyone had anticipated with top-line and EBITDA. Again, very, very strong and really the only thing holding back additional EBITDA growth over and above the 17% is the fact that they're growing so fast that we have to place reserves, which in effect defers the recognition of that flow-through of profit. So even these numbers on the bottom line are a bit muted against what's actually in the book. So overall, the first half you've got plus 24% top, you've got plus 23% on EBITDA, I would say it's a pretty solid first half of the year.","What I would call out, especially in today's environment where growth is so hard to come by, we're looking at 12% organic growth. On a constant currency basis, we're looking at 16% constant currency organic growth. And against our goal of 3x GDP, we're currently running at 6x GDP, which I think is fairly exceptional.","Okay. Let's turn now to Conversant. Let's see what's going on here. We put together a couple of charts here, and you'll see when we brought Conversant into the family at the end of 2014, the trends we were seeing prior to that and then the trends we are seeing since they became part of ADS. Essentially, as a six-month update, we made the bet that the majority of the Conversant offerings would be very, very attractive to Alliance's client base, and specifically Conversant itself was in the middle of transitioning to a model that relied on a client's online and offline transactional level or SKU level data, which should sound familiar to everyone, to provide extremely targeted display ads that were linked across desktop, tablet and mobile devices.","When we first looked at Conversant, the biggest challenge they were beginning to have was its size. It was beginning to be dwarfed by some very, very large players in the space. And it was having more and more difficulty getting into the door of the C-suite, which is where the spending decisions are being made. And so, we thought as part of Alliance that challenge should go away and that's where we are today and we look at first revenue. It's a pretty ugly chart until you start looking at where we see things are heading.","And again, as Charles mentioned, we have a much more comfort with visibility now going forward than we did three months ago. Growth rates and revenue have been slowing or outright declining for almost a year-and-a-half or five straight quarters, and the bulk of the recent decline was what we'll call self-inflicted as we move quickly to prune the more quantity like products which offer lots and lots of revenue, but very, very little margin, if any. And as I mentioned, for those of you in the ad tech space, that's a pretty common thing, that's something that we're not interested in. That process is now complete. Q2 should be the bottom and we had to go a little bit deeper than we previously anticipated, but we think we can call the bottom at this point.","Now, while we pruned, we also introduced Conversant to some of Alliance's clients. Initial response rate has been very, very encouraging. To be specific, I know everyone wants numbers, we inked deals with about 10 existing clients that will drive an annual run rate of $50 million. I will consider that a very successful start to the year. That being said, our goal by the end of this year is to have inked deals that would have an annual run rate of between $75 million and $80 million. We think we were well on pace to hit that goal by the end of this year and that to me would suggest that the original thesis we put forward is in good shape. So, the overall low margin commodity stuff has gone and the GC or sort of cross-sell is signed and I think it's a question of timing at this point.","The big question when we signed the original deal was can Conversant be transformed into Alliance's key digital cross-sell product and returned itself to a high growth business. I think at this point, we all internally feel that the answer to that is yes. And now the question is how fast can we start to load the new wins on to the platform and start seeing the flow-through to revenues. I think that's the question now.","So in our opinion, and again, I think with some folks, it's going to take until we actually print the numbers, but based on what we signed so far, based on the pipeline, the question has moved away from, is this going to be a nice long-term organic growth business for Alliance. I believe the answer is certainly yes. The question now is how quickly can we get these folks boarded and start recognizing the revenue and showing the turn. And that's the race now. We need these wins fully up and running by the end of Q3. We've got half of them boarded by now, and we need everything boarded by the end of Q3 to exit the year in a strong growth mode. Right now, we should get there, but that's the thing that we're focused on right now.","Now, we turn to EBITDA, which I think tells a different story, which also declined for five straight quarters, but as we had mentioned, it's already turned the corner. Again, the pruning of the top actually helps the bottom and in Q2, EBITDA margins jumped 300 basis points from the year before, and we've turned from five negative quarters into flat, and then we should be back into growth mode Q3, Q4 as the acceleration begins.","So from that perspective, I would say, that we're in good shape there. If I were to sum up, maybe five points here, I would say, first, the pruning is done, painful but necessary, remembering why we purchased Conversant. Number two, I think the pruning hurt the top but helped the bottom, and EBITDA has turned, and margins jumped 300 basis points. Number three, the cross-sell into ADS has already produced deals of $50 million in annual run rate, and we want $75 million to $80 million by year-end. We talked about getting everything boarded by the end of Q3. And then, really if you were to turn to sort of the plus\/minus of it that we've been going through that slide that says Conversant at the top plus and minus. If we were to sit back now and say, all right, what did we get right, what did we get wrong. I think at the end of the day, what you're looking at is, I think, we were too optimistic, we certainly were too optimistic on the timing. We thought Q2 would be relatively flat, Q2 came in about $13 million short on revenue, EBITDA did come in on track, which is good, but we do believe that the original thesis is playing out nicely. If we can get the value of the signed contracts from $50 million run rate to $75 million to $80 million by the end of the year and get things boarded, we should have a very strong jump up for next year and we expect double, double top and bottom organic growth from Conversant in 2016.","So that's where we stand. It's going to be a little bit of a waiting game in terms of seeing that curve turn on the revs, but it's headed in the right direction, the cross-sell looks good, the pipeline looks good, the EBITDA is heading in the right direction and I think outside of probably being overly optimistic in terms of pruning versus putting on the new cross-sells, I think we're in pretty good shape on Conversant.","If you were to go now to the 2015 guidance and critical goals for the overall company, again, BrandLoyalty, as we talked about for the full year, we certainly expect on a constant currency basis to see double-digit top, double-digit bottom. On BrandLoyalty, I'd say the potential for the North American expansion is enormous. As Bryan mentioned, we had a number of programs already up and running in Canada that are going well and we expect those to be repeatable next year and the question is as we begin to dip our toe in the water in the U.S., how successful that would be, but given the size of North America that could be huge new market for BrandLoyalty in 2016 and 2017 and with them running at double top and double bottom, we think this could be a really nice growth engine not only today, but really accelerate in the future.","In Canada, as we said, the big driver there and the big pleasant surprise is the fact that miles being issued, our key growth driver is in fact running double digits through the first half, we expect mid singles for the full year. But again, it's always nice to be ahead, on the first half, especially given we were down 2% this time last year and that will eventually flow into revenue and profit.","So I think LoyaltyOne is in very, very good shape. Again, you are fighting against the $0.25 billion hit in terms of top-line and $50 million on EBITDA in terms of the dollar. But inherent in this is the fact that the businesses themselves offer great, long-term potential.","Then we move to Epsilon, the big goal for this year was to make sure the top-line flows through to EBITDA, and we've talked about a number of businesses and a number of things that we've done there right now. We expect the various loyalty platforms, the database, the digital, the data, all those assets are doing quite well. We are seeing some softness on the agency side, and I think the numbers for Epsilon right now, on terms of top-line are not up to what the potential should be which I believe is 7% or 8%. And that's something we're going to have to continue to work on as we move through this year and into next year.","So, potential there for, I think, faster growth going forward, same deal at BrandLoyalty, same deal in Canada. And then on Conversant, I think we've completed the internal transformation towards product offerings that really rely on what Alliance does best, which is using offline and online SKU level information to help drive the targeting across any and all devices, mobile, tablet, desktop. Those are the things that would make us different in the marketplace. It seems to be playing extremely well with our client set.","Again, we've only talked about 10 folks or 12 folks that we signed out of probably population of about 300 clients. So, it's a huge potential. I do think the thesis is holding nicely. We do have obviously some timing issues that we're trying to get behind us over the next quarter or two.","As it relates to our card group, there's not much more to say as I \u2013 the \u2013 its exceptional portfolio growth, solid strong double-digit revenue and EBITDA growth, and I keep going back to the question of, well, it's been such a huge run in the last three years or so, is this \u2013 are we getting near the end here and the answer keeps coming back a very strong no, this thing has got legs to it.","We think that based on just the signings we're looking at this year, we've released some, we've got a bunch more to release that signing another vintage meaning that this year's signings would eventually spool up to about $2 billion in portfolio. We're about 85% to 90% done with that already. I would say that the pipeline of deals today looks as encouraging as it did three years ago.","I do believe a lot of this is secular in the sense of budgets continue to move away from sort of non-measurable traditional channels and into the very focused one-to-one marketing that can come with having SKU level information.","So, long story short, the Card Services, I think, has a long way to go which is very good news. We didn't know when we signed our first $1 billion vintage whether it was one and done, but it was a $1 billion, then $2 billion, then $2 billion, then another $2 billion, so it looks like this thing is going to be around for a while. From a credit quality and funding perspective, again, as Charles talked about, in good shape.","Overall, organic revenue growth, we target at 3x GDP, which would be high-single digits, maybe 10%. This year, we're currently running at 6x GDP on a constant currency basis or about 15%, 16%, with overall revenue growth of 20%. And then, mid-20%s on a constant currency basis, lots of free cash flow, we're using that this year to buy back a number of shares. As Charles mentioned, I think we've already taken in half the shares we issued on the Conversant deal that tends to be still a very good use of our capital both today and going forward.","And we started the year pretty deep in the hole with the FX issue, and we managed through over performance primarily in the card group, as well as share buybacks to mitigate what we believe is the entire FX headwind and print the numbers that you're seeing today.","All right. Let's finish up with raising 2015 guidance \u2013 our last sheet here. I think that we're looking at 20% \u2013 20%, a little over 20% top at $6.5 billion and about 20% on EPS, back to that sort of golden number of $15, which is what we wanted before the dollar tanked. So I think we're all the way back which is good, and I think that overall the businesses are in good shape.","If you step back \u2013 and let me just spend two minutes on this from a strategic perspective \u2013 and say, all right, how's the model doing? How's the company look? Are you guys at the peak of earnings? Are you somewhere in the middle? And the answer is that what you're looking at is a business where you're going to have usually the majority of the businesses doing extremely well, some of the businesses sort of under construction and they tend to swap out in terms of leadership. And right now, you have the Card Services group and the BrandLoyalty group are continuing to produce very big growth rates.","The good news is I don't see that changing any time soon, but what perhaps is more interesting is the potential for other parts of ADS. I don't believe Epsilon has hit its potential in terms of top-line growth, which I think is in the high-single digits. We are beginning to see the EBITDA flow-through to Epsilon. So, we're basically doing profitable growth, which is good. What we're not seeing yet either is the potential for BrandLoyalty in North America. That market is huge. That could be an accelerator to the growth rate of BrandLoyalty. We spent a lot of time doing the six-month checkup on Conversant. We are just beginning to get going here. Are we comfortable that this thing is a double-double top and bottom growth for 2016? The answer is yes. A lot of it depends on making sure we continue that book of signings from $50 million to $75 million to $80 million by year-end, get them boarded, get them up and running and we should be in good shape.","On AIR MILES, we talked about how the key driver of the financials is miles issued. It was flat last year. We're already running double digits this year. You'll begin to see the flow-through next year on the deferred. Bryan talked very briefly about Brazil, but again, from a potential perspective, it is growing 30% top and 30% on its customer base in constant currency. Again, it's sort of at the early stages.","So I think wrapping up, there's a lot of good news. There's work in progress. There's a couple of things under construction. I do not think we're at the peak of what we can do long term and that's the way Alliance is basically run. So, we've cycled through different businesses for the last 15 years. I would expect that we will continue to cycle as we go forward, but right now, the outlook looks pretty good.","With that being said, I'll open it up to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Questions on the agency side of kind of legacy Epsilon business or the core Epsilon business. Could you just talk about what kind of opportunities there are to accelerate the growth there and maybe diversify away from some of your core customers?","Charles L. Horn - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. If you look at agency, what's unique about it is agency is more project-based versus contract-based. That makes it a little bit more difficult for us to forecast; and with several large clients in the agency, they can increase their projects, they can pull back, so they can influence the growth rates very quickly. We talked last year about Ford onboarding, it's ramping nicely. Conversely, we had another large client pull back a little bit. So that's a situation where it's always going to be a little bit bumpy being project-based. The upside for ADS is we continue to grow the technology side double-digit within Epsilon plus you ladder in Conversant, you get that back to double-digit growth. That will further diversify the product offering within Epi and allow it to mitigate some of these swings on project-based offerings.","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay. And then maybe one on Conversant, obviously, good traction in terms of the cross-sell opportunities. When we think about the sizes of the revenue opportunities that you're currently signing versus what might be out there prospectively, I mean, is it safe to assume that some of the opportunities are larger than what you're signing right now?","Edward J. Heffernan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No. I think that if you used somewhere between $3 million to $5 million per signing, we're probably at the higher end of that right now. So say, call it $5 million per over 10 clients. Sanjay, in that 10, you're going to have a swing between $1 million and $10 million. So, it depends on how big a set of services they sign up for whether it's just an affiliate transaction or whether it's the big CRM type data work. So, I focus more on if we got traction with 10 clients and let's say we add another half a dozen or so by year-end, there's probably about 300 clients between our Card Services group and core Epsilon that I think would be a nice target audience for this. So, you do the math, that's what we're focused on. Obviously, we're not going to get all 300 clients, but if we can add 15 clients, 20 clients a year, this could be a nice story.","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","And the signings that you have had thus far, are those from those segments or are they from elsewhere?","Edward J. Heffernan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes, yes. There's been a couple that have been from sort of already in the pipe of Conversant pre-Alliance, but everyone else has been an existing client of either Epsilon or Card Services and that was the big bet that we made going into this thing is the ability to get these folks into the C-suite.","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","All right. Great. I have one last one. So, I guess one of your competitors in the private label space talked about how there's opportunities sub $1 billion and obviously there's all sorts of deals out there sub $1 billion and types of companies. It doesn't seem to be really impacting you guys in terms of your growth. I mean, is that a safe assumption to make that you're really not seeing a lot of competition as it relates to your niche part of the market?","Edward J. Heffernan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. It's always hard to comment on what other people are saying, but from \u2013 look, we're focused on getting a $2 billion vintage every year and growing tender share in the core. The vast bulk of our stuff, Sanjay, as always will be finding retailers that have never had a program before or had one and had a very bad experience. And we start them up from scratch and it takes three years or four years to churn them up. And those are things that quite frankly, the large card players in the industry. That's a lot of time, patience, effort for a file that may reach a $100 million or something like that, which is sort of our average file, if not smaller.","So, it's just, I don't think, moved the needle at the big guys, you've got to go after these huge ones. So to answer your questions, no, we haven't seen it. That doesn't mean that going forward, there could be some irrational bids thrown in for some of our existing clients and if that happens, we're going to make money on this business, we'll make two times or three times what other card players do and we're growing five times faster. So it's a model that works and we're focused on making sure we do it profitably.","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question.","Edward J. Heffernan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Ed, I wonder if we could just dig in a little bit on sort of the puts and takes of the transition that's taking place at Conversant. Can you be a little more specific on the business that you're pruning? I assume that's the \u2013 their traditional media business and the precise rationale behind that. And then also the nature of new the business you're signing if you exit with $75 million or $80 million of annual run rate revenue from cross-sells, there's multi-year deals and what could that number be like next year if you see continued momentum?","Edward J. Heffernan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. Without getting too far into the specifics, it's pretty basic to think about our \u2013 what would be pruning for us, what are areas that aren't that exciting. The pruning areas for us would be, look, there's a chunk of that business that is a commodity and everyone has seen what has happened in ad tech over the last few years and what used to be real juicy stuff is now turning into more commodity type business especially on the agency side. That, to us is less exciting, because it brings in a whole lot of revenue, but it doesn't do anything for your bottom-line. And we're not out there looking to trade it 20 times revenue and some of that crazy stuff without earnings, we are known for generating huge cash flow. So that stuff we don't feel is sticky, we don't feel it's additive to our clients and as a result, those types of plays have been deemphasized. That being said, I think there's a lot of very exciting stuff on the agency side that will involve the use of data down to the individual level that we haven't really put into place until just now.","And so, very quickly that could be something from \u2013 going from, hey, a client says, here's $3 million, I'm having a sale this week, and let's get a bunch of eyeballs on it across devices to, hey, I'm having a sale this week and here's $3 million, let's go out and go after the folks that we know have a very strong interest in the brand, have shown a willingness to shop here before, live close to where the stores are, et cetera, et cetera. That's the type of stuff that is very, very additive from a value perspective. So that sort of both, what's being deemphasized and then where we see the emphasis coming on the agency side.","From the deal side, what you're finding is the vast, vast bulk of the wins are as you might expect and what was the \u2013 called the CRM or the old Dotomi side where the client will feed us both offline and online historical SKU level, purchase transactions, we will combine that with some Epsilon data that we have. And again, we'll go out almost on a one-to-one basis to target individuals across the web with relevant ads and offers and link them through unique ID across the three devices. With the upsurge in mobile, we want to make sure that desktop, tablet, and mobile can all be linked together. And that's pretty much what we're doing. So, think of the big growth. Think of everything at Conversant basically as the more data that we have, the more unique SKU level purchased online, offline data, the more we're going to put our shoulder into it, the more our clients like it and that's what's going to make it a differentiated model.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. And then a follow-up on BrandLoyalty, just looking at obviously, very strong first half from a profitability perspective, it looks like almost all of the EBITDA was generated in the first quarter. Is that revenue timing? Is there a fixed cost component that pulls down the second quarter margin versus where you were in the first quarter, just trying to get a sense of that and whether or not you can have \u2013 whether or not we should expect the possibility of choppy margin quarters in BrandLoyalty over time?","Bryan A. Pearson - Executive VP & President, LoyaltyOne","Andrew, it's something we've kind of talked about before, which is BL tends to have a high fixed cost structure, which we added to during the second quarter as we look to move further into Canada as well as to in the U.S. So, what happens is when we have good sales volume and drops to the bottom line, when you have a decline in revenue like what we did in Q2, it was down 7% year-over-year, a high fixed cost structure is going to hurt you. So, what you really have to do is you'll have a little choppiness there as we talked about before, but if you're hitting your revenue growth targets of 10%, 15%, 20%, you're going to see it flow through over the course of the year. But a pullback in any one quarter given a high fixed cost structure is punitive to your share earnings.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. Thanks. Appreciate it, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller with Barclays.","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks, guys. I just want to touch on this one, organic growth rate in Epsilon for one more minute just briefly. I mean I know there was a client you said pulled back. And obviously, Ford's going well. But I guess it's been a few quarters now where we've seen sort of mid-single digit growth there from the legacy organic business. Should we be looking at Epsilon now as a story where really to see that high single-digit growth rate, again it has to be really encompassing the full synergies and cross-selling from Conversant? Or is your legacy Epsilon business powerful enough by itself to still be a high single-digit grower? Just if you can help us think about that.","Edward J. Heffernan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. I mean, look, it's \u2013 we're pleased with the flow-through. We're not pleased with the top line. I do think Epsilon is a 7% to 8% top-line organic growth shop by itself. I think with Conversant now that we're getting on the upswing that will bring the whole segment up a few points. And that's really what we're looking to do. But I don't think 5% growth top-line for Epsilon is what we're shooting for. I don't think that's an acceptable long-term number.","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, all right. So it's still a 7% to 8% in your mind?","Edward J. Heffernan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yep.","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Just \u2013 all right. Shifting gears, BrandLoyalty, I know this quarter again you had a pull forward in first. I mean that's an area that does seem like with the build-out in Canada $25 million incremental revenues there and then potentially U.S., it could be a very large contributor maybe a year from now. I guess two questions. Number one is how substantial of a ramp do you think we could see for that in the new markets outside of just Europe? How's Europe going for, I guess \u2013 how's Europe going first of all, but more importantly, I mean in terms of the opportunity in the U.S. and Canada, is there something we can see in 12 months to 18 months to be really substantial? And then in terms of ownership stake of BrandLoyalty, I mean I think you were expecting that to increase per year, right? Could you just remind us on the economics around that?","Bryan A. Pearson - Executive VP & President, LoyaltyOne","I'll answer that one first, Darrin, which is, yes, we own 70% now. We'll look to take the next 10% in January of 2016 and then in 2017 and 2018, that's the way it's structured.","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thanks.","Charles L. Horn - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And on the business side, I would say that what's the nice thing about BrandLoyalty, as Ed alluded to in his comments towards the end, is that the growth is very solidly happening across the European and Asian base right now. I mean that's where the primary growth is coming from. Canada is certainly additive to it, but it's \u2013 what we're seeing is a lot of client renewing programs, a lot of new clients coming on board, companies like Lidl extending programs into other markets that they operate in. And so, I think we feel really quite confident about what we're seeing in the existing markets that they are operating in today.","And to answer the second question which is what's the horizon on the North American marketplace growing, if Canada is any indication, it will take two \u2013 a couple of years sort of starting the deal and starting the relationships with the clients. I think what happens is that, you see a pilot program or you may see an initial program run, and then what we've seen in Europe is that, the ultimate goal is to get your clients running a couple of programs a year. And so, they kind of dip their toe in the water, figure out how this works for them. They see the results, because we see that this definitively has an impact on our partner results, and then they are looking at \u2013 we're doing a program again to fix the go over issues that they'd have in the following year. And then they look at adding the second program. So it's sort of a stair step thing that happens over time. The big thing -","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","All right.","Charles L. Horn - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","...for the U.S. would be how many clients we get. So (51:08) -","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yeah. It seems like a \u2013 yeah, obviously, a much bigger opportunity in market wise, the only question is just how much competitive there is around loyalty solutions and rewards type programs in general in the U.S., but it seems like just with your pilot and what you're doing in Canada, it is a good start. So, you're not worried \u2013 just I guess the question is you're not worried about the competitive dynamics in the U.S., you still think that's something that can really be big?","Bryan A. Pearson - Executive VP & President, LoyaltyOne","Yeah. It definitely can be big and I would say that if Canada's indication what we're seeing is that they're layering this program in, in addition to the long-term loyalty initiatives. So they're replacing other promotional activity and running the short-term 16-week to 20-week promotional campaigns and if the results \u2013 so there's no reason to believe that the programs would not work equivalently well in the U.S., I think the markets...","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay.","Bryan A. Pearson - Executive VP & President, LoyaltyOne","...are similar enough. It's just about the grocers adopting it and thinking about this as a new tool in their arsenal, that's all.","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","All right. That's great, Bryan. Just \u2013 Charles, very quickly within private label, sales coming on in Q3, I think or Q4 maybe, how should we look at the portfolio yield cadence in the back half of the year. And then just for charge-offs, should we still expect flat to slightly up versus 2014 and I'll leave it at that, guys. Thanks.","Charles L. Horn - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So from a yield standpoint, I'm looking for about a point down year-over-year, that's pretty much what we thought starting the year.","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yep.","Charles L. Horn - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","From a provision standpoint, probably an ending reserve around 5.5, which should mean a loss rate of around four or five-ish for the year. It may be up 10 basis points, 20 basis points year-over-year.","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay.","Charles L. Horn - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","They'll continue to work with it. Obviously, it takes a while and we're working through that to get it done by the end of the year.","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","All right. All right, that's all unchanged. Thanks, guys. I appreciate it.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line Josh Beck with Pacific Crest.","Josh Beck - Pacific Crest Securities","Thank you. I had a question really on going back to some of these CMO conversations that you're having, you've talked about 300 plus targets more or less among your Card Services in Epsilon client base. Could you just help us maybe bring to life some of those conversations, help us understand how CMOs are viewing your differentiation relative to competitors? Obviously, there's a lot of other people knocking on the doors as well. So just help us understand kind of where you're staying now, is it your data assets? What you're doing with attribution, transparency? I'm not sure exactly what it is, but if you could just give us some color there, I think, would be very helpful.","Edward J. Heffernan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. Not a problem, Josh. I think that if you look at what we're trying to create here across \u2013 we talked about Card Services. We talked about Epsilon. I'm bugging Bryan to \u2013 who's sitting across from me \u2013 to get going on Canada and then, frankly, get going on Europe and elsewhere. But he's a little busy right now.","Anyhow, there's probably \u2013 if you look at it in terms of all the stuff that's out there swirling around in the marketplace and there's a lot of good models and everything else, we are focused very closely on sort of five things to differentiate us from the rest of the pack. The first one is as we've talked about because of our size and because of what we do for a living, we only do one thing, which is using data to engender loyalty and drive sales. And our ability to reach any CMO across the spectrum is solid. We can get in the door anywhere, get a meeting whenever we want. And so that's sort of the first step is you need to get an audience with the people who are making the decision. And that's something that was fading at Conversant and so we can offer that.","Point two is that these are existing clients, and recall again, what we do for a living, we are already sort of the trusted partner when it comes to handling their most sensitive information. And so, if you think about, they're offline and online transactional level information, they don't give that to just anyone and we're building the biggest loyalty platforms in the world. We're building these huge card programs. We're the ones collecting that information. We have a good trusted relationship. So they're not going to freak out when we say with Conversant to do targeted ad across multiple devices, hey, we're going to need a couple of years of historical online\/offline SKU level information. In a lot of cases, we have it. And in other cases, the CMO is going to be very comfortable giving it to us. That's something that the CMO would have trouble with especially when you get into some of the \u2013 a couple of the really big guys. We're viewed as sort of a neutral party.","The third thing, again, is we're not \u2013 look, we're never going to use social information to help drive our targeting. Our mousetrap is purchase level \u2013 actual purchases that are made online, offline and again that makes us a little bit different from others.","The fourth would probably be the fact that we have unique identifiers that have been able to link your desktop with your tablet with your mobile device. In this unique ID, means basically our targeting can be that much more precise and specific and we're not wasting a bunch of the client's money hitting the same person across their IDs like there's three different people.","And then finally, again, we're not software-as-a-service; we are a services company. We've got 8,000 folks in Epsilon, Conversant. And we believe that there's a huge market out there for CMOs who want all the technology that we have, all the creative that we have, but also wrap together and services so they can pick up the phone with one throat to choke. And that's a very longwinded answer, Josh. But the end of the result is there's sort of those five things that we think will make this unique. We're not going to be all things to all people, but for our 300 clients, we think it's a compelling offer.","Josh Beck - Pacific Crest Securities","Great. Yeah. That's very helpful. Certainly, a lot of moving parts to get there, but I do understand what you're saying there. I also wanted to ask on BrandLoyalty, how do you see the margins through that business at scale? Obviously, it's an earlier business and you're building it pretty substantially. So where could that go if you put your longer-term hat on? And then how should we think about seasonality kind of moving forward? Obviously, this year, we've had some moving parts between Q1 and Q2. And then I think we probably also have some moving parts around expanding that business. So maybe just help us think a little bit more about the seasonality of that business and how it evolves?","Bryan A. Pearson - Executive VP & President, LoyaltyOne","From the margin side, I think, to say it's 20% plus would probably be in the right range. I mean, we're \u2013 Ed talked about \u2013 or sorry, Charles talked about the fixed cost nature of the business. But I know that there's continuing focus there on how we grow margins over time, but I think that would be safe.","And then on the second question around seasonality, I mean, you've got to think about when grocers really want to focus on, on what happens in their business. And that's heading into the holiday seasons. And you can imagine, in the U.S., Thanksgiving will be a very large period of time and then the holidays after that with Christmas. And so, what you see is that the programs tend to skew a little bit towards the latter part of the year and then sometimes those programs run into the beginning of the following year into the first quarter. So you might get a little flop over of revenue and profits as you clean up the fall programs. And then people tend to run spring programs as well. So, it really is dependent on the clients and what the clients are trying to do in their business. We start from what the grocers are thinking about in terms of where they're looking to add sales and sort of create excitement for customers, and so that creates a little bit of the shift back and forth in terms of how you see the (59:45).","Josh Beck - Pacific Crest Securities","Q4 is usually the biggest, right?","Bryan A. Pearson - Executive VP & President, LoyaltyOne","Yeah. Q4 is usually big.","Josh Beck - Pacific Crest Securities","But -","Charles L. Horn - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","If you look at the first three quarters, what he's basically telling you, Josh, is it's not going to be a constant seasonality you can model every year.","Josh Beck - Pacific Crest Securities","Yeah.","Charles L. Horn - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","It's just going to be a little bit bumpy with Q4 being the biggest.","Josh Beck - Pacific Crest Securities","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dan Salmon with BMO Capital Markets.","Dan Salmon - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hey, guys. Good morning. Ed, when you look at the robust pipeline that you've got on the private label side, you mentioned sort of if we look \u2013 if you look back three years, you feel like it's just as strong now as it was then. How is it different? Is it maybe more tilted towards co-brand? Are there different verticals that are driving it more? But just as we think about the run rate over the next few years, we've obviously seen some new types of clients coming in there. If you could just give us a little bit color on sort of how you see that growing and executing against that sort of robust sort of growth numbers that you've talked about?","Edward J. Heffernan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. It's a fair question. Some of it again will be self-imposed on our end, which is I do think that, you know, our \u2013 the co-brand side of it, we're going to be a bit more cautious on because the co-brand stuff tends to attract some of the other players in the marketplace who are looking to make it sort of the number one card in the wallet, which is not necessarily what we're after from our clients' perspective. They just want to make sure it's number one when you're shopping at their store. And so I would expect that you would continue to see the vast, vast majority of our announcements to be private label as opposed to co-brand, which is really our basics.","The co-brand stuff for the most part, if you looked over the portfolio, has either been in T&E, which is sort of unique to the T&E space or more specifically, they're co-brands that have been \u2013 that the clients have said, all right, I have a private label, maybe I can get even more penetration with the co-brand. So a lot of our stuff are dual card programs. And that's where I see some of our growth on the co-brand side going forward, which is an existing client, he says, hey, can I get another 10 points of tender share if I offer a general purpose card. So we're looking \u2013 we're pretty attracted to that stuff. But for the most part, private label, probably 75% of our stuff will be private label. The portfolio we'd like to keep it 75%-25%. We think that's a good mix on a long-term basis. In terms of where the deals are coming from, again, whether depending on how you cut it in our sort of little sandbox, we've talked about 350 or so type clients that we think would be a good fit. And of those, there's only still about 150 who have a program, so we still got \u2013 we're not even half penetrated at this point. It's just a lot of folks who are turning off the general spend marketing and moving over to the measurable data driven targeted marketing. So, it's a reallocation of their budget dollars, and we're just seeing it in waves today that started three years ago. You cover the space which goes on.","Dan Salmon - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay, great. Thanks, guys.","Edward J. Heffernan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. We'll take one more.","Charles L. Horn - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","We'd already cut it off.","Edward J. Heffernan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","That's it?","Charles L. Horn - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah.","Edward J. Heffernan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. Thank you for all your time. And we'll see next go around. Bye now.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect."]}}
