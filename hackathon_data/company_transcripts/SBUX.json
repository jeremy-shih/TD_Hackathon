All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session.","Thank you. Mr. Shaw, you may begin your conference.","Tom Shaw - Starbucks Corp.","Thanks, Julie, and good afternoon, everyone. This is Tom Shaw, Vice President, Investor Relations at Starbucks Corporation. Thank you for joining us today to discuss our second quarter 2017 results, which will be led by Kevin Johnson, President and CEO; Belinda Wong, EVP and CEO, Starbucks China; Scott Maw, CFO; and Howard Schultz, Executive Chairman. Joining us for Q&A are John Culver, Group President, Global Retail; Matt Ryan, Global Chief Strategy Officer; Adam Brotman, EVP of Global Retail Ops; Kris Engskov, EVP, President of U.S. Retail; and Tony Matta, President, Channel Development.","This conference call will include forward-looking statements, which are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements. Any such statements should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements in our earnings release and risk factors \u2013 risk factor discussions in our filings with the SEC, including our last annual report on Form 10-K.

This conference call is being webcast, and an archive of the webcast will be available on our website.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Kevin Johnson. Kevin?","Kevin R. Johnson - Starbucks Corp.","Thank you, Tom. Welcome, everyone. Before getting into Starbucks' Q2 results, I thought I'd comment on a recent Wall Street Journal article noting that more retail stores have closed in the first quarter of calendar year 2017 than closed in all of 2016. And that more retail stores are expected to close in the U.S. this year than closed in any year during the Great Recession that began in 2008. The article illuminated once again the seismic shift in consumer behavior underway and the devastating impact that this sea change in behavior is having on many traditional brick and mortar retailers. Articles like this prompt three very important questions that I've repeatedly asked myself over the years and that I suppose many of you on today's call have asked as well.","What are the critical, transformative components required to propel a brick and mortar retailer into the future? How do these transformative components relate to Starbucks? And what are the proof points? It is against this backdrop that I decided to open my first earnings call as Starbucks' CEO by sharing my perspective on what it's going to take for a brick and mortar retailer to survive in the future, and to explain how in the face of tremendous retail headwinds and cross currents underway, Starbucks continues to produce record financial and operating results quarter after quarter, and open a new class of over 2,000 stores around the world every year that continue to outperform both the immediate prior class and the industry overall, and deliver record AUVs and profit.","Now, Howard understands this intuitively, our senior leadership team has been intimately engaged in the topic. As a company, we have a clear perspective on the answers. The critical transformative components required for any brick and mortar retailer to survive, let alone succeed in the future are an engaging, digital and mobile relationship with customers that is threaded into a branded, immersive, experiential retail destination.","The attributes of the destination will vary. They may include theater, intrigue, or romance. But the common denominator will be the creation of a consumer experience that evokes human emotion and connection. I firmly believe that these are the ingredients that will determine which brick and mortar retailers thrive in the future, and which become victims of the current trend.","The analogy from my years in the tech industry is how companies respond when a new disruptive technology, like cloud computing, for example, emerges. Those who recognize the disruption think long term and innovate for the future are the big winners. Those who don't, struggle. The retail industry is going through a period of similar profound disruption right before our eyes. These critical components are at the very core of Starbucks' business and investment strategies. To be sure, many of our investments will yield near term returns; others, longer term returns, but in all cases, they will further solidify Starbucks foundation as we build for future. Starbucks Coffee Company is playing the long game, and we are playing to win globally.","Let me now share with you the evidence of our success in Q2 and why we are so optimistic about the second half of fiscal 2017. I'll start with four important and very encouraging headlines of today's call. U.S. comp sales accelerated through the quarter, culminating with a 4% comp in March. U.S. comps are further accelerating into April. Our newest class of retail stores continue to perform at record levels. And our business in China posted accelerating 7% comp sales growth, including 6% transaction growth.","Accelerating comps and strong positive trends in our two largest markets sets up the narrative for FY 2017 as being the year of two halves. We're quite confident that we've turned the corner on U.S. comps, and that given the strength we are seeing in our U.S. business going into the second half and the beverage, food and digital innovation we will be rolling out over the next two quarters, that we will deliver on our mid-single digit comp target for the full year, despite the soft start in the first half. I want to be very transparent with you on our priorities, and explain how they relate to the two most important things for the future, digital relationships with customers, and branded experiential retail that are customer destinations.","Our five priorities are focused on near term, as well as long-term growth. They include: One, continuing to accelerate comp sales and transaction growth in the U.S. Two, driving breakthroughs in food for the lunch day-part. Three, enabling long-term growth in China. Four, extending our digital flywheel assets; and five, elevating through the Starbucks Reserve brand. Each of these are powerful drivers of value creation that will once again provide us with outsized current returns while strengthening our business and positioning us to deliver sustained, profitable growth in the future.","Let me start with an overview of our efforts to accelerate U.S. comp sales. We have several initiatives supporting this objective underway, including food and beverage innovation, strengthening and leveraging our digital and marketing capabilities, operational improvements, and improved in-store execution. You will recall that in Q1, we highlighted that 1,200 of our busiest U.S. company operated stores were experiencing 20% or more of their peak transactions coming from Mobile Order & Pay.","The rapid adoption of Mobile Order & Pay and resulting demand increase was causing throughput challenges at peak in these stores. By the end of Q2, approximately 1,800 of our U.S. company operated stores were experiencing 20% or more of peak transactions from Mobile Order & Pay. Steps we have taken since the beginning of the calendar year to increase throughput have enabled to us to better and more efficiently handle increased demand from both Mobile Order & Pay and non-Mobile Order & Pay customers at peak. And we saw measurable progress in peak transaction throughput in Q2, as compared to Q1, in these busiest stores.","As we enter Q3, Mobile Order & Pay continues to be a powerful driver of comp, revenue, and attach. And we are maintaining sharp focus on further increasing throughput. Our action plan includes three ways to unlock growth in all day-parts, and particularly at peak.","Wave one actions have largely been completed and included additional training and reallocation of partner roles to Mobile Order & Pay during peak, testing of additional labor at peak in select stores, implementation of new approaches to order consolidation at the hand-off plane, and new tools and processes to support beverage and food production. These actions alone enabled quantifiable increases in both March and April, and improved the customer experience as evidenced by recent customer service scores.","Wave two actions are now underway and involve the introduction of a new Digital Order Manager, or DOM. And the selective addition of labor in our busiest stores at peak based on the results of the wave one test. The DOM shows up as a tablet-based device that provides baristas with visibility on all incoming orders and enables better tracking and real-time order production management.","It also enables a digital notification to a customer's mobile app when their order is ready, improving many dimensions of the customer experience, both in the app and in the store, while reducing congestion at the hand-off plane. We will be deploying DOM technology to our highest volume stores this quarter. But the DOM does more. As we deployed this high value, low cost technology across our store portfolio, we will create an extremely valuable source of new data insight around operations and customer experience. Data that will enable us to further optimize store operations, increase throughput, and elevate our customer experience.","Wave three actions are being integrated into our existing store development and renovation approach. We are sharpening our focus on the selection and addition of in-store equipment and pursuing improvements in overall store layout and design, all with the goal of delivering a great customer experience and further increasing throughput. The actions we have taken to improve throughput are contributing to the acceleration we are seeing in sequential monthly U.S. comp sales now squarely back in the mid-single digit range.","Looking to the future, this is all about how our digital relationships with customers intersect with experiential retail in our stores. We are confident that we're well on our way to further increasing overall store capacity while delivering enhanced Starbucks experience to our customers.","Moving on to food. At our Investor Day in December, we highlighted the importance of food to our strategic growth agenda and are focused on driving breakthroughs in food for the lunch day-part. In many ways, this is about elevating experiential retail in Starbucks by providing a new customer offering in a relevant day-part and doing it well.","Let me put the size of the Starbucks lunch opportunity into perspective for you. You may recall that we first began delivering significant growth in our food program several years ago when we up-leveled the quality and appeal of our bakery case with particular emphasis around breakfast sandwich innovation following the acquisition of La Boulange. Our strategic focus on the bakery case and breakfast sandwiches has paid off and is contributing to sales.","In fact, in Q2, food represented 21% of our U.S. revenue and contributed 2 points of comp. We have demonstrated that by focusing on a specific day-part, we can create new customer occasions that add to the branded experience and become long-term drivers of growth. That is precisely what we are doing by up-leveling our lunch offering with the new fresh food concept we call Mercado.","We launched Mercado in over 100 Starbucks stores in Chicago earlier this month. And though still in the early days, we are extremely encouraged by the customer response to Mercado. So much so that we are accelerating plans to deploy Mercado to a second market over the next two quarters. We view Mercado as an opportunity to provide our customers with a fresh, healthy and delicious lunch menu that we believe has the potential to drive increased traffic and attach, and ultimately help us achieve our long-term goal of 1 points to 2 points of U.S. comp growth from food once deployed across a significant portion of the Starbucks platform.","We are very excited about our strategy and the opportunity to enable long-term growth in China, a country we first entered 18 years ago. Our business in China has never been stronger, nor have our aspirations ever been greater. We continue to open a new store in China roughly every 15 hours, a rate of new store growth that is likely to continue for decades to come.","Increasing customer engagement and accelerating strength in Starbucks business in China once again demonstrates the global power of the Starbucks brand. Given the strength of our China business and the size of the opportunity, I've invited Belinda Wong, CEO of Starbucks China to join us on today's call from Shanghai to share insights into how we are continuing to drive our business in this very important growth market.","Belinda, thank you for getting up so early, and welcome.","Belinda Wong - Starbucks China","Thank you. Thank you, Kevin. Good afternoon, everyone. I'm very pleased to report that partner and customer enthusiasm for the Starbucks brand and the momentum in Starbucks China business have never been greater. Comps in Q2 accelerated to 7%, driven by a 6% increase in transactions. We saw growth in all categories and day-parts. Beverage, food and digital innovation are laser-focused on operational excellence, and targeted brand investments are attracting new customers into our stores and bringing existing customers in more often.","Last December, we launched a strategic partnership with Tencent, including offering Tencent's popular WeChat Pay as a digital payment option in all of our stores. In its first quarter, WeChat Pay has already reached a remarkable 29% of tender, and has elevated the Starbucks experience for both customers and partners through its convenience and fast transaction speed.","Following on that success in February this year, we've launched social gifting to unprecedented customer demand, partner excitement and social media interest. In only the first seven weeks after launch, over 1.2 million gifts were sent and over half have been redeemed by recipients in our stores. Our innovative new social gifting platform, we call it Say it with Starbucks, is not only encouraging everyday simple acts of kindness and connection, it is also bringing new customers into our stores to trial and enjoy the Starbucks experience. This is a great opportunity to further build new and authentic customer connections. We're only in the very early stages of social gifting in China and the growth opportunity ahead is enormous.","We opened five new cities in Q2 and entered Q3 with 2,628 stores across 127 cities. Once again, our newest class of stores are delivering record transactions, AUVs and profits. We're also creating new Starbucks locations beyond our retail stores. In Q1, we launched Bottled Frappuccino, a new ready-to-drink beverage tailor-made to local customer taste preferences, and it is already available through more than 30,000 points of distribution. Since launch, we've tripled our RTD business and added 5 points of market share compared to Q2 last year. And we have many exciting new CPG products in the pipeline, including a delicious tea-based Frappuccino.","Howard experienced Starbucks' accelerating momentum in China firsthand on a milestone trip he made to Beijing two weeks ago when we also held our fifth Annual Meeting of partners and families. At the meeting, we respectfully announced a new breakthrough partner benefit, critical illness insurance to parents of our partners, a benefit that is giving great joy to our partners and over 10,000 of their parents. I am so proud that we're setting a new precedent in China by helping our partners better take care of their aging parents. Our partners are our family, and it is important for us to also take care of our extended family. This is deeply rooted in our Chinese culture and values. We will continue to invest in our people and are committed to remaining one of the most admired brands and an employer of choice in China.","Starbucks is building a different kind of company in China, a truly one-of-a-kind company, and we're doing it one cup at a time. And with the opening of our Shanghai Roastery in December, we will further elevate the brand and introduce our Shanghai customers and visitors from all across China and Asia-Pacific to an immersive ultra-premium coffee-forward experience currently available only one other place in the world \u2013 Seattle.","We will continue to put our customers and partners at the heart of everything we do and to share our success. By doing so, we will continue to grow and to win, and to win with partners' pride in China now and in the future. Thank you.","Now I'll pass the call back to Kevin. Kevin?","Kevin R. Johnson - Starbucks Corp.","Thank you, Belinda. As you can see, extending the digital flywheel is a powerful asset that is driving deep customer engagement and growth around the world. And we are very pleased with the results our digital flywheel made to our business in Q2. This is one of the two critical transformative elements for brick-and-mortar retailers of the future. A year ago, we made the strategic decision to transform our rewards program from a frequency-based to a spend-based program. Following this transition, we have seen solid growth in customer membership.","We entered Q3 with 13.3 million active Starbucks Reward members in the U.S., up 11% year-on-year, and with 36% of total tender coming from Starbucks Rewards members. If you include sales from unregistered gift cards, a meaningful 44% of all transactions in the quarter were prepaid on our proprietary Starbucks payment platform.","The program change positioned us well for investments in the next wave of priorities. One to one personalization, the ability for customers to earn stars outside of Starbucks stores, and additional social gifting partnerships around the world modeled after our phenomenally successful partnership with Tencent. The personalized Star Dashes and suggested selling are examples of how we are using personalization to provide a relevant customer experience and to increase engagement.","Starbucks rewards spend per member accelerated through the quarter as both average transaction frequency and average ticket size grew for active members. This past quarter, we saw 8% growth, the highest growth rate in average spend per active rewards member over a prior year ever, reflecting both increased ticket and transaction frequency. We have line of sight to additional digital features that will drive sales growth in the quarters and years ahead, and you will see us continue to invest to extend our digit reach to more customers in new ways that are accretive to the Starbucks brand experience and that leverage our over 26,000 stores around the world.","Finally, we are investing to elevate both our brand and our customer experience around coffee through our roasteries and the Starbucks Reserve brand. Starbucks Reserve is at the center of our innovation strategy around branded, experiential retail customer destinations. Complementing our first roastery in Seattle are additional roasteries now under construction in Shanghai, New York, Milan, and Tokyo. And a sixth in Chicago, announced only yesterday, will be underway soon.","We continue to extend and solidify our global leadership around all things coffee. Our investment in roasteries and Reserve stores not only enable a world-class, ultra-premium, coffee-forward experience in flagship locations around the globe, it also establishes a core innovation center second to none that will feed innovation throughout our global fleet of Starbucks stores.","As I said earlier, the retail industry is going through a period of disruption right before our eyes. We believe in the two transformative elements that will continue to propel Starbucks into the future, and we are allocating resources thoughtfully. As our second half U.S. comps and revenue growth accelerate, there are two priorities that will require modest increase in investment. First, we continue to see a rapid and significant return on investment by accelerating features of our digital flywheel.","We have a strong roadmap of features to drive top-line growth, and accelerating those features will require incremental investment in second half. These are the right investments for our business and they will provide outsized returns. Second, we are investing against our long-term strategy to elevate the Starbucks brand through the design, construction, and introduction of five additional iconic ultra-premium Roasteries.","As Belinda noted, our second Roastery in Shanghai will be opening later this year complimented by Starbucks Reserve stores around the world and the introduction of food inside Roasteries and Reserve stores through our partnership with Italian artisanal baker, Princi. Each of these is a smart, strategic investment that will pay dividends long into the future. (24:57)","Finally, while the Teavana brand continues to be highly accretive to our tea business in Starbucks stores and is now being further leveraged with the introduction of Teavana branded ready-to-drink tea sold into CPG channels, many of our mall-based Teavana stores are continuing to have a negative impact on our overall result. We have launched a review process and intend to take clear action to improve the performance of our Teavana mall store portfolio.","When you put all of this together, we remain focused on the critical transformative elements that will propel Starbucks into the future while maintaining a sharp focus on near-term value creation for our shareholders. These priorities are linked directly to the strategy we presented at the December Investor Day, and I believe will prove to be drivers of meaningful increases in shareholder value, both near and long term.","Following Scott's comments on the financials, I've asked Howard to share a few thoughts before we transition to Q&A. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Scott. Scott?","Scott Harlan Maw - Starbucks Corp.","Thank you, Kevin, and good afternoon, everyone. As Kevin shared, Starbucks once again posted record quarterly revenues, operating income and EPS in Q2. Our business accelerated through the quarter and with the momentum we are seeing and the beverage, food and digital innovation we will be introducing, we are confident in the further acceleration through the second half of the year. Now at the midpoint of our fiscal year, we are better able to assess how our year-to-date performance, our investment plans, and overall macro factors will impact our full year expectations.","Before getting into our fiscal 2017 outlook, I'd like to provide color on our second quarter performance. Consolidated revenues in the second quarter grew 6% to $5.3 billion. The largest contributor to revenue growth came from the 2,240 net new stores we opened over the past 12 months followed by 3% global comp growth, comprised of a 4% increase in average ticket and a 1% decline in traffic that after a 1% adjustment for transaction splitting, nets to flat traffic.","Consolidated operating income in Q2 increased 8% year-over-year to $935 million, despite two points of impact resulting from recording certain prior period revenue adjustments in our channel development segment and one point of negative impact from foreign currency translation. Consolidated operating margin totaled 17.7% in Q2 on a GAAP basis and 17.9% on a non-GAAP basis, up 30 basis points year-over-year.","Margin improvement in Q2 was driven primarily by sales leverage, partially offset by higher partner investments in the Americas. Both GAAP and non-GAAP EPS in Q2 grew 15% over prior year to $0.45 per share. Both measures are inclusive of a favorable $40 million impact in other income related to a gain on the sale of our investment in Square, Inc., our previous payment processor. Noteworthy is that the below the line gain on Square was largely offset by the $21 million impact of certain out-of-period accounting adjustments in channel development, as well as asset impairments related to our Teavana mall stores. I will discuss both of these items further in a few minutes.","I'll now take you through our Q2 operating performance by segment. America's revenue in Q2 grew 8% year-over-year to $3.7 billion, driven primarily by 952 net new store openings over the past 12 months and 3% comp growth. America's delivered strong operating income of $826 million in Q2. Operating margin declined 130 basis points in the quarter to 22.2%, primarily due to increased investments in our U.S. store partners and higher cost of goods sold resulting from very strong food sales partially offset by sales leverage. Expanding a bit on food, we saw two points of comp from food in Q2, the most in four quarters driven entirely by attach. In fact, food attach in Q2 was the highest since we rolled out La Boulange three years ago. We saw continued momentum in our morning bakery and breakfast sandwich platforms, and strong positive customer response to our recently introduced Sous Vide egg bites.","There were several contributors to the additional one point of Americas comp in Q2, the largest being continued success of our iced beverage platform with double digit growth across each of our espresso, coffee, Teavana tea, and Starbucks refreshers. And we are launching Frappuccino happy hour next week, with far more operational focus compared to last year, new beverage offerings, and the significant tailwind and customer excitement provided by the incredible Instagrammable success of last week's Unicorn Frappuccino. As we moved into summer, we will be launching revamped Easter boxes with an increased focus on protein and new Teavana iced teas.","Let's move on to China\/Asia-Pacific. Our CAP segment once again delivered a very strong quarter in Q2, with revenues up 13% over prior year to $769 million, driven by incremental revenues from over 1,000 net new store openings over the past 12 months and 3% comp sales growth. In addition to the accelerating momentum and continued strong performance from China that Belinda highlighted, Japan also delivered a very solid quarter, despite the adverse timing impact of a large annual New Year promotion that benefited Q1 rather than Q2 this year.","Adjusted for this timing, CAP comps would have been a positive 4%. We're very pleased with our new store performance in CAP, and are seeing accelerating sales of Teavana branded teas in Starbucks stores across the region. Teavana is now available in all CAP markets with both Japan and China recording an over 40% increase in tea sales. Noteworthy is that we are creating momentum in our food program in Japan, aided by the success of recently launched pudding products and scones.","Elsewhere in CAP, our licensed joint venture markets including East China and South Korea continue to make meaningful contributions to CAP's strong performance in Q2 as evidenced by a 35% increase in income from joint ventures. CAP's operating income on a GAAP basis grew a strong 36% over prior year to $176 million, with 380 basis points of margin expansion to 22.9%, the segment's highest Q2 margin since we made the Japan acquisition three years ago. On a non-GAAP basis, CAP's operating income increased by 33% to $190 million and operating margin expanded by 370 basis points to 24.7%. Contributing to CAP's margin expansion was the transition to a value-added tax structure in China and sales leverage.","Let's turn to EMEA. Our strategy of repositioning our EMEA portfolio to a predominantly licensed model continues to drive margin expansion in the segment to a quarterly record of 12% in Q2, a 170 basis point increase over prior year. Of EMEA's nearly 2,800 total store count at the end of Q2, 82% were licensed up from 72% in the prior year.","Total revenue in EMEA were $232 million in Q2, a 14% decline versus prior year. However, when normalized for the 20% impact of the transfer of our Germany business to a licensed partner, other portfolio shifts and foreign exchange, EMEA revenue grew 6%, driven by incremental revenues from over 300 net new stores added in the last 12 months. While reported comps in EMEA declined by 1% in Q2, overall system comps increased by 3%. Our system sales and adjusted revenue figures reflect the strength of the Starbucks brand in a region that continues to be significantly challenged and adversely impacted by economic and geopolitical uncertainty.","Let's turn to channel development. As previously noted, we expected seasonality, particularly given the timing of the Easter holiday, to negatively impact Q2 revenue growth in our channel development segment. However, we also recorded an unfavorable revenue and operating income adjustment in Q2, primarily related to certain revenue deductions from prior quarters. This one-time adjustment impacted Q2 revenues by approximately $21 million and operating income by a similar amount, and was the principle reason behind flat segment revenue growth for the period. Excluding the adjustment, channel development revenue growth was approximately 5% and was in line with our expectations. Despite the adjustment, our domestic channel development business remains very strong and we gained approximate one point of market share in each of the K-Cup and Roast and Ground categories for the seventh consecutive quarter. We grew our K-Cup business by 4% during Q2, compared to zero growth for the K-Cup category overall, and now have an approximate 16% share of K-Cups.","Within ready-to-drink our NACP partnership also gained share driven by our core Doubleshot and Frappuccino beverages. We began shipping Teavana ready-to-drink teas through our partnership with Anheuser-Busch InBev in February, with all four flavors already ranking in the top ten in the premium single serve ready-to-drink tea category in our active markets.","On the international front we continue to grow our distribution of Starbucks Nespresso compatible capsules in the UK and France. Since launching the Nespresso compatible program last September, we have already shipped over 20 million units. In the UK, we have achieved 14% share and a number three market position. Channel development's operating income grew 6% in Q2 to $194 million and the segment delivered a 250 basis point improvement in operating margin to 42%.","I'm going to spend a few minutes discussing our Teavana results and in particular the mall stores which are a major component of our all other segment. We currently operate approximately 350 Teavana mall stores and as Kevin mentioned over the last several years many mall based retailers have been adversely impacted by reduced foot traffic, resulting from the accelerating shift of consumer behavior away from brick and mortar retail and changes in consumer retail activity overall. Because Starbucks is a customer destination, profitability in our Starbucks mall store has largely been unaffected. But our Teavana mall stores have not been immune with many reporting negative comps and operating losses for some time.","Since acquisition we've invested in new store designs and improved merchandising, but the rate of the decline coming through last holiday and into Q2 is worse than we had forecast and we are expecting further declines at a number of at-risk Teavana mall stores. Since the Teavana acquisition, we have recorded impairment charges and closed mall stores from time to time, but given these recent performance challenges, we recorded a larger impairment charge in Q2 related to certain of these assets.","This impairment charge was the primary driver of the 12% increase in the all-other segments store operating expenses. We are currently evaluating strategic options for the at-risk portion of the Teavana mall store portfolio and will update you over the coming quarters as we set our course of action. It is important to note that we do have a meaningful subset of profitable Teavana mall stores.","As a reminder, strategic reviews are not a new practice for us, and typically result in a stronger portfolio and increased profits in the long term as most recently evidenced by significantly improved performance in our EMEA portfolio. Our Teavana branded teas and handcrafted beverages in core Starbucks stores continue to outperform, and we continue to expect the Teavana tea platform \u2013 expand the Teavana tea platform through product innovation and new product offerings all around the world.","Globally, in Q2, Teavana sales in Starbucks stores grew by almost 10% with even stronger performance in traditional tea drinking markets like China and Japan. Also, tea has driven a point of comp in the U.S. in virtually every quarter since we launched the brand in our Starbucks stores about three years ago. That's the investment case for Teavana, and the Teavana business remains very much intact.","Let's move on to our 2017 targets and how we expect to finish the year. First, I want to reiterate that we expect stronger revenue growth in the second half, driven by mid-single digit comps including accelerating comps in our U.S. business. Revenue growth for the full year will be 8% to 10%, excluding approximately 2 points for the extra week in 2016 and 1 point for FX. But given performance in the first two quarters of the year, we are likely to be at the lower end of that range for the full year. We expect the back half of the year to be near the upper end of this range.","EPS guidance is revised as follows. Full-year GAAP EPS in the range of $2.06 to $2.10 and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $2.08 to $2.12. Third quarter GAAP EPS will be in the range of $0.54 to $0.55 and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.55 to $0.56. This implies a broader range in the fourth quarter, with GAAP EPS of $0.56 to $0.59 and non-GAAP EPS of $0.57 to $0.60.","I want to take a moment to explain both the change in total annual guidance and the wider Q4 range, and there are two main factors behind the changes. First, we see the opportunity to accelerate certain investments as we move through the balance of 2017. These investments are mainly in our Roastery Reserve and Princi businesses, including the ramping of our Roastery openings and increasing our spend related to digital opportunities, including in-store digital and investments related to personalization and Starbucks Rewards. Both of these areas are critical to sustaining growth over the long term.","We now expect investments in 2017 for partner and digital to be over $250 million, accelerating as we enter the back half of the year and higher than our previous estimates. Second, as I mentioned earlier, underperforming Teavana mall stores will have a larger impact on earnings growth than we had originally forecast. I would further underscore that both ends of this EPS guidance range should be considered in your models. While we are confident regarding the second half top-line momentum, we will continue considering investing in opportunities that we believe will better position us to fully optimize our business and drive long-term shareholder value.","For consolidated operating margin, we still expect a slight improvement on a 52-week basis compared to fiscal 2016. As promised last quarter, we want to separately discuss our core and innovation G&A growth. As a reminder, we have set our long-term target to grow total G&A below the rate of revenue growth and core G&A at half the rate of revenue growth. I'm pleased to announce that we achieved both objectives during Q2, and are on track to achieve this for the full year.","Specifically, G&A as reported declined by 1%, but after adjusting for certain current and prior-year anomalies of approximately 6%, total G&A grew by about 5%. Core G&A, which comprises over 80% of the total was roughly flat, whilst innovation G&A increased significantly on an absolute percentage basis. Innovation G&A is comprised mainly of product R&D, digital innovation and certain costs related to Reserve, Roastery and Princi. We remain committed to managing the core growth rate while investing for the near and long term.","For segment operating margins in fiscal 2017, we now expect Americas operating margin to be slightly lower year-over-year, CAP operating margins to show moderate expansion despite the negative impact of FX, EMEA operating margins to approach 15% for the full year and channel development to post strong operating margin improvement, with second half gains moderating from the strong first half performance.","Looking at commodities and FX, our coffee needs for 2017 are almost fully price locked, and we expect commodities will be slightly unfavorable in the back half of the year. We also continue to expect an increased negative net impact from foreign exchange for the year, with revenue growth expected to be negatively impacted by about 1%, and earnings per share negatively impacted by 1 point to 2 points. The impact of FX will accelerate as we move into the last half of 2017. All other targets for fiscal year 2017 will remain the same.","We remain confident in our strategy and the areas of investments that will drive our future financial results in the second half of 2017 and beyond. Our store partners around the globe continue to go above and beyond to deliver the Starbucks experience for our customers every day. And the performance from our two major markets, in particular, U.S. and China, each reflect and justify the increased investments we will make over the near term.","Howard?","Howard S. Schultz - Starbucks Corp.","Scott, thank you. Kevin, congratulations on your first call. I think you did really well. And, Belinda, coming from China in the middle of the night, I could not be more proud of you. And the story you told really came through in terms of the success and the bright future we have in China.","My role on today's call and on all calls going forward is obviously different than in years past, with Kevin and the team leading the call. So my role today is really to be the unscripted closer to summarize what's been said, and I thought I'd do that through the lens of trying to put myself in your shoes, and that is the shoes of an investor. What did you hear today? What did I hear and what's my conclusion?","I think there's a short-term issue and a long-term story. The short-term issue is, clearly in the first half of the year, we had compression and headwinds on comps and revenue. And as Scott and Kevin have covered, we feel very confident that we're going to see a significant change in both comps in the mid-single digits and revenue returning to historic levels in the second half of the year.","You also heard from Belinda the success that we're enjoying in China. And unless you've seen it firsthand, you can't imagine the footprint we have in China, the opportunity we have and the growth and development of that market. And as I've said in the past and just having been there two weeks ago, there's no doubt in my mind that China is going to be bigger, stronger and more robust than any market in the world over time, including the U.S.","Over the long term, you have to ask yourself a bigger question. And that is, given the seismic change in consumer behavior and how disruptive online shopping and mobile shopping has been to traditional bricks-and-mortar businesses and companies, who's going to survive and who's going to win? So I think there's two bifurcating questions. One in the short term, one in the long. The short-term question is, in terms of Starbucks U.S. business and comp growth, is the bloom off the rose? Is the glass half empty or half full?","Now, I've been here almost 40 years. I've seen many cyclical changes in our core business. And I can tell you sitting here today, I have never been more confident that the comp growth that we have seen in the first half of the year, over time, beginning in the second half of the year and beyond, will be a distant memory. The pipeline for innovation, both in terms of product development, digital development, mobile development, and if you just look at what happened in the last two weeks, was something that was really probably the most stunning example of our understanding of digital and social media and Instagram, what happened with Unicorn, drove significant traffic, incrementality, awareness, brand affinity. And just stay tuned, because we have a lot more coming.","So in the short term, the bifurcating question for you is, do you believe that U.S. comps are going to return and Starbucks' U.S. business is going to be as robust as it has been in the past? And I can tell you sitting here today, there's no doubt in my mind that the answer to that question is yes.","Over the long term, I can tell you, as I've told you in the years past, that we anticipated and we saw very early on that there was going to be a very, very significant disruptive and almost cataclysmic change in the landscape of physical retailers. The number of store closures, consolidations, we're in the nascent stage of that. And there are going to be many, many losers. And the bifurcating question is, is Starbucks Coffee Company going to be one of the winners? What is it going to take to win? And, Kevin, I think, articulated that very clearly.","One, every retailer that is going to win in this new environment must become an experiential destination. Your products and services for the most part cannot be available online and cannot be available on Amazon. In addition to that, what evidence do we have? Well, we're opening 2,000 stores a year. And here is another year at a time when there's so much pressure in the operating environment and we have another year, another consecutive year, of demonstrating best-of-class new performance in our U.S. stores. To me, personally, that is better evidence of the health and strength of the brand, unit economics and the relevancy of Starbucks stores in our existing comp number.","In addition to that, you have to believe that in order to win and win big, domestically and globally in this new environment, that a company's capability and competency as a four-wall bricks and mortar retailer must be as good digitally and on mobile in all things that make the brand as relevant outside of the store and on a mobile device as it is inside the four walls of the store. We had a leadership position in our loyalty program in mobile payment, in Mobile Order & Pay, and I can tell you given what is in the pipeline in terms of the investments we're going to make over the long term and our ability to toggle back and forth between the physical and the digital world is only going to make our four wall retail business stronger in the future.","So that the net result and the answer to these questions that I strongly believe, if I was an investor, if I was a shareholder, if I was analyzing Starbucks is, yes, we've had a tough first half of the year. We've got issues with Teavana, but that basically are diminutives when you look at the size and scale of Starbucks revenue and earnings power. We have the largest most important market in the world where we are already the leader with 2,600 stores and one opening up every day and our brand affinity second to none, and that's China. We have a national and global footprint now of over 26,000 stores, 90 million customers a week and still recognized as one of the most respected and recognized brands in the world.","Starbucks Coffee Company is built to last. Starbucks Coffee Company is built to build a great and enduring company. And there's no question in our mind as we sit as a management team and as we address you today on the heels of a tough first half that our best days are in front of us. And for those of you who have covered the company for many, many years, who know me personally, I would not be here banging on the table and telling you how strongly I feel about the growth, development, and what we have in store in terms of the innovation of the company, both inside the four walls of our store, the building of the Reserve brand, the unbelievable experience, the roasteries, what's going to happen in all these cities.","And one thing about the roastery that I should point out is that as strong as the roastery has been in Seattle, 20% comps, being profitable, it's not a city in which we can have the global halo that New York, Shanghai, Tokyo, Milan and Chicago will have when those roasteries open. It's a roastery that basically is catering to mostly local Seattle people and West Coast tourists. Wait till these roasteries open in these other markets. It's going to change the company.","So net-net, those two bifurcating questions is Starbucks U.S. comps half empty or half full? Let me tell you, they're half full, not half empty. On the bifurcating question is Starbucks going to be one of those companies that is going to navigate through the unbelievable challenges that the bricks and mortar physical retailers are going to have, the question is undeniably, yes. We are going to be that company that is going to be the winner.","So with that, that's my unscripted summary of how strongly I feel about the growth and development of the company, the leadership team, Kevin as our new CEO, and I thought again we told a great story today, especially Belinda in the middle of the night from China.","So with that, I'll just turn it back to Kevin or the operator for Q&A.","Kevin R. Johnson - Starbucks Corp.","Yes, we'll go ahead and open it up for questions, operator. Thank you, Howard.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Sara Senatore from Bernstein. Sara, your line is now open.","Sara Harkavy Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you very much. Yes, Scott, I would just like to ask about the earnings algorithm going forward, just in the sense, that at the analyst Investor Day four months or five months ago, there was a reiteration of that long-term growth. This year, obviously now expectation is lower because of investments. Does that mean that if we think about it longer term, that we should sort of rethink that earnings algorithm in terms of I think the double digit revenue growth, 15% to 20% EPS growth?","And I guess on a related question, we've seen other companies, maybe use their balance sheet more aggressively. Again is that something that you contemplate doing in terms of just, again, going forward, thinking about the puts and takes, the top line, maybe a step up in just the normalized rate of investments? And then what margin for error your balance sheet offers? Thank you.","Scott Harlan Maw - Starbucks Corp.","Thanks for the question, Sara. I think, the first thing I'll say is we are still reiterating our long-term guidance of 10% on the top line and 15% to 20% on the bottom line. To your point, we understand why the question is being asked and it's being asked a lot more frequently by the street given what's happened in the last two quarters where we haven't quite gotten to the low end of our revenue guidance. But I think as you look at the back half of the year and acceleration back up to 10% revenue growth, we remain confident in that being the fuel for 15% to 20% earnings guidance.","And I think I'd also talk about every year as we set our long-term guidance, we go through our strategic planning process in the spring and we look at all of the drivers on the top line, all the things around innovation for product and digital, all the things we can do in the middle of the P&L to drive sales leverage, and cost of goods sold savings and G&A. We've been increasingly using the balance sheet and I'll come back to that to help a bit with earnings growth as well. And we ask ourselves, can we reiterate those long-term targets? And we're at the beginning of that process.","Again, this spring, we'll go through it with our board over the next few weeks. If in that process we decide that the long-term growth targets have to be adjusted, then we'll come to you, we'll explain it to you, and we'll talk about why we're changing things. But as we sit today, we remain confident give than acceleration that we'll see those long-term goals still come into line.","As it relates to the balance sheet, we have over the last three years taken long-term debt up pretty significantly. I think, we had $750 million a few years ago. We're up close to $4 billion now. And as you know, buybacks have increased pretty significantly over that time as well. And we'll continue to be opportunistic on the balance sheet. I think last second quarter, we bought back over $1 billion in stock. This second quarter, it was over $600 million, it's about a $1 billion in total cash return for the quarter. So we have been selectively adding leverage .We have been taking advantage of opportunities to buy the \u2013 buy our stock back and that will continue as we move forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe from JPMorgan. John, your line is now open.","John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Thank you very much. I'd like to follow-up on the growth rate question, if I may, but dig in a little bit deeper on the Americas. Obviously, the Americas is your biggest segment. At least the calculation that we did around the analyst day, it looked like the Americas needed to grow something like low to mid-teens a year for the next five years to contribute to your overall earnings growth algorithm. And yet in the first half of the year, operating income growth was around 2% with pressure on both the cost of goods sold line and occupancy, as well as operating expenses, in other words labor.","So this \u2013 are comps enough, I guess, to change that? I mean, when we go from a 3% comp to a mid-single digit comp. Is that enough to begin to see leverage in that line, or are there perhaps other things that can happen in your business, lapping partner investments, running a more efficient store if that makes sense. Maybe some benefits from lower commodities or lower rents especially as other retailers vacate their properties, that can maybe give some more visibility of margin expansion in the Americas segment than what is currently apparent at this point?","Kevin R. Johnson - Starbucks Corp.","Yeah, I think, John, I'll start and then I'll maybe have John add to my comments. There's a couple of big drivers that are not evident in the P&L today. And the first one is top line comp growth. So the last couple quarters, we've been in that 3% comp growth rate, and that is a big impact on our ability to drive overall margin.","I don't want to underestimate what a couple more points of comp would do for overall profit growth in the U.S. So being up in that high single digit to 10% range in total revenue growth in the U.S., that is a major driver of additional profitability. So, again, as we get into the back half of the year that should start to rectify itself.","The second thing is the partner and digital investments we're making in the U.S. as a percentage of revenue, over the next few years that will start to decline. So we will continue to make investments but the reality is the rate of growth in those investments, the delta, if you will, that will start to come down and we'll be able to lever it as revenue growth increases. So that's not saying that wage investments are going to go down; rather they're going to go up.","But if you look at this year, we went up $250 million for partner and digital investment, and the vast majority of that is in the U.S. That kind of impact on margin is not going to continue after we get out a couple more years. So both of those give us confidence in the growth algorithm. John, would you add anything?","John Winchester Culver - Starbucks Corp.","No. I would just add, John, that also what gives us confidence is the new store performance. And you look at new stores, it contributes over 4% of our top line revenue growth in the Americas. We've consistently done that for 12 consecutive quarters and we anticipate that that's going to continue.","So we're making these partner investments up front, to Scott's point. We feel that those partner investments are the right thing to do and also at the same time, we're starting to see traction as it relates to not only partner satisfaction and we sequentially improved turnover by two points versus Q1 and also at the same time, our customer service scores sequentially improved from Q1 to Q2 as well. So, I feel very good about the investments that we've made and that, in fact, we're seeing payback from that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Glass from Morgan Stanley. John, your line is now open.","John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks very much. You talk a lot about retail environment and that's presumably the implication it's a headwind to your sales. But competition doesn't come up much on Starbucks calls. There is more and better places to get coffee today than there ever has been. And I understand roastery and Reserve is sort of a way of targeting that, but how do you think about the role competition is now playing in your sales trajectory today versus a year ago, let's say? Is that a contributing factor in your minds? And how would you close on that?","Kevin R. Johnson - Starbucks Corp.","Yeah, John, this is Kevin. I'll comment and then I'll ask Howard to comment on the view on roasteries and at the very high end. Look, we've always had competition, and typically, I look in markets where we've had a first mover advantage and we establish a presence of a number of stores and the Starbucks brand in those markets, that is a very defensible position.","And if I look at where we're at in the United States and in China in our major markets, we are not \u2013 we not only have established a very defensible position, but we're expanding that with new store growth. In fact, let me have Matt comment a bit on thoughts on new store growth and how we're thinking about as we're building new Starbucks stores in our core brand, how that's helping us further strengthen that proposition in an environment where there is competition. There's always been competition. Matt, do you want to comment on that?","Matthew Ryan - Starbucks Corp.","Yes, domestically in the U.S., we have to look at this is not one market, but a collection of many markets. And as we look across geographies, we continue to see enormous headroom for store growth across the U.S. Just like we see differentials in store presence international to U.S., we see the same thing within the U.S. That means that there is a lot of opportunity for us to continue to expand in places where our strength has not been as traditionally great as it has been in certain urban and many western markets. So you're going to continue to see store growth, you know, ramp for us to grow into the future.","Kevin R. Johnson - Starbucks Corp.","And Howard, do you want to comment on the roasteries?","Howard S. Schultz - Starbucks Corp.","I would say a few things. First of all, there's no evidence whatsoever that any national company, even those companies that are discounting coffee significantly, with McDonald's nationally or Dunkin' Donuts in New England, what Panera is trying to do, there's no evidence whatsoever that we have, that there is anything that they are doing that is affecting us adversely. So I just want to get that off the table. The competitive issues question is just a nonevent for us.","I want to talk about the Roastery and Reserve brand, not through the lens of competition, but what you're going to have to do to win in the future. Every retailer is going to have to create an experiential moment, and if you're in the food and beverage business, you have to go to craft. You have to go to art. The interesting thing about the Roastery is, the average ticket to Roastery is $20. The average ticket in a Starbucks store is $5. People in the Roastery are spending significantly more time there than they do in the Starbucks store.","The day-parts in the Roastery are afternoon and evening driven, which as you know is not Starbucks strong suit. The Reserve bars that we have opened are demonstrating enough interest from the customer and customers are trading up, which has given us even more understanding about the opportunity we have to elevate the Reserve brand in existing Starbucks stores.","And when the first Reserve store opens in Chicago, I'm not talking about the roastery now, I'm talking about the Reserve store with Princi food, we'll have another \u2013 we'll more evidence about the opportunity we feel to grow those stores in ways that'll be highly complementary and bring a halo to the brand. But the short answer is the competition across the street, or the competition nationally and even those companies that significantly are discounting their coffee is not affecting Starbucks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Palmer from RBC Capital Markets. David, your line is now open.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi, thanks. Your rewards and digital mix of sales is still growing nicely, 400 basis points or 500 basis points or so on a year-over-year basis. Looking at your active rewards membership, it's growing 11%. And that's maybe half the growth it was a little over a year ago. So it looks like that growth or the deceleration in your rewards member growth is correlating with your slowdown in sales. Do you think that that's an important metric? Is rewards member growth a key thing that you're looking at and targeting to reaccelerate in the future? And how are you going to do that? Thanks.","Matthew Ryan - Starbucks Corp.","Thank you, David. Matt Ryan here. When we look at the rewards program on the digital flywheel, we can't just focus on any one single metric. We have to look at the totality of its contribution to the business. And we're at a point right now where in the U.S., the digital flywheel has been the largest single driver of comp growth and we're very confident that's going to continue. And I think it's important to reiterate a couple of things that Kevin said.","We have in fact seen 11% year-on-year growth in membership, but we have also seen record growth and spend per member. And when you take 13-point-some million members and you multiply it by an 8% increase year-on-year, that turns out to be one enormous number, and that's been a major contribution to our business.","Scott Harlan Maw - Starbucks Corp.","And I would just add that's the power of personalization that Matt and his team have been driving. So taking that big installed member base and driving additional transactions via personalization. that's what's driving that spend, remember. And, David, if you go back a couple of years ago when we were adding a lot of members, the incremental spend per member was flattish. It might be up 1% or 2%, but this quarter it was up 8%. And so we see an opportunity to accelerate that over time.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sharon Zackfia from William Blair. Sharon, your line is now open.","Sharon Zackfia - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hi. Good afternoon. I guess another maybe strategy question. Given the phenomenal response of customers to Mobile Order & Pay, have you rethought that hurdle of having people preload money in order to utilize it?","Kevin R. Johnson - Starbucks Corp.","Matt, do you want to take that?","Matthew Ryan - Starbucks Corp.","Yeah, Sharon. Matt Ryan here. It is one of the things we will be looking at as we look across the future. But I just want to remind that a theme that we reiterated at the Investor Conference, which is we continue to have a lot of people who join the program as soon as they become familiar with it, and our biggest barrier is familiarity with the program. So continuing to let that word get out there and help people understand what the program is all about is critical.","In addition, we have an easy low-hanging fruit in front of us, which is to get people into the program once they begin the sign-up process. So you're going to continue to see a lot of improvement to the sign-on process and to the way in which we guide customers to go from where they are today, not being members, into being full members with the store value card loaded. And we see a lot of opportunity there in the short term. And we'll, of course, be looking at other options like the one you suggested, in the long term.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein from Barclays. Your line is now open.","Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thank you very much. Just focusing on the comp topics for the company and I guess specifically for the U.S., it seems like that's the side of things that you guys are extremely confident on, the mid-single digit for the full-year fiscal year 2017. If we focus on just the U.S. for a moment, I mean, do the 3% comp in the fiscal second quarter we know the compare of these what looks like 300 basis points starting in this April through June quarter.","So I'm just wondering, your confidence and then is it accelerating comps confidence beyond just the compares? Because, again, you would think that you would see that uptick just to keep the line steady. I'm just wondering what you characterize as maybe the most impactful new product or platform that you think in the back half is going to lead to a reacceleration in that two-year trend.","And then, Scott, just to clarify. Did you say for the fiscal 2017 earnings that the range you gave was wider and that if you make incremental investments you'll come in at the lower end of the range? Or were you implying that you can make investments that might lead you below the low end of that newly revised range? Thanks.","Scott Harlan Maw - Starbucks Corp.","So I think I'll have John and Kris talk...","Kevin R. Johnson - Starbucks Corp.","Let me just frame if first and I'll hand it over to John and Kris on this. Jeffrey, let me give you three things that I think in addition to \u2013 well, number one is the sequential acceleration that we saw throughout Q2, that has continued into April.","The second thing is as we look at this quarter, the work the team has done around the Frappuccino launch that was kicked off by the Unicorn Frappucinno and what we've done to really make sure that we've got innovation and line of sight to how we're going to execute in the stores against that. And if you recall, a year ago we had the launch of the transition of the Rewards program at the same time. So we've been laser-focused on how we execute better in store with that.","And then certainly, beyond that, there's been a great focus that Kris has placed on our partners in the stores connecting with customers and ensuring that we're getting that uptick in customer sat, and the work that Adam Brotman has been leading to increase the throughput at peak.","So the increase of throughput at peak, the work that Kris has done in terms of customer connection, the innovation in the Frappuccino and the focus on in-store execution all contribute to the confidence, in addition to the sequential monthly acceleration we've seen in comps.","And so maybe I'll have Kris touch upon a bit of what he's been driving in terms of store partner connection with customers. And Adam can touch a bit maybe on the Mobile Order & Pay. Kris?","Kevin R. Johnson - Starbucks Corp.","Well, Jeffrey, I think we've got a number of things that we teed up, especially coming into the next two quarters, around operations particularly. And obviously customer connection is the most important thing we do, be it through MOP or cafe customer or whoever it was. But the reason I look to Q3 as a big opportunity is a number of things. First of all, I just think we've just gotten started on MOP service improvements. And we talked about that a good deal last quarter.","The things we put in place I know Adam will share in detail in a minute. But very, very confident that we've got huge opportunity in front of us around improving that service and making sure we get more people through the stores.","I think secondarily, strengthen beverage and food innovation. As I look to Q3, Frappuccino Happy Hour is going to be a huge home run this year. As Kevin mentioned, we acknowledged that we underestimated the interdependence of those two things, the Frappuccino Happy Hour and the launch of the MSR, or the conversion MSR program last year. But we have got singular focus on Happy Hour this year. We've got this early spark with Unicorn out there that has really ignited, I think, interest in the product, in the platform.","We're going to bring at least one new entirely new drink into Happy Hour this year that is going to be as good as Unicorn or better. And we've extended our hours this year on some other tactical things to really make sure that Happy Hour is set up for success.","I look a little further out and I see some great products we're bringing in the back half of Q3 and into Q4. We've got an entirely new iced tea platform we're bringing into the stores that's going to be a winner. Cold coffee is on fire. Our core espresso platforms around cold coffee are some of our strongest growth we've seen over the last few weeks.","And food. We've talked a lot about food today, but I think the food performance in Q2 is indicative of what we're going to see in Q3 and Q4. Everything from Sous Vide eggs to our core around breakfast sandwiches have been fantastic. We're going to bring a lot of innovation in core food over the next quarter, and I'm very confident that is going to help us lift comps significantly over the next few weeks.","Adam, do you want to talk about MOP?","Adam B. Brotman - Starbucks Corp.","Yeah, Jeffrey. This is Adam. First of all, in general, we're in the process right now of making real improvements in throughput and capacity in general. So we've got good momentum there, specifically as it relates to Mobile Order & Pay, as Kevin mentioned in his remarks. The first wave of new operational actions we've already taken in this regard have landed well in the field.","We're feeling really good about the results we've already seen, both in terms of improved throughput at peak, as we've mentioned, but as well as the customer experience in those stores around MOP in general for both Rewards customers and non-Rewards customers. We saw increased peak transactions in our busiest MOP stores. We saw the greatest improvement in customer experience scores for the quarter in the latest quarter in those busiest MOP stores, and that continues into April.","And we're also really pleased with how we've been able to deploy partner labor against these throughput improvements, particularly in these busiest Mobile Order & Pay stores. It's a really important part of how I think we're getting smarter in terms of shifting or reallocating labor to the morning peak opportunities occasionally, and selectively investing in labor where it makes sense to do so and where we feel good about that.","So net-net, we're really happy with the early momentum we have in terms of operational improvements around getting better at MOP experiences and just in general driving our business in this area.","Scott Harlan Maw - Starbucks Corp.","And I'll wrap up your question, Jeffrey. So, no, we're not indicating risk below the low end of the range. But I do want to acknowledge that if we see opportunities for investment or if the Teavana mall stores perform a little worse than we have forecast, that lower end is entirely in play.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Tarantino from Baird. David, your line is now open.","David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hi. Good afternoon. Scott, just on the guidance for this year, could you give a little bit of perspective on how much of the change was related to Teavana and how much of it was related to the investments you're making? And then I guess the second question related to that, assuming that the investments is a big part of this is why make that decision now? I mean, Starbucks has such a long history of delivering on their financial targets. I think the last time you lowered guidance was during the recession. So why now are you pulling forward investments and lowering the targets?","Scott Harlan Maw - Starbucks Corp.","On the first part of your question, the larger piece is the investments we're making, although the Teavana mall store performance versus what we thought is meaningful. And to the second part of your question, David, I take the spirit of what \u2013 how it's asked. We see a significant opportunity in areas like digital and specifically what we see with returns on investments that we make around personalization, around things around Starbucks Rewards, things that we do in the app to make things easier for our customers. Those investments have the shortest payback and the highest returns of anything we do in Starbucks including new stores.","And so as we look at the back half of the year and we look at the fact that we're driving the majority of our comps from digital, I would argue we must make those investments because those will pay off both as we exit 2017 and as we head into 2018, and I think, it would be not the right thing to do to skip those. So the second thing I would say is on Reserve and Roastery, those have longer term implications for us as Howard talked about, So making those investments now as we build the Princi capabilities.","A lot of these capabilities are in the early phases, building out. The commissary capability for Princi Kitchens is building out. The roasteries that we have under construction across the globe and opening our first Reserve store soon, all of those things, needs the right level of design, the right level of merchandising, and it costs money to get those things setup right. The good news is as we move into 2018 and beyond, we'll start to leverage those investments as we begin to open more and more Reserve stores, open the roasteries, and we think that's the right thing to do.","Kevin R. Johnson - Starbucks Corp.","And I think this just reinforces the fact that we're playing the long game. And in this period where this dramatic disruption is taking place in the retail industry, we are very clear that the transformative elements that we're focused on are digital, mobile relationships with our customers and branded, experiential retail. And the investments we're putting in are in those areas. It's about elevating the digital flywheel and it's about elevating the brand with the investment we're making in roasteries and Reserve stores and Princi. It's all about the future.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jason West from Credit Suisse. Jason, your line is now open.","Jason West - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Yes, thanks. Just one quick one and then I've a bigger question. Scott, did you reiterate the mid-single digit global comp guidance for the year? I just wasn't quite clear on that. And then in terms of the personalization, I know you guys have been talking about that since kind of last fall. Can you maybe give us an update on how you think that's working and maybe what's left to do there?","Scott Harlan Maw - Starbucks Corp.","So yes, mid-single digit comps globally for the full year, and I'll turn it to Matt for the second part of the question.","Matthew Ryan - Starbucks Corp.","Thank you for the question. We are very excited about personalization. And I would just reiterate what we've been saying and it remains absolutely true. We have only just begun. Right now, personalization, we did extend from email to the app about two quarters ago.","We are seeing terrific results. It is the single biggest driver that we're seeing of the improved spend per member, and we just told you what that meant for us. So it's a big deal. We haven't done a lot of the things we dream about doing and one of the reasons why we continue to invest in technology is to be able to do those things.","Triggered responses to events, triggered responses to external data that we can use, continuing to put personalization elsewhere throughout the app, and then eventually extending personalization to other screens beyond the app as well. These are all on the roadmap and will be coming and we believe they'll drive significant value for the company. So we're very, very optimistic and bullish on it.","Scott Harlan Maw - Starbucks Corp.","Maybe just one proof point to add to what Matt said. As you know, we launched this quarter suggested selling across the platform within the app. So as you're ordering your beverage, we're able to show pictures of food and other things you've either ordered in the past, or would go well with items in your basket. And we saw this quarter the ticket on Mobile Order & Pay actually go higher than the average ticket on Starbucks Rewards orders that weren't through Mobile Order & Pay. That wasn't the case over the last year. So for the first quarter we've seen that tick above as we thought it would when we launched personalization. And that's a good sign.","Matthew Ryan - Starbucks Corp.","And just to add, we have also seen acceleration through the quarter with regard to personalization. So as we entered the quarter, and as we exited, we saw personalization as one of those things we think is going to continue to drive comps up in the second half of the year.","Kevin R. Johnson - Starbucks Corp.","And we saw higher attach on food in particular.","Matthew Ryan - Starbucks Corp.","That's right.","Kevin R. Johnson - Starbucks Corp.","Which is the highest since we launched La Boulange three years ago. So clearly personalization is playing a role in that success.","Operator","The last question comes from the line of Karen Holthouse from Goldman Sachs. Karen, your line is now open.","Karen Holthouse - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, another question on the sort of U.S. comp commentary. So stores that had those peak Mobile Order & Pay stores which were in 20% of transactions, you noted sequential improvement, but are we actually back to a point that those are positive year-over-year in traffic? And then when you're thinking about the improving into April, how much of that just relates to the disruption that we're lapping last year around Mobile Order & Pay or is that true on a two-year basis as well? Thanks.","Scott Harlan Maw - Starbucks Corp.","So, Karen, those highest volume stores were slightly negative last quarter from a transaction standpoint, and they're still slightly negative. But that \u2013 but it's improved significantly quarter to quarter.","Kevin R. Johnson - Starbucks Corp.","It was pre-adjusted. (1:19:37)","Scott Harlan Maw - Starbucks Corp.","Yeah. So we're seeing improvement, but still a little bit of negative transaction there.","Howard S. Schultz - Starbucks Corp.","Can I just clarify one condition myself? I want to make sure there's clarity and common language, because I think the question was also is comp improvement based primarily on low comparisons. The answer is no, right?","Scott Harlan Maw - Starbucks Corp.","So in both March and April we still had pretty big comparisons to lap over, so we're pretty happy with the overall comp growth and particularly transaction growth in April.","Howard S. Schultz - Starbucks Corp.","Yeah.","Kevin R. Johnson - Starbucks Corp.","And I think our comp \u2013 well, our comp performance for the back half is based on the level of innovation that we're bringing in from a product standpoint, performance at happy hour as well as continued expansion of the digital flywheel.","Scott Harlan Maw - Starbucks Corp.","Okay.","Kevin R. Johnson - Starbucks Corp.","Great. Thank you, Karen. Thank you everybody. Tom?","Tom Shaw - Starbucks Corp.","Yeah, thanks again for joining us today. And we look forward to speaking with you again on our third quarter earnings call, which we have tentatively scheduled for Thursday, July 27. Thanks again.","Operator","This concludes Starbucks Coffee Company's second quarter fiscal year 2017 earnings conference call.

[Operator instructions.] Ms. DeGrande, you may begin your conference call.","JoAnn DeGrande","Thanks, operator. Good afternoon. This is JoAnn DeGrande, vice president of investor relations for Starbucks Coffee Company. Joining me on the call today to discuss our fiscal third quarter results are Howard Schultz, chairman, president, and CEO; Troy Alstead, COO; and Scott Maw, CFO. Also joining us for Q&A are Cliff Burrows, group president, US and Americas; John Culver, group president, China, Asia Pacific, and channel development; and Matt Ryan, global chief strategy officer, who is part of our digital team, along with Howard and Adam Brotman, our chief digital officer. ","This conference will include forward-looking statements, which are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements. Any such statements should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements in our earnings release and risk factor discussions in our filings with the SEC, including our last annual report on Form 10-K.","Starbucks assumes no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements or information.

","This conference call is being webcast and an archive of the webcast will be available on our website later today.","Before I turn the call over to Howard, I would like to remind you again of our biennial investor day taking place the first week of December in Seattle. We\u2019re in the early planning stages, and invitations will be sent in the fall. We hope you\u2019ll be able to join us for the first conference in Seattle since 2006.","With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Howard.","Howard Schultz","Thank you, JoAnn, and welcome to everyone on today\u2019s call. Starbucks Q3 represents another quarter of outstanding operating and financial performance around the world, demonstrating once again the power and relevancy of the Starbucks brand and the success and scalability of our business model and go-to-market strategies.","Today, over 300,000 Starbucks partners are serving over 70 million customers from almost 21,000 stores in 65 countries every week. I\u2019m particularly pleased to report that each of our reporting segments delivered solid performance in Q3 and contributed to our accelerated 11% increase in revenues to $4.2 billion.","Particularly noteworthy is that our U.S. retail store business delivered comp growth of 7%, ahead of our own expectations and a stunning achievement on a base of over 6,800 stores against 9% comps in Q3 last year and in the face of continuing challenging U.S. economic and consumer environments.","Over the last two years, our U.S. business has produced revenue growth of over 22%. Our business in China, now approaching 1,300 stores, has never been stronger, contributing to a strong comp growth of 7% in China Asia Pacific. And EMEA demonstrated continued progress against transformation plan, delivering comp growth of 3% with key U.K. market comps outpacing the EMEA regions overall.","Globally, store comps grew 6%, our 18th consecutive quarter of comp store sales gains of 5% or more. Innovation and share expansion also drove strong gains in our premium single-serve packaged coffee and tea portfolios, contributing to a solid 13% increase in channel development revenues. ","Overall, our operating performance in Q3 resulted in a 200 basis point expansion in our consolidated operating margin to a Q3 record of 18.5%, and a 22% increase in earnings per share to a Q3 record of $0.67 per share. ","The results we announced today reflect the success of our strategies to innovate, identify new consumer need states, and day part opportunities and create innovative, highly differentiated, relevant products to satisfy those need states, all while maintaining a laser focus on our core coffee business.","I\u2019m convinced that the continuing effort to execute against these strategies will enable us to drive further incrementality and deliver even stronger unit economics and greater profitability into the future. ","Innovation has also been a key driver of Starbucks business, and today, deep trust in the Starbucks brand, our emotional connection to consumers around the world, and our scale afford us the opportunity to innovate beyond our core coffee business.","I previously shared our intent to reinvent the tea category, just as we did the coffee category, and we are making meaningful progress against our plan to do so. In Q3, we introduced both Teavana Oprah Chai and Teavana Shaken Iced Tea to tremendous customer response. Just last week, we opened our fourth new Teavana tea bar on Third Avenue and 63rd Street in Manhattan, and in the fall, we\u2019ll be opening another iconic Teavana tea bar on Broadway and Ninth Street in New York City\u2019s Greenwich Village.","These innovations are emblematic of the future vision we have for Teavana, and have drawn attention to the tea category, elevated the Teavana brand, and these new, innovative beverages have driven incrementality in both Starbucks and Teavana stores.","In addition, last month we introduced Fizzio, Starbucks\u2019 brand of preservative-free, hand crafted, cold carbonated beverages in approximately 3,000 of our stores in the U.S. Sun Belt. Consumer response to Fizzio has been strong and following the successful test in both Japan and Singapore, we plan to introduce Fizzio in select international markets in the quarters ahead.","Teavana Oprah Chai, Teavana Shaken Iced Tea, and Fizzio are providing us with highly differentiated, hand crafted beverages that attract customers during afternoon and evening day parts and drive increased food attachment. ","But innovation for us is not limited to new opportunities. We continue to invest heavily against what we know drives our brand and our core business, day in and day out: leadership in all things coffee, unparalleled customer service enabled by our world-class partners, innovative locally relevant store design, and digital platforms that extend and deepen customer loyalty and the customer experience. ","Global coffee industry leadership remains at Starbucks\u2019 core, and we are committed to elevating both our range of coffee offerings and the experiences we offer our customers, through the introduction of innovative new customized espresso beverages and cold coffee drinks. ","We are also expanding our offerings of micro lot rare and exclusive reserve coffees. No other coffee industry participant approaches Starbucks\u2019 ability to evaluate, select, blend, roast, and deliver micro lot coffees around the world, 20 so far in fiscal 2014 alone. ","And in September, we\u2019ll be offering an extraordinary micro lot reserve coffee, the first coffee developed on our own farm in Costa Rica. Expect to see an expanding and evolving portfolio of proprietary coffees under the Reserve brand from our coffee farm in Costa Rica and around the world in the future.","At the same time, we are aggressively pursuing new store segmentation opportunities in order to showcase Clover, pour-over, and other unique brewing methods. ","As Starbucks continues to deliver record revenues and profits, it\u2019s becoming increasingly clear to others what we have known all along, that Starbucks\u2019 most valuable asset is our store partners, our people.","The culture of our company has been curated in our stores and is on display every day as partners connect with customers and one another. Recognizing the respect that Chinese children have for their parents, two years ago I hosted the first family meeting of its kind in China, a coming together of partners, parents, and families, at which we shared Starbucks\u2019 values, heritage, and culture and an aspiration to improve the lives of youth and the communities in which they live. And last month, we held two more extraordinary family meetings of this type in Guangzhou and Beijing. ","This year, we\u2019ve brought the concept to the U.S., holding family meetings in New York City; Washington, DC; and Seattle, and introducing the Starbucks College Achievement Plan, the unique benefit we are providing to our U.S. partners.","Just as millions of partners and their families have benefited from healthcare and stock equity over the last few years, the Starbucks College Achievement Plan will benefit our people by helping them earn a college degree, unlocking doors to life-changing opportunities, dreams, and their own aspirations. Investments such as these promote increased trust and loyalty, strengthen our bond with our people, and help us support them both professionally and personally. ","We also continue to seek opportunities to develop our next generation of leaders. I have no doubt that the global leadership conferences we\u2019ve held in New Orleans in 2008 and Houston in 2012 directly contributed to the record results we reported in 2013 and now are seeding in 2014. I\u2019m looking forward to hosting over 2,000 district managers in Seattle this October and our next global leadership conferences in Orlando, Florida, in October 2015. ","We continue to elevate the equity of the Starbucks brand through the introduction of flagship, unique stores all over the world that deliver strong unit economics and cast a bright halo over all things Starbucks. In Q3 alone, we opened 344 stores, including a technology forward company owned store at Walt Disney World in Florida, our ninth Disney store as part of that partnership.","I\u2019m highlighting the new Disney store because Disney stores are among the highest-volume stores in our portfolio and we are actively pursuing further opportunities to partner with Disney and open additional Disney stores around the world.","But relevance and innovation are not limited to our U.S. store portfolio. We recently opened two stunning flagship stores in China that I saw for myself just a couple of months ago, including in Beijing, where we opened our first 24-hour store to a tremendous customer response, giving us confidence that we can introduce additional 24-hour store formats elsewhere in the world.","And just last week, I had the opportunity to experience firsthand the romance and local influences unique to Colombia\u2019s rich coffee heritage and see it come to life in our first opening in Colombia. The design of this iconic three-story, spectacular flagship store in Bogota was inspired by Starbucks\u2019 unique 43-year relationship with Colombian coffee farmers dating back to our first store in the Pike Place Market in Seattle.","Honestly, it was simply one of the most extraordinary emotional celebratory openings I have ever witnessed. And customers will find the same level of imaginative design in Vietnam, where over the last few days we\u2019ve opened our first two Starbucks stores in Hanoi, showcasing stunning local artwork and d\u00e9cor that speaks to Vietnam\u2019s strong coffee legacy.","New stores in different countries on different continents, with different coffee cultures and no aided awareness to speak of, but the same results: lines out the door and customers clamoring to get in day after day, from morning until night. These openings remind me that despite the size of our current global store footprint, pent-up demand for the Starbucks experience continues to increase, and that we have untold markets yet to open and expand in the years ahead.","Digital platforms have been instrumental in building brand loyalty and extending and deepening customer engagement with the Starbucks brand. We have invested well ahead of the curve to create opportunities for our customers to engage with their social and digital networks on mobile devices and are now beginning to see the payoff of these investments.","While many national and international retailers are just beginning to appreciate the critical importance of integrating a mobile platform into their business, Starbucks continues to expand our leadership position by providing the digital services and content our customers truly value and appreciate. And we are committed to developing new digital products and services that are relevant to our customers, deepen our brand engagement, and leverage the network effect of a growing digital platform in the future.","Starbucks digital success starts with the popularity of our cards, and the loyalty program associated with those cards. The Starbucks card is now available to customers in 29 global markets. Our My Starbucks Rewards loyalty program now has over 8 million active members in the U.S. and continues to grow around the world.","In fact, in China today, MSR transactions now account for over 40% of total tender, a remarkable metric, and demonstrates the loyalty of our Chinese customers and the relationship they have to this card.","Stars, the loyalty program rewards currency, are highly motivating to consumers. We are seeing rapidly growing participation in the program and increasingly positive results through offering stars as rewards in highly targeted one-to-one marketing. ","And we are seeing this not only in our stores - and this is really important - but in the grocery channel as well. The extension of MSR to include the integration of star codes on packaged coffee in the grocery channel is proving highly accretive, with nearly 1.3 million MSR members having earned and redeemed nearly 7 million stars to date, as we leverage multiple channels\u2019 distribution.","The core strength of our loyalty program is fueling adoption of our mobile app. Customers continue to embrace our industry-leading mobile app in increasing numbers, and we now have almost 12 million active users of our mobile app in the U.S. and Canada alone. Mobile payment now accounts for over 15% of all transactions in our U.S. company operated stores and we are now processing on average 6 million mobile transactions in the U.S. every week alone.","By integrating mobile loyalty, payment, and in-store digital experiences, we are creating game-changing technologies and experiences for our customers, and the opportunity to introduce new lines of business for our company. A prime example of this is our forthcoming mobile order and pay initiative that will allow customers to use their phones and MSR accounts to order ahead of arriving at a store where we plan to pilot in a major U.S. market later this year.","Mobile order and pay will be the fastest and easiest way for customers to order, pay for, and pick up their purchases, once again demonstrating the lead position Starbucks has in all things mobile. Mobile ordering is just the first of many initiatives in the pipeline that will enable Starbucks to extend its lead position in mobile payments, while leveraging the value of Starbucks stars to tens of millions of loyal customers across the globe.","As Starbucks enters its Q4, we are well on our way to meeting our growth targets for fiscal 2014, and ideally positioned to continue delivering double digit top and bottom line growth into the future. I could not be more proud of our Starbucks partners or of the exceptional execution and extraordinary results we are delivering to our shareholders, but we strongly believe the best is yet to come. ","I\u2019ll now pass the call over to Troy and Scott to discuss our Q3 operating and financial performance in detail and share our initial fiscal 2015 targets. ","Troy Alstead","Thanks, Howard, and good afternoon everyone. Our third quarter results are a testament to the growing strength and global relevancy of the Starbucks brand. Q3 performance was driven by continued beverage and food innovation, deepening our connection to customers and elevating our customer experience through phenomenal execution by our partners.","I\u2019ll discuss our third quarter performance for each reporting segment and then turn the discussion over to Scott for additional details on our financial results, our outlook for the balance of fiscal \u201914 and preliminary targets for fiscal 2015.","Each of our reportable segments set new third quarter records for revenue and operating income. Let me start with the Americas segment, which delivered another quarter of strong results, despite a persistently difficult retail environment.","Total net revenues in the Americas were $3.1 billion in Q3, up 10% over the prior year. The largest driver of this increase was strong comp growth of 6%, with 4% coming from ticket growth and 2% from transactions. These results are particularly significant given the 9% comp we were lapping from a year ago.","Comp growth for our U.S. business outpaced that of the Americas, accelerating to 7%. One of the primary drivers of this growth is the strong progress we\u2019re making with food. The improved quality and variety of our food offerings once again drove 2 points of comp growth, and we expect that the ongoing innovations we\u2019re planning will continue to drive comps in the coming years.","In addition to providing a meaningful contribution to our comp growth, our food program is also driving significant margin improvement. Working closely with our vendors, we\u2019re benefitting from improved manufacturing costs. In our stores, our efforts to improve inventory management and waste are paying off.","A major contributor to our success in food is our breakfast sandwich platform, which delivered 40% growth in the third quarter. The bakery rollout of La Boulange in our U.S. stores is nearly complete, with remaining stores slating to be converted by mid to late August. ","Throughout the rollout, we continue to make enhancements to the line and leverage operational learnings through all day parts as we go, including our lunch program. We\u2019ve learned a great deal from the breakthrough launch and from our current lunch test, closely monitoring customer and partner response as we test new offerings.","These learnings have influenced our approach to enhancing our lunch program. Customer response to the two new sandwiches we introduced at the end of the third quarter has been very positive, leading to an uptick in sales and attach rates to our lunch offerings.","This recent success has encouraged us to introduce new SKUs to the lunch line going forward, and we\u2019ll continue to evolve our lunch program with this disciplined, measured approach, which minimizes disruption to both store operations and customer routines.","It also allows us to test and adjust products as necessary. By the end of fiscal 2015, we expect the lunch program to look very different than it does today, and we will continue to evolve and enhance our lunch offerings in the years ahead. ","In addition to food, beverage innovation was a strong contributor to our results, with a new limited time offering, Caf\u00e9 Espresso Frappuccino to our growing refreshments platform including Teavana Iced and Shaken Teas and Refreshers, to Teavana Oprah Chai, which also ","helped drive overall growth in our chai tea platform. ","Our core Frappuccino beverages also performed well, demonstrating the healthy balance of new and longtime favorites driving customers\u2019 purchases. And in addition, pricing contributed 1 point to comp growth in the quarter.","Howard already mentioned Fizzio. We are equally excited about innovation in the refreshment category with our super premium Teavana branded teas in our entire U.S. Canadian company operated store portfolio. ","Our summer Teavana Shaken Iced Tea limited time offerings have been in stores since May, and have significantly up-leveled our tea offerings. Returning favorite Peach Green Tea Lemonade and a new Blackberry Mojito Tea Lemonade are delivering strong results, and we expect both to remain customer favorites throughout the summer.","These innovative beverage offerings, along with our new lunch sandwiches, are part of our bigger initiative to consistently grow across all day parts, including afternoons, which have shown the strongest comp growth over the last few quarters. ","Drive-thrus remain a very important part of our U.S. store portfolio, as they continue to deliver very strong results. They account for more than 40% of our company operated stores and continue to show double digit total sales growth year over year for the third consecutive year.","This speaks to the convenience they provide for our customers throughout their daily travels. Our field teams remain focused on consistently enhancing our drive-thru customer experience, including investments in innovative design elements and functionality. As we broaden and expand our drive-thru program, we see another layer of opportunity for tremendous growth.","Now turning to EMEA, where the turnaround continues to progress. The region delivered strong 13% revenue growth in the third quarter, attributable to favorable foreign currency exchange, 3% comp growth, and incremental revenue from 161 net new stores opened in the last 12 months.","The 3% comp growth was the fifth consecutive quarter with positive comps, driven by a 2% lift in transactions and a 2% rise in average ticket. The two-year comp at 5% represents the highest two-year comp since the first quarter of 2012. Continued focus on solid in-store execution and a strong lineup of products, including continued progress in up-leveling our food program in Europe are all contributing to these strong results. ","Also noteworthy to highlight, comps from two of our largest EMEA markets, the U.K. and Germany, where economic recovery is taking hold, outpaced the overall regional comp growth for the quarter. The outlook for the U.K. in particular continues to be positive, supported by declining unemployment and the expectation of a sixth consecutive quarter of positive GDP growth.","Our EMEA license markets are also performing exceptionally well. Turkey and the Middle East in particular continue to outperform, with even stronger comp growth relative to company operated stores. These results support our license-focused growth strategy for the region, where today 50% of our stores are licensed.","Turning to the China Asia Pacific region, where our growth aspirations continue to be reaffirmed by the robust performance of our new stores and the strong comp growth we continue to deliver in this region. CAP total net revenues grew 23% to $288 million in Q3, a new all-time record, and represents the 15th consecutive quarter with revenue growth in excess of 20%.","The largest driver of this growth was incremental revenue from new stores. A key driver of the strong comp growth is our ability to innovate and offer our customers beverage and food options that appeal to their unique tastes. We introduced several record breaking limited time offerings in the blended category that were received with great enthusiasm by customers.","In China and select Asian markets, the strawberry cheesecake Frappuccino set instant records for the top-selling limited time Frappuccino offering ever. Beverages and products that revolve around our coffee core also showed momentum, including VIA lattes and Reserve coffees in some of our key markets, and our Macchiato marketing campaign highlighted barista artistry and brought Starbucks espresso expertise to the forefront as a key differentiator. ","CAP\u2019s 7% comp growth for Q3 reflects a 6% increase in traffic, which is outstanding considering we were lapping an exceptionally high 8% traffic comp a year ago. There are a few metrics worth highlighting relative to our CAP performance in the third quarter. ","Two year comps for the region are at a strong 16%. Once again, comps in China outpaced the region overall, despite concerns around an economic slowdown in China. And, the political instability in China has eased slightly, but continued to weigh at consumers in Q3. Traffic from this market has still not returned to the strong levels achieved in prior periods. ","These results, and the investments we\u2019ve made across the region give me great confidence about our future performance in the CAP segment. Into the third quarter, we\u2019ve had 4,425 stores in this region, which included 543 net new stores opened during the past 9 months, keeping us on track to meet our target of 750 new stores in CAP for fiscal 2014.","Finally, new channel development, where our third quarter performance has reaffirmed our confidence about expanding customer occasions outside Starbucks retail stores. This segment achieved new records for revenues and operating income in the third quarter, which resulted in double digit revenue growth and strong margin expansion.","Revenues were $375 million, a 13% increase over the prior third quarter, primarily driven by increased sales of premium single serve products and increased sales volumes of packaged coffees.","We gained share during the quarter both in the premium single cup category and the premium packaged coffee space, underscoring our leadership position in premium at-home coffee. Looking ahead, we are very excited about the innovation we will be introducing across our coffee portfolio in Q4, with several new K-cup SKUs including flavored coffees, the addition of Fall Blend and single origin coffees in both K-cup and packaged coffee, as well as new VIA lattes.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Scott to take you through financial results for the quarter, our outlook for the balance of fiscal 2014, and preliminary targets for fiscal 2015. Scott? ","Scott Maw ","Thanks, Troy, and good afternoon everyone. Our business has performed exceptionally well once again this year, and the third quarter continued that trend, thanks to fantastic execution and customer focus by our partners across the globe.","I\u2019m particularly pleased with our consolidated comp store sales, which increased 6% and revenue growth of over 11%. Our consolidated operating income grew 25% to $769 million, a new third quarter record. This translates into 18.5% operating margin, an increase of 200 basis points over the prior year.","In terms of segment profitability, operating income in the Americas grew to $728 million, up 18% over the last third quarter. Operating margin expanded 150 basis points to 24%, primarily driven by strong sales leverage. ","These are clearly fantastic results, and our 7% U.S. comp growth in particular takes on even greater significance given recent same-store sales trend data reported by many other retailers. ","EMEA\u2019s profitability continues to improve as we remain focused on the turnaround in that market. Operating income more than tripled to $29 million over the prior third quarter and operating margin expanded 580 basis points to 9%.","Sales leverage, combined with our intense cost focus throughout the P&L, were key drivers to the margin expansion. We are also very pleased with the performance in China Asia Pacific, which delivered strong operating income exceeding $100 million for the very first time.","This 19% increase over last year, which translated into a 35% operating margin, reflects particularly strong performance from China company owned stores and our JV partnerships in South Korea, Japan, and East China.","The ongoing portfolio shift towards more company operated stores and the impact of unfavorable foreign currency exchange from a weaker yen were partially offset by strong sales leverage, leading to a 120 basis point operating margin reduction.","Margin expansion for channel development continued in Q3. Revenue increased 13% and operating profit grew 45% to $139 million. Operating margin of 37% was an 800 basis point improvement over last year. The largest driver was favorable coffee costs, but underlying efficiencies such as improved inventory management practices also contributed.","The operating loss related to all other segments expanded in the third quarter to $19 million, reflecting continued investments in our emerging businesses. On a consolidated basis, our excellent global revenue growth and margin expansion drove up earnings per share 22% to $0.67, a new record.","Additionally, we returned nearly $500 million to shareholders during the quarter through dividends and share repurchases. On a year to date basis, cash returns to shareholders totaled $1. 82 billion based on our history for this period.","Finally, Q3 operating cash flow was $850 million, up 28% from last year, driven by strong business unit performance and ongoing working capital efficiencies.","And now I want to cover how we expect to finish fiscal 2014. To better understand and evaluate our future performance, I will be referencing certain non-GAAP financial measures.","Our excellent results across the company in the third quarter put us in a great position to deliver another year of strong growth. We\u2019re now targeting fourth quarter non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.73 to $0.75, which excludes an estimated net benefit of $0.03 related to the sale of our retail operations in Australia and Malaysia that may close in the fourth quarter.","This gives us growth of 22% to 25% over Q4 2013 calculated on a non-GAAP basis. It\u2019s very important to note that our Q3 EPS growth rate was 22%, and we believe this same rate of significant growth or perhaps a slight increase will continue in Q4.","On a GAAP basis, whole year fiscal 2014 EPS will be in the range of $2.70 to $2.72. Non-GAAP EPS will be in the range of $2.65 to $2.67, which excludes the estimated net benefit of $0.03 related to the sale of the previously mentioned retail operations and the $0.02 benefit from a litigation credit recorded in our first quarter of this year.","This gives us a very strong 21% to 22% growth over fiscal 2013, calculated based on non-GAAP EPS. In terms of our other targets, we continue to expect revenue growth of 10% or better, driven by strong global comp store sales growth in the mid-single digits. We now expect to open 1,550 net new stores globally, with the 50 additional stores from our prior target coming from the Americas.","Consolidated operating margin for fiscal 2014 is now expected to be an approximately 200 basis point improvement over FY2013 when excluding the Kraft litigation charge in fiscal 2013, an excellent result, driven by strong sales leverage and commodity favorability.","We continue to expect moderate operating margin improvement year over year in the Americas. In EMEA, we remain on target for our operating margin reaching the high single-digits as evidenced by our strong performance so far this year.","In CAP, we continue to target operating margin moving towards the low 30% range, including year over year margin deceleration in Q4 given the ongoing ownership mix shift and lapping certain favorable nonrecurring items from last year.","And for channel development, given the strong year to date performance, we are increasing our operating margin expectation to approximately 600 basis points of margin expansion in fiscal 2014.","Looking ahead to 2015, we anticipate again delivering significant growth for our shareholders while investing in critical capabilities for our customers and partners. We are recommitting to our long term guidance for EPS growth of 15% to 20%.","Next year, we anticipate EPS growth within that same range on a non-GAAP basis. However, toward the lower end due to the following factors. First, the past two years have included significant commodity cost tailwinds. This includes 4 percentage points, or approximately $0.10 of this year\u2019s EPS growth attributable to favorable commodity costs.","In contrast, next year we expect commodity costs to be roughly neutral, or have a minor unfavorable impact based on the roughly 60% of our coffee needs we now have price protected for fiscal 2015. Second, we continue evaluating opportunities to drive long term growth in our businesses, with a specific focus on enhancing the partner experience and digital related investments.","Other targets for fiscal 2015 include revenue growth of 10% or greater, global comparable store sales growth in the mid-single digits and 1,600 net new stores globally, with 650 in the Americas, 150 in EMEA, and 800 net new stores in China Asia Pacific.","These represent our initial growth targets for 2015. We\u2019re still in the process of finalizing our annual operating plan, which is due to be wrapped up in September. We will then provide further details on our fiscal 2015 targets when we report Q4 and fiscal 2014 earnings in late October.","The results we delivered in Q3 are the product of a business model built on continuous innovation, on an intense customer focus, and on world-class execution. Over the years, we have consistently invested to support and growth that model, all while delivering significant shareholder value. ","And while we have again set challenging targets for Q4 and beyond, we are confident in our trajectory for a number of reasons, including innovation as a core competency of ours. And as a result, we have multiple layers of significant diverse growth opportunities in the pipeline. ","Our position as the global coffee authority is a major asset, and we continue to invest and focus on extending our capabilities in this area. Our industry leading store design and digital capabilities deliver outstanding results, with much more coming in the years ahead. And our focus on our people will only accelerate, with a clear correlation between enhancing the partner experience and delivering excellent results.","Finally, as we expand, invest, and innovate, we will maintain a sharp level of financial discipline, preserve a strong balance sheet, and generate increasing cash flow. This will result in powerful returns on capital and will continue to significantly benefit our shareholders.","With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to the operator for Q&A. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions.] Your final question comes from Matt DiFrisco with Buckingham Research.","Matt DiFrisco - Buckingham Research ","On the same-store sales front in the U.S., commentary on sort of the contributors to that as far as what you\u2019re seeing from food and other items that might be driving that, and even very early results, but results that you see in the markets where you have Fizzio, if that encourages you to maybe even expand that out further.","Clifford Burrows","We\u2019re very pleased with the strength of the 7% comp in the U.S. business. It is a mixture of both ticket and transaction. We have seen continued strength from our food business, as we roll out that launch. It has been a contributor of 2% to the comp in the quarter. It has been underpinned and supported by beverage innovation, whether it is the iced teas from Teavana or whether it is Fizzio in its early days, in the Sun Belt region.","And also, the Frappuccino limited time offers this season have also performed strongly, so really, really pleased in company operated and licensed, and with our new store performance. So all around, very strong performance in the U.S.","Howard Schultz","I would just add, it\u2019s clear to us that we have a significant opportunity in the need state of refreshment. And shaken Teavana iced tea and Fizzio has reaffirmed that, and we see that as just the beginning of both afternoon and evening opportunities. And we are bullish on all things tea, and we are excited about what\u2019s happening with the introduction of Fizzio. Just the beginning.","Operator","Your next question comes from Keith Siegner with UBS.","Keith Siegner - UBS","Just a quick question on channel development. Very strong numbers. Particularly on the margin, and what\u2019s most impressive is those margins are before you even include the pricing [unintelligible]. So I was just wondering, maybe Scott, if you could talk a little bit about, as we think through the channel development margins during the next few quarters, what other factors do we need to consider in modeling out that margin beyond the late July price increase? Are there investments you\u2019re making? Mix changes? International? What other factors should we consider?","John Culver","I\u2019ll take that question. In terms of the margin expansion, we\u2019re very pleased with the 800 basis point improvement on the quarter. We\u2019re seeing strong execution across all categories. If you look at our share growth across packaged coffee, across K-cups, as well as RTD and Tazo tea, huge share gains in each of those categories, so very pleased with that.","What\u2019s driving that is the innovation that we\u2019re pushing into each of these areas, in packaged coffees with limited time offerings, single origins, new K-cup SKUs coming into the mix with the Blond product as well as the flavors. We\u2019ve got innovation coming in in tea. ","And then couple that with the fact that we saw strong execution down the aisle from a display standpoint. We feel as though we\u2019re hitting on all cylinders in terms of what the team\u2019s delivering. We also had some upside as it relates to coffee costs in the quarter, which helped contribute to the margin expansion. And we\u2019re really focused and disciplined on managing the operations in a way that is going to continue to drive growth on the bottom line.","We\u2019re very much encouraged in terms of these stars down the aisle, and the fact that we had 1.5 million members redeem nearly 7 million stars since we introduced that program. And that program continues to gain traction. And then we also have the Starbucks siren, the Starbucks siren down the aisle that we have about 400 locations that we\u2019re targeting to have built out by the end of this year, which is also helping us as well.","Operator","The next question is from Jeff Bernstein with Barclays.","Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays ","Just looking at the Americas specifically, in terms of the comp, it looks like the last few quarters the ticket continues to rise. So it was 1%, then 3%. Now it\u2019s 4%. Related to that, a couple of question. Just one, I\u2019m wondering whether that\u2019s a conscious push of maybe premium products if there\u2019s anything in particular, whether that\u2019s being driven by food. And then as it ties into food, I\u2019m just wondering, it seems like lunch, the rollout was targeted for fiscal \u201915. I\u2019m wondering what you expect the contribution to be. I\u2019m assuming that it will be meaningfully incremental relative to the breakfast and maybe boost up that 2 percentage point contribution. Any thoughts on that would be great. ","Clifford Burrows ","There\u2019s no doubt that the work we\u2019ve done with food over the last two years, with the investment in La Boulange and then the rollout of these fantastic new morning pastries, and the products around all day parts supported by whether it\u2019s pastries [unintelligible], loaf cakes, all of that is really helping us to increase our attach. And it is giving us an opportunity to improve quality. And we\u2019ve had a benefit from ticket in their area.","We also went in and we are now in, I guess, our 10th year of breakfast sandwiches. And we did a major overhaul and upgrade of the ingredients. And we really did see a 40% growth versus the previous year. So there is absolute confidence that we\u2019re heading in the right direction with food. ","As Troy said earlier, we introduced two new lunch products, two new sandwiches, and we\u2019ve seen those perform well. And we are testing in a couple of markets a lot of innovations around lunch. And we will keep testing. And as we prove out new products, new ideas, we will roll them out. And really, that will happen from now throughout 2015. ","As Howard said, the beverages we\u2019ve got around refreshment, whether it\u2019s the iced shaken teas from Teavana, or whether it is Fizzio, they again support this lunchtime occasion. We\u2019re equally excited about the opportunity with evenings, and that is not just around the wine and beer element, but it will be around food, the opportunity to sell tea and coffee beverages, and we\u2019re in the early days there.","So there is an opportunity for us not only to continue to grow transactions, but also to grow ticket in different day parts. ","Howard Schultz ","I would add one thing, and I think this is an important opportunity to make this statement. Food at Starbucks, I think we could all admit, for many, many years was a weakness and a challenge for us, and I would say, unequivocally, with the acquisition of La Boulange and the execution of Cliff and his team, has now become a significant strength and a driver of multiple occasions, need states, and the opportunity for Starbucks to leverage day parts that we did not have access to before. And we\u2019re just getting started. ","Operator","The next question is from Joe Buckley with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Joseph Buckley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch ","Maybe some follow up on the recent food comment. Can you talk about food attachment rates? I guess I\u2019d be most interested in the morning day part, but maybe in total, and how those are trending, where you think they might go?","And then I wanted to ask one more, too, on the expansion. The Americas number being bumped up by 50 units this year, is that in the United States? Or someplace else within the Americas? That you\u2019re raising that target?","Troy Alstead","First, on food, we don\u2019t specifically disclose specific attach rates, so I won\u2019t give you a specific number to hang on. I will tell you, though, unequivocally, we are selling more food in the morning day part. Food is becoming an increasing driver - the fastest transaction growth we have in our entire store system is happening at midday and into the afternoon. And food, along with the refreshment category that Howard has spoken about, is the primary driver of that additional day part expansion.","So across all throughout the day, food is giving us an uplift in ticket, is contributing to, we believe, traffic growth into the stores, and there\u2019s no question it\u2019s driving an improved customer experience and frankly, increased pride among our partner base as we elevate the food program. So very, very healthy results all around. And at our investor conference this fall, we look forward to telling you about what the next wave of that looks like as we\u2019ll go deeper into our expanding lunch program at that point in time.","In the U.S. stores, and I\u2019ll make a comment, Cliff may jump in here, but what has been one of the most phenomenal stories for us in the past year or two or three has been first recovery several years ago but now the phenomenal returns we\u2019re seeing from new store growth and acceleration of that growth in our U.S. and broadly in the Americas, but specifically within the big system of the U.S.","The new store formats, flagship stores as Howard spoke about earlier, footprints that allow us to reach traffic that we never had access to previously, all are contributing as we\u2019re growing the system to an opportunity in the U.S. for an accelerating store growth both this year, which you saw in our revised targets today, but as we go into the coming years ahead, beyond any expectation we had previously. You\u2019ll see us continue to drive more stores throughout the U.S. in addition to day part expansion, comp growth, and increasing margin expansion and return on capital across the system. We\u2019re very pleased with what we\u2019re seeing across new stores in the U.S. market.","Clifford Burrows ","I think I\u2019d only add two other things. The opportunity that we identified a couple of years ago around drive-thru, that continues to strengthen. And I think the other thing is the geographic opportunity across a wide geography of the U.S. is what encourages us that this is a really good base to build on. ","And Troy said it, with the quality of the real estate and our absolute discipline maintaining our sales to investment ratio of two to one, and I also think the design quality, the team we have now, and you\u2019ve seen some great stores around the globe, but some of the stores we\u2019re now opening - you know, New Orleans in Canal Street is just phenomenal. Disney, Anaheim, just wonderful, wonderful stores that are really stretching those and giving us an opportunity to attract new customers and give us locations that we\u2019re incredibly proud of. And customers are reacting so well to these new locations.","Operator","The next question is from David Tarantino with Robert W. Baird.","David Tarantino - Robert W. Baird ","Scott, I had a question about the comments you made in reference to the fiscal 2015 guidance. I think you referenced some investments that you\u2019re planning to make, and I was wondering if you could elaborate on those and potentially the magnitude of those investments. And then secondly, if you could talk about, I think in the past you\u2019ve talked about the ability to carve out some costs out of the P&L through productivity and efficiencies. And I was wondering if those might start to kick in next year and offset some of those investments.","Scott Maw","On the first part of that question, we make a number of investments across the business to make sure that we can continue to drive the growth that you saw in this quarter, and so far this year. And those include things that we\u2019ve talked about before, around digital investments, technology investments, investments in our partners and in the stores, some of the things Howard talked about around innovation, around store design. All of that is an ongoing thing that\u2019s there to some level every year.","As we look forward to next year, there are some of those areas where we\u2019ll go a little bit farther, where we see an opportunity to extend our lead. For example, in digital card and mobile. We see things that we can do there. We\u2019re going to support that with the right level of investment.","Obviously, the overall revenue growth is more than offsetting that. We\u2019re still expanding margin. But we\u2019ll continue to set aside that amount of investment as we see fit, as we go through time. We\u2019ll be more specific as we get through the fourth quarter and finalize our operating plan. We\u2019ll be able to sort of articulate a bit more about what those investments are. But that\u2019s the general scope of what we\u2019re talking about.","And we do have, baked into the numbers that we\u2019ve shown you, an increase in a leverage, particularly around cost of goods sold and working capital, which we\u2019ve talked some about. So when you look at the target, every year we come out with a target for our supply chain organization. They\u2019ve done a tremendous job of hitting those targets.","But when we look at the targets that we\u2019ve set for next year across a number of different factors, we\u2019ve actually taken that up significantly, and that\u2019s contributing to the overall range that we\u2019ve provided.","Troy Alstead","Let me punctuate a comment Scott made, and that is that we are very, very bullish about the fourth quarter ahead, and about fiscal 2015. The targets we provided to you today that Scott\u2019s outlined reflect another quarter ahead of us as we finish out fiscal 2014 of very, very strong top line growth and earnings growth, earnings per share growth, equal or better than what we just delivered in the third quarter.","As we move into fiscal 2015 we\u2019re once again committing to double digit revenue growth to earnings per share growth in that 15% to 20% range, which we have consistently delivered for years now. And we can reaffirm that we will keep, as Scott has articulated, investing back into the business to drive that growth, take care of our partners, to make investments to the future, to make sure that this trajectory that we\u2019re on is sustainable. And we anticipate making those investments and delivering another fantastic year ahead.","Operator","Our next question is from Sara Senatore with Sanford Bernstein.","Sara Senatore - Sanford Bernstein ","","I actually wanted to ask a question on digital and mobile. Essentially, I think a couple of calls ago, or maybe last call, there was talk about potentially other retailers being interested in using the Starbucks platform. You know, white labeling I think. Could you talk about whether there\u2019s anything else to update us on? I mean, from the perspective of what you might think of as offering from a Starbucks ecosystem around that or where you\u2019re going longer term with that?","Matt Ryan","We can tell you right now that we are in a series of very active conversations on this with both technology and financial services companies that would be potential partners here. And while those conversations are going on, I can\u2019t tell you the specifics of them, but what I can tell you is we remain absolutely confident in the nature of the opportunity here, both in terms of what we\u2019ve started with mobile loyalty as a platform as well as the appeal of stars as currency.","And I\u2019ll leave it at that, and you\u2019ll hear more from us in the future.","Operator","The next question is from John Glass with Morgan Stanley.","John Glass - Morgan Stanley ","I wanted to ask about digital too, but on the potential for ordering on the mobile platform. Are your stores currently equipped to handle mobile ordering such that there\u2019s technology for the baristas to see an order come in? And some other retailers that have started to do this have seen a work process reengineering, because there\u2019s [unintelligible] that cash register as being the flow meter for products. Suddenly, there\u2019s the potential for a lot more velocity of orders to come in quickly. So are you thinking about labor reallocation in stores as you start to test this? ","Howard Schultz","I just want to frame this issue for you. I think at our core, the hallmark of everything we\u2019ve done for now, 40-plus years, has been the customer experience. We want to do everything we can as a company historically and in the future of really not becoming a fast food classic QSR company. And so the experience of Starbucks is really based on customized beverages and really creating this third place between home and work. And we\u2019ve created that now around the world.","It\u2019s clear to us in our research that express order and pay is a big, big idea, and a big enough idea that can create significant incrementality if done right. And I think the operative phrase here is, \u201cif done right.\u201d This is not something we are coming to overnight. This is something that has been very thoughtful, very disciplined, and part of the digital team of people, wide swath of people, looking at this to ensure the fact that not only do we deliver the capability, but we do it in a way that does not dilute the integrity of the Starbucks experience. ","And I can tell you unequivocally that Cliff and his team are going to execute this in a way that is going to be seamless and accretive to the Starbucks experience. ","Clifford Burrows ","Thanks, Howard, and the opportunity that our mobile MSR platform affords is just incredible, because we know the customers, they know how to use that technology in our stores, and I really see this as a great enhancement.","As you can imagine, we\u2019ve got a lot of people working on this to make sure the input comes in in the right place, the production falls into line with our regular rhythms, and that we are very clear on the handoff, how do we keep that interaction between our barista and the customer.","And really, it enhances the relationship we have with the customers, and we think this is going to be just such a great opportunity to increase capacity in stores at peak and just find new ways to fit into customers\u2019 lives. And we\u2019re going to do a significant market test before the holiday, and I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll learn from this and very rapidly then we\u2019ll start to roll out.","Operator","The next question is from Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo. ","Bonnie Herzog - Wells Fargo","First, I have just a quick follow on question from earlier, on Fizzio. Could you quantify any potential lift you saw in the quarter, and the lift you\u2019re ultimately expecting. And I\u2019d be curious to hear if you think it\u2019s in fact attracting new customers or primarily driving additional day parts.","And then I was hoping you could talk about any new relationships you\u2019re forming and distribution agreements you\u2019re signing to build your multibillion dollar global coffee packaged business, and what you\u2019re looking for in these partners, especially as you try to increase your global points of distribution, which actually could prove to be quite challenging.","Howard Schultz ","We had the real benefit of testing Fizzio. We tried to test it kind of under the radar, but many of you heard about it and saw it. That was last summer in Atlanta and Austin, and Tokyo and Singapore. So we had a lot of insight, a lot of knowledge, and we saw firsthand that we were creating something that had a day part opportunity and a refreshment need state that was beyond and accretive to Starbucks core products and core morning day parts.","And that is what\u2019s playing out. In addition to that, as Cliff said earlier, the food attachment that is linked to refreshment beverages, I think, is going to prove to be a plus for Starbucks. And with have certainly seen that with shaken iced tea on the Teavana side, and now with Fizzio. It\u2019s still early. I can tell you we\u2019re enthusiastic. ","It\u2019s a proprietary machine. I think our customers really like the fact - and this is something we saw in test and we\u2019re seeing it play out - in addition to the three Fizzio flavors, not unlike almost everything we do at Starbucks, our customers are now responding on their own and creating their own customizable carbonated beverage that is not even close to anything we\u2019re offering. ","","So we\u2019re seeing an opportunity to leverage carbonation beyond the initial flavor profile. And this is something part and parcel with Frappuccino for 20 years. And it\u2019s very interesting. It\u2019s exciting, and we\u2019re just giving it to the customer and let them be in control. And that\u2019s benefitting Starbucks.","With regard to packaged coffee and global partnerships, I\u2019ll give that to John.","John Culver","Today, we operate in 30 countries selling our either packaged goods or ready to drink product. Right now we\u2019re really focused on continuing to expand both the partnerships, but then also our opportunity for distribution in new countries, as well as going deeper in our existing countries. We\u2019ve seen strong performance in China, in the U.K., in Canada this year, which is driving our international growth. And we continue to look at opportunities for business partnerships who have capabilities in the areas of manufacturing, in the areas of sales, also in the area of distribution as we identify potential business relationships.","But this is an area that we are investing heavily in as a company. We see it as a future growth driver for the channel development business, since we\u2019re only in about half of our total markets we\u2019re in around the world. ","Howard Schultz ","We\u2019ve always believed that we had to be able to create the equity of that Starbucks brand in our retail stores first, create kind of impressions, the economies of scale, and the emotional connection in our stores, and then sequentially, as a result of that, be able to create new channels of distribution.","And as a result of that, the success we\u2019re seeing, and you saw it this quarter, is a result of the equity in the Starbucks brand being now available in places where people can find coffee and other Starbucks products where they shop for food.","And you know, I\u2019ve said this before, but we are probably the only traditional four-wall, bricks and mortar retailer that has now created multiple channels of distribution outside of our store base. One reason for that is we\u2019re a company owned system, so we don\u2019t have the franchise relationships, and we\u2019re not encumbered by them. But the other thing is the fact that our customers want Starbucks coffee and related products outside of our stores.","And when you look at comps of Starbucks at 7% U.S., what\u2019s not in the P&L, and probably was not in our remarks, is not only are we achieving 7% comps on a base of 6,800 stores, but we\u2019re also self-cannibalizing many, many things that we sell in our stores by having 100,000 points of distribution of Starbucks coffee and related products throughout the United States.","Operator","The next question is from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.","John Ivankoe - JPMorgan "," ","La Boulange and Evolution Fresh are about to be fully national within the company, at least the company store base within the U.S. Does this give you an as of yet taken advantage opportunity to market nationally the improvement and differentiation of these product lines? I ask this in the context, as I was surprised to see Teavana Shaken Tea on television these past months, and I was curious how advertising that product in a fairly new way did, and if you might see a similar reaction to some of your other sub-brands.","Howard Schultz ","Let\u2019s talk about Teavana fist, because I think it\u2019s a very interesting case test and study. When we acquired Teavana, the going in assumption was we\u2019ve got a $90 billion category that we believe was ripe for innovation. But we also had the inherent benefit of the opportunity to not only expand Teavana traditional stores in the U.S. and around the world - and I think over time, it will prove out that Teavana\u2019s greatest strength is going to be outside of the U.S. But that\u2019s for another day.","But I think the benefit going in was the fact that we believed that we could create significant incrementality inside Starbucks. Our tea business, before the acquisition, was less than half of 1% in Starbucks stores. ","By leveraging the Teavana brand and the quality of the tea, we are building a new category inside Starbucks. We\u2019re seeing significant growth in tea as a result of Teavana and Oprah Chai. But the real benefit is not only inside Starbucks, but the halo and the fact that we\u2019re creating awareness, we\u2019re creating a unique opportunity to build the Teavana retail brand as well.","So the advertising benefit is we\u2019re not only getting a return on the investment of advertising Teavana Shaken Tea in our stores, but we\u2019re getting the added benefit of being able to communicate the benefit of going into Teavana stores. And this is just the beginning. ","With regard to Evolution, we haven\u2019t talked about this in a while, but you know, a while back we announced a relationship and a partnership with Dannon. And in calendar 2015, you\u2019ll see the benefits of the partnership of Dannon, which will be integrated into Evolution products in yogurt.","Troy Alstead","And today, Evolution sits in over 12,000 points of distribution, whether it\u2019s through our retail stores or down the aisle.","John Ivankoe - JPMorgan "," ","And do you have an opportunity to put La Boulange on television, once that gets further along into your stores, in terms of how big that will be within the system?","Clifford Burrows ","No, La Boulange, for us, was the credibility and the base to grow quality pastries and that morning day part within Starbucks stores. Over time, it is about the full array of food that we serve at Starbucks, some of which will be pastries and some of those other day parts that Howard talked about earlier.","And obviously the big opportunity is to have food that complements our beverages. So the beverage will drive and the food will support that. We wanted to make sure that as we invested in food that we had great quality food that matches the customer expectation. And that\u2019s the role La Boulange has played in that morning day part.","Operator","The next question is from Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer.","Brian Bittner - Oppenheimer ","Can you remind us what percentage of the company operated stores have drive-thrus today? And on top of that, I\u2019d really like to hear what inning you think you\u2019re in on your speed and throughput opportunities at the drive-thru, and whether you view throughput at the drive-thru as a meaningful comp opportunity going forward, still as we sit here today.","Clifford Burrows ","We have just under about 50% of our company operated stores are drive-thru. In the new stores that we\u2019re opening, it is more than half of them, with the current year are going to be drive-thru. So it is a growing part of our portfolio. We have seen considerable improvement in throughput, and the drive-thru stores have been strong contributors to comp, both in the drive-thru lane and also in the in-store experience as well. And that\u2019s because we\u2019ve really focused on how do we serve the two customer need states.","We talked several calls ago about an enhanced drive-thru experience, and that really is we\u2019re going to have the opportunity to have face-to-face conversations with customers through technology and through digital, enhancing the experience for the customer, both in terms of how they order and how they pay in drive-thru, and how they keep out of the rain in those drive-thru lanes.","So all of those are investments we have tested. Really encouraged by it. And really, it will be three years we will do that rollout. Some will be on cycle renovation, and some will be to speed it up, where that opportunity exists.","So I think it\u2019s fair to say drive-thru will be a significant contributor, and it\u2019s an opportunity for comp. The good news is customer feedback, and what they\u2019re telling us, is the drive-thru experience is really important to them, because we meet them where they\u2019re at. It is not how they build the relationship, but that convenience and the ability for a mother to be in the car with her kids rather than offload the family is important. And the morning commuter.","So drive-thru is a focus. It has been a contributor to our comps over recent years, and it will continue to be so.","Troy Alstead","I want to add to Cliff\u2019s comments, because it\u2019s very important to step back and put several pieces together here. We just delivered a 7% comp growth in the U.S., across a huge system. Nobody with a system the size of this, with these volumes, at that age of portfolio, is delivering that kind of sustainable comp growth and driving margin expansion at the same time, while opening stores, while expanding our license footprint, and while expanding our CPG business in that same huge geography.","And things such as drive-thru and all the effort that Cliff and his team have put into enhancing the drive-thru experience to improving the flow-through and the speed of the car stack, the experience of the customer through drive-thru, has contributed, over the last years, and certainly in this quarter we just reported, that very, very strong comp growth, just as has the investments we\u2019ve made in food and beverage innovation, in the MSR program.","What you\u2019re seeing is the coming together of all these very strategic investments in the core of our business, and the brand, and the experience, and the product offering, and the channels of distribution, contributing to what is a world-class and quite a rare delivery of same-store sales growth through the big U.S. system.","Operator","The last question comes from Jason West of Deutsche Bank.","Jason West - Deutsche Bank "," ","Just going back to 2015 outlook, Scott, I believe that in the past you guys have provided some color on the margins that are embedded in the guidance. I don\u2019t know if you could offer any color on that for 2015. And just on the commodity piece, what you\u2019re assuming there for the unhedged portion. Are you kind of taking the current spot prices or futures, or are you making some other assumptions?","Scott Maw","On the first part, obviously consolidated margin will expand, just given the relationship of revenue growth and overall EPS growth. We\u2019re not going to give quite yet the individual business unit margin results. We\u2019ll wrap up our annual operating plan over the next couple of months, and then the fourth quarter will be far more specific about what we expect by each business unit.","As far as coffee goes, it\u2019s a good question. So we have about 60% of our coffee needs price locked for next year. And those prices are roughly flat to this year, up perhaps a little bit. Where we actually end up for the year, we still think it will be roughly neutral, but it will depend on how we lock in that last 40%.","So right now, we\u2019re thinking neutral, perhaps up a little bit. If coffee prices come down, there may be an opportunity to ease that a bit.","Jason West - Deutsche Bank ","But where the coffee futures are today would be sort of in line with that flat to up slightly? ","Scott Maw","Yeah, I mean, where we\u2019ve locked in is what it\u2019s in line - where we end up with that, that last 40%, will determine how much we swing within that range. ","JoAnn DeGrande","This concludes Starbucks\u2019 third quarter 2014 earnings call. Thank you very much for joining us. Have a good day. "],"20142":["Starbucks Corp.

I would like to welcome everyone to Starbucks Coffee Company's Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year End 2018 Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session.","I will now turn the call over to Tom Shaw, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Shaw, you may begin your conference.","Tom Shaw - Starbucks Corp.","Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us today to discuss our fourth quarter and full year results for fiscal 2018. Today's discussion will be led by Kevin Johnson, President and CEO; Roz Brewer, Group President Americas and Chief Operating Officer; John Culver, Group President, International Channel Development in Global Coffee and Tea; and Scott Maw, CFO. And for Q&A, we'll be joined by Matt Ryan, Chief Marketing Officer.","This conference call will include forward-looking statements which are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements. Any such statements should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements in our earnings release and risk factor discussions in our filings with the SEC, including our last annual report on Form 10-K.

On today's call, I'll provide an overview of a solid Q4 performance and summarize fiscal 2018. More importantly, I want to use this opportunity to reinforce the long-term strategic priorities we discussed on our last earnings call and provide additional details on the initiatives that support our strategy. I do this with the intent of showing you how we are executing against our plan which is, in turn, driving positive results.","Following my comments, I will turn the call over to Roz Brewer to cover details of our operating initiatives and performance in the U.S., followed by John Culver, to do the same for both China and our Global Coffee Alliance with Nestl\u00e9. This will reinforce that we, as a leadership team, are executing against a clear set of initiatives that are driving positive outcomes. Scott Maw will then cover FY 2019 guidance.","On the last earnings call, I shared that we were progressing well on our search for a world class CFO to succeed Scott. Last month, I was very pleased to announce that Pat Grismer will join us on November 12 and assume the CFO responsibilities at the end of November, when Scott officially retires. Pat brings a well-rounded set of experiences to Starbucks with a decade at Disney, more than 14 years at Yum! Brands, including four as CFO, and most recently, as CFO of Hyatt Hotels. He understands consumer brands, investing in relevant consumer experiences and capital allocation for food and beverage industry at scale.","Now, I'd be remiss if I did not personally thank Scott who joins us for his last earnings call. Not only for facilitating this transition, but also for all that he has done to support me and Starbucks over the past five years.","Now let's begin with the quarterly results. The fourth quarter showed significant improvement from the third quarter in nearly every critical metric and came in ahead of our expectations on comp store sales, revenue and EPS. While we still have work to do, these results provide encouraging evidence that our plan is working. Starbucks delivered Q4 net revenue of $6.3 billion, which represented 11% year-on-year growth.","I'm pleased to highlight that we posted a 4% comp in our largest market, the U.S., which was our strongest comp in the past five quarters. China, our second largest and fastest growing market, drove double-digit growth in total transactions when combining new store growth and total comp sales with the latter improving sequentially to a plus 1% year-on-year growth.","We delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.62 a share inclusive of a $0.02 headwind from the earlier than planned closing of the Global Coffee Alliance with Nestl\u00e9. For the fiscal year, Starbucks reached a record $24.7 billion in net revenue, up 10% over last year or up 8% adjusted for FX and streamline activities. We delivered a 2% global comp, while surpassing 29,000 stores.","Full year non-GAAP EPS grew 17% to $2.42 per share. While we ended the year on an upswing, we acknowledge 2018 has been a year of change along with some challenges as we sharpened our focus to drive growth at scale. The Starbucks brand is incredibly powerful and beloved by customers. We are a brand that stays relevant by constantly challenging the status quo, elevating the customer experience, investing in and empowering our partners, operating with discipline and adapting with agility. This is increasingly important today as consumers are interacting with brands in completely different ways and Starbucks is leading this transition both in our stores and digitally.","With an amazing brand and a large and growing addressable market, we have a clear set of strategic priorities for the future. These priorities are the foundation for the initiatives and actions you'll hear about today. As a reminder, our three strategic priorities include accelerate growth in our targeted long-term growth markets of the U.S. and China; expand the global reach of the Starbucks brand, leveraging the Global Coffee Alliance; and sharpen our focus on increasing shareholder returns. We are consistent in these priorities and have clear initiatives driving actions and results.","Before I hand the call over to John and Roz to highlight our Q4 progress against these initiatives, I want to add my perspective. Accelerating growth in our two targeted long-term growth markets of China and the U.S. acknowledges that these two markets are in very different stages of development. Our initiatives in the U.S. are focused on increasing customer visits by enhancing the in-store experience, delivering customer relevant beverage innovation and driving digital relationships. We are making progress in each of these areas and Roz will provide you examples of actions taken that led to the acceleration in comp.","When we look at the strategic priority of accelerating growth in China, our second largest and fastest growing market, a key metric is total transaction growth, which includes new store expansion as well as same store comp. We've now successfully unified Mainland China as a company operated market which has positioned us for long-term expansion.","In addition, we executed against a clear set of operating initiatives in China that delivered 3 points of sequential improvement in comp, which came in at a plus 1% for the quarter. We also announced a comprehensive China digital partnership with Alibaba, China's leading tech company. We're working closely with Alibaba to elevate the end-to-end customer experience for delivery in partnership with Ele.me.","Our second strategic priority achieved a significant milestone at the end of August when we closed on the transformative deal with Nestl\u00e9 ahead of schedule. And we now have successfully transitioned to healthy business in North America, retained great talent in key leadership roles and reinforced a global growth agenda which is now being operationalized through the alliance. This sets the stage for us to expand our CPG and food service businesses globally. And John will share more details with you on these plans.","Our third strategic priority is to sharpen our focus on increasing shareholder returns. Our work over the past year to streamline the company has been focused on three areas: retail market alignment, business simplification, and establishing the Global Coffee Alliance with Nestl\u00e9. Collectively, our streamline actions are enabling us to amplify our focus and resources on core value drivers for Starbucks.","The retail market alignment actions have successfully transitioned markets in Germany, Brazil, Taiwan and Singapore and most recently we announced definitive plans to license France, Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg to a long-term Starbucks partner who understands how to protect and grow the Starbucks brand.","Over the past year, our streamline actions to simplify the business drove decisions to sell Tazo to Unilever, close the Teavana specialty retail stores, transition our e-commerce business to our channel partners and simplify our SKU structure. More recently, we've taken steps to simplify work in our stores by automating inventory tracking and replenishment, which is enabling us to redirect more store partner time towards serving our customers. Business simplification is creating value through a more focused and more efficient operation.","Finally, as we enter the next phase of our agenda driving growth at scale, we are transforming how our functional support organizations increase the velocity of innovation for our store partners. Innovation that is relevant to our customers, inspiring to our partners and meaningful to the business. We view this as a multiyear initiative with our primary focus on increasing the velocity of innovation that results in a more efficient operation as measured by G&A as a percent of system sales.","All of these actions to streamline the company and change the way we work have freed up capital, which supports our commitment to return $25 billion to shareholders through fiscal 2020. In fiscal 2018 alone we returned nearly $9 billion to shareholders and effective October 1, we executed an accelerated share repurchase plan utilizing the $5 billion of after-tax proceeds from the upfront Nestl\u00e9 payment.","Now, I hope you share my optimism for the future of Starbucks. A clear set of strategic priorities, supported by a solid operating plan and focused execution in the quarter contributed to our strong result. With Pat Grismer joining Starbucks in mid-November, the leadership team and I look forward to hosting you at our December investor conference where we will share our assessment of the opportunity ahead and details of the initiatives that are driving business outcomes in support of our growth agenda. We look forward to seeing you in December.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Roz. Roz?","Rosalind G. Brewer - Starbucks Corp.","Thank you, Kevin. Last quarter, I shared how the Americas is committed to improving transaction comps by focusing on three operating initiatives: enhancing the in-store experience, delivering beverage innovation, and driving digital relationships. Today, I'll provide an update on the key initiatives we're driving in each of these areas, as well as a glimpse of what's to come in fiscal year 2019. I'll start first with a closer look at our Q4 results.","The Americas grew revenue 8% to $4.3 billion, generating $940 million in non-GAAP operating income and delivering a 4% comp growth. We also continue to see strong new store contributions with new non-comp stores accounting for 4 points of revenue growth. Beverage contributed 3 points of the 4 points of comp growth, the strongest performance of fiscal year 2018, and given it's our highest margin category, we're encouraged by this shift in comp growth.","We continue to grow transactions at peak and we showed modest improvement in the afternoon daypart. This resulted in improved one-year and two-year transaction comp in the quarter. At the same time, we continue to balance community and our commitment to the third place while serving the growing demand for convenience. Last quarter, our stores with drive-thru well outperformed our caf\u00e9 comp. And from a U.S. portfolio strategy, more than 80% of our new stores in FY 2018 were drive-thru and this format will be a continued focus into FY 2019.","Additionally, drive-thru, out-the-window and Mobile Order and Pay combined grew to more than 50% of the way customers are ordering, up more than 10 percentage points in just two years. And although we don't often report on our U.S. licensed store performance, it's worth noting that revenue and operating income grew at double digits in the quarter, the strongest performance we've seen in nearly three years.","Finally, Americas' non-GAAP operating margin of 22.1% was down 90 basis points from last year, primarily due to the continued impact of investments in our store partners in the U.S. including tax related wage and benefit investments and food and beverage related sales mix shifts. Stronger comp in the quarter drove improved sales leverage and bodes well for margin as we move into 2019. Taken as a whole, we made notable progress in Q4. Yet we realize there's still much work ahead, particularly as it relates to reversing our negative transaction trend. As we move into fiscal 2019, we are leveraging our positive momentum while staying focused on the same priorities and continuing to accelerate with excellence.","Now, I'd like to talk a little bit about our progress that we're making around our number one priority, enhancing the in-store experience. And this seems especially timely as we head into the holiday season. Last month marked my one-year anniversary with Starbucks, but I fell in love with Starbucks way before I ever joined the company. And I fell in love for the same reason millions of customers do again and again every day. And that's because we've always been about so much more than just great coffee. We build brand love and loyalty through the human connection between partners and customers. This makes us who we are and this connection has always been at the heart of the Starbucks experience.","But we haven't always made it easy for our partners to focus on their customers and truly lead in the moment. Complex tasks and unclear expectations often get in the way. This is the key reason we continue to focus on driving in-store improvements and tangible changes that put our customers first.","In Q3, we announced an ambitious target to cut up to 50% of current in-store administrative tasks by the end of fiscal year 2019 with the expectation this could initially unlock up to two to three hours daily for partners to focus on customer connections. We made solid progress against this goal in Q4, redeploying up to one-and-a-half hours per day of noncustomer-facing tasks to customer-facing activity, depending on the store.","I'll give you a few examples. We initiated automated inventory in 32 stores for all food products. We assigned a team to address dense urban market performance. New York Metro is the initial target. And lastly, we rolled out training to build leadership to facilitate creating best moments in our caf\u00e9s. And we're starting to see this work pay off. Our customer connection scores, which includes ratings on cleanliness and speed of service, in Q4 showed improvement across all dayparts and regions with September ending at an all-time high. Moreover, we're confident these activities will continue to pivot the momentum in the stores to grow transactions with all our customers, including the infrequent customer.","Next is our work in beverage innovation. This quarter's strong beverage performance was driven by innovation in key platforms, which includes Cold Brew and Refreshers. We also ramped installations of our successful Nitro offering adding nearly 700 stores in fourth quarter alone to reach 2,800 stores at year-end. This is a bullish sign for the future growth as these beverages combined with our core espresso platform represent our coffee forward heritage more than other more indulging categories. We are seeing customers adopt cold beverages across all dayparts and seasons, with sales growth after 2:00 P.M. improving for the quarter versus Q3.","Our third priority is digital and in Q4 we continued to advance our goal of acquiring digital relationships that will allow us to further build customer engagement in the future. For the quarter, active SR members grew to 15.3 million, up 15% versus last year and the strongest growth rate in seven quarters. These customers continue to drive nearly 40% of tender in the U.S. with Mobile Order and Pay representing 14% of transactions.","Additionally, we grew the number of digitally registered customers from 6 million at the end of Q3 to 10 million at the end of Q4. Currently, we're engaging with these customers directly via e-mail with offers like Happy Hour. But as we get to know who they are and what they want, we'll tailor specific offers with the goal of converting them to our SR program.","We also continue to look for ways to extend the Starbucks digital experience outside our stores as well. We started testing delivery in Miami this summer and the results are promising. It's a potentially exciting opportunity for us and I look forward to sharing more about our efforts in this area at Investor Day.","Kevin mentioned the work we're doing to reduce G&A as a percentage of system sales. We have taken this opportunity to increase our focus, which is enabling greater speed and agility by reframing our marketing and technology teams. An initial outcome is a combination of our consumer insights, partner analytics and marketing analytics functions into a new center of excellence.","As we elevate our ability to understand customers and drive that understanding through all of our customer-facing functions, we see significant benefits in combining these groups. The opportunity to unleash and democratize information across the entire enterprise, to ensure our customer is at the center of our day-to-day decision-making is powerful. And by having a smaller team and an easily accessible single source of the truth, we are enabling faster decision-making and delivering more relevant products and improved experiences.","Lastly, I'll share an update on holiday. Our customers tell us they love the holidays and Starbucks holiday cups are a cue that the season is upon us. Last year our stores didn't sufficiently reflect the festive environment our customers know and love and have come to expect from us. We leaned into that feedback and starting tomorrow, we'll unveil our full holiday assortment more than a week earlier than last year with the support of a more robust media plan. Our baristas will proudly wear their red aprons, stores will be adorned with holiday decorations and bright pops of red and green trim, and customers can begin shopping our collection of curated giftable merchandise, our whole bean coffee and Starbucks gift cards.","As we head into FY 2019, we're looking forward to sharing more on our work around our innovation in beverages, convenience and store efficiency at Investor Day next month.","I'll now turn it over to John.","John Culver - Starbucks Corp.","Thanks, Roz. Let me first start with some broader points on the China and Asia-Pacific region. CAP revenues grew 41% during the fourth quarter and 38% for the fiscal year. Excluding streamline activities and foreign exchange, revenues grew 12% in the quarter and for the year. Comps for the region improved to 1% for the quarter, led by a 3 point sequential improvement in China, which also delivered 1% for the quarter. Total transaction growth across China showed strong double-digit increases.","Equally impressive was Japan, which generated a solid 3% comp, which represents the best performance for that market in the past seven quarters. And Korea, our fifth largest global market, delivered a strong 10% system comp.","CAP's non-GAAP operating margin in Q4 represented the highest margin across retail for the company at 24.3% and when adjusting for ownership changes, it expanded 230 basis points over the prior year. Overall, for the year, CAP contributed an impressive 53% of our total revenue growth for the company.","Now taking a deeper look at China, we were very pleased with our performance as we executed and delivered against the Q4 initiatives we outlined in July. At our China investor conference in May, we shared with you our purpose-driven growth agenda, which outlined our areas of focus and the key operating initiatives we are executing against.","Let me comment on several of these initiatives as it relates to our performance and what we were able to deliver in the quarter. And let's begin with our stores.","In China, we exceeded our plan and opened 585 net new stores and entered 17 new cities during the fiscal year. For the quarter, we opened 139 stores and entered five new cities, expanding our presence to over 3,500 stores across 148 cities on the mainland.","More importantly is the fact that our new stores continue to achieve best-in-class profitability and returns and our new designs continue to elevate our brand and further define our leadership position in the market.","From a product innovation standpoint, the initiatives we introduced in the quarter were key contributors to regaining positive comp momentum. The actions were strategic, well planned out and aligned with the mind-set we have of investing in innovation and playing the long game in China. A few of the highlights were: our innovative and unique Coffee Meets Ice Cream platform which has been scaled to over 1,000 stores covering almost one-third of our store portfolio. This new category has proven to resonate with our customers and the adoption and repeat rate remains high.","We also continue to be encouraged by the opportunity we see for food. In the quarter, we had strong performance through our up-level bakery lineup and the investments we continue to make. And finally, the mid-autumn festival is an important holiday to our Chinese customers and their families. Our unique moon cake offering has become a tradition for many Starbucks customers. This year, we achieved high double-digit growth in both volume and in revenues.","Turning to digital. In August, we announced our new strategic new retail partnership with Alibaba Group. This partnership is not just about delivery. In fact, this is a comprehensive partnership that spans across their entire ecosystem including, Ele.me, Hema, Tmall, Taobao and Alipay to co-create an entirely new digital experience for our customers. This partnership will be the rocket fuel for our holistic digital flywheel strategy in China. Now, we're nearly a month into the rollout of our delivery program with Alibaba through its Ele.me platform.","Delivery has also been expanded to all our Starbucks stores in Beijing and Shanghai, and 11 cities in China. We've also piloted two unique stores, our Star Kitchens, which are located within Hema supermarkets in Shanghai and Hangzhou. Initial indications are our personalized Starbucks Delivers program is being positively received by our customers. The team in China is working at an unprecedented pace to bring Starbucks Delivers to more than 2,000 stores across 30 cities by the end of this calendar year.","And finally, as we look to optimize efficiencies to drive our business growth for the long term, I'm pleased to report that we have made tremendous progress on unifying Mainland China and integrating the East China business, all while continuing to deliver strong results for the year in the East China region. We have kept our new store opening momentum in the region. And similar to what we're seeing across the mainland, these new stores continue to deliver best-in-class performance and returns. In addition, we've identified and set the foundation in place to capitalize on the great synergies we can achieve on labor, G&A and supply chain, most of which we will begin to realize in fiscal 2019.","Finally, let me cover channel development and our Global Coffee Alliance with Nestl\u00e9. Revenues grew 4% for the quarter and 7% for the year, excluding streamline initiatives, which is in line with our prior business trend and continues to outpace the category. This includes continued share gains within total coffee, with Starbucks up 60 basis points to 15.9% for the quarter.","Non-GAAP operating margin was 42.7% in the quarter, a very solid result, even with the 150 basis point adverse impact of the Nestl\u00e9 transition and other streamline initiatives.","Regarding the Global Coffee Alliance, we have now transitioned over 500 Starbucks partners to Nestl\u00e9 in North America and Europe. This alliance leverages the unique capabilities of both companies, and we're focused on accelerating growth across three key areas: first, making Starbucks branded capsules available on the leading single serve platforms of both Nespresso and Dolce Gusto, second, expanding and growing our leadership position in North America, and lastly, rolling out and expanding in our international markets.","Now, given the final details of the closing, we now expect this deal will become accretive in fiscal 2020 which is ahead of our prior guidance of three years or sooner.","In closing, I look forward to sharing more on our plans and progress for both China and with the Global Coffee Alliance when we're together next month in New York.","And thank you, and with that, I'll turn it over to Scott.","Scott Maw - Starbucks Corp.","Thank you, John, and good afternoon, everyone. Kevin, Roz and John have discussed in detail Starbucks' strong performance across our business and around the world in Q4 and the meaningful improvement in virtually every critical operating metric we saw compared to Q3. On today's call, I will briefly cover Starbucks consolidated Q4 and fiscal 2018 margin performance and then turn to fiscal 2019 targets.","In fiscal year 2018, consolidated revenue growth came solidly within our long-term guidance after adjusting for FX and streamline related activities, and consolidated comp growth of 2% was just a bit below our long term range.","Consolidated non-GAAP operating margin was 18.1% for the fourth quarter and 18% for the full year, declines of 190 basis points and 170 basis points, respectively, relative to the prior year.","The primary drivers for these declines were partner and digital investments including the incremental expense resulting from investments we made following the tax law change as well as products mix shift largely in the Americas. Additionally, our Q4 performance also reflects an unfavorable impact of 40 basis points related to the Nestl\u00e9 transaction.","With the Global Coffee Alliance with Nestl\u00e9 now in place, we have redefined and realigned the financial results of our reportable operating segments to better align with how we run the business. These changes only had a nominal impact on segment performance in Q4 with the exception of EMEA where the shift in EMEA's Food Service business to Channel Development resulted in declines in operating income and operating margin. Our historical consolidated and segment level financial statements have been recast to conform to the new alignment and can be accessed on our IR website.","Let's shift to 2019 guidance. In FY 2019 you will begin to see some of the benefits from the significant actions taken in FY 2018 to position Starbucks for the future. We are confident that the momentum we saw in Q4 and what we believe to be a very strong beverage, food and merchandise lineup for the upcoming holiday season will enable us to deliver a great start to the fiscal year.","For fiscal year 2019, we expect global comp growth near the lower end of our current 3% to 5% guidance range. We expect to add approximately 2,100 net new Starbucks stores globally in fiscal 2019, down slightly from the nearly 2,300 net new stores added in 2018, and to end fiscal 2019 with over 31,000 stores.","China\/Asia Pacific will drive approximately half of our global new store growth in fiscal 2019, adding 1,100 net new stores including nearly 600 in China.","We expect to add over 600 net new stores in the Americas, a 4% increase, with the U.S. at plus 3% net of the accelerated U.S. store closures we discussed last quarter. And EMEA is targeting approximately 400 net new stores, virtually all licensed.","We are expecting another strong year of revenue growth in 2019 with consolidated revenue increasing 5% to 7% in fiscal 2019 including approximately 2 points of headwind from streamline-related activities.","Let me take a moment to talk specifically about the financial impacts of the Global Coffee Alliance with Nestl\u00e9. As you may recall, we initially expected revenue and EPS growth to both be impacted in 2019 by 2 points to 3 points. We now see the impact on revenue growth at the lower end of that range and EPS growth impacted by 1 percentage point to 2 percentage points.","We also stated that the deal would be accretive by 2021 as the domestic and international businesses gain momentum starting in the latter part of 2019. But as John stated, we now see accretion in 2020. So 2019 will come in ahead of our original guidance on the Nestl\u00e9 transaction on three key financial metrics: revenue, EPS and speed to accretion, further highlighting the strategic rationale and growth prospects of the Global Coffee Alliance. I would also add that shifting our CPG and Food Service businesses to a royalty model will impact operating income and operating margin. Specifically consolidated operating margin will be negatively impacted by about 100 basis points in 2019. Finally, the buyback impact related to the Global Coffee Alliance is significant as I will describe in a moment.","Fiscal 2019 consolidated non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be down moderately from 2018 with first half pressure expected from the tax reform investments that were made in the back half of 2018 and at the impact of the Global Coffee Alliance before returning to more consistent year-over-year levels in the second half of the year. Of note, we expect slight consolidated non-GAAP operating margin growth, excluding the impact of the Nestl\u00e9 transaction. The work we are doing to drive G&A savings will accelerate over the course of the year helping margin over time.","Let me add two additional points to the operating margin equation for fiscal year 2019. First, commodities are expected to have minimal impact on year-over-year COGS as some favorability in coffee prices is offset by higher dairy and fuel. Our overall coffee needs are roughly 90% price locked at this point for fiscal 2019. More broadly, we expect continued progress on our cost of goods sold savings targets that we outlined at our last Investor Day.","Second, a few comments on G&A. Last quarter, we outlined the three-year opportunity to remove around 100 basis points of G&A from our base of around $35 billion in system sales. We are on target to deliver what we said we would do. Excluding our planned 2019 U.S. leadership conference, which will meaningfully impact Q4 2019 G&A, we expect to reach about 35 basis points of run rate savings in G&A as a percentage of system sales through 2019. This puts us well on the path towards our three-year target. Kevin and the team will provide you a more detailed update on that front at our upcoming Investor Day.","From a segment standpoint for fiscal 2019, we expect Americas' non-GAAP operating margin to be down slightly from the prior year due to the significant tax reform related partner and digital investments we made starting in Q3 2018, which we will lap in the back half of fiscal year 2019.","CAP non-GAAP operating margin should be roughly flat to 2018 levels as strong operating leverage in China and Japan is offset by the impact of the ownership change in East China. EMEA non-GAAP operating margin should improve over the course of 2019 as the benefits of the shift towards licensed stores and G&A savings ramps up over time. We expect Channel Development non-GAAP operating margin to be in the high 30% range, down from just over 42% in 2018 all driven by the impact of the Nestl\u00e9 licensing transaction.","Below the operating income line, we expect lower interest income and other particularly in the first quarter given the significant unredeemed gift card balance benefit in the prior year and due to new revenue recognition accounting for unredeemed gift cards. We will adopt this new accounting prospectively starting in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, which will move this benefit to the revenue line. Higher interest expense in fiscal 2019 will reflect the additional leverage on the balance sheet, including the most recent $3 billion debt offering in August.","Regarding share count, Kevin highlighted that the proceeds of the Nestl\u00e9 transaction have been used to execute accelerated share repurchases effective October 1, 2018. The initial delivery of shares represented approximately 80% of the total that will be repurchased under the ASR with the balance of the ASR and other repurchases happening in the second half of the year. We expect our non-GAAP effective tax rate for 2019 be flat to down slightly compared to 2018.","Capital expenditures in fiscal 2019 are expected to total approximately $2 billion roughly flat to 2018 levels. Nearly 80% of 2019 CapEx will be allocated to Starbucks retail portfolio, new stores, renovations for existing locations, and strategic store related initiatives. This compared to 70% in 2018.","We expect non-GAAP EPS to grow 8% to 10% in fiscal 2019 to $2.61 to $2.66 per share. This includes our updated expectation that the Global Coffee Alliance transaction will lower 2019 non-GAAP EPS growth by 1 point to 2 points. Non-GAAP EPS growth in the first half of the year is expected to be below the full fiscal 2019 average due primarily to partner investments funded by tax reform savings and the additional benefits of share repurchases.","Full year non-GAAP EPS growth is slightly below our long-term guidance due to the impact of the Nestl\u00e9 transaction and tax related investments. G&A savings will start to build and deliver sustainable benefits later in 2019 and beyond. Additionally, non-GAAP EPS for Q1 is expected to be flat to down slightly related to Q1 2018 primarily due to the impact of the true-up of our liability for unredeemed gift cards in the prior year as well as dilution from the Global Coffee Alliance.","In closing, I would like to again thank all of you for your support over my past five years as CFO. And I would again like to thank Kevin and the many Starbucks partners with whom I've had the honor and privilege to collaborate during my seven years at Starbucks. And finally, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to our store partners who proudly wear the green apron and deliver an elevated Starbucks experience to our customers all around the world every day. I know that the best days for Starbucks are still ahead because of your unwavering commitment to serving our customers with passion and dedication, one cup at a time.","With that, I'll turn the call back to the operator. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Great. Thank you very much. First a clarification and then a question, first on the clarification, does the earnings guidance include the amortization from the Nestl\u00e9 gain? The $7.15 billion is the first clarification. Then secondly, on the question, I do know that there's obviously a target to reduce G&A 100 basis points as a percentage of system sales. At this point are you willing to commit to that being a net number? Or might there still be some investments that you decide to put against that number as we move throughout 2020 and 2021? Thank you.","Kevin Johnson - Starbucks Corp.","Take the first...","Scott Maw - Starbucks Corp.","Hey, John, thanks for the question. On the first part, yes, it is inclusive of the amortization of the revenue and as far as the 35 basis points this year and the 100 basis points over three years that is a net number. So there will be investments that happen within that, but that's a net number you'll see come out of the P&L.","Kevin Johnson - Starbucks Corp.","Did you clarify the...","Scott Maw - Starbucks Corp.","Amortization, it's in there. Yeah.","Kevin Johnson - Starbucks Corp.","Yeah. Okay. Got it.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Jeffrey A. Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thanks very much. Just two-part question on the U.S. comp, I'm just wondering if you can provide any color in terms of the sequential trends you saw through the fourth quarter, maybe what you think was the biggest driver of the uptick. Made it sound as if you have leveraging at positive momentum into this year, so wasn't sure if you'd provide any color in terms of that sequential trend and whether it continued into October. And then, Roz, if you could just provide any color in terms of the PM traffic trends. I think you said modest improvement versus 3Q. Wasn't sure if you would call that a noticeable change in trend that you expect to continue. Or is there any particular drivers that might have led the PM to get better sequentially? Thank you.","Rosalind G. Brewer - Starbucks Corp.","Yeah.","Kevin Johnson - Starbucks Corp.","Yeah, I'll let Roz answer the question on U.S. comp thing. I'll just mention though, too, you asked about October and I think Scott and I had said on the last call, we don't think it's helpful to be doing intra-quarter discussions. So, we'll stay away from that question. But Ros can shed some light on the Q4 performance on comp.","Rosalind G. Brewer - Starbucks Corp.","Yes so, let's \u2013 Jeff, let me see if I can break that down for you. So first of all, we did grow revenue 8% in the quarter. We continue to see strong growth in our new store contribution with new and non-comp stores accounting for about 4 points of revenue growth. Really highlighted in there from the beverage innovation that I alluded to, beverage contributed about 3 points of the 4 points of the comp growth with the strongest performance throughout the year hitting in the fourth quarter. A lot of that is based on the performance we're seeing in our cold platform and that cold platform is our Nitro, our Refreshers, in addition to Cold Brew and then Cold Foam. And so we're seeing it come through in our cold beverages.","And then the question that you had around the afternoons, if we're seeing some improvement there, I will tell you that when we removed some of the tasks that are happening in the stores to get the stores more efficient, we freed up time for the partners to interact with customers throughout that afternoon daypart, moving some of that, the routine tasks to closing freed up time for them to interact. And so we're seeing some nice movement between our customer connection stores and we know ultimately that relates to increased frequency and traffic. So we're encouraged by those things. You'll continue to hear us talk about beverage innovation because that's where we see our greatest push from transaction growth.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Tarantino with Baird. Please proceed with your question.","David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hi. Good afternoon. Similar question on the China trends. The China trends have been quite volatile the last couple quarters and I wonder if you could just elaborate on the factors you think drove the improvement this past quarter and how sustainable that trend might be because I know you mentioned some successful product introductions and those might be temporary. But could you just talk about the sustainability of what you've done in China and how you'd like us to think about the year for fiscal 2019?","John Culver - Starbucks Corp.","Yeah, David, I think that overall, first off, we're very pleased with the growth we saw in China in the quarter and for the year. So when you look at it in total, revenue growth across China grew 19% ex any of the equity or FX variables. And for the year, revenues grew 21%. So very strong growth across the market.","The majority of the growth, as we've shared previously, is being driven by the new stores and non-comp stores. So we continue to double down and accelerate growth on new stores. And we opened 585 stores last year, a total of 139 in the quarter and we opened five new cities.","We also as part of that then look at total transaction growth across the market, and as I shared, we saw total transactions grow in the double-digit range for the quarter, which indicates the fact that we continue to attract the existing customers frequency into the stores as well as new customers into the stores as we open stores.","Then you couple all that with the work that we did around product and around innovation and I talked a little bit about Coffee Meets Ice Cream, the roll-out that we've seen there, that had a \u2013 contributed about 2 points of comp contribution to us. We also saw a strong uptick on Cold Foam and then also food. Food we saw strong uptick as well given the investments that we're making across bakery and some of the other holiday food items.","Now all the performance that you saw in the quarter put aside the delivery opportunity that we have with Alibaba. As we shared, we announced the deal in August. We were just getting it rolled out in the month of September and so there is really no meaningful impact with delivery on the quarter. So we feel that the momentum that we have coming through the quarter and seeing the sequential improvement in comp, we will continue to see gains in comp as we work through the year. It will moderate in the first half of the year and it will accelerate in the back half of the year as we get delivery fully rolled out and as we continue to build out the new stores as well as continue to drive digital engagements with our customers.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Sara Senatore with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.","Sara Harkavy Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you. I have a question about margins if I may. So the Americas margins are down and I guess I was a little surprised because while I know you had guided to that last quarter, it seems like the comp you had was very strong, maybe as good or better as what you expected in the beginning of the year and it was entirely ticket driven. So I'm just trying to understand given that beverage mix was better, you had a ticket driven comp, why the margin? And I guess related to that with China, should we expect you to be reinvesting some of the cost savings that you've talked about in like product and partners or would we expect to see some of that flow through?","Scott Maw - Starbucks Corp.","Hey, Sara. Thanks for the question. It's Scott. So margin came in about where we would expect it with the comp growth that we had. We did see, if you take out the partner and digital investments that we did in the back half of the year from the tax savings, we did see the best margin performance that we'd had all year for any quarter. So if you back those out, margin was down just slightly and as you know, we've seen \u2013 and I'm talking about in Americas, we've seen the Americas margin down quite significantly particularly in the first half of the year before those investments. But as we came through the fourth quarter and you remove those incremental tax related partner and digital investments, margin performance was actually the strongest for the year. And maybe I'll have John handle the second part of the question.","John Culver - Starbucks Corp.","Yeah, Sara, on the margins, as it relates to China and the investments we're making. So we continue to make investments in our business in China as we continue to build on the foundation for growth, whether that is in IT, whether that is in supply chain, and more importantly around our partnership with Alibaba and the investments we need to make there. And then you couple that with the investments that we continue to make in our partner base and making sure that we continue to elevate Starbucks as an employer of choice in the market.","All those puts and takes within China lead us to a CAP margin that Scott guided to which would be roughly flat on a year-over-year basis. So we're able to absorb all those investments within the total CAP business and keep margin relatively stable on a year-over-year basis.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Glass with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks very much. I wanted to delve, Roz, maybe a little bit more into the check growth you saw this quarter. It sounds like it was beverage. So one, what was that? Was that trade-up to these cold platforms, for example, that you were experiencing? Two, I think in the past you've talked a little bit about your spend for My Starbucks Reward members have driven checkup. And so was that a phenomenon here as you sort of individualize offers and you're getting people to trade up more often? And how do you think I guess maybe longer term about it; right, traffic was down. Check was up a lot. You probably want it more balanced. Is your plan in 2019 to drive traffic maybe with lower check? Or how do you think about how 2019 plays out for check versus traffic?","Rosalind G. Brewer - Starbucks Corp.","Yeah, I'm actually going to start with your 2019 question around do we plan to drive with price in 2019? And actually, we have loaded in the plan just like we did in fiscal year 2018 about 1 point to 2 points of price. So we're going to stay pretty stable. We address that throughout the year \u2013 no particular beverage or food item or geography. We just balance it throughout the year. So no change there.","When we think about what's happening in terms of what got our movement in fiscal year 2018, it's a little bit of movement on what we're getting from our Starbucks Rewards members, and then it is the combination of looking at our Blended business and just supplementing that with the new cold platform.","So it's an and equation for our Beverage business. We're seeing nice food attached on our ticket as well, and as you know, our Breakfast business tends to do well for us, our hot sandwiches. Sous vide egg bites are growing nicely for us, and then the premiumization of frappuccino actually helped us as we transitioned to that in the second half of the year.","So it's a combination of things. It gets back to our strategic points of focusing on beverage innovation, continuing to drive our digital relationship with our customers, our Starbucks Rewards customers, and then just running the business through maintaining price at the 1 point to 2 points throughout the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matthew DiFrisco with Guggenheim Securities. Please proceed with your question.","Matthew DiFrisco - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Thank you. This is a question for Matt Ryan. Could you just speak to I guess as you've done in the past the My Starbucks Rewards membership, how those guys performed as far as a comp or their growth year-over-year, their spend? Can we get some color on that this quarter? And also some of the \u2013 maybe some other details on what you're seeing on the reloads and the potential for that to accelerate?","Matthew Ryan - Starbucks Corp.","Sure. Thanks for the question. I think the big headline was that we saw tremendous growth in the membership this quarter, and it's typically a quarter in the year when we don't see that. We tend to see \u2013 because of seasonality see a reduction. So up 15% year on year at the end of the year to 15.3 million members, and we had a few things contribute to that.","One is these digital relationships we've been talking about. We've begun to see conversion of those members into Starbucks Rewards members which is tremendously helpful. We've removed some of the friction in the funnel as well too, getting people into the program more easily, and just focusing on membership.","We continue to see year on year growth in spend per member. That is in the single digit range, again, and we're very optimistic about that because that shows that our members are in fact engaging, even the ones we've had for a long time. So we're very, very pleased with growth there and are looking forward to expanding the program and leveraging more of those digital relationships we have during the course of the next year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Charles with Cowen & Company. Please proceed with your question.","Andrew Charles - Cowen & Co.","Great. Thanks. Kevin, does 4Q's improved performance give you increased confidence in the long-term targets around 3% to 5% same store sales and 12% plus EPS growth? Or I want to patch early priorities to be taking a deeper look at these targets given initial 2019 guidance is at the low end or below these levels. And then Roz, if I could sneak one in there, can you talk about the performance of PSL in the quarter? This has been one \u2013 I remember historically, it's out-comped itself every year that you've been running it and the contribution that had to the 3% beverage comp. Thanks.","Kevin Johnson - Starbucks Corp.","Yeah, thanks, Andrew. I'll take your first question; then I'll hand off to Roz. Keep in mind that our FY 2019 revenue guide when adjusted for approximately 2 points of negative impact from the Global Coffee Alliance transition puts us clearly in our 7% to 9% top line revenue long-term growth range. Same when you look at non-GAAP EPS. When you adjust it for year one of the Nestl\u00e9 deal and the incremental investment from tax reform dollars we made in wage and digital that Scott mentioned before, puts our EPS at the lower end of that long-term guidance range. So I think clearly, FY 2019 is a transitional year, primarily driven by the Global Coffee Alliance with Nestl\u00e9. But that Global Coffee Alliance with Nestl\u00e9 is part of our long-term growth and value creation agenda.","And if I look at what we've done around the streamline activities over the last year, plus the Global Coffee Alliance, this positions the company to really focus on growth; not just growth at top line, but growth of operating income. And FY 2019 is that transitional year that positions us for that going into 2020 and beyond. Roz, you want to take the other question?","Rosalind G. Brewer - Starbucks Corp.","So the question on PSL. So we saw a nice sharp turn on PSL coming out of the season. We did something different with PSL this season. We really hit social media with it this time. As we've been talking about really getting behind the marketing of the brand and the marketing of the product and focusing on what our customers expect of us, PSL was one of those tried and true. So it came out of the gate strong and fast, signaled the quarter, the fall season so we were pleased. And it did a nice job for us through the quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Karen Holthouse with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Karen Holthouse - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hi. Another question on the digital side. So where you have established those kind of expanded digital relationships outside of the rewards program, it's great to hear that you are seeing conversion into the rewards program. But are you seeing incrementality in those relationships with the sort of more standardized, not as personalized offers? Or is that still an evolution to come?","Kevin Johnson - Starbucks Corp.","Yeah, Matt Ryan will take the question. Thanks, Karen.","Matthew Ryan - Starbucks Corp.","Thanks, Karen. I would just say that our journey with these customers has just begun. While we have as \u2013 brought in a tremendous number, millions and millions of new digital relationships, we've only now just begun to use those relationships. Some of it is in programs like Happy Hour, where we're using those relationships to bring people in across the year, and we're seeing that perform better year on year than the past way of treating Happy Hour, both in terms of revenue and profitability. But more important, we have to think of it as the top of the funnel; an enabler of the relationships that we can create that lead people eventually into the Starbucks rewards program. So we expect to see that continue to contribute to incrementality but over time. It's not something that we would hang our hat on just yet. We're moving in that direction.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Dennis Geiger with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Dennis Geiger - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thanks for the question, and Scott, thanks for all your help over the years and then best of luck, of course. Matt, I'm sorry but just one more follow-up on the digital engagement side of things. I guess just based on what you've seen thus far, 10 million members, a great number. Does that give you \u2013 does what you've seen so far from those 10 million digital engagement members, does that give you any greater confidence in that 1% to 2% comp contribution for next year? Is that still the target? And again, do you feel any better about that given you're already at 10 million members? Thanks.","Matthew Ryan - Starbucks Corp.","Yeah, again, I think that we have begun to build an opportunity for us, and we have not yet gotten to where we want to go. So we're just beginning to send offers to this group of people. We have not yet begun to personalize and that's something we expect to do later this year. It's going to take us time to feel confident, attributing how much business comes from any particular segment of customers but we are very, very encouraged by the responsiveness we see to people who commit to a digital relationship. Remember that we're not in the business of creating digital relationships for digital relationship's sake.","They're an enabler for us to communicate and talk to our customers. It is a way that we go to market. And by building that capability, it allows us to be less reliant on media and to be more reliant on customers pulling information from us in the future. And we're going to use all the toolbox that we've built with our SR customers with those customers over time, but it's not something you turn on all at once. It's something that's a journey for us and we're going to continue to go down that pathway.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Gregory Francfort with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.","Gregory R. Francfort - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey. I just had one on China and the competitive environment there. I think that was part of the reason for the softer comps in the third quarter. Is that \u2013 has that changed or materially changed in any way that you're seeing it let up? Or no change and this is more of a sort of internally driven change that you guys have driven with the company?","John Culver - Starbucks Corp.","Yeah, Gregory. First off, let me just comment on the competitive environment because I know there's a lot of press that's out there and a lot of questions. I think what we're seeing in China is that the competitive environment reflects the opportunity the market presents and the opportunity to continue to grow. And, obviously, Starbucks has been at the forefront over the last 20 years of building out a very strong coffee culture based on the premium position that we've been able to achieve, as well as the experience that we provide our customers.","We welcome all competitors and the market is going to continue to be competitive. At the same time, I would say that we are leading in many different ways given our brand and given the experience that we provide. We lead in the areas of product innovation. We lead in overall quality of the products that we serve. We obviously lead in terms of the service experience and that third place experience that our partners provide. And we lead in terms of the third place with the designs of our stores. All those things are not able to be replicated by the competition. You couple all that together with the elevation of our brand with the Roastery and the Reserve stores that we're opening and we are definitely building a very premium position in the market.","Now you add in the opportunity that we see with delivery and the opportunity that that gives us to extend our brand outside of our stores to where our customers desire Starbucks the most based on the need state of convenience, then you couple in the opportunity that we see with the Global Coffee Alliance with Nestl\u00e9 in China, with the Nespresso platform, with packaged coffee, with our RTD partner with Tingyi. All these things add together to build a very holistic opportunity that is unique to Starbucks and that cannot be replicated in the market by the competitors. So we feel as though we're in a very strong position to take on the competition, but at the same time, we remain focused on the long term and we remain focused on the strategy that we put into place.","Kevin Johnson - Starbucks Corp.","Yeah, I think \u2013 this is Kevin, I just want to add to John's comments as he commented on competition in China. And things that I think apply globally. The fact is that there is a large and growing addressable market around all things coffee. And as a company, we've been in this business for 47 plus years and built one of the world's most admired and trusted brands. And we've built that by delivering premium products and a premium experience in our stores. And that remains true today, the third place experience. And even as we've extended that to meet the need state of convenience, we work to do that in a way that is accretive to the brand and accretive to the experience in our stores.","So as John and Belinda and team have been working on delivery with Ele.me for example, we've integrated that fully into the operation of our stores so that we can create a great experience. But I think our ability to continue to differentiate as a brand that has a premium set of products, creates a premium experience in our stores, and is able to deliver custom hand-crafted beverages at scale, that is the formula that we're going to continue to stick to. And our investment in things like Starbucks Reserve Roastery is a brand amplifier.","The partnership with Nestl\u00e9 is a growth agenda, but it too is a brand amplifier as Nestl\u00e9 brings our coffee and tea products to CPG and food services. So we're going to stick to what got us to this point and the things that we think are defensible differentiators in the market and things that we do well and that will serve us well for the long-term in every market around the world.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matt McGinley with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.","Matthew Robert McGinley - Evercore ISI","Thank you. My question is on the Americas operating margin. Scott, you had mentioned that the margins would have been down a little excluding the partner and digital investments and I know that product mix will have an impact, but holding that aside, do you need a 4% comp to keep margins flat in the segment? Or with the labor planning tools and the cost management you have or you're putting in place, can you keep that margin flat on a comp on your 4%?","Scott Maw - Starbucks Corp.","Yeah, what we said is, if we can do a 3% comp with some transaction growth within that, we can drive margin expansion. And so the things that Roz is doing in the middle of the P&L, the things that she's doing from a store operations efficiency standpoint, things on waste, and even with that labor investment, if we can do a 3% comp with a little bit of transaction growth in there then we can drive margin expansion in the Americas.","Operator","Our final question will be from Chris O'Cull with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.","Unknown Speaker","Yeah, hi. Good afternoon, everyone. This is actually Mitch (1:05) on for Chris. Just a follow-up to an earlier question on China, could you give some color on what sales lift you expect to see from the Alibaba delivery partnership? And then what marketing programs will be tied to the Singles' Day coming up?","Kevin Johnson - Starbucks Corp.","Sorry, repeat the second question, Mitch? (1:05:17)","John Culver - Starbucks Corp.","Singles' Day in China.","Kevin Johnson - Starbucks Corp.","Singles' Day. Okay. So for the delivery opportunity, first off, we're still quantifying exactly what that upside is going to be, but we do obviously expect incremental upside. Initial reaction that we're seeing from customers is very positive, so we are seeing some transaction lift, but it's still too early to call exactly what that looks like.","And we'll have more details as we get into the Investor Day and sharing those details of what the roll-out looks like. We've gone through and we've renovated and innovated around all the packaging that we have going on out on delivery and really creating a unique Starbucks Delivers experience for customers in the marketplace.","So we're very optimistic about the opportunity on delivery. And it will be delivery unlike any other competitor is doing in the market. So more details to follow on that as part of Investor Day.","And then in terms of November 11, we always see a big day on November 11 as a company. We build that into our forecast, and that's built into the overall guidance that we put in place as we look through the year. But we expect it to be a big day.","Operator","At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin for closing remarks.","Kevin Johnson - Starbucks Corp.","Well, thank you all for joining us today. I did want to mention that we really look forward to seeing you at our December 13 Investor Conference in New York City. Today we spoke a little bit about the Starbucks Reserve roasteries, and we opened a beautiful Reserve Roastery in Milan, Italy last quarter. And so as part of the December 13 Investor Conference, for those of you who can attend, we would like to invite you to an exclusive preopening tour of the next Starbucks Reserve Roastery that will open in New York City. And then we look forward to hosting you all that afternoon for the Investor Conference. So thank you for joining us today, and we look forward to seeing you next month.","Operator","This concludes Starbucks Coffee Company's fourth quarter and fiscal year end 2018 conference call.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After speakers\u2019 remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions)","Thank you, Ms. DeGrande you may begin your conference.","JoAnn DeGrande","Thank you, Rachel. Good afternoon, this is JoAnn DeGrande, Director of Investor Relations for Starbucks Coffee Company. Thank you for joining us today for our fourth quarter and fiscals yearend 2012 earnings call. Opening the call today will be Howard Schultz, Chairman, President and CEO, and he\u2019ll be joined by Michelle Gass, President of our Europe, Middle East and Africa Business and Troy Alstead our Chief Financial Officer. The three presidents of our other segments Cliff, John and Jeff are also on hand for Q&A.","This conference will include forward-looking statements which are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements. Any such statements should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements in our earnings release and risk factors discussions in our filings with the SEC including our last Annual Report on Form 10-K.","Starbucks assumes no obligation to update any of the forward-looking statements or information. Please refer to the financial statements accompanying the earnings release to find disclosures and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today\u2019s call with their corresponding GAAP measures. The earnings release can be found on our website at starbucks.com under \u2018Investor Relations\u2019. This conference call is being webcast and an archive of the webcast will also be available on our website.","Before I turn the call over to Howard, let me cover a couple of additional items. First, given that this our yearend call we will extend it beyond 60 minutes as needed. And second, I\u2019d like to remind you that our Biennial Investor Conference will be held on December 5th in New York. We hope you\u2019ll join us in-person or participate via the webcast.","With that, let me turn the call over to you, Howard.","Howard Schultz","Thank you, JoAnn, and good afternoon to everyone on today\u2019s call. Before we begin, as a lifelong New Yorker, I\u2019d like to express my heartfelt concern for the many millions of people impacted by this week\u2019s devastating hurricane. The images we have seen and stories we have heard are beyond heartbreaking. All of us at Starbucks are grateful to the thousands of first responders who are courageously and selflessly responding to this disaster, and our thoughts go out to those directly affected.","I will now turn to the record fourth quarter and fiscal 2012 financial results Starbucks reported today. Q4 was an extraordinary quarter for Starbucks on almost every level. Record fourth quarter revenue of $3.4 billion, strong fourth quarter EPS of $0.46 which includes charges of $0.02 per share related to our store portfolio optimization initiatives in Europe, an increase in our total company operating margin to 15.4% and significant relevant innovation across our business segments and around the world.","Starbucks solid Q4 performance has ideally positioned us to go into holiday with strong momentum supporting a powerful lineup of holiday beverages and product offerings and to further our commitment to continue growing sales and delivering increased profits to our shareholders in 2013 and in the future.","Q4 also caps off a record full year in which our sales rose 14% to a record $13.3 billion, and our earnings rose 18% to a record $1.79 per share. What makes our performance during the quarter and the year even more remarkable is that both were achieved in the face of profound, continued economic uncertainty and challenged consumer environments in markets all around the world in which we operate and compete.","Starbucks ability to deliver the results we did in Q4 and 2012 is a reflection of the strength of our business and brand, our deep connection to our growing universe of global customers and the correctness of our go-to-market strategies. As we were all reminded at our Leadership Conference last month in Houston, the key to our success are the 200,000 Starbucks partners around the world who proudly wear the green apron and deliver the Starbucks experience to our customers every day. To each of my partners, I want to say that I am humbled by your dedication and commitment, and that you have my deep personal gratitude and appreciation for all that you do.","In fiscal 2012, Starbucks served nearly 3 billion customers who visited our stores, a statistic that testifies to the reach and breadth of our increasingly global brand and local relevance. And while the 18,000 stores in 61 countries we have today may sound like a large number, the fact is that the opportunity of Starbucks to grow our business around the world in a profitable, disciplined and deliberate fashion has never been greater or more exciting.","Over the past 12 months, we added over 1,000 net new stores with two-thirds of those being outside the U.S. and we remodeled more than 2,000 stores globally. Our plans call for us to open an additional 1300 net new stores and to remodel roughly 2,000 more in fiscal 2013. We are well on our way to having more than 20,000 Starbucks stores on six continents by 2014. After more than 40 years Starbucks worldwide appeal remains undeniable.","Starbucks is seeing strong and sustained growth in our core retail business across both the Americas, and China and Asia-Pacific regions where comp store sales growth reached 7% and 10% respectively.","I\u2019d like to personally recognize Cliff Burrows, President of our Americas segment and John Culver, President of China, Asia-Pacific for their leadership in delivering the tremendous results they did in Q4. Particularly noteworthy is that Starbucks U.S. business revenue grew 9% and U.S. comps grew 7% in Q4. Reflecting a level of execution and intensity that is nothing short of fantastic given the softer than expected performance we saw in Q3.","We accomplished our U.S. results by taking swift and decisive action to drive increased store traffic and improve operating efficiency, at the very first sign of the early summer slowing in traffic that we and many other retailers began to experience. And we continue to drive traffic in August by re-launching our popular and successful (inaudible) campaign and participating in a record-breaking, LivingSocial offer that was taken up by 1.5 million Starbucks customers, in believe it or not, in less than 24 hours. These initiatives also enabled us to generate incremental profitable sales, further communicate Starbucks\u2019 powerful value proposition and attract more customers to our U.S. stores for the September rollout of our full beverage lineup than ever before.","As I mentioned earlier, the strong momentum we saw in Q4 has ideally positioned us as we head into Q1 of 2013 and the holiday season. Our traditional red cups and holiday beverages are beginning to appear in stores as a prelude to the official kickoff of holiday of our U.S. stores on November 13th. And I can tell you that we have the strongest and most exciting lineup of handcrafted holiday beverages and limited edition products in store for our customers than ever before.","Also new this year, is Starbucks Christmas Blend Blonde Roast, a specially selected blend of Latin American and aged Sumatra beans that delivers a noticeably light and cheerful note. Christmas Blend Blonde Roast is a perfect complement to our fall \u2013 to our full lineup of holiday season offerings that extends both our Blonde Roast offerings and our best-selling Christmas Blend portfolio.","But the big news for Starbucks this holiday season is the innovation and opportunity we have unleashed with Verismo. The only single-serve beverage system that delivers perfectly crafted Starbucks Caff\u00e8 Lattes and espresso beverages as well as brewed coffee from a single machine. If you haven\u2019t tried Verismo yet, I urge you to. The Verismo system produces the highest quality, best tasting, in-home, single-serve espresso and coffee beverages anywhere, bar none. And it\u2019s the first and only single-serve machine that uses pods made from real milk to deliver beverage quality and versatility meeting Starbucks exacting standards.","In the eight months since we announced the Verismo system, we have successfully planned and executed the launch of Verismo in 6400 retail locations including premier specialty retailers like Williams-Sonoma in the U.S. where Verismo was chosen to be showcased on the cover of its holiday catalog. Harrods in the U.K., in Starbucks stores across the U.S. and Canada and through online e-commerce channels in 3 other countries.","We are supporting Verismo with only the third national TV campaign in our 41-year history, elegantly through the unique Starbucks lens and in a way that introduces and celebrates Verismo system and elevates the Starbucks brand. With more than 10,000 Verismo demonstrations and sampling events taking place over the next several weeks, we expect Verismo\u2019s momentum to accelerate through the holiday season and continue into the feature.","In addition to launching Verismo, our Channel Development team has continued to innovate in the premium single-serve category with other new product introductions across the portfolio, including Blonde Roast and our new successful Refreshers platform.","As a result of these and other initiatives, our Channel Development business increased revenues by 50% in fiscal 2012 to $1.3 billion. We have expanded our global Channel Development presence now to 20 countries and we are targeting tens of thousands of new points of distribution, but I can assure you Jeff Hansberry and his team are just getting started.","This month marks the first anniversary of the Starbucks K-Cup launch. And I\u2019m very pleased to report that in fiscal 2012, less than a full year of operation, we shipped nearly 500 million Starbucks K-Cups and have garnered a full 15.6% share of the premium single cup market, well above what people expected.","VIA also continued to grow sales in fiscal 2012. VIA is now available in 14 countries and 80,000 points of global distribution. It grew nearly 50% in FY12 and garnered a 7% share of the premium single cup category in U.S. grocery channels in Q4. Together, our complimentary and carefully planned and executed K-Cup, VIA and Verismo product and go-to-market strategies provide Starbucks with the strongest and most complete comprehensive lineup of products and the definitive winning hand in the premium single cup category, and there will be more innovation to come.","In 2012, we made significant headway against our ongoing plans to elevate and transform our food platform and bring authentic and delicious food to customers through the acquisition of La Boulange bakery. The fresh bakery products we are developing with the artists and bakers at La Boulange will rank among the very best bakery products you have ever tasted. We\u2019ve been testing new La Boulange offerings to a fantastic customer response and significant sales lift and now plan to rollout La Boulange products in 2,500 company-operated Starbucks stores across the U.S. beginning in the spring of 2013.","Evolution Fresh, another of our emerging brands is also helping to expand and enhance our retail store and Channel Development operation and processes. Last month, we opened an Evolution Fresh store in San Francisco\u2019s Fillmore district our third Evolution Fresh location in the first one outside of Greater Seattle. Our fourth location will be opening in Seattle\u2019s University Village shopping center later this month.","At the same time our Channel Development segment is continuing to significantly expand the availability of bottled Evolution Fresh juices through premium grocery channels in Starbucks stores. Evolution Fresh bottled juices are now available over 1,500 grocery locations including Whole Foods and Safeway and approximately 2,200 West Coast Starbucks stores, where we have seen a 100% lift over the juice product get replaced in our stores and we are on track to continue extending distribution of Evolution Fresh into more of our major U.S. company-operated markets throughout fiscal 2013.","And Starbucks is making a big difference in the business in just a short time we have owned the company. Sales of Evolution Fresh bottled juice, through all channels in the latest quarter, were up 50% over sales in the same period of 2011 prior to our acquisition of the company. Our intention is to create another dynamic national brand with Evolution Fresh. And to meet the anticipated demand for Evolution Fresh products, we are adding a state-of-the-art juicery in Southern California in late 2013 that will have four to five times the production and packaging capability of the current Evolution Fresh facility.","As I have noted in the past, Starbucks is embracing the seismic shifts in consumer behavior that are well underway. Let me now take a moment to share our progress and the investments we\u2019re making to continue our leadership in card, loyalty, social, digital and now mobile commerce, all of which will significantly enhance our customers experience with Starbucks.","Our card and loyalty initiatives are continuing to drive great convenience and value for many customers. This has been a record year with nearly $3 billion loaded onto Starbucks Cards, with Starbucks Card transactions accounting for over 25% of U.S. store tender.","The My Starbucks Rewards loyalty program has already amassed more than 10 million members, half of whom are active participants and have opted in to receive communications from us. As many of you know, we recently unveiled a number of enhancements to our loyalty program in the U.S. and Canada, including making rewards fully digital, making it easier for customers to earn free rewards, and including free food as part of the rewards option. As a result, we are already seeing record numbers of membership signups in the first few weeks of our new fiscal year, which really will bode well for fiscal and calendar 2013.","The depth and breadth of our digital assets continues to grow with leadership positions and engagement across Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest and many other relevant medium. All this progress will now become even more relevant given the sea change in behavior and experience enabled by the ubiquity and personalization of mobile technologies.","Our mobile payment platform has become the leading number one program for any consumer brand or retailer in North America, with now more than 2 million mobile payment transactions occurring every week and more than 100 million mobile payment transactions logged since the launch of Starbucks mobile payment app in January of last year.","We believe the rapid adoption of mobile gives us an opportunity to create a unique and much deeper relationship with our customers directly and in the moment like no other consumer brand or retailer. We have the unprecedented ability to reach new customers, create awareness to new products, drive incremental transactions and explore new revenue streams in music and digital publishing.","Recently, we have evaluated dozens of mobile payment solutions in companies, with an eye towards trying to find a company with a similar vision and approach to creating a mobile payment platform, where the customer experience is paramount. And that led us to Jack Dorsey and his team at Square.","By partnering with Square and accepting their innovative Square\t Wallet mobile payment app in our stores, we are able to not only offer a complimentary mobile payment solution to our apps but we are also able to reduce our interchange fees for U.S. debit and credit card processing. We\u2019re looking forward to Starbucks customers being to use able the Square Wallet app to pay for purchases with their mobile phones in U.S. \u2013 in U.S. stores later this month.","While we are proud of what we accomplished thus far in mobile, we plan to continue to push the envelope in the future by adding features and interactive activity in such areas as tipping, mobile ordering and personalization. And I can assure you, the best is yet to come in terms of the innovation that we are going to bring to the marketplace that creates separation, not only between us and other people in our space, but us and every other consumer and retail business.","While I touched on the enormity of the global expansion opportunity for Starbucks that lies ahead, I would like to take a few moments to update you on a few of our recent global initiatives. Two weeks ago, I was in India to participate in the extraordinary opening of our flagship store in bustling Horniman Circle area of Mumbai. Our Horniman Circle store, without question, the most elegant Starbucks store we have created anywhere in the world, is a stunning two level experience that celebrates sensibility and respect to the beautiful tapestry of India\u2019s culture, while at the same time embracing Starbucks unique coffee heritage.","In the days following the opening of the Horniman Circle store, we opened our second and third store in Mumbai. All three stores are exceeding our loftiest expectations. I cannot be more proud to enter the Indian market with the Tata Group, a global organization that shares many of the same values that Starbucks was founded on over 40 years ago. Starbucks opportunity in India is tremendous, and I\u2019m confident that India will evolve into one of Starbuck\u2019s five largest markets over time.","We also continue to deepen our connection to consumers in China, where recently alongside Apple and Nike, Starbucks was named one of China\u2019s top 10 foreign brands. And just last week Starbucks received best employer in China recognition. These acknowledgements are testament to the dedication of our 15,000 Starbucks partners in China who deliver the Starbucks experience to the millions of customers visiting our 700 stores in Mainland China each week.","Now despite recent economic reports pointing to a slowdown in China, it remains for us, one of the largest and fastest growing economies in the world, with rapidly increasing spending power of the fast-growing middleclass, and a market that continues to represent a major significant future retail growth opportunity for us. And Starbucks business remains extremely strong in China as evidenced by a 52% year-over-year increase in sales and double digit comps in China.","We\u2019re building the China market deliberately and in a brand accretive way by making significant investments in our people, our systems and our operations. And the connection our partners are building with our customers in China gives me great confidence that we can ultimately bring the Starbucks experience to tens of millions of consumers through thousands of stores across the Mainland. In that regard I am pleased to report that we are on track to reach our near-term goal of having 1,500 stores in China by 2015, and that China will soon be our largest market outside of the U.S.","Our journey across the China and Asia-Pacific regions continues as we look forward to opening our first store in Vietnam in early 2013.","Finally, I recently attended the 10th anniversary celebration of Starbucks entry into Mexico meeting with inspiring partners and taking part in the opening of the market\u2019s first lead store. With 350 stores in Mexico, it is Starbucks third largest market within the Americas region. Mexico is also a fast growing market in Latin America. Together with our JV partner Alsea, we plan to open 150 net new stores in Mexico over the next three years.","Before I introduce Michelle Gass, President of Starbucks EMEA, to share some of the developments and I\u2019m happy to say progress we are making in Europe and in the U.K., I want to tell you about the most important investment we will make all year in investment in our people.","Last month 10,000 Starbucks partners gathered in Houston, Texas for our Leadership Conference. Just as with our transformational conference we held in New Orleans in 2008, Houston provided an extraordinary and inspiring three-day opportunity for us to connect our leaders to the heart of our company, enhance and refine their coffee expertise, inspire leadership skills and perfect the art exceeding customer expectations.","The power and impact of the three days we spent together in Houston will reverberate throughout Starbucks this year and beyond, and enable us take our record breaking fourth quarter and 2012 performance to a completely new level in the future.","It\u2019s now my pleasure to turn the call over to Michelle Gass.","Michelle Gass","Thank you Howard and good afternoon everyone. I\u2019m delighted to be with you on the call today to update you on our EMEA business and the progress over the last year as our three-region operating model has taken hold. And as the EMEA leadership team and I have embarked on our transformation strategy or as we call it our renaissance plan.","The region today operates across 36 countries in nearly 1,900 stores. Over the last year, we\u2019ve opened 111 net new stores including 10 company-owned and 101 licensed. We\u2019ve grown our geographic reach most notably with our recently announced partnership in Scandinavia with Umoe Group. We will open our first stores in the early part of 2013 in both Oslo and Stockholm with this terrific new partner.","As you know, the EMEA region historically operates at significantly lower margins than the Americas and China, Asia-Pacific regions. There are several reasons for this. In our company-owned markets of U.K., Germany, France, Switzerland and Austria, our portfolio is dominated by high street shopping areas with occupancy cost 2 to 2.5 times that of the average occupancy costs in the U.S. as a percent of sales.","This portfolio is also not as broad as in other Starbucks regions, where highly productive drive-throughs, small footprint stores and a strong presence of captive audience, licensors also diversify the retail footprint. All of these factors, coupled with the fragile state of the European economy and one of the fiercest competitive environments in the world makes for a robust exciting challenge.","But on a positive note, these issues are largely within our control and we are taking actions. In the last year we had focused on driving results against three key strategies which are laying the foundation for a long-term profitable growth; first, increasing the Starbucks brand presence, health and relevancy across the region; second, unlocking the profitability of the existing base through focusing on top line growth and on operating cost; and third, positioning the region for growth primarily through licensing opportunities. I have great confidence that the region will achieve meaningful revenue and profit growth over the next five years and will deliver against our goal of mid-teens margin over time.","Let me recap how we performed in the fourth quarter and later I will add some colors to the actions we are taking and the progress we are seeing. In Q4, revenues declined 2% versus the prior year driven by unfavorable currency exchange, but partially offset by 29% growth in revenue from licensed stores.","Same-store sales were down 1% for the quarter driven largely by continued softness in Germany. And even though, the U.K. market delivered a slightly positive same-store increase for both the quarter and the year, this was dampened by continued weakness in consumer confidence and disappointing traffic levels experienced by most high street retailers throughout the London Olympics.","Beyond our company-owned operations, our JV licensed business has shown continued strength with the Middle East, Turkey and Russia driving strong comp growth during the quarter and throughout the balance of FY 2012. The more encouraging news for the quarter and for the year is the progress in operating income. While EMEA has had an operating loss of $6.5 million and negative operating margin of 2.3% for the quarter, it included $11.5 million of charges related to the optimization of our store portfolio and $9.2 million of asset impairments for underperforming stores in the U.K., Germany and France.","Excluding these charges, operating margin improved over the same period last year, as well as the second and third quarters of this year. We achieved this improvement through the efforts we have made on labor management, G&A, waste and a broad emphasis on cost control across all aspects of the business.","The European portfolio optimization work involved in a number of factions, each focused on improving profitability and strengthening our P&L. These actions included a thorough review of the U.K. store portfolio, which resulted in negotiated lease termination charges as well as the transfer of airport stores in the U.K. to one of our existing channel licensing partners SSP. As a result, operating margin contracted by 410 basis points.","As I mentioned, we realized $9.2 million of asset impairments for underperforming stores in the U.K., Germany and France. These expenses are a part of our normal quarterly review of underperforming stores and are not included in the portfolio optimization charges. They are reported in store operating expenses in our EMEA P&L and equate to a negative 320 basis points of margin impact in Q4.","In the fourth quarter, we also transferred ownership of 17 stores in Ireland to an existing licensed partner Entertainment Enterprises. Ireland has always been a small market for us and it made more sense to leverage a partner with the local knowledge and capability in that country to drive profitability and growth. This resulted in a $4.9 million charge, which shows up in the other income line of the consolidated P&L outside of EMEA results.","Looking forward there may be additional charges in the coming quarters, though likely to a much lesser extent than the Q4 as we have a handful of leases in which we\u2019re in the process of negotiating lease terminations. We know this is the right course of action to take and will leave us with a healthier, stronger portfolio upon which to build.","As I mentioned earlier, our blueprint for change the EMEA renaissance plan has incorporated many lessons from the successful U.S. transformation of 2008 and 2009, that I had the privilege to be part of, while applying the lens of unique business and consumer challenges of Europe. We\u2019re leading the organization to deliver our goals, bring relevancy in margin expansion and unlocking the region\u2019s growth potential through a disciplined set of actions addressing coffee expertise, our people, driving frequency and loyalty and boldly telling our story.","I\u2019ll share briefly with you some of the actions of the past 12 months, my first year leading the regional team. Coffee and people is at the core of our business and our brand and is a central long-term focus of this plan. Given how critical the role espresso plays in the lives of European consumers, we must deliver the best latte on the high street.","In the last year we retrained all of our baristas, we introduced foam art and we made changes locally to respond to the needs of our customers, including changing the standard of our most popular drink in U.K. the Tall Latte to double the espresso. Response has been positive and we view this as a long-term investment to winning in the U.K. market.","Equally, we have placed a significant focus on inspiring our people across the region and on shoring up the strength of the Starbucks\u2019 mission and culture. I have personally traveled now to more than two-thirds of the countries we operate in, conducting roundtables and open forums with our customers and our people, helping to shape our plans ahead. Driving our espresso focus through innovation, local relevancy and marketing will be the primary emphasis of the year ahead.","We have also applied great focus to enhancing the customer relationship and building loyalty and frequency. The biggest move we made this year was introducing customers\u2019 names on cups, including Starbucks\u2019 style chalk name badges on our partners, enabling greater customer connections. We are also placing a great deal of emphasis on the customer environment marrying the latest design ethos of Starbucks with local edge.","We renovated nearly 100 stores across the U.K. in-time for the Olympics. We opened now a globally acclaimed store in Amsterdam, two beautiful new stores in Madrid and Barcelona and are prepared to open an unbelievable flagship store in Kuwait with many more on the way.","We are also addressing value in relative ways. We launched Starbucks Card and My Starbucks Rewards across most of our company-owned markets and some of our JV and licensed operations. We are implementing value offers in markets across the region and we are dramatically increasing our presence in social media to connect with our customers through these important channels.","As I close out, I would be remiss not to acknowledge the recent media coverage surrounding our tax practices in the U.K. and across EMEA. For 14 years, Starbucks has been honored to serve our millions of customers across the region. We have never avoided paying taxes, and in fact adhere rigorously to the local accounting rules and tax laws everywhere we do business. And we have demonstrated our continued willingness to be open and transparent about our operations and their impact on taxable income.","We look forward to continuing to clarify our position about our European tax position in the days and weeks to come. And I\u2019m so proud of our partners and how they have responded to customers and worked with one another throughout this period. They allowed us to stay close to the needs and the voice of our customers and helped to ensure that this is simply a point in time along the way that won\u2019t affect our momentum nor our progress towards the objectives within the renaissance plan.","The work our partners are doing throughout the region, the passion they are bringing, the love they have for their customers and the Starbucks brand is at the core of the progress we are making. I have great confidence that, like the U.S. transformation, we are positioning this region for profitable long-term growth. Thank you.","Now let me turn the call over to Troy.","Troy Alstead","Thanks, Michelle, and good afternoon, everyone. As you heard from Howard and Michelle, we could not be more pleased with the trajectory of our business and the strong results we continue to deliver.","2012 was a record year for Starbucks producing new highs in revenues, earnings, operating margin and return on capital. The company is stronger financially today than at any time in our history. We have a healthier pipeline of profitable growth opportunities in front of us now than ever before and we\u2019re deeper in terms of talent and capabilities to pursue those opportunities than we\u2019ve ever been.","I will review the fourth quarter performance of our three other segments and the consolidated results for both the quarter and the year. Then I\u2019ll update you on our guidance for what we anticipate will be another strong year in fiscal 2013.","In the Americas, the fourth quarter was an impressive demonstration of the capability of that team and of their focus and adaptability. Revenues grew 9% for the quarter to $2.5 billion with 7% comparable store sales growth. Especially noteworthy about this result is that it came on top of 10% comp growth last Q4, which was the best quarter we have had in more than five years.","As we discussed on our last call, June and July were soft months in the U.S. Cliff Burrows and his team took quick action throughout the U.S. stores to turn the direction of our transaction growth. Our store partners continue to provide outstanding experiences to our customers every day. We reintroduced Treat Receipt in August and the annual fall favorite Pumpkin Spice in September. We\u2019ve provided customers value through the LivingSocial offer and we provided customers another reason to visit their Starbucks store with the launch of Refreshers. The result was a strong recovery of U.S. comp growth in the quarter to 7% with 5 percentage points of transaction growth.","Americas operating income for the fourth quarter grew to $536 million, nearly 21% above last Q4. Strong sales and a high level of operating efficiency again provided increased leverage as we expanded operating margin by an outstanding 210 basis points to 21.4%. Store operating expenses as a percentage of related revenues dropped 70 basis points to 37.4%.","Our experienced team of store managers adjusted labor schedules for the volatility we saw in the early summer period, which led to the right levels of store partners at the right time to deliver an outstanding Starbucks experience. Cost of sales and occupancy as a percent of revenues dropped 90 basis points over last Q4, due in part to increased sales leverage on our largely fixed occupancy costs.","Now, in the China and Asia Pacific region, significant revenue growth continues to drive high margin returns. Revenues of $198 million were 23% higher than last Q4, boosted by incremental revenues from the new stores that opened in fiscal 2012 along with comparable store sales growth of 10%. The 10% comp growth was broad-based as our four company-operated markets China, Thailand, Singapore, and Australia, all posted healthy increases. This marks the 11th consecutive quarter of double-digit comp growth in CAP and while some are lower than the growth rate for the past several quarters we\u2019ve been expecting that the extremely high comp growth of recent quarters would moderate over time. However, even with this expected slight moderation of comp growth, our business model in China remains outstanding and our growth acceleration plans are on track.","In addition to the strength of comp growth in the region, new store performance remained strong. The CAP team opened 132 net new stores in Q4, the most ever in a single quarter for this region. Many of these were in China where we ended the year at 700 total stores. But the absolute number of new stores is not our primary focus in CAP. We remain acutely focused on and encouraged by the performance of those new stores.","Stores opened in both fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2012 are delivering first year sales of approximately three times their investment, that is significantly above our targeted sales to investment ratio and speaks both to the high quality real estate our teams are securing, as well as the premium store experience we are designing and building.","A higher pace of growth needs upfront investment to support it. This includes initial rent as we prepare the stores for business, higher labor for the stores first 8 to 10 weeks to set operational standards and understand the cadence of transactions and other growth-related expenses.","These expenses were the largest contributor to the 340 basis point reduction in CAP operating margin in Q4 to 32.9%. A shift on our store portfolio composition was another contributor to the margin decline. As we have discussed in the past, we expect that as we continue our very profitable and rapid growth in China, we will shift the mix of stores in the region from predominantly licensed today to somewhat less licensed in the future. That business makeshift will have the impact of moderately reducing CAP segment margins over time and the shift did impact margins in the fourth quarter.","In Channel Development, we completed a very active year with a strong fourth quarter. Revenues of $319 million grew by $76 million over last Q4. This increase of 32% was driven largely by sales of Starbucks and Tazo K-Cups, which have gained nearly a full point of market share in food, drug and mass channels since June. Channel Development achieved its significant milestone in Q4 as quarterly operating income exceeded $100 million for the first time ever. This represents an increase of 26% over last year\u2019s fourth quarter.","Operating margin of 31.6% declined 155 basis points from last Q4. A shift in product mix as K-Cups grew their share of Channel Development revenue in the quarter combined with higher commodity costs totaled nearly 500 basis points of margin contractions. Partial offsetting by margin pressure was a shift in timing of marketing spend and increased sales leverage.","Now I will review our consolidated results for the quarter. It was clearly the best fourth quarter Starbucks has ever delivered especially given the persistent macroeconomic uncertainty and the softness in June and July. Consolidated fourth quarter revenues grew 11% to a record $3.4 billion. Net increase was driven by 6% global profitable store sales growth, the 32% Channel Development growth I just discussed, contributions from stores opened over the past 12 months and continued strong performance from our global licensed operations.","Our 6% global comp growth was driven by the strong results in the Americas and China\/Asia-Pacific regions. Five percentage points of the growth came from transactions with one percentage point from average ticket. Two year comp growth of 15% in the quarter represents acceleration from both the second and third quarters. Consolidated operating income grew 16% to $520 million in the fourth quarter. Operating margin grew 60 basis points to 15.4% driven primarily by increased sales leverage. Commodity costs did not have a material impact on consolidated operating margin in the fourth quarter.","Earnings per share of $0.46 grew 24% when excluding the non-routine gains in last Q4. As a reminder those non-routine gains resulted from the acquisition of the remaining equity in our Switzerland and Austria markets and the sale of corporate real estate here in Seattle.","The $0.46 EPS of this Q4 includes the $0.02 impact of two items; the $11.5 million store portfolio optimization in the EMEA P&L and the $4.9 million related to the licensing of Ireland that hit our consolidated P&L. The store closures and ownership changes are a key element towards strengthening the EMEA business and represent an important step in achieving our longer-term goal in that region.","For the full fiscal year of 2012, the results were equally strong. Total net revenues grew 14% to a record $13.3 billion with 7% global comp growth and 50% growth in Channel Development. The 7% comps were driven by a 6% increase in transactions as we continue to see new customers in our stores while also serving the same customers more frequently. In fact, we are proud to deliver such meaningful growth without relying on significant price increases as by and large we absorbed this spike in coffee costs this year through disciplined cost management and a relentless focus on providing experiences in our stores that encourage frequent customer visits.","We also set records for both operating income and operating margin at $2.0 billion and 15.0%, respectively. The operating margin expansion of 50 basis points over 2011\u2019s non-GAAP result was accomplished despite a negative 160 basis point impact or $214 million due to higher commodity costs in fiscal 2012.","Throughout the year, our operating teams did an extraordinary job of improving efficiency and tightening managing costs, which drove leverage on our strong sales and offset the impact of historically high coffee costs.","The result of the revenue growth and margin expansion was record earnings per share, which for the full year reached to $1.79 that equates to 18% growth over last year\u2019s non-GAAP EPS of $1.52 per share, falling squarely within our stated long-term guidance of 15% to 20% annual EPS growth.","We opened 1,063 net new stores across the globe in fiscal 2012. 665 of those were licensed stores, which demonstrates the continued strength of the many valuable licensed partnerships we have around the world, and then nearly, 400 company-operated stores we opened in 2012 are exceeding our first year sales projections indicating another class of stores that will contribute to long-term sustainable growth.","The strength of our business results in significant cash generation, allowing us to invest in our existing portfolio of stores and in future multi-channel growth opportunities while also increasing the cash return to shareholders.","In the fourth quarter, we repurchased approximately 12 million shares of stock. Additionally, today, we announced that our Board has approved a 24% increase to our quarterly dividend from $0.17 per share to $0.21 per share. I will now give you an update to the initial fiscal 2013 outlook that I provided on last quarter\u2019s call.","We continue to target revenue growth in the range of 10% to 13%, driven by mid-single digit comp growth of approximately 1,300 net new stores and continued strength in channel development. The 1,300 net new stores represent an increase over what I provided last quarter, driven by further acceleration in China and Asia Pacific. We now expect CAP to open 600 net new stores in fiscal 2013, with roughly 50% of those been licensed.","China will account for slightly more than one half of CAP new stores. Our America\u2019s estimate of 600 net new stores and our EMEA estimate of 100 net new stores are unchanged.","Capital expenditures are now expected to be near $1.2 billion in fiscal 2013. This increase reflects the growth in new stores, continued focus on renovations as well as investment in additional manufacturing capacity.","Full year consolidated operating margin is now expected to grow by approximately 100 basis points over fiscal 2012, as we continue to drive leverage. I will provide operating segment margin targets at our Investor Conference in early December.","Given the strength of our global business, the momentum we carry into 2013 and the deep pipeline of profitable growth initiatives, we are raising our fiscal 2013 earnings per share target to a range of $2.06 to $2.15. This represents 15% to 20% growth of our fiscal 2012.","While we expect each quarter to fall within that 15% to 20% growth range, our first quarter EPS is expected to come in at the low end of that range. This is due to investments unique to the first quarter, including our leadership conference which was held in early October and cost approximately $30 million and the launch of Verismo.","We are positioning Verismo for a significant impact in the years ahead and are approaching that as a major platform launch with significant spend in marketing, sampling and store labor. As a result, we expect that Verismo will produce a net loss of approximately $30 million in the first quarter and a total net loss of $30 million for the full year. The launch of Verismo this quarter is just a beginning. We will build and expand the Verismo platform in order to pursue the multi-billion dollar global opportunity.","And finally, we continue to expect a net benefit of approximately $100 million of $0.09 per share in fiscal 2013 due to favorable commodity costs, which is included in our targets. We believe that impact will be spread evenly throughout the year at approximately $0.02 to $0.03 per quarter.","2012 was a phenomenal year for Starbucks by every measure. We strengthened our operational muscle with record productivity in the U.S. and enhanced capabilities around the world. We strengthened our tie to our loyal customers, with enhancements that provide significant rewards through our loyalty program. We strengthened our global portfolio by opening profitable new stores, by closing unprofitable stores and by filling the small markets to local licensees.","We strengthened our product line up with significant innovation around refreshment, health involvements, at home coffee, and a huge opportunity in food. We drove strong financial results reaching records for revenues, earnings, operating margin and return on capital and we increased cash returned to shareholders with prudent share repurchases and a growing dividend.","We are excited to leverage these strengths and momentum in 2013 in ways that greatly reward our customers, our partners and our shareholders. And we\u2019re confident in our outlook of continued, strong, profitable global growth in the year ahead.","With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to the operator for Q&A. Rachel?","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of John Glass from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","John Glass \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Thanks very much. I wanted to just go back to the U.S. and the same-store sales that you reported and what the turning point was? We all assumed you entered the quarter in July maybe comping 5%-ish, but you ended at 7%, so it implies there was a fairly dramatic acceleration. So, was that a consistent acceleration to the quarter, was there a bigger response say to the Treat Receipt?","And just \u2013 and just in general, what other elements do you think drove it, because what you did during the quarter was impressive from a promotional standpoint or from an execution standpoint, but I didn\u2019t think any of those stood out my mind as being events that would drive comp acceleration to this magnitude, so maybe any other color around that would be helpful? Thanks.","Troy Alstead","Sure, John, thanks for your question. Let me start just briefly and then I\u2019ll ask Cliff Burrows, the President of our Americas business to speak more specifically about the actions in the quarter and what the impact of some of those things were.","Yes, you\u2019re right, the July, similar to June and as we discussed at our last earnings call in late July, was a soft month for us. Soft, still growing in traffic, still total comp growth growing, but softer than we had been trending earlier in the spring.","As we progressed through August and September, we saw a very, very significant recovery in our same-store sales and absolutely exited the quarter in a much healthier place than where we entered the quarter.","With that, I\u2019ll have Cliff speak a little bit more specifically to some of the actions we took.","Cliff Burrows","Thanks, Troy. Thanks, John. It really was an intense focus on the operations of our stores and our partners did an amazing job just getting about on daily work and that was focusing on the customers we had in front of us. Treat Receipt was well received by both our partners because they\u2019re familiar with it and our customers because it was an all-favorite coming back. Between Treat Receipt and LivingSocial, I\u2019d say that accounted for about 1% comp growth in the period where we run it and we also in this period launched our Refreshers platform, which was in there in handcrafted and in cans in our stores, and all of that gathered a momentum and gave us good pace for the future. So, it really was a great focus on the business and really closed with the way everybody responded.","Troy Alstead","John I\u2019d just add one thing that the public doesn\u2019t see directly and that is the use of all of the social media channels that we were able to leverage. Starbucks is at any given month a leading brand on Facebook and Twitter. As a result of that, we were able to leverage a level of engagement with a large number of customers, millions of Starbucks fans and customers and direct them to the store in ways that really reduced traditional marketing spend. And I think between that the operations that Cliff talked about, the effectiveness of Trade Receipt and LivingSocial, we were in a position and then towards the end of the quarter, we began to have a great result with Pumpkin Spice Latte, which got off to a fantastic start despite the fact that it\u2019s been year-over-year. All of those things bode very well for the quarter; and as we said, a stunning turnaround from Q3.","John Glass \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matthew DiFrisco from Lazard. Your line is now open.","Matt DiFrisco \u2013 Lazard","Thank you. I just wondered if you can give us a little color on sort of those remodels. I think you touched on about a little over 2,000. What you\u2019re seeing as far as volumes afterwards and the key initiatives to those remodels, I guess, is it longer term for setting up for better products and more products to sell or is there also sort of a near term added benefit with any sort of improvement on throughput during those high peak times, because your traffic number looks extremely strong and I\u2019m curious if that\u2019s a reflection in part due to some throughput initiatives?","Troy Alstead","Matt, let me start to address it, but I\u2019m also going to ask Cliff to get into a few more specifics. We have, as you said, a long list of major and minor and everything in between remodels over the past year. And as Howard mentioned, I think 2,000 remodels planned and we expect to be on a pace of level like that for some time.","Now I would point out that somewhere in the neighborhood of 2,000 remodels, a smaller number, somewhere in the mid-100s are more major significant type of things that might involve a very substantial change or the expansion of a store, the balance of them may involve more minor changes that aren\u2019t just significant remodel of the store. So, it\u2019s a varying degree of impact both on the store itself and on the results to come out of it.","Needless to say, Cliff will go into more specifics, but as we do particularly those major remodels on that individual store, we see a very, very, very significant increase in comp growth in that store when we opened.","Howard Schultz","The store in Spring Street in SOHO is the prime example of that \u2013 of a significant remodel and as a result of that significant return on investment and an enhanced customer experience. I just mentioned that because it\u2019s in New York.","Troy Alstead","Yeah.","Cliff Burrows","Matt, hi, it\u2019s Cliff. The 2,000 you mentioned is obviously a global number approaching the 1,700 in the U.S. last year and then you fit into those categories that Troy said. And we are focusing on each refurbishment to make sure we treat it like a new store and equip it to deal with the changing customer base and changing demand around peak and at different times of the day. We\u2019re looking at it to enhance not only the experience, the seating, the flow and introducing innovation like clover and each time we innovate we bring in clover and that really helps us in many ways, helps us to build the relevance with our customers build our coffee authority and that intimacy and just keep raising the conversation around coffee and the level of our execution.","And so there isn\u2019t a sort of a general number I\u2019d give you as the benefit, because each one of them is unique and each one of them we try and do the best thing for our partners in terms of the work environment and our customers in terms of the experience and we\u2019ll do a similar number in the coming year in the U.S.","Matt DiFrisco \u2013 Lazard","Thank you. I just had one follow-up also. I guess you mentioned a little bit about the Evolution Fresh, the 2,200 West Coast stores, a 100% lift in that. Was that also \u2013 I\u2019m not familiar, I haven\u2019t gone to one of those stores \u2013 is that similar to how you did the Refreshers as far as have you combined that with putting the ready-to-drink product out with also any sort of assortment of handcrafted drinks with Evolution Fresh yet?","Troy Alstead","If I talk about Evolution Fresh in U.S. Starbucks stores, it is bottled beverages only. We have a range of six of cold-pressed beverages and it ranges from orange juice, which is the most familiar and the best-seller and it goes through to whether it\u2019s sweet drinks or essential vegetables, it\u2019s a wide range.","It supports our health and wellness platform and the increase that Howard refers to is a mixture of both ticket and volume, but it has been well-received in every single market. Future innovation will come from our learnings from Evolution Fresh stores, of which we opened the latest one in Fillmore Street last weekend down in San Francisco and as had a fantastic reception locally.","Matt DiFrisco \u2013 Lazard","Excellent. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein from Barclays. Your line is now open.","Jeff Bernstein \u2013 Barclays","Thank you very much. Just I guess a two-part question as we look to CAP and I guess specifically to China. One, just from a unit perspective, it seems like there is obviously an acceleration in openings, I know it\u2019s 300-plus in fiscal 2013, considering you only have 700 in total, obviously that\u2019s a pretty sizable up tick. I\u2019m just wondering, if you can give some color around real estate availability, whether you\u2019re seeing increased competition? We\u2019ve heard from others that perhaps the competitive environment to get these sites is going up and that\u2019s where the cost is going up with it. So, I\u2019m just wondering, if you could talk from a real estate perspective?","And then the other piece relates to the other driver of top line, which would be comp, and you mentioned I guess the 10% plus comp, which I guess, an impressive string of 11 straight quarters of that double-digit. I\u2019m just wondering whether you view like you said the deceleration \u2013 like how do you decipher between the deceleration due to the compares versus the deceleration due to what you kind of acknowledge was a macro slowdown in China? Thanks.","Howard Schultz","John?","John Culver","Yeah. Hi, Jeffrey, this is John Culver. First off, the opportunity that we have in China is enormous and we continue to see very strong acceptance of the Starbucks brand and when we\u2019re opening our new stores, we\u2019re opening both in our existing cities as well as new cities. We now are in 52 cities across the country. We opened 12 new cities this past year. And as Troy touched on, we\u2019re seeing a three times sales to investment ratio over the last two years.","So all indications for us is that China represents right now the most immediate and fastest retail growth opportunity that the company has in front of us, and with that what we\u2019re doing are making significant investments around our people in terms of ramping up the investment and the hiring and training of people to staff the new stores as well as investment in infrastructure from a supply chain and IT perspective. We\u2019ve also localized our design resource to help enable speed into the market of opening our new stores and then also invested heavily in research and development so that we can have locally relevant products that match the flavor profiles that our Chinese consumers want.","In terms of the real estate that we\u2019re seeing, we are seeing an abundance of available real estate and we\u2019ve invested in local teams in the major provinces in the major cities to go out and to capture that real estate opportunity and what we\u2019re seeing is that we\u2019ve been very well-received in the new cities that we\u2019re in, we are going into. Consumer response, we\u2019re seeing lines out the door and the new stores in these new cities are exceeding our expectations. So we\u2019re very optimistic and very bullish on the opportunity. We\u2019re going to stay very focused and very disciplined in the investments and monitoring the performance of our new stores and our existing stores and we\u2019re going to continue to drive relevant innovation into the stores so that we can continue to sustain the growth.","And as Troy pointed out in his comments also, there is a rebalancing that\u2019s taking place that as we continue to accelerate the new store growth, more of our sales growth is going to come from new stores versus comparable sales growth. So you\u2019re going to see a rebalancing of the portfolio and as part of that more company-owned stores versus licensed stores which is going to have a slight impact on margin over time.","Jeff Bernstein \u2013 Barclays","Is it \u2013 just to follow up, are you seeing any sign just from the macro perspective versus the compares whether or not you think consumer shifting to lower-priced items or any kind of mix \u2013 anything concerning versus just compare driven slowdown in comp?","John Culver","I haven\u2019t seen anything that\u2019s concerning to me at this point in time. I mean we monitor this very closely, obviously are aware of others \u2013 people\u2019s challenges in China, but for us, we\u2019re continuing to make the investments. We\u2019re taking a long-term view and we\u2019re pushing forward.","Troy Alstead","And Jeff, I would also just add to that that we are continuing to grow traffic in China, we\u2019re continuing to grow ticket in China, we\u2019re growing healthily across all day parts and the two-year comp growth is remaining very, very, very strong if you compare that over the last several quarters. I think that speaks to the fact that, yes, we\u2019re up against tougher compares. It wasn\u2019t all that long ago just a couple of years ago, where average unit volumes in our business in China were roughly a third U.S. levels. They are now well greater than half U.S. levels and catching up and by the way that comes at a point in time when average unit volumes in the U.S. have been growing and are at all-time record levels here in the U.S. and yet China has been growing quickly. So we don\u2019t see any concerns about growing volumes whatsoever.","Howard Schultz","John?","John Culver","Hey, Jeff, just one other thing I\u2019d like to also comment on in terms of real estate, one of the things that we did earlier this year is host the first ever landlord real estate conference in Summit where we brought in all the major owners of key developments across China. And Howard and I and Arthur Rubinfeld had the opportunity to sit and address them and talk about the investments we\u2019re going to make in China from a growth perspective, talk to them and share new designs and really start to build the unique partnerships that we wanted to go after with these key landlords and that is paying huge dividends for us.","Jeff Bernstein \u2013 Barclays","Very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sara Senatore from Sanford Bernstein. Your line is now open.","Sara Senatore \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","Thank you. I wanted to follow up on the top-line in the U.S. obviously again very impressive. I just \u2013 I\u2019m wondering as you look forward and it\u2019s also equally encouraging that you\u2019re sticking to the sort of mid-single digit comp guidance overall. If you could talk a little bit about","A, what your expectations are for the demand environment given that I don\u2019t think the overall environment got better just you seem to reaccelerate? And, B, if you can talk a little bit about in terms of contributions, is it more from new products, is it from Verismo, is it from things like \u2013 more like the Treat Receipt more \u2013 being a little bit more aggressive on social media that kind of thing? Just so we have some comfort in the bottoms-up driver of the comps?","Howard Schultz","This is Howard. I\u2019ll start, I think it\u2019s very interesting and multidimensional question. If you look at the last few years, there is no question that the economic environment in the U.S. has been very challenging, fragile, and depending on the region, very difficult at times. I would \u2013 I\u2019m not an economist, but I would say that the consumer environment is somewhat bifurcated and has been for a couple of years.","And I wouldn\u2019t describe Starbucks literally as a luxury brand, but I think we occupy a very unique space that is the premium brand and luxury brand within our space. At the same time, we are still very much an affordable luxury by not only people who are at the high-end of luxury consumers, but people who can afford Starbucks in all walks of life.","In addition to that, I think we have been able as evidenced by Q4 and I think this is really important and highly relevant. We\u2019ve been able to thread the needle to maintain and preserve and enhance our premium position as a premium brand, while at the same time, developing, offering and creating value propositions for our customers that in no way dilute the equity of the brand, but reward our customers by, in a sense, putting our feet in their shoes and developing value for them.","Having said all that, I think we are highly confident that despite any turn in the current economy that we can anticipate that we have the tools, the resources and most importantly, the power in the marketplace to navigate through this by what we\u2019ve been able to learn and the muscle memory that is inside the DNA of the company since transforming the company in 2008.","I do think the burden of proof is on companies and consumer brands to recognize there is a seismic change in consumer behavior, as I alluded to in my remarks, as a result of social and digital media and the emergence of mobile commerce and mobile payments. But we are in the most desirable position because of the investments we\u2019ve made over the last few years to not only be the leader in the space, but now have the tools, the resources and the capability to leverage those channels and means in a way that is almost unparallel in the marketplace.","So the short answer is, we are optimistic that we \u2013 and we\u2019re confident that we can continue to navigate through changes in the economy and we\u2019ve done it now year-over-year and I think turn in Q4 is not only stunning but gives us great confidence as we head into fall holiday in 2013.","Cliff Burrows","Yeah, if I can answer, so the other piece I think is about our people. We have invested greatly in our managers and our leadership and giving the tools to our partners to do their work and I think that has really helped us in terms of the amount of time we have to connect with customers, to improve the quality of the customer experience and the relationships we form. I think there\u2019s nothing better to support that than the fact we have 3 million Gold Card members as part of our My Starbucks Rewards and that just gives this dialogue and immediate feedback and such a richness.","And I think just to give you a little bit of additional (inaudible), we\u2019ve seen strong growth across the whole of the U.S. in August and September, and if I look back on the year as a whole, I\u2019d also say that. And the work we\u2019ve been doing around day parts, whether that is building capacity at peak or enhancing the food offer around other day parts, we have seen growth on all day parts. So we continue to grow at peak in the morning, but also at lunch, afternoons and now into the evenings. And I think that is what gives us the confidence about both the opportunity to grow more stores in the U.S. and to continue to grow average unit volumes by spending on day parts and our ability to deal with peak capacity. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Diane Geissler from CLSA. Your line is now open.","Diane Geissler \u2013 CLSA","Hello, can you hear me okay?","Howard Schultz","Yes.","Cliff Burrows","Yes.","Diane Geissler \u2013 CLSA","I wanted to ask if you\u2019ve seen any changes in the competitive dynamics within the CPG channel given the expiration of the patents on the K-Cups, have you seen any movement there from additional SKUs?","Troy Alstead","Diane, we\u2019ll have to introduce Jeff Hansberry, who is on the call and as you know, President of our Channel Development business and he will take that question.","Jeff Hansberry","Hi, Diane, thanks for your question. Yes, we have. We have seen the introduction of some private label offerings in the K-Cup space that have been previously announced that I think we\u2019re all aware of and we\u2019re starting to see some of those begin to show up on retail shelves. We have not seen a significant impact though to retail pricing or the competitive space. And in fact, we continue to see strong demand for Starbucks K-Cups from our customers.","Howard Schultz","Next question.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Keith Siegner from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Keith Siegner \u2013 Credit Suisse","Thank you. I just wanted to ask a question, thinking about all the various initiatives that launched this quarter from Treat Receipt, LivingSocial a number of different loyalty based programs. There was a lot of product news, marketing news and other promotion news in general, some of which was really unique and kind of differentiated. As you enter a period of deflation in 2013 and maybe beyond, does this free you up to say do a little bit more of this activity than maybe you used to? Is Q4 somewhat of the new base level, I mean we\u2019ve seen product in other news working very nicely across the sector and again does this deflation give you an opportunity to say, ramp that effort from maybe what we\u2019ve seen historically? Thanks.","Howard Schultz","Thank you for the question. This is Howard. I respectfully say, no. I think all of us at Starbucks are deeply committed to preserving and enhancing the equity of the Starbucks brand. And as a result of that, we want to be extremely disciplined and thoughtful about how, when and with who we might do things that create an offer, whether it\u2019s Treat Receipt that we did on our own or the relationship we developed with LivingSocial.","I don\u2019t think that you\u2019re going to see Starbucks go on sale or anything like that. I do think that we have to be ultra-sensitive to the economic issues and the pressure on the consumer, but I think we\u2019ve demonstrated over 41 years that the best anecdote for us is the experience we create in our stores, the quality of the coffee and the level of innovation.","I think what we haven\u2019t talked about today is because it isn\u2019t appropriate is the pipeline of products categories and innovation that we have in the near and long-term future, which I think is the strongest pipeline in the history of the company. We\u2019ve taken great steps to recognize that the status quo in our business or any business isn\u2019t going to be good enough, but I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to go down the road of discounting Starbucks. We\u2019re doing things on an ongoing basis that was highly selective at the time and we\u2019re not going to do that on a consistent basis.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jason West from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Jason West \u2013 Deutsche Bank","You guys touched a little bit on the food program that you\u2019re working to roll out with the upgrades there with the La Boulange product line. If you could talk a little bit about what you\u2019ve seen in the West Coast markets where you\u2019ve tested that, if you have any details or anecdotes or figures you could share on that and sort of what it looks like from a customer perspective when you make those changes?","Cliff Burrows","Thank you, Jason, it\u2019s Cliff. It is very early days and we have had 10 stores open in San Francisco where we have been developing and testing a specific line of pastries and muffins and the like for the morning business, we\u2019re really encouraged by that, and that\u2019s really been the very early steps.","This week and next week we launch in San Jose and that would be our first time outside of the San Francisco market and that will give us new learnings. The reaction from our partners in our stores about the quality of the food and the enhanced pride they\u2019ve got to share those products with the customers, the taste is absolutely fantastic and the reaction from customers in the stores we have served it so far has been fantastic. I think we\u2019ll be in a much better position after the San Jose launch to give a bit of color, a bit of a flavor and more detail of our rollout plans at the Analyst Conference in early December in New York. So, nothing specific to share, but we\u2019ve seen a great reaction so far.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Kelter from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Michael Kelter \u2013 Goldman Sachs","I had a few margin questions, I guess for Troy. The first is you raised your operating margin guidance for 2013 from 50 basis points to 100 basis points initially to a 100 basis points now. And I wanted to understand the puts and takes there and why you felt comfortable taking the guidance up before the year even started? And secondly, I hear you talk about your visibility into 2014 given coffee cost remain in the $1.60 range, which as I understand it is well below your lock cost for 2013?","Troy Alstead","Thanks Michael. Yeah, let me speak to the last part first. We have been doing some buying \u2013 early buying into fiscal 2014 on our coffee needs. We\u2019re not very far into 2014 yet, but we\u2019re going down that path a little bit and we\u2019ll talk about that in a bit more detail at the conference in December. Suffice to say though, as we\u2019ve talked about before, the early read and what we can see is that 2014 is likely to benefit from reduced coffee costs once again. The order of magnitude is too early to tell, but what I point out is that we will exit the year of 2013 with coffee costs significantly lower through our P&L than we entered the year of 2013 coming through our P&L. But again, that\u2019s a comment given what we see today, with not very much of 2014 locked at this point in time.","Now, in terms of margins we\u2019ve raised it today to the 100 basis points of improvement given the number of things that we\u2019ve seen as we come through the fourth quarter, the momentum we have both on the top line as well as the completion of the operating plans that we put together annually in the summer, prior to the start of the new fiscal year.","And that\u2019s given us confidence given again both the growth we see around the world, the investments that we know we need to make in new initiatives and the growth opportunities we have in the future and the margin improvement opportunities we have all throughout the P&L; in supply chain, in operations management, in leverage of G&A, an improvement in Europe, which we are expecting based on, as you heard from Michelle, some of the many changes that her and her team have been tackling over there. So, I would expect margin improvement really in a number of places in our business and it\u2019s all of that I have visibility into, that\u2019s given me the confidence in the improvement I talked about both in terms of operating margin as well as earnings growth in the year ahead.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Palmer from UBS. Your line is now open.","David Palmer \u2013 UBS","Hi. Congrats on the quarter and the year. I know it\u2019s early days on the Verismo, but what are some of the feedback you are getting from retailers and your own store managers on the machine? The strengths and weaknesses versus other products that are out there in the single-serve market?","Howard Schultz","Jeff, you want to start.","Jeff Hansberry","Sure. Hi David, it\u2019s Jeff Hansberry. We\u2019re very encouraged on the Verismo System. For us it\u2019s a first in a number of ways. It\u2019s the first system that makes Starbucks quality lattes, espresso and brewed coffee all from one machine. We get natural milk pods that are made from real milk, that deliver a great latte and for the first ever we\u2019re able to have Starbucks partners, our baristas actually go out and meet with customers in specialty retail stores and tell the story of Verismo and tell the story of Starbucks.","So, we\u2019re off to a very good start. Our shipments are in line with our expectations. But importantly, with a new system like this we are listening very closely to our customer feedback and the majority of feedback is very positive. We are listening for customer opportunities for improvement and we\u2019ll continue to do so.","Howard Schultz","Jeff, you want to just address the attachment on pods that we\u2019re seeing?","John Culver Well, it\u2019s still very early. We\u2019re only \u2013 we only got a months\u2019 worth of data, but at purchase we\u2019re seeing significant multiples of purchases of pods, actually well ahead of our expectations.","Howard Schultz","The other thing I would add and I think this is important and Troy alluded to this in his remarks. The launch of Verismo is the launch of a product, but behind the scenes it is the launch of a platform and a deep strategic commitment that we have to the single-serve category domestically and globally. If you look around the world at what Espresso has done building a multibillion dollar business, what Keurig and Green Mountain have done and then the nascent space that we believe exists in Asia and our brand position. This is a global long-term multibillion dollar business and we are just getting started. Verismo is just the beginning.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","John Ivankoe \u2013 JP Morgan","Thank you very much. A question on Europe, specifically if I may, there was a little bit of re-franchising activity I guess in Ireland, specifically you pointed out. Ad I just wanted to get the sense of how much of an opportunity that may exist for existing company store base, whether it is in Switzerland or France or the U.K. or Germany, but have you to perceive more of an asset-like model on those markets and whether they\u2019d be any constrains to earning pure company store, as well as still maintaining your footprint in any of the major markets where you currently are?","Michelle Gass","Hi, John, it\u2019s Michelle. Thanks for the question. U.K. is the central part of our strategy going forward, which is really a sea change in our opening plans. We see the licensing and franchising opportunity as tremendous. And it does a couple of things. First of all, it gives us access to places probably on the high street, which as I mentioned in the call earlier is largely where we are penetrated. And we have not only agreed with our existing great partners like SSP or Autogrill to have a more accelerated plan, but also bringing in new partners like for example in the U.K. Euro Garages, which is going to help us and compliment with us our plans to expand into hundreds of drive-thrus across the region over the next few years.","We see absolutely tremendous opportunity but it\u2019s largely about the new growth and our new growth will be dominated by licensing. We also are actively looking at the franchising opportunity and we have put that strategy in place in the U.K. and we are looking to extend that strategy across Continental Europe. And then as it relates to our existing base, we\u2019ll look at smart opportunities that make sense for the business then for our customers.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Greg Badishkanian from Citi. Your line is now open.","Greg Badishkanian \u2013 Citi","Great, thanks. Maybe if you could give us a little bit more color in terms of the coffee consumer, as well as the competitive landscape in Europe, and maybe any changes that you\u2019ve seen over the last quarter or two?","Michelle Gass","Yes. Thank you for the question. As I said earlier we face tremendous competition not only with a, I\u2019ll call them bigger chains but also with many small operators across the region. As I said I visited now many, many markets throughout my first year and what I will tell you consistently across both our customer and our partner feedback is what the customer is looking for is the Starbucks experience. And that \u2013 what we bring is unique product whether it\u2019s our Espresso, our Frappuccino, importantly the environment, free WiFi all of which are assets and we\u2019re also very focused on building like we\u2019ve seen in the U.S. our digital platform, our service rewards platforms etcetera.","So I would say that there hasn\u2019t been tremendous change for say over the year, but we are getting a lot closer to the customer and navigating in ways to bring local relevancy and that relates to, as I mentioned, focusing on espresso, bringing a new level of innovation in that category, and I\u2019ll be speaking to that when we\u2019re together in December and that\u2019s not only with products but in delivery systems. It\u2019s also around our food and importantly our environment. We\u2019ve now built a local design team in Europe, like in Amsterdam and some in the U.K. to really bring that local design edge to the customer experience.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Bonnie Herzog \u2013 Wells Fargo","Hello.","Howard Schultz","Hello. Hi Bonnie.","Bonnie Herzog \u2013 Wells Fargo","Hi. Just sticking on Europe, I just have a few questions. Could you provide more color on how you expect to improve your food offering in Germany and then in general what are some of the steps you are taking to develop a deeper consumer connection throughout Europe and then how long do you anticipate this will take? And finally, could you talk a little bit more about your action plan to fix some of your supply chain issues in the region?","Michelle Gass","Sure. Thank you, Bonnie for the question. I think there is few layers to that. First, let me address the customer experience. To build on what I said, really emphasizing what Starbucks has done so brilliantly over the last 40 years, is the first half get hand and we have done some things new in the region that we haven\u2019t done anywhere else in the world at this scale, which is things like deepening the personal connection, names on cups, names on partners.","And I can tell you that on roundtable since we\u2019ve put that in place the customers are really seeing this now as a unique thing that Starbucks does. And they are getting to know their customers in much deeper ways. We\u2019re taking advantage of our social media channel. We are outpacing many of competitors in the region. We have more than doubled our presence in Facebook and Twitter. We have done new websites across the region, both in company-owned and in licensed stores, all of which are surrounding and enhancing the customer experience.","As it relates to food, we\u2019ve made nice progress. I will tell you we\u2019re just getting started. In the U.K. we re-launched our muffin platform; dramatic improvement in quality. We\u2019re seeing that show up in customer response and in our sales. We\u2019re also doing some testing on new distribution models for food. We\u2019re working through and we stated this throughout the year. We had a major change in our logistics and we\u2019re working through that. We\u2019re very confident that as we move to the year ahead we\u2019ve worked out some of the start-up challenges that any retailer would have with that scale of a change.","And then to your specific question around Germany. As we studied the food opportunity there, there is lots of regional opportunities that we can take advantage of. The core Starbucks and the customer of Germany they want the core offerings. They want the muffins and the cakes and we have an opportunity to do a better job there.","JoAnn DeGrande","Thank you, Michelle. That concludes Starbucks\u2019 fourth quarter and fiscal year-end 2012 conference call. We thank you all for joining us. We\u2019ll talk to you again in early December at our Biennial Conference.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you.","Ms. DeGrande, you may begin your conference.","JoAnn DeGrande - Investor Relations","Thank you, Mike. Good afternoon. This is JoAnn DeGrande, Vice President of Investor Relations for Starbucks Coffee Company. Thank you for joining us today to discuss our fourth quarter and fiscal 2015 year-end results, which will be led by Howard Schultz, Chairman and CEO; Kevin Johnson, President and COO; and Scott Maw, CFO. Joining us for Q&A are Cliff Burrows, Group President, U.S. Americas; John Culver, Group President, China Asia Pacific, Channel Development and Emerging Brands; Mike Conway, President, Global Channel Development; Matt Ryan, Global Chief Strategy Officer; and Adam Brotman, Chief Digital Officer. Given all we have to discuss today, both Q4 and 2015 year-end results, along with introducing our initial fiscal 2016 growth targets, we anticipate this call will run longer today than our typical quarterly earnings calls.","This conference call will include forward-looking statements, which are subject to various risks and uncertainties that can cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements. Any such statements should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements and our earnings release and risk factor discussions in our filings with the SEC including our last report on Form 10-K. Starbucks assumes no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements or information.","Please refer to our website at investor.starbucks.com to find the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures referenced in today's call with their corresponding GAAP measures. This conference call is being webcast, and an archive of the webcast will be available on our website at investor.starbucks.com later today.","Let me now turn the call over to Howard.","Howard S. Schultz - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, JoAnn, and good afternoon, everyone. Starbucks record Q4 financial results highlighted by stunning comp store sales increases of 8% globally, 9% in the U.S., and our second sequential quarter of a 4% increase in global traffic, underscores the strength and relevance of the Starbucks brand around the world and the success of the investments we continue to make in our people, in our business, in new beverage and food innovation, and in ground-breaking technology innovation that is deepening our connection to customers everywhere.","Noteworthy is that Q4 represented our 23rd consecutive quarter of global comp store sales growth of 5% or more, a remarkable achievement given the scale, breadth, and complexity of our business and the fact that our global comp base now includes nearly 10,000 stores in countries and markets around the world.","In Q4, Starbucks increased revenues to a record $4.9 billion and non-GAAP EPS to a Q4 record of $0.43 per share, and for the full-year we generated record revenues of $19.2 billion, record non-GAAP EPS of $1.58 per share and we served over 72 million more customer occasions from our global comp store base than we did the year before.","Starbucks' performance throughout fiscal 2015 was outstanding by any standard, metric, or comparison. We are connecting more deeply and more meaningfully with more customers across all day parts than ever before, and we are delivering quarter after quarter of record-breaking financial results despite the accelerating shift in consumer behavior away from traditional bricks-and-mortar retailing and despite difficult macroeconomic retail and consumer headwinds that continue to challenge traditional retailers.","At our Investor Conference last year, we laid out for you our five-year strategic plan for growing our business and continuing to deliver world leading financial and operating performance and long-term sustainable profitable growth into the future. Starbucks is playing the long game, and our plan is premised on seven core strategies that are guiding both our focus and our execution.","Let me start with the first of our strategies. Creating brand differentiation to an elevated in-store customer experience brought to life through our over 300,000 Starbucks partners around the world who proudly wear the green apron, the best most engaged and customer-centric people in all of retail today.","Starbucks will continue to lead and to succeed, first and foremost, because of our partners. The investments we make in our partners and our partners' connection to our customers and our brand are at the center of what drives Starbucks' business and sets us apart from every other retailer in the world.","And the investments we make in our partners pay tangible dividends in the form of more satisfied and engaged partners, deeper connections among partners, and with customers and improved in-store efficiency, all of which contribute to an elevated in-store Starbucks experience for everyone, partners and customers alike.","Noteworthy is that today we are seeing improvements in partner attrition, a direct result of our partner investments at a time when the industry overall is actually moving in the opposite direction.","And we are seeing a direct correlation between reduced partner attrition and our business results. Our comp results are strongest where we are having our greatest success in reducing turnover. There is no doubt that our partner investments link directly back to our ability to post record profits, industry-leading global comp store sales increases, and back-to-back quarters of 4% increases in global traffic, and that they are driving our business.","As for the second of our core strategies; coffee leadership. I couldn't be more proud of the many ways in which we are extending our lead and creating greater distance and separation from our competitors. The Starbucks Roastery we opened in Seattle, last December is the first of several roasteries we have planned for major cities around the world, is clearly the world's definitive immersive coffee experience and the anchor of a new initiative in building 500-plus coffee-forward Starbucks Reserve stores in key global markets around the world. The Starbucks Reserve store we just opened in London just last month to tremendous customer response and acclaim is emblematic of our Starbucks Reserve store, the strategy and the initiative that's coming to life.","We continue to elevate and bring premiumization to the entire coffee category with our Starbucks Reserve brand. The Starbucks Reserve offers consumers the finest assortment of exclusive micro-lot coffees from around the world and is now available in thousands of Starbucks stores globally, reflecting a diversity of origin and sourcing capability that only Starbucks can deliver. We have now built seven Farmer Support Centers around the world, most recently in Sumatra, Indonesia, with the eighth opening in Mexico in 2016. Our Farmer Support Centers provide an on-the-ground agronomy service that promotes sustainable best-farming practices and augment our comprehensive approach to ethical sourcing.","Earlier this year, we verified 99% of our coffee as ethically sourced and our rigorous approach to environmental and social best practices in growing and processing coffee has enabled us to achieve this recognition. To date, more than a million farmers and workers on four continents have benefited from our farmer support programs, once again demonstrating Starbucks coffee leadership and authority and our commitment to giving back to the people around the world who support our partners and our business and the communities in which we operate.","Now some years ago, the suggestion was made that Starbucks may be reaching store saturation in the U.S. The data reported since demonstrates that nothing could be further from the truth. As in the intervening years, we have opened thousands of new stores with each successful class of stores outperforming the prior class. And our newest class of stores is performing at the highest level in our history, generating first-year average unit volumes of $1.4 million, up nearly 20% from only three years ago, while also delivering record profitability and returns on investment. At the same time, we continue to open new Starbucks stores and introduce dynamic new best-of-class store designs and formats like our express stores and drive-thrus, while meaningfully growing comps and without any net cannibalization of existing Starbucks stores operating in the same trading area. We cannot identify any other retailer that can make these kinds of claims, especially in today's very tough retail environment.","Our strategy for sustained long-term profitable growth is also emphasizing and identifying new customer need states and creating and fulfilling new day-part opportunities and occasions in our stores, growing our business in tea with the Teavana brand, and building our CPG business by leveraging customer affinity with the Starbucks brand, our strong customer loyalty and further extension of Starbucks Stars' down-the-aisle initiatives.","By creating more opportunities for more people to engage with us more often both inside and outside of our stores, Starbucks has successfully integrated and coordinated retail and wholesale strategy in driving our business and our growth around the world. It should be mentioned that no national or global retailer has been able to leverage a retail store footprint into a CPG business remotely approaching the size, scale and profitability of Starbucks. Today's Starbucks CPG business represents both a prime profit center for us and a powerful complementary channel of distribution.","Finally, a few thoughts on how we are leveraging technology digital engagement and loyalty to drive your business. By anticipating and beginning to invest many years ahead of the mobile technology curve, Starbucks today is defining customer-facing and partner-facing mobile and retail experiences of the future. And the technology innovations we are introducing are further strengthening our brand, improving our efficiency and in-store execution, increasing our profitability, enabling us to further extend our lead over competitors and, most importantly, enabling us to deliver an elevated Starbucks experience to our customers.","Starbucks occupies a front-row seat at the intersection of the physical and digital worlds like no other company anywhere in or out of retail. Our unique combination of assets that includes a growing global physical footprint of now over 23,000 stores, deep consumer engagement and trust in our brand, millions of customers every day and breakthrough mobile and digital technologies are together enabling us to extend our reach and deepen our emotional connection to customers everywhere in ways that were not imaginable even a few years ago. Our customers trust us and reward us with unparalleled frequency and loyalty, as demonstrated by the robustness of our business, the unprecedented increases in global traffic we are seeing, and the amount of currency preloaded on our customers' mobile devices. We continue to leverage all these assets in ways that are accretive to our business and to the heritage of our company.","Our industry-leading mobile app has emerged as an evolving platform and profit driver of its own, creating multiple touch points that will continue to drive incrementally and create new business and profit opportunities for us in the future.","The partnerships we've recently announced with The New York Times, Spotify and Lyft are the first of many partnerships that will enable us to increasingly leverage and monetize the platform and our other technology investments. Through these investments and the best-of-class mobile and digital experience that Starbucks delivers, we believe that we are building an unassailable position that will only strengthen and become more relevant as today's increasingly mobile-first consumer economy evolves.","But despite our industry-leading position in mobile and digital today, we are continuing to push the envelope and now have line of sight on the next-generation of features to excite and delight our customers and our partners. Mobile payment now accounts for 21% of all transactions in our U.S. company-owned stores, and although we only completed the rollout of Mobile Order & Pay across our system 7500 U.S. company-owned store portfolio in September, we were already operating at a run rate of over five million transactions per month. And that figure, believe it or not, is growing by the hour.","We have seen the pattern of accelerated adoption of Mobile Order & Pay with each successive region and market we enter play out over and over again. And I'm pleased to report that we are seeing it again in terms of this pattern, accelerated adoption, repeat in the early days of our recent international launches of Mobile Order & Pay in both the U.K. and Canada.","Membership in our fast growing and industry-leading My Starbucks Rewards program, our loyalty program, continues to grow, and we now have over 20 million members in countries around the world. And two weeks ago, we launched delivery in the Empire State Building to favorable customer and media response, and we'll be launching delivery in Seattle in conjunction with Postmates later this quarter.","But the growth in incrementality you are seeing today is only the beginning of an exciting evolution of Starbucks' business that commercialization of our new proprietary technologies is enabling, and it all is made possible by the investments we have made and continue to make in our mobile, digital, and loyalty programs.","As I was preparing for this call, I couldn't help but become a bit nostalgic as I reflected how gratifying this quarter and year has been. And now with a market cap poised to exceed $100 billion, how far we have come from that small coffee company in Seattle that had 125 stores at the time of our IPO in June of 1992. 23,000 stores in 68 countries around the world, close to 2,000 stores in China, over 2,000 stores in EMEA, and over a1000 stores each in Japan and Korea, and over 180,000 points of CPG distribution around the world.","The deep authentic connection our customers have with the Starbucks brand and with our people, our values, and our culture and the universal appeal of the Starbucks experience, stunning financial performance coupled with unmatched groundbreaking innovation that is relevant to our customers and our people and so much on the horizon.","Never in our 23 years as a public company has the Starbucks brand or our business been more relevant or been stronger. Nor have our aspirations and the opportunities that lie ahead of us. We remain humble and steadfast in our mission to build a great enduring company, and as managers and leaders to exceed the expectations of our customers and our partners.","With that, I'll turn it over to Kevin Johnson","Kevin R. Johnson - President and Chief Operating Officer","Thanks, Howard, and good afternoon, everyone. I'd like to take a few minutes to provide more color on the quarter and share my perspective on our business as we enter fiscal year 2016. Then I'll turn the call over to Scott, for details on our financial performance and outlook for fiscal year 2016","Howard highlighted a few key themes: Stellar operating and financial performance, our investments are paying off, and we have great confidence in our future. Since taking on the COO role in March, I've been personally focused on operationalizing the seven core strategies for growth we outlined at last December's Investor Day, allocating resources against those operating plans, and driving execution across the business.","The investments we are making are aligned with those strategies, and they are working, giving us confidence going into fiscal year 2016 that we have line of sight to our next wave of initiatives and the business outcomes that will follow. Let's take a look at each business segment.","Our fast-growing Americas segment continues to deliver industry-leading growth, posting 8% comp growth in Q4 with 9% comp growth in the U.S. Americas grew revenues 11% in Q4, fantastic operating performance for a business of its size, and it opened 612 net new stores over the past 12 months. Our beverage program, fueled by innovation such as our new Cold Brew and strong core beverage performance, drove six points of comp growth and delivered increased food attach. Sales of iced beverages, including Teavana Shaken Iced Teas, grew 20% year-on-year. And our limited-time offering line-up with the new and improved Pumpkin Spice Latte, Salted Caramel Latte, and Toasted Graham Latte performed well ahead of our initial expectations.","Noteworthy is that in fiscal year 2015, Teavana branded, handcrafted tea beverages generated nearly $1 billion of sales through Starbucks stores in the U.S., up 12% over last year. And we will be bringing Teavana branded, handcrafted tea beverages to CAP and EMEA in fiscal year 2016.","Food revenue grew 19% in the quarter, contributing three points of comp growth, including attach. Our breakfast sandwich platform, which has now doubled in size from just three years ago, is increasingly resonating with our customers, and our lunch program is accelerating. Our focus on creating new occasions enabled us to grow in every day part. The data is clear: Starbucks is increasingly becoming a food destination across multiple day parts.","We have momentum going into holiday, officially starting for millions of customers in the U.S. and around the world this weekend, when Starbucks cups turn red and we celebrate the return of Chestnut Praline Latte, Eggnog and Gingerbread Latte, Peppermint Mocha and Caramel Brul\u00e9e Latte. We've leveraged last year's learnings in a reimagined in-store experience for holiday and created an experience that embraces food and beverage innovation, while leveraging all of our best assets, including digital, loyalty, card, mobile and our global store footprint. Our partners are excited and they are ready.","This year, customers will find a new seasonal favorite beverage which builds upon the popularity of our Flat White and holiday beverages and the return of our holiday Dot Collection. We are expanding our dotcom gift shop to offer seamless online and offline shopping experiences. All the merchandise our customers see in our stores will now be available online.","Our Gift Card program is a big part of holiday. You may recall that last year, one in seven Americans received a Starbucks Gift Card over the holidays, generating over $1.6 billion in card loads in our first quarter of fiscal year 2015. This year, we've reimagined our card mall, expanded the program to include all U.S. company operated stores, and we're introducing a limited offering of premium cards. We're also bringing back the opportunity for customers to win something that isn't for sale: Starbucks for Life. This program will be exclusive to our MSR members, where they will have opportunities to win this very special reward. Noteworthy is that total card loads in the U.S. and Canada, including reloads and activations, in fiscal year 2015 totaled $5.1 billion, up 19% year-on-year.","Our China Asia-Pacific segment delivered comp growth of 6%, driven entirely by increased traffic, with revenue growing 110%, 18% excluding the impact of approximately $287 million from the ownership change in Starbucks Japan and negative impact of FX. The result is outstanding operating income leverage with 25% growth in the quarter. Building for the future, rapid store growth continues as we added a record 838 net new stores in fiscal year 2015.","Our new class of company-operated stores in CAP are outperforming the prior class, generating record AUVs and profit, results that demonstrate the accelerating strength and relevance of the Starbucks brand across the region. We now have over 1,800 stores in 95 cities throughout China. Our brand has never been stronger and our connection to our customers has never been deeper. We continue to introduce innovative new food and beverage items into the market, Cold Brew being one example, and we're leveraging all of our physical, digital and loyalty assets to become an increasing relevant part of the daily routine for our rapidly growing customer base in China. And we now have over eight million MSR customers in China, giving confidence in our commitment to having 3,500 stores in China by the year 2019.","Our traffic growth in China continues to outpace our CAP segment traffic growth overall, and we saw traffic comps in China accelerate throughout the quarter with continued strong momentum into October.","As we head towards the 20th anniversary of Starbucks Japan in 2016, our brand has never been stronger. With our business in Japan delivering another solid quarter of comp sales growth. And now with full ownership, we are positioned to accelerate growth and to leverage all of our mobile and digital capabilities as never before.","Noteworthy is that the company operated stores we acquired in Japan last year will be included in our global and CAP comp basis during Q1 fiscal year 2016.","EMEA's Q4 results demonstrate the success of our continued efforts to improve the profitability of our company-owned store portfolio, while at the same time as we grow our license business. Excluding approximately $40 million of FX headwinds and the transfer of 41 stores from company-owned to licensed, EMEA revenues increased approximately 8% in Q4. In fact, every major EMEA market posted positive comps in Q4, with the U.K., France, and Germany posting particularly strong comp growth.","Comparable store sales in EMEA grew 5% despite ongoing macroeconomic challenges in several markets in the region with a 3% increase in traffic, representing EMEA's 10 consecutive quarter of positive comp growth.","Our EMEA licensed markets are continuing to perform exceptionally well, with Turkey and the Middle East in particular continuing to outperform, further supporting our license-focused growth strategy.","By Q4, nearly 69% of our 2,362 EMEA stores were licensed, up from only 54% four years ago. And we intend to continue to grow our EMEA licensed-store portfolio. This strategy is working as EMEA delivered a full 37% increase in operating income over Q4 last year.","Channel Development Q4 revenues grew 14% over last year to $457 million. Despite continued competitive pressures in at-home coffee categories. We are pleased with the strength of packaged coffee sales in the quarter, which combined with K-Cup sales were the primary drivers of Channel Development revenue growth.","Our total K-Cup portfolio continues to gain share despite increased pricing pressure and additional new market entrants. In fact, Starbucks is now the share leader in both premium roast and ground and the entire K-Cup segment for the first quarter ever.","Innovation has been key in establishing our leadership position in the K-Cup category, and we're excited for customers to experience the new hot cocoa K-Cup beverage platform that we recently launched with classic and salted caramel hot cocoa flavor profiles.","We've also seen our Stars down-the-aisle loyalty program driving incremental purchases of roast and ground in fiscal year 2016, and we're expanding the Stars program to include select Starbucks K-Cup SKUs.","Foodservice also had a strong Q4 with 8% revenue growth year-over-year. Our broad product offerings to the foodservice trade are becoming increasingly appealing as businesses continue to differentiate themselves by providing employees with premium amenities in the workplace.","Internationally, we're seeing strong growth in the China Asia Pacific ready-to-drink sales. While this is a small part of our business today, it underscores the size of the opportunity presented by the strategic partnership we announced earlier this year with Tingyi. We also remain on track to launch ready-to-drink through grocery and convenience store channels in 10 Latin American markets with our long-term business partner, PepsiCo, in 2016.","As Howard mentioned, Starbucks has a front row seat at the intersection of the physical and digital world like no other company. Data shows that My Starbucks Rewards customers spend three times as much as non-MSR customers. The Starbucks digital experience is a key enabler of the loyalty program that engages customers and provides us with digital feedback to constantly improve the experience and attract more customers. It is a virtuous cycle.","The pace of digital innovation is accelerating. We completed the rollout of Mobile Order & Pay in all U.S. company-owned stores to an overwhelming customer and partner response. We launched the Mobile Order & Pay feature on our Android App and introduced additional functionality to provide real-time store-specific menu and inventory information.","We improved pickup time accuracy, all designed to add convenience and improve our customer experience. We have begun deployment in 150 stores in the U.K. and more than 300 stores in Canada, while framing plans to continue rolling out Mobile Order & Pay in key markets around the globe. We launched the Starbucks mobile app, both the iOS and Android versions in France and Germany. We're on track to deploy in Poland, Czech Republic, and Kuwait this year.","This quarter we've grown our active MSR customer base in the U.S. by 28% year-on-year, our active mobile users in the U.S. and Canada has grown 32% year-on-year. Mobile payments in October represented over 21% of U.S. tender.","We're launching delivery pilots in New York City and Seattle. In the coming weeks, we will launch a rich digital music experience, both in-store and out of store, integrated in our mobile app through our partnership with Spotify. Our digital momentum is real, and the roadmap for the upcoming year is bold. I'm convinced that Starbucks is doing something very unique and very special.","We operate a world-class bricks-and-mortar retail business with over 23,000 stores that is growing, and we are rapidly building a world-class consumer digital experience powered by a technology platform that complements and extends the scale of our brick-and-mortar business.","In my 34 years in the technology industry, it is difficult to point to another instance where an in-store experience has been extended to a digital experience in such a seamless and elegant manner. Many others in the food and beverage industry are now trying to follow in our footsteps by building a mobile app. From what I have observed in the market, Starbucks has built something that is differentiated from all of the others. Where others are attempting to build a mobile app, Starbucks has built an end-to-end consumer digital platform anchored around loyalty. This platform enables us to deliver new features faster, create a more integrated experience, and personalize those experiences for the consumer. I believe this approach provides a significant differentiation from others who are struggling to replicate the success we have experienced.","Q4 of 2015 is a reflection of the great work being done by our Starbucks partners around the world who are delivering innovation, driving operational excellence, and leveraging the scale, reach, and breadth of our capabilities and to continuously elevate the Starbucks experience. The accelerating momentum we experienced in Q4 and unqualified success of our long-term strategies for sustained, profitable growth has ideally positioned us for the future.","I'll now hand the call over to Scott, to take you through the quarter and our outlook for fiscal year 2016. Scott?","Scott Harlan Maw - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Kevin and good afternoon, everyone. Starbucks performance in Q4 reflected a continuation of the pattern of accelerating momentum we have seen with each successive quarter of fiscal 2015. Revenue and profit growth each finished at the high end of our Q4 estimates and each of our four reporting segments achieved operating margin in excess of 15% for the first time in our history. Once again, demonstrating the strength of the Starbucks brand and continued excellent execution by our partners across the globe.","Starbucks' strong Q4 results were particularly meaningful as they were achieved despite significant foreign exchange headwinds, and both the increase and acceleration of our partner and digital investments, investments that link directly to and in many ways are driving the comp and profitability growth we are experiencing.","Kevin has addressed much of Starbucks' consolidated Q4 performance, so I will only comment that our GAAP operating margin in Q4 was 19.7% and non-GAAP operating margin was 20%, up nicely from Q3, but down 50 basis points from Q4 of last year, due to the impact of partner and digital investments and the change in ownership of Starbucks Japan, partially offset by sales and cost of goods sold leverage.","Now on to the segments; revenue and operating income growth in the Americas continues to be very strong. In Q4, Americas' operating income increased 13% year-over-year to $840 million \u2013 $841 million on an 11% increase in revenues to $3.4 billion. And our operating margin expanded 40 basis points to 24.8%. Strong sales leverage resulting from a 9% increase in U.S. comps was the primary driver of the margin expansion, more than offsetting approximately 160 basis points of impact related to increased partner and digital investments in Q4.","GAAP operating income in our CAP segment reached a record $130 million in Q4, a full 25% increase over the prior year. GAAP operating margin declined to 19.9% from 33.5%, primarily due to the impact of the ownership change in Starbucks Japan. Excluding the 15.5 percentage points of financial impact from the ownership change in Starbucks Japan, CAP's operating margin increased by 190 basis points, driven primarily by operating savings in the region.","EMEA results in Q4 were particularly strong, once again demonstrating increasing momentum in the business and continued progress against our plan to significantly improve segment profitability over time. EMEA achieved record operating income for the quarter, and when excluding unfavorable FX impact of nearly $5 million, EMEA operating income increased by almost 50% year-over-year to $58 million.","And EMEA's Q4 operating margin of 17.2% exceeded expectations and marked the segment's fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit operating margin. EMEA's 510 basis point improvement in operating margin in Q4 over the prior year was driven primarily by sales leverage, including the impact of our ongoing portfolio shift to more licensed stores and gains on the sales of certain assets.","Channel Development grew operating income of 15% over the prior year in Q4 to $197 million, also a quarterly record for the segment. Operating margin totaled 43.2%, a 20 basis point increase over the same quarter last year, reflecting a significant increase in income from our North America coffee partnership with PepsiCo and improved cost of goods sold efficiency, primarily offset by higher coffee costs and marketing costs.","Before I wrap up Q4 and move on to a brief recap of our full-year fiscal 2015 results, I would like to note for Q4 comparison purposes two non-GAAP adjustments we made in addition to the adjustments we made related to our acquisition of Starbucks Japan.","First, as I previously shared, we refinanced $550 million of higher-rate debt in Q4 and incurred a charge of approximately $61 million, primarily related to an early redemption premium.","Second, our effective tax rate for Q4 2015 reflects an incremental tax benefit related to certain additional domestic manufacturing deductions to be claimed in our U.S. consolidated tax returns. These deductions are retroactive to fiscal-year 2010 and lowered our tax rate for Q4 of 2015 by 7.3% relative to Q4 of 2014, resulting in a GAAP effective tax rate of 27.2% for the quarter.","Starbucks delivered excellent operating performance and financial results for the full fiscal year 2015. In addition to record revenue and operating income, we also drove operating margin expansion of 10 basis points on a GAAP basis and 50 basis points on a non-GAAP basis, both ahead of our initial margin guidance provided in Q4 of 2014.","Excluding 90 basis points of impact from the change of ownership in Starbucks Japan, our operating margin once again expanded by over 100 basis points in 2015, driven by sales leverage, including significant leverage in cost of goods sold, reflecting the ongoing success of our efforts to drive efficiency in this critical area.","In fiscal-year 2015, each of our reporting segments achieved record operating income. In terms of operating margin, our Americas segment drove margin expansion of 80 basis points for the year to 24.2%, driven by strong sales leverage and despite a 90 basis point impact from increased partner investments. China\/Asia-Pacific delivered a 20.9% margin for the year, significantly above our initial guidance for a high-teens operating margin in CAP that we provided on last year's Q4 earnings call.","EMEA was a standout, finishing the year with a remarkable 13.8% margin, representing a full 460 basis points of margin expansion year-over-year and eclipsing our previous goal of reaching mid-teens operating margin by 2018. And Channel Development delivered a 37.8% operating margin for the year, a 180 basis point increase over last year, and representing our third straight year for margin expansion in excess of 100 basis points.","Finally, it is important that I qualify the impact of FX in our financials. FX negatively impacted both Starbucks' revenue and non-GAAP EPS growth by roughly 3 percentage points in Q4 and 2 percentage points for the full year. The record operating and financial results we delivered in fiscal 2015 also drove record cash generation, providing the capital we need to reinvest in our business and increase the cash we return to our shareholders. In fiscal 2015, we returned a record $2.4 billion of cash to our shareholders through a combination of dividends and share buybacks, up over 50% from 2014 levels. And today, we announced that our board has approved a 25% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.20 per share.","As you know, Starbucks' performance and profitability has been consistently strong over the last several years. Nonetheless, 2015 was an important, if not pivotal, year for us financially and operationally. We delivered record operating and financial results, returned record cash to our shareholders, and importantly, we funded several very significant new investment initiatives. And I'm pleased to report that these initiatives are already producing outsized returns for our shareholders. I'd like to share a few metrics to illustrate this point.","After adjusting to reflect the change in ownership of Starbucks Japan, our return on invested capital increased over 200 basis points in 2015. While still only in their early days, the investments we have made in Mobile Order & Pay and in areas such as improved MSR one-to-one marketing are already delivering returns well in excess of our overall company average. Partner attrition in our U.S. stores has declined and, as Howard mentioned, we gained a full three points in the past month, bringing our delta to 18 points versus the industry on this critical metric. And the data is clear that our stores with the lowest attrition generate comps that are above our company average.","Finally, and perhaps most importantly, our comp growth in the U.S. clearly illustrates how our investments are timed to performance. In Q4 of last year, we delivered five points of comp growth with one point of traffic growth in the U.S. During 2015, our comps and traffic accelerated sequentially every quarter to 9% and 4%, respectively, in lockstep with the ramp of our investments. The strength and momentum we saw throughout 2015 and are seeing as we enter 2016 gives us the confidence we need to increase the speed and size of our investments in order to continue strengthening and expanding the foundation of our increasingly global business.","Importantly, in fiscal 2016, we will be taking the learnings from the investments we are making in our partners in the U.S. to major markets around the world. This next wave of partner investment will include wage and benefit increases and even housing benefits in some countries. And following on the success of the investments we are making in our mobile, digital and payments initiatives in the U.S., in 2016, we will be accelerating these investments, both domestically and in our largest international markets. With this as background, I'll now turn to our relevant targets for 2016.","Consistent with our long-term goals, we expect 10% or greater revenue growth on a 52-week basis with the 53rd week adding approximately two points to this growth. Importantly, and for the first time in many years, given the momentum we are seeing in our business, we are expecting 2016 global comp growth to be somewhat above our long-term mid-single-digit guidance range. Our consolidated operating margin will increase slightly from 2015 on both GAAP and non-GAAP bases, reflecting strong revenue growth, sales leverage and increased operating efficiency and performance, partially offset by the impact of increased partner and business investments.","We expect to see our operating margin in the Americas increase moderately above 2015, reflecting strong sales and COGS leverage, offset by the impact of our investments. And we expect to see flat to slightly down operating margins in CAP from 2015 levels as increasing sales levels in China, Japan and across the region is offset by the last bit of impact from the acquisition of Starbucks Japan and the continuing impact of negative FX headwinds. Noteworthy is that our projected operating margin of approximately 20% in CAP is above our initial expectations for year two when we close the Japan acquisition. And we remain bullish on the opportunity for future long-term margin expansion in CAP.","Q1 CAP margin is expected to be lower by several points than Q1 of 2015, primarily due to lapping the impact of the change in our ownership of Starbucks Japan and the negative impact of FX. Also given the complexity of modeling the impact of the ownership change in Japan, I'd like to provide additional color around our CAP revenue expectation for 2016.","Overall, in FY 2016, we expect CAP comps to land in the mid-single digits, including the impact of adding over 1,000 stores in Japan into the calculation. And projected revenue growth in CAP will be in the mid-teens, reflecting excellent growth in all of our major markets and a small benefit from the change in Japan ownership, partially offset by ongoing FX headwinds.","We expect our operating margin in EMEA to approach 15% for the year, as we continue to realize the benefits of increased momentum in key markets, strong execution by the team, and the ongoing business model shift from company-owned to licensed stores. And sales leverage will drive moderate margin expansion in our Channel Development segment, though less than the very strong 180 basis point expansion we saw in 2015.","As a result of both strong overall revenue growth and margin expansion, we expect GAAP EPS in the range of $1.84 to $1.86 and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.87 to $1.89, including the 53rd week we will report on in the fourth quarter of 2016.","A few specifics about our EPS guidance; the 53 week adds approximately $0.06 to our 2016 EPS estimate. Our expectations of comp growth being somewhat above mid-single digits is factored in to our 2016 EPS estimate. We expect the year-over-year increase in global partner and digital investments in 2016 will be between $100 million and $125 million, impacting our EPS growth rate by approximately 3 points.","Our total global investment in these areas in 2016 will land between $250 million and $275 million, compared to approximately $145 million in fiscal 2015. The majority of the 2016 initiatives will be in the U.S., but will also include global investments in certain increased partner benefits, digital and technology investments, and G&A costs.","FX is expected to impact revenue growth by 1 percentage point and EPS growth by 2 percentage points. Commodities impact is slightly favorable for the year, now with over 90% of our 2016 coffee costs locked. And finally, our effective tax rate for 2016 will be between 34% and 35%.","Given all these inputs, when adjusting our 2016 non-GAAP EPS range for the extra week by subtracting the $0.06, our growth rate versus 2015 non-GAAP EPS of $1.58, will be at or slightly above 15%.","For Q1, 2016 we are targeting GAAP EPS in the range of $0.43 to $0.44 and non-GAAP EPS of $0.44 to $0.45, representing a lower growth rate than the full year as significant FX headwinds in Q1 of 2016 will impact non-GAAP EPS growth by four full points.","Also, Q1 growth will be lower as we started implementing the vast majority of our 2015 partner and digital investments in earnest in Q2 of last year. Given our Q1, 2016 growth rate, we expect non-GAAP EPS growth in the remaining three quarters of 2016 to be in the middle of our long-term guidance range.","Contributing to our revenue growth in fiscal 2016 will be the addition of approximately 1,800 net new stores globally. In 2016, 70% of our net new stores will be outside of the U.S. with the entire Americas segment accounting for a total of 700 stores, split roughly evenly between company-owned and licensed.","Our China\/Asia Pacific segment will drive roughly half of our new store growth with 900 net new stores, two-thirds of which will be licensed. And our EMEA segment is targeting 200 net new stores in fiscal 2016, virtually all of which will be licensed. Finally, capital expenditures in fiscal 2016 are expected to be approximately $1.4 billion.","2015 was another excellent year of financial performance for Starbucks as demonstrated by record results and significant increases in total shareholder return, return on invested capital, and cash returned to shareholders. In 2016, Starbucks will deliver approximately $21 billion in revenue, operate close to 25,000 stores, and generate an operating margin approaching 20%. And despite the scale and scope of our company, we will also deliver, once again, double-digit revenue growth and non-GAAP EPS growth of at least 15%, when excluding the set impact from the 53rd week, consistent with our long-term targets. The growth we are experiencing and returns we are delivering are made possible by the investments we are making in our people and in our business and the dedication and hard work of our partners around the world, who now deliver an elevated Starbucks experience nearly 80 million times every week.","With that, I'll turn the call back to the operator for Q&A. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from John Ivankoe from JPMorgan.","John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Great. Thank you. The question might be a little bit obvious, but Howard, in the last conference call, and I think very rightly, you told us not to expect mid-single-digit comps and you told us certainly not to model more than mid-single-digit comps. So, in terms of kind of expressing that, you expect to have somewhat above mid-single-digit comps for fiscal 2016. I mean the question has to be asked, what specifically changed maybe relative to how you thought three months ago when you told us not to think about anything above mid-single-digit comps? And is it Mobile Order & Pay that's really getting the significant traction in the U.S. that's giving you the confidence to do so well on extremely difficult comparisons or is it other factors that you'd like to discuss?","Howard S. Schultz - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I certainly was \u2013 I was expecting that call, John, but not right out of the gate. So let's just kind of walk through this together. Throughout the calendar and fiscal year, we saw an acceleration of traffic and comp store sales. And I think if you go back a year ago, we were at 5% and 1%. And if you look at 9% and 4% in the U.S. and what we've done sequentially throughout the year and you couple that with the inherent momentum and attachment that we're seeing from mobile payment, Mobile Order & Pay, and specifically the integration, as Kevin talked about, and the attachment of loyalty, we have enough visibility in the business to be transparent with you that we believe that we're going to see some incrementality in our overall comp.","And I think just like I've said in the years past, we want to be very straightforward and try and under promise and over deliver. I think we're at the inverse here, and we just feel that it's important to be straightforward and tell you that we think our comps, although it's really an anomaly in this market, is going to be somewhat greater than what we've had this calendar year and fiscal 2015. I would not jump to conclusion and say it's going to be significantly greater. But we have enough visibility and I think significant attachment and response from our customers based on in-store execution, the investments we've made in our partners, as Scott has really articulated, has had a significant effect on our relationship with our customers and all of these things are laddering up to a performance.","I mean, when we saw the quarter head towards 9% comps in the U.S., given where all of U.S. retail is, where the economy is, where bricks and mortar has gone, the change in \u2013 seismic change in consumer behavior and everyone else in our peer group, not only is it a stunning number, but it's a number that does not exist anywhere in the world at our scale, at our complexity. And we think we're going to do better than the mid-single-digit guidance that we've given you the last few years, and we thought it was responsible to share that with you.","John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And if I'm still on, Howard, it's certainly striking to hear your approach to labor in fiscal 2016 in this tightening economy, and maybe juxtapose that a little bit with Starbucks' experience maybe in the late 1990s and 2006, 2007 where you did participate in very tight labor markets. So, is it to some extent lesson learned from your perspective of just the importance of having the right people and compensating them and making sure that turnover is staying low, or how would you describe this current labor market relative to other tightening and expensive labor markets that Starbucks has seen in the past?","Howard S. Schultz - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think the equity of the Starbucks brand throughout our public life has been defined by the culture and values and guiding principles. I said from day one that we are in the experience business, and our brand is defined by the people who wear the green apron. The entire DNA of the company goes back to equity in the form of stock options, comprehensive health insurance, 25 years ahead of the Affordable Care Act, and this year alone groundbreaking benefit of college achievement of providing all of our people with a four-year education.","So, I think what we've seen is that other companies are reacting and playing catch-up to legislation, where we have always been ahead of it, and the tightening of the labor market is not something that we want to deal with or use as an excuse, just like we don't want to talk about weather.","And so, we strongly believe that the investments we've made ahead of the curve on legislation in terms of labor and the benefits that we have provided for many, many years is an intrinsic part of the Starbucks experience, and the brand affinity, the loyalty, and all the things that we're doing are linked directly to the investments we've made in our partners. And I think, as Scott said, we can give you even more specifics that demonstrate that the return on investment of these benefits is dramatically affecting return on investment of new stores. You saw that in the $1.4 million first-year stores, the return on investment on comp store sales, and the incrementality.","There's no one on the planet doing 4% traffic at our scale, especially when you consider that we have self-cannibalized, I don't know what the percentage is, probably 20%, 30% 40% of our store base this year alone, and no effect. We are driving incrementality in all day parts, and our people in many ways are responsible for it and we want to invest in them and with them. And I think the performance just shows the result.","John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you (52:56) so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Sara Senatore from Bernstein.","Sara H. Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you very much. I wanted to ask a little bit more about digital and it's sort of a two-part question. One is, obviously Mobile Order & Pay extremely successful and I think we see that in the fact that you're rolling out so quickly elsewhere. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the relative impact on traffic versus ticket. Obviously, both numbers very impressive, but even a little bit more out of ticket that I might have expected. So that's part one.","And part two is, maybe you could talk about further partnerships, so you talked about Spotify and Lyft and the New York Times. Could you share your plans for expansion there and when we might expect this to be maybe even a material contributor to operating results from a financial perspective that you actually call out separately? Thank you.","Howard S. Schultz - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, thanks. Let's have Adam comment on Mobile Order & Pay first, and then we'll take the other two parts of your question.","Adam B. Brotman - Chief Digital Officer, Executive Vice President","Hi, Sara. This is Adam. On Mobile Order & Pay, a couple things to mention. First of all, before we get into specifics on ticket and transactions, it's worth reiterating that Mobile Order & Pay is part of a broader platform that includes card, loyalty, mobile payment, digital engagement, and now mobile ordering. And we're about to add delivery and music. So, no other consumer retailer has put together a platform like this, and Mobile Order & Pay is proving out what we thought, which is that when you get the flywheel effect of such a successful platform, you see the results that you see from Mobile Order & Pay.","Now specifically to your question, we're seeing incremental transactions from Mobile Order & Pay, particularly in our busiest stores. We're pleased with the results across all the tiers of our stores. You know, ticket right now is holding steady and is doing quite well consistent with our other MSR ticket, and we haven't even added the feature of suggested selling and suggested pairing, which we're going to do in the first half of the year. So, we expect to see that increase on top of the incremental transactions that we're seeing.","Kevin R. Johnson - President and Chief Operating Officer","Yes, and Sara, this is Kevin. I'll just add to Adam's comments about what's driving our comps. I think there's three key things. Number one, Howard mentioned is the investments we've made in our partners and the fact that we've reduced attrition is allowing our partners in store to better connect with our customers, and we know that that yields better outcomes in terms of comp growth. And so that's number one.","Number two is our investment in food and beverage innovation. In fact, if you look at the comps, three points of our comp growth came from food. Our breakfast sandwich business has doubled in the past three years. Lunch is accelerating. We now have evenings program deployed in 100 stores, so it's early days on evenings, but we've seen growth in every day part as a result.","On the beverage side, that accounted for 6% \u2013 six points of comp growth. And so innovation certainly around things like Cold Brew contributed to it, and very good results with our iced beverages including the Teavana Shaken Iced Teas, which grew 20% year-on-year. So in addition to the investment in partners, it's the investment in food and beverage innovation, and then finally is the investment in digital and loyalty. So in fact, we know that MSR customers on average spend three times as much as non-MSR customers, and we've grown the number of active MSR customers by 28% year-on-year. So the investments we're making in our partners, food and beverage innovation and digital and loyalty are key drivers.","Howard S. Schultz - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","There was one question about partnerships, future partners. Matt, do you want to take that?","Matthew Ryan - Global Chief Strategy Officer","Sure. It's Matt Ryan. We have only just begun with our partnership business regarding loyalty. And while we've announced three specific deals, there are many more to come. We are in the process of building capability to offer Stars everywhere. That is the opportunity for customers to essentially earn Stars at a lot of different places and take them back to Starbucks. That is going to be a lever in our business in the future and that has not yet impacted our business but will. In addition, as we negotiate those deals, we are going to have additional benefits to both our customers and our partners, which will accrue back to us in the form of loyalty and deepened engagement. So we're very, very bullish on that. We don't have specific announcements today, but stay tuned.","Operator","Your next question comes from Keith Siegner from UBS.","Keith R. Siegner - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you. Howard, in the past couple of years, you have talked about the seismic shift in the retail landscape and how you were going to strategize against that. If you think about the success of the Mobile Order & Pay, this whole platform that it's integrated into, delivery and inevitability, next-gen features you said are already in sight. When you think about that real estate, that physical asset base that you've talked about and its role in servicing that relationship; does this change or could this change? Can you exploit some of that relationship and come up with a new or different way to even further deepen that relationship with consumers? How do you think about that? Thanks.","Howard S. Schultz - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","You know, I think \u2013 as you all know, I think two years ago or so, we shared with you that we had begun to witness and get quite concerned about a downturn in pedestrian traffic on Main Street and certainly a downturn in traffic in malls. And I think if you look at the retailers that are succeeding, I'm not talking about people in our core business but all retailers anywhere in the world, it has to be an experiential, emotional experience where the retail experience is really exceeding the expectation of the customer. And so we went back to work on that and I think we also believe very strongly that we had to seamlessly integrate the Starbucks experience with all things mobile. And as I said in my prepared remarks, we are living in a mobile-first global economy and we're witnessing that kind of change.","With regard to the physical shape, size, and what we do in our stores, I think we do believe, and I can't give too much away here, that we are in a position where we're in every single or almost every single community in America and almost, you can almost make that statement, in the world, and as a result of that, we're both intercepting and driving traffic into our stores. And we certainly have one of the world's strongest real estate portfolios in terms of where those stores are located. So we are, I think, asking ourselves the very important question, what else can we do in our stores? And I think the operative issue here is relevancy. We have become an extremely relevant brand.","And, as Kevin just outlined, three, four years ago, all the day parts that we're now engaged in, we did not have relevancy, we didn't have the right product. And we're, certainly, now looking at the physical space, what it is we're selling. And I'll share something else with you. It's because of the amount of traffic we have, the millions of people and the fact that the core customer is a Millennial customer, the most important consumer in the world today, we have many, many companies who want to partner with us and integrate their products or services into the Starbucks Experience and specifically, certainly they want to do that in terms of what we're doing in terms of mobile technology. So these are early days of us answering that question, but I think you did hit a nerve here by saying that Starbucks has a physical asset almost second to none and when you combine that with what we've been able to do in leveraging that with a seamless digital mobile experience, we're in a very unique position to win.","And, I would say, we're as hungry today as we were two years ago when we recognized the problem and we're challenged by it. We certainly feel we have overcome it and we're winning, but we're hungrier today to make sure that the separation we create in the marketplace between us and everyone else gets wider.","Operator","Your next question comes from Sharon Zackfia from William Blair.","Sharon M. Zackfia - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hi. Good afternoon. I wanted to touch on the labor investment that you've made in the U.S. I think you talked about making more of an investment globally as well. Can you dimensionalize kind of the order of magnitude of the investments, both in the U.S. that you've already done and maybe ongoing investment into 2016 both in the U.S. and overseas?","Scott Harlan Maw - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, thanks, Sharon. It's Scott. So the total amount, as I mentioned, is between $250 million and $275 million. The vast majority of that, again, will be in the U.S. I think the important part is there is some amount that will happen out in the regions, much smaller dollars, but that includes not only partner investments which is wage and benefit, but it includes an acceleration of some things we want to do digitally around mobile, around loyalty, and around platforms in general. So I think the way to think about it is vast majority in the U.S., a bit in the other regions. And as we go through the year, if those numbers become significant, we'll give you an idea of how they landed by segment.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Palmer from RBC Capital Markets.","David S. Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi. Thanks. What customer and partner feedback are you getting on Mobile Order & Pay so far, and in what ways do you think you can improve the app or adjust operations to make the experience even better? And just separately, bigger picture, I think you said 21% of orders were mobile payment to some degree. It might be striking to you internally as an opportunity that four out of five orders are not using the benefits of mobile pay or mobile order. Are you thinking about ways that you can further drive penetration to get them into this digital ecosystem that you have? Thanks.","Clifford Burrows - Group President-Americas, US & Teavana Region","Thanks, David. It's Cliff here. It has been incredible to see the adoption by customers across the country, and with each wave that we've launched, the ramp rate has been quicker for adoption. I think what is most exciting is our highest volume stores are the ones that are seeing the biggest share come from mobile orders, and what is happening with that is it increases capacity in the store itself. So we're seeing two wins on this. We're seeing the adoption of mobile orders, and we're seeing increased capacity in the core stores. So every part of the country is now live, and we are seeing activity from mobile orders in every part of the country. I could speak briefly to Canada where that adoption focused in Toronto has mirrored what we've seen in the U.S., and it just bodes really well for the future.","Adam, do you want to talk about the increased offer?","Adam B. Brotman - Chief Digital Officer, Executive Vice President","Yeah, thanks, Cliff. This is Adam. David, just to build on what Cliff said in terms of some of our busiest stores particularly in either hospitals or downtown locations, let me give you some examples of that. Yesterday, World Financial Center in New York City did 150 mobile orders for over 10% of their overall transactions. Duke Energy Center in Charlotte, North Carolina has been doing incredible with Mobile Order & Pay. They did over 234 mobile orders yesterday for 20% of their transaction. Cleveland Clinic in a busy hospital where the convenience of when you're on break and you don't have a lot of time and you want to just get your mobile order and get out, incremental occasions being driven there 269 mobile orders for 11% of their transactions.","So these are in on our busiest tier. It gives you an example of how pleased our customers and stores are with Mobile Order & Pay. Customers are responding incredibly well. We're seeing conversion rates from trial like we've never seen before. We are seeing some of the best customer satisfaction scores for Mobile Order & Pay, particularly around customer connection, which is a great indicator of future visits. So we're really happy with what's going on there. And in terms of what are we going to do to continue to improve it and how are we going to get even better adoption, that's absolutely in our plan. First of all, we're constantly improving the estimated pick-up time algorithm.","Same with store inventory, we've enhanced our ability to display accurate store level menu and inventory availability and we're chockfull of great new features that are coming for Mobile Order & Pay including the ability, like I mentioned earlier, for suggested selling which should drive not only customer satisfaction but also bigger ticket. You're going to see the ability to redeem your loyalty rewards, and favorite stores and favorite orders. So that's just the beginning of what we're going to do to improve not only adoption but the experience.","Howard S. Schultz - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And I've had to say one thing which I think is important. We've always viewed ourselves as merchants, and when we think about the digital experience and the mobile experience with regard to mobile payment and Mobile Order & Pay, the most important thing that we try to consider is the customer experience and as merchants what can we do to surprise and delight the customer so that the mobile experience and the digital experience is not something that's dilutive but actually something that is accretive.","And I think as Kevin said in his remarks, I think all those players that are now trying to get into this business, what I notice is that it's really \u2013 they're in a utility business. They're in a commodity digital experience. That is not who we have been as a retailer, and that's not who we're going to be as a digital purveyor of the Starbucks Experience.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Glass from Morgan Stanley.","John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks very much. I thought I'd maybe go in slightly different direction. I wanted to just ask about CAP and the comps being 6%. They had been stronger in prior quarters, traffic had been stronger. So I'm just wondering what that deceleration was, where it came from? You talked about China being strong. So I wasn't sure if it was maybe ex-China. Maybe you can put a little more color around what is going on in China since that seems to be a controversial area now.","John Winchester Culver - Group President-China & Asia Pacific","Yeah. John, let me \u2013 this is John \u2013 let me just talk a little bit about China and what we're seeing in China. And first, let me just be very clear that our business in China and across CAP remains very, very strong. You look at the momentum that we've been able to build. We've seen no systemic slowdown in our business in China. As we discussed on the call, our performance in terms of comp in China accelerated above the total region. And when you look at the comp breakdown, not only in China but then also across the region, this is all being driven by transactions which is phenomenal. It means that we're attracting more new customers into our stores every day as well as, at the same time, continuing to build frequency with our existing customers.","In addition, what we saw during the quarter was that comps actually accelerated month to month. And in China, we see that comps are continuing to accelerate into the month of October, which is great news for us. Just let me touch on China because I know there's a lot of questions out there right now. Today, we operate 1,800 stores across 95 cities, and when you think back to two years ago, we had a 1,500 store target in China by the end of 2015. We are significantly ahead of that 1,500 store target with over 1,800 stores. In the quarter, we opened 135 new stores in China. That's 1.5 stores per day, which is actually ahead of the 1.2 stores that we average for the entire fiscal year of 2015.","And when you look at the new stores that we're opening in China, we have the best age class performance in our new stores since 2012. And when you break down the total growth across CAP and really across China, 75% of our revenue growth is being driven by new stores, 25% is being driven by comp, and what we continue to do is focus on investing ahead of the curve as it relates to our people, the digital landscape, IT, store development, supply chain, and continuing to elevate our coffee position in the marketplace. So, again, we're just very optimistic about the opportunity that CAP presents and more specifically what China presents.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Tarantino from Robert W. Baird.","David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Hi. Good afternoon and congratulations to all of you for delivering great results. My question, Scott, is two-fold. First, on the investments that you're making, or the incremental investments you're making into business, are those structural in nature, meaning they'll continue beyond 2016, or are there any one-time in nature? And then I guess the second part of my question is just the flow-through to the margins that you're anticipating in 2016 on the comps you're expecting, looks a little low on the surface. So is there anything going on outside of some of the factors you mentioned that would prevent the flow-through down to the bottom line in 2016?","Scott Harlan Maw - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, David. On the first part of your question, I think what we've done in 2015 and heading into 2016 is actually accelerate the investments as we've moved through time. So we had a number as we started the year in 2015, and each quarter we actually leaned in a little bit more. And we're doing that again in 2016. And I think there may be some of that that continues as we head into 2017, but obviously as we've changed our plans as we move through 2015, we'll update you as we get into 2017. So I do think we're in an accelerated investment mode now. At some point, that will tail off. But I think the best way for you to think about it is as we move through time, we'll let you know. When we see opportunities to accelerate given what's happening on the top line, we will lean in. We will spend more. We won't hesitate to do what the right thing is. And so, I think the best thing for you to do is just sort of track with us as we go through time. I feel good about what we have for 2016. As we get through the year, we'll talk about 2017.","On flow-through, I would say part of the flow-through that you're mentioning is driven by exactly what I'm talking about. So we are definitely investing ahead of the curve. So there's a little bit of advanced and accelerated investment that's having some impact on margin.","But I just want to go back to the comments I made on the call that are really important. A lot of what you're seeing for the full year on margin and EPS growth guidance is really a result of what's happening in that first quarter, driven by significant FX impact which impacts top line and bottom line and margin. And driven by the fact that we didn't really start our partner investments until January of last year. So that math is impacting the whole year. As you get through to the rest of the year, you kind of come back up into the middle of our range on a non-GAAP basis.","Operator","Your next question comes from Karen Holthouse from Goldman Sachs.","Karen Holthouse - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi. Congratulations on the quarter. I want to ask actually a question about food, which is 3% of comp growth instead of 2% of comp growth on a larger base, lunch is accelerating. Certainly some data points there to feel good about. As it's become a bigger part of the business, kind of outside of the breakfast day part, I'm curious what you're learning in terms of merchandising, products that people are using, grab and go versus things in the case, and just what you've learned so far that can help you continue to grow and build momentum in that part of the day?","Clifford Burrows - Group President-Americas, US & Teavana Region","Thanks, Karen. It's Cliff. We're really pleased with what we're seeing with food and food across the day parts. The strength of breakfast sandwiches, as Kevin mentioned earlier, we've seen that business double over the last three years. And that is quite significant for us. We're also now into testing lunch, and we're seeing both great reaction from the customers around the offering, Bistro Boxes, paninis, and the enhancement of our sandwich range. And evenings is \u2013 it's 100 stores now, and we're going to open several hundred more during the year with the evenings program, and that is giving us a day part where not only is the wine beer and our standard beverages but there is also this opportunity for sharing plates.","So that is \u2013 so the day parts we're excited about, we're able to offer to customers. At the same time, we are increasing the introduction of what we're calling, Wall of Chill, which is our grab and go food presentation, which in high volume stores certainly in the urban locations not only do people buy products for breakfast, but they also often buy something to take with them like the Bistro Box. So portability is important. Food is growing both in our store and through the drive-thru lanes. And with what Adam was talking about on Mobile Order & Pay, our ability to offer people at a store level the food range that that store has and, over time, a much more dynamic suggestive sell plus responding to the in-stock position, all of those things bode really well.","We've seen food grow through that 3% comp to 20% of the mix in U.S. stores, and we see that increasing over time to the mid-20%s, but obviously beverage will still drive it. And we'll just keep investing, keep learning, and keep growing it.","Operator","Your next question comes from Andrew Charles from Cowen & Co.","Andrew Charles - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you. Adam, with Mobile Order & Pay and delivery coming soon and the marketing opportunities these have, do you view straight-up mobile payment as something ultimately become obsolete or it still have its place given the robust customer data you receive from it as well as the convenience?","Adam B. Brotman - Chief Digital Officer, Executive Vice President","I think, Andrew \u2013 this is Adam. No, mobile payment is not going to become obsolete. Although mobile ordering is a form of mobile payment and we are going to see a significant number of transactions morph over. But it's really the spectrum of offering customers what they want. If they want the convenience of mobile payment, mobile loyalty engagement, we're going to continue to offer that and innovate on that. And as mobile ordering becomes more and more powerful and more and more prevalent, you're going to see some of that shift over. I will tell you that we saw record mobile payment last week, and as Kevin and Howard mentioned, over 21% of our transactions are still mobile payment, and it's going strong in terms of both mobile payment and now mobile ordering","Operator","Your next question comes from Jeff Bernstein from Barclays.","Jeffrey Andrew Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thank you very much. Just had follow up questions on, I guess, China, Asia-Pacific region. Maybe just a two-part question.","One, in terms of the unit potential, I know you're talking about accelerating that. I'm just wondering it looks like this year you're talking about 900 units, up slightly from I think you guided last year to 850 units. So I'm wondering what's the gating faster that maybe faster growth, I guess it's primarily in China, whether it's people or real estate? It doesn't seem like it's demand. And I'm sensitive to asking this because I know about prior concerns of growing too fast. But the first part of the question was just on what's the gating factor.","And the other piece was just broadly around China just as you build that business and one day it will be the biggest business outside of the U.S. Can you just talk about the success you're seeing and shifting customers whether it's pushing them from p.m. to a.m. or shifting them from tea to coffee, just how you're converting those customers into more of the traditional Starbucks customer? Thanks.","John Winchester Culver - Group President-China & Asia Pacific","Hi, Jeff. This is John. Thanks for the question. First, in terms of the growth rate around stores, we'll open approximately 900 stores across China next year. And we're well on our way to delivering the 3,400 or 3,500 store target by 2019.","We continue to be very disciplined in how we're looking at real estate, how we're building the stores, and, more importantly, how we're creating that experience for our customers and really taking the long-term view on that. When you look at the success of the portfolio, particularly this past year, but more importantly as well in year's prior, the portfolio continues to perform very strong. And we continue to lay the tracks around the infrastructure so that we can continue to accelerate in the future new store growth. So again, we remain very optimistic about that. We continue to focus on people and bringing in the right people, training our partners, and giving them the tools that they need in order to be successful.","In terms of the customers and shifting them, what we see is that the majority of our business continues to be in the afternoon and evenings in China. But more and more we're seeing that morning ritual come into play. We have some investments in the business this year in the plan around food and building out the capability around food and particularly the morning day part.","In addition, we see digital as a key component in helping to shift customers from that afternoon and evening day part into the morning. And we're laying the tracks on that now. So, again, we're taking the long-term view on China. We want to build our business the right way. We have a very strong brand and great experience that we're providing our customers there","Howard S. Schultz - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","John, can you just speak to what we're doing in January on the family partner forum and what we've done in the past and why that's been so important?","John Winchester Culver - Group President-China & Asia Pacific","Yeah, so one of the things that we've talked about over the course of the last couple years is partner family forums in China. And the significant role that the family plays in helping their children select where they want to work and the type of companies they want to work for.","Three years ago, we held our very first partner family forum in Beijing, followed by one in Shanghai, and then another, a third one, in Guangzhou. In January, we're going to do our fourth family forum in Chengdu and when you think of these family forums, think of about 2,000 people, our partners as well as their mothers and fathers, their children, if they have children, coming to this and really seeing what Starbucks is and who we are as a company around the values we have, the opportunities that we're going to give them to grow, and really no other company is able to create this type of experience.","And that's why, over the last several years, we've been the employer of choice in China, and we've been able to attract top talent. So we're continuing to make these investments, and we're continuing to be very optimistic about our future in China. But we want to do it the right way.","Operator","Your next question comes from Karen Short from Deutsche Bank.","Karen F. Short - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I just want to ask a couple of questions about guidance. I guess, though, the first is within your comp guidance, can you maybe just kind of go into more detail on the different components, food, tea, innovation, Mobile Order & Pay? And then the second question I had is just, I guess your fiscal 2016 guidance for Americas calls for moderate margin expansion, which is consistent with your language on fiscal 2015 margin guidance, and yet obviously, margins were up 80 basis points. So I guess any color on what your definition is of moderate because you definitely seem more confident on your ability to drive comp, so maybe wondering if you're being conservative. Thanks.","Scott Harlan Maw - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Thanks for the question. On the first part, I think comp growth next year in the U.S. will look a lot like it looked this year. So in other words, strong growth from food probably in that two-point, maybe three-point range. It's important to point out this is the first time we've ever had three points in food, so the momentum is continuing. I would expect to see limited time offerings in innovation, as Kevin talked about, with things like Cold Brew. There's lots of things in the pipeline that will continue to drive a point or two point of comp there.","And then, importantly, the core of what's driving our comp today is all of our regular platform, so espresso, iced beverages, just significant growth in those things that we've been doing all along and we just continue to do them better. So I think the comp breakdown, think of it as very similar to what we did both in the quarter and the year. And then, yeah, I expect Americas comp expansion to be in the range of what you saw this year. So we said moderate. That was 80 basis points, and I think that, that's in the range of what we'll see as we look forward for 2016.","Operator","Your next question comes from Matt DiFrisco from Guggenheim Securities.","Matthew James DiFrisco - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Thank you. I also have a question on a little bit of the guidance there with the margin outlook for the U.S. It also seems a little conservative if I look at where coffee costs have gone. I wonder if you can just give us an update of what you've locked in. I know the last time you talked, I think you said it was 80% locked in. I'm just curious if the majority of what we're seeing in the commodity market coming down now, how that directionally relates to your coffee if that's more so a multiple-year progress of you being able to realize that benefit. And in addition, also I just wanted to make sure I understood the partner investments that you've made. How much has that helped you to maybe have a less of a hit from the structural wage inflation coming down the pipe when the calendar turns to January? How much are you already fronting?","Scott Harlan Maw - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Matt. It's Scott. As it relates to coffee costs, the first thing that I'll just remind everyone is coffee in our retail business continues to be a decreasing part of overall COGS. So just keep that in mind as we grow, the movement in coffee prices really impacts channel development more than it does the retail businesses. With that said, we expect coffee costs to be a little bit favorable as we look forward into 2016. And I think this was inherent in your question, Matt.","If you go back a couple of years, you'll recall that in 2014, coffee prices spiked significantly. They spent a good portion of the year above $1.90. They went above $2. Heading into that spike, we were quite long in our coffee inventory, and so we didn't buy much coffee at those prices. And so when coffee came down for 2015, we started buying. And so, if you were to take a look at the spot rate impacting 2015, we were much lower than that spot rate because of our coffee buying practices. So as you roll over into 2016, the delta in the spot rate doesn't impact us as much because we didn't pay as much as the market did in 2014. So that's what's happening is we're smoothing out those costs, aborting the spikes that we had in 2014 and our 2015 P&L, and that's rolling into some favorability in 2016 and I think some favorability as we head into 2017, depending on what the market does. So I think being patient there definitely paid off for us.","So, do you want to \u2013 Cliff, do you want to try (85:17).","Clifford Burrows - Group President-Americas, US & Teavana Region","Yeah, I'll respond, if I may, Matt, about the investments and wages. So anything that we know about or has been mandated either locally or by states across the country, we've anticipated that in our plans. We're, obviously, annualizing the investments that we want to make and have built that into our plans for the year ahead. And these are investments such as food benefit for our partners, our college achievement plan, and what we're going to do with our partners there and the increased enrollment, 4,000 partners today and we see that number increasing significantly in the coming years. We've anticipated that and we've planned for it. And, obviously, there are some other investments we've made to support our business plan for this year around comp growth, around new stores, around the increased complexity of our business. And we feel very confident with those investments. Obviously anything that comes along during the year we'll respond to and we'll deal with it accordingly and update you as the year goes on.","Operator","Your next question comes from Joe Buckley from Bank of America.","Joseph Terrence Buckley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. Can I ask a clarifying question? I think, Howard, in your remarks you said mobile payments were 21% of the mix, and, Kevin, I think you used the same percentage for the month of October. So I guess I just want to clarify what period that 21% applied to and maybe both. And then if you would talk a little bit about what the Mobile Order & Pay component of mobile pay is and just how do you see that building as the rollout \u2013 well, the rollout is over now, but how do you see that building over time?","Kevin R. Johnson - President and Chief Operating Officer","Yeah, Joe, this is Kevin. The 21% of tender being paid for with the mobile payments was a statistic for the month of October. That's the latest data point that we have. So it's 21% for October. In terms of data on percent of transactions or percent of tender that's Mobile Order & Pay, since we just finished the rollout in the U.S. late in the quarter, we don't have a full run-rate of quarter, so we're still watching that advance. I think Adam gave you some color on some of the locations that are seeing high usage of that. But each wave of deployment we have made has been adopted faster than the prior wave.","And so I think that there will always be some customers that will go into the store that want the in-store experience that will order at the point of sale and pay mobile. And then other customers that will want to do Mobile Order & Pay for convenience, and they'll pay. So you think about Mobile Order & Pay will always be a subset of the total mobile payment tender that we take. And as soon as we have some track record of full quarters of data, we'll be in a better position to share. Adam, do you want to add anything to that?","Adam B. Brotman - Chief Digital Officer, Executive Vice President","Yeah, just building on what you said, Kevin. This is Adam. Howard mentioned that we're seeing a five million mobile order per month run-rate already. And while we're not breaking out specific percentages, there is a range of mobile order numbers across a number of store tiers particularly in our busiest tiers and we are seeing significantly more incremental transactions, incrementality in our busiest stores. We are seeing, internationally, our latest wave that went out for Canada and U.K. saw even a faster adoption than the New York wave, which was faster than the previous wave. So we're getting better at getting faster customer adoption and it bodes well for Mobile Order & Pay globally.","Howard S. Schultz - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Joe, I'll just mention one final point. There are many scenarios where the customer wants the full Starbucks Experience. And then there are other scenarios where that same consumer may want the convenience of Mobile Order & Pay. So we're going to see the balance of consumers that are going to use both. And we think that's a very good thing. We've added this capability that provides significant convenience to the consumer, but we've done it in a way that does not take away from or prevent the full Starbucks Experience on those occasions that that experience is desirable to them. And so, our ability to sort of observe and see how consumers respond and react to this I think is very important. And thus far, I think we're seeing great results, great reception, and we're very confident that we're on the right path.","Operator","We have time for one last question. The last question comes from Andy Barish with Jefferies. You may ask our question.","Andrew Marc Barish - Jefferies LLC","Hi, guys. Just a boring numbers question. The G&A was pretty heavy in the 4Q and actually de-levered for the full year. So I'm assuming some of that was incentive comp given the impressive results. But is that where a lot of the technology investment is also falling, Scott, and maybe what is your outlook for the ability to leverage G&A in fiscal 2016?","Scott Harlan Maw - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. Thanks, Andy. It definitely was driven by both the technology investment as well as the delevering year-over-year is partially driven by the Japan acquisition just given how the accounting works there. And then some catch-up definitely in the fourth quarter around incentive comp. If you sort of normalize for that, our goal is to grow G&A at half the rate of revenue, and we basically achieved that in 2015. You've just got to strip out some of the accounting from the Japan acquisition and some of the other items that are in there from an investment standpoint. Going forward, we are still targeting to leverage G&A. I will tell you it will be less than that half a rate of revenue growth as we look in 2016. And that's because the technology investments will hit G&A and put a little bit of pressure on that. But we still expect a bit of leverage as we look forward.","JoAnn DeGrande - Investor Relations","Thanks, Scott. Thank you for joining us today.

After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session.","I would now turn the call over to Tom Shaw, Vice President-Investor Relations. Mr. Shaw, you may now begin your conference.","Tom Shaw - Starbucks Corp.","Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us today to discuss our second quarter results for fiscal 2018. Today's discussion will be led by Kevin Johnson, President and CEO; Roz Brewer, Group President, Americas and Chief Operating Officer; and Scott Maw, CFO. Our Q&A will be joined by Cliff Burrows, Group President, Siren Retail; John Culver, Group President, International and Channels; and Matt Ryan, Global Chief Strategy Officer.","This conference call will include forward-looking statements which are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements. Any such statements should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements in our earnings release and risk factor discussions in our filings with the SEC, including our last Annual Report on Form 10-K. Starbucks assumes no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements or information.","GAAP results in fiscal 2018 include several items related to strategic actions, including restructuring and impairment charges, transaction and integration costs, gains related to changes in ownership of international markets, and other items. These items are excluded from our non-GAAP results. Please refer to our website at investor.starbucks.com to find the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures referenced in today's call with their corresponding GAAP measures. This conference call is being webcast and an archive of the webcast will be available on our website as well.","I will now turn the call over to Kevin.","Kevin Johnson - Starbucks Corp.","Thanks, Tom. Good afternoon and welcome, everyone. Before I share my thoughts on Q2, I want to provide an update on our efforts to address the incident that occurred in one of our Philadelphia area stores two weeks ago today. Our leadership team has been on the ground in Philadelphia over the past week to understand all aspects of this incident.","I am personally committed to act on several fronts to ensure it never happens again. The closing of our stores for racial-bias education on May 29 is a small piece of a set of ongoing actions that will systematically be woven into our processes, training, and culture moving forward. The value Starbucks provides to our partners, customers and shareholders is not only through our coffee, but also through our brand, culture, and ethos. All companies make mistakes; great companies learn from them and improve. And that is exactly what we intend to do.","Let's now shift the focus to Q2 of fiscal 2018; another quarter of record financial results for Starbucks. The quarter was highlighted by accelerating momentum across our Americas business, particularly in the U.S., with strong performance in China, including our first full quarter of consolidating results following the acquisition of East China and meaningful progress against the strategic initiative that positions Starbucks to continue delivering strong operating and financial performance in the quarters and years ahead.","Revenues in Q2 totaled a record $6 billion, up 14% over last year, driven by comp increases of 2% globally and in the U.S. and 4% in China. Importantly, we saw comps accelerate in both the U.S. and China throughout the quarter, giving us confidence in both our full year and long-term guidance. At the same time, we opened nearly 500 new Starbucks stores globally in the quarter, and now operate over 28,000 stores in 76 countries, with our newest class of stores continuing to deliver best-in-class operating and financial performance and returns. And our record Q2 non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.53 represents an increase of 18% over last year.","On today's call, I will highlight progress we are making against four of our strategic priorities: accelerating the power and momentum of our digital flywheel; enabling long-term growth in China; elevating the Starbucks experience through Roasteries, Reserve and Princi; and streamlining our operations and sharpening our focus on core value drivers. Accelerating our comp growth globally remains a top operational priority for us, and leveraging the power and momentum of our digital flywheel continues to play a key driver of comp growth.","Establishing digital relationships with many more customers represents a significant growth opportunity as we have proven that a direct communication channel combined with personalization enhances the customer experience and drives increased engagement. In Q2, we grew the number of active rewards members in the U.S. to nearly 15 million, and we implemented new ways to attract digitally registered customers beyond our rewards program.","We are widening the aperture of our digital flywheel through a range of customer interaction touch points, including opening up Mobile Order and Pay to all customers, leveraging Wi-Fi sign-up in our stores, and reinventing Happy Hour through the use of single-use digital coupon, all of which are yielding results. Together these initiatives and related efforts will generate a few million additional registered customers by year-end, and we are already running ahead of our expectations. We are now leveraging the digital flywheel to prove out that we can deepen engagement and incrementality with newly registered customers, the same way we have for active rewards customers.","In addition to significant progress in digital, we continue to strengthen the foundation supporting our long-term growth plans in China. The integration of East China is progressing as planned and positions us well for the future. We now have over 3,200 company operated stores in 141 cities across Mainland China. The opportunities for Starbucks in China, which are significant, are growing along with the size and scale of our business, and the deepening connections among our partners, our customers and the Starbucks brand.","Starbucks entered China nearly 20 years ago intent on playing the long game by building and growing the business with deep, genuine respect for the Chinese culture, our partners and customers, and with empathy for the human experience. No western company or brand is better positioned to benefit from the rapidly expanding Chinese middle class expected to exceed 600 million or twice the size of the entire U.S. population by 2021.","We continue to mindfully evolve a coffee culture in China where the reward will be healthy, long-term profitable growth for decades to come. Supporting this view is the fact that per capita coffee consumption in China is only about one half of one cup per person per year compared to roughly 300 or so cups per person per year in the U.S. and even more than that in certain Western European markets. China is an important part of our strategy and we look forward to demonstrating the enormity of the opportunity at our first China Investor Day in Shanghai beginning May 16.","China also highlights another core strategy: elevating the Starbucks experience through Roasteries, Reserve, and Princi. Our extraordinary Shanghai Roastery is building upon our long history in China, and casting a bright halo over all Starbucks business in China and throughout Asia. Since opening in December, customer traffic in the Roastery continues to exceed all expectations with average ticket three times that of a typical Starbucks China store. Customers continue to line up for hours to enter the Shanghai Roastery and will be taken on an immersive, multisensory coffee, food, and tea journey.","And our Starbucks Roastery in Seattle, opened in 2014, continues to delight customers and drive double digit comps. In November, we opened the Princi bakery and caf\u00e9 in the Seattle Roastery and are seeing further lift in total food sales, followed by the first Starbucks Reserve store with a Princi bakery to an overwhelming customer response.","We are now venturing into building standalone Princi bakeries complete with Starbucks Reserve coffees and coffee bars. These stores will feature Reserve coffees, Princi food and design elements from the Roastery in markets across the globe. We will build on a solid foundation with the opening of our Milan Roastery in September and our New York Roastery in November. Tokyo and Chicago will follow in 2019. The potential opportunity for Siren Retail over the next decade is significant as it represents the finest of experiential retail around all things coffee, and we're off to a solid start.","In addition to our growth priorities, we continue to streamline our business and sharpen our focus on our highest value targets. Since assuming the responsibility as CEO of Starbucks one year ago, we have taken a number of value-creating actions including selling Tazo to focus on Teavana, closing our Teavana retail stores in the U.S. and Canada, transitioning our internal e-commerce site to a commercial site, rationalizing the merchandise offered for sale in our lobbies, maximizing value by transitioning certain geographic markets from company-operated to license models, and acquiring the East China joint venture to fully integrate company operated model across Mainland China. These actions, while beginning to yield positive economics, will become increasingly accretive over time.","We are evaluating more streamline actions to come as we further position Starbucks for sustained long-term profitable growth. It has been an active first year for me as CEO of Starbucks. I've been focused on building a world-class leadership team, streamlining our business to better focus on value creation, and executing against a clear strategy to drive growth and long-term value creation for our shareholders. We have much work to do, but I'm pleased with our progress to date and feel grateful for the support of the extraordinary leadership team joining me on this journey.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Roz. Roz?","Rosalind Brewer - Starbucks Corp.","Great. Thank you, Kevin. I will start by reflecting on my first six months as Chief Operating Officer of Starbucks. I came to Starbucks to be part of a uniquely defined company, and I can tell you with great certainty that I have found that here. Great companies are defined by how they respond during a period of adversity. As we chart our path forward in the aftermath of the Philadelphia incident, I am confident that our learnings and actions will result in a greater level of operational excellence, consistent with our mission and our values. Earlier this quarter, for the 16th year in a row, Starbucks was recognized by Fortune magazine as the fifth most admired company in the world. Following that accomplishment, we recently announced that after years of great diligence and commitment, Starbucks has achieved 100% pay equity for women and men and people of all races performing similar work in United States. Staying true to our mission and values will always define Starbucks, despite the financial tenor of the landscape in which we operate. And for that, I'm particularly proud to be on this journey leading the Americas.","I'm also very proud to report that in Q2, Americas and the U.S. business delivered results that were in line with our forecast, and more importantly, we drove momentum throughout the quarter. The Americas segment achieved record Q2 revenues of $4 billion, reflecting 8% year-over-year growth, mostly from new stores which contributed four points for the 16th consecutive quarter. Comps accelerated from under 1% in January to 3% in both February and March, driven by a mix of beverage and food growth leading to a strong 2% for the full quarter. This is the first quarter since quarter three fiscal year 2017 that our comp growth had positive contribution from our non-rewards customers, and this bodes well given the advances we are making in broadening our digital relationships. Operating margin declined 220 basis points to 20%, which we expected this quarter given our strategic decision to invest in partners, higher product cost of goods sold as food growth continues, and lower forecasted comp of 2%.","Over the past six months, in addition to getting to know the many amazing partners that we have wearing the green apron, we have also deeply focused on understanding in more detail exactly who our customer is and what he or she wants from us. We have over 75 million customers who come to Starbucks each month. This includes the nearly 15 million customers inside our Starbucks Rewards program, and these customers love our brand. But the majority of our customers visit Starbucks one to five times a month. So let me tell you a little bit more about this occasional customer. We know that many of these customers, largely those whom we don't have a digital relationship, do not visit as frequently and have a low awareness of either new product introductions or many of our great core offerings. In fact, over this past year, only one in four of these non-Starbucks Rewards occasional customers were aware of our new offerings and key promotions as compared to nearly double that of our frequent Starbucks Rewards customers. And these customers make up nearly 50% of the volume sold in the afternoon, which is greater than their share of other day-parts. Said more simply, these customers are a material part of our current afternoon challenges. These differences are driving a shift in our marketing initiatives, particularly in the afternoon to drive more relevant product promotions and focus on these customers.","As Kevin mentioned, we are also highly focused on driving more digital relationships outside of Starbucks Rewards to help develop relevant marketing and offers for more occasional customers. And while the specific focus is on serving customers through our amazing partners, we do so by leveraging the same key priorities that were outlined more than a year ago. These priorities include: Digital relevance and the expansion of our digital relationship, which Kevin covered in detail; innovation in both our products and our marketing activities; and an unwavering focus on the customer experience in our stores. So let's dig a little deeper into why I'm confident these three priorities with my focus on today's call specifically to innovation and the customer experience, both will continue to drive momentum in the U.S. business.","Let me start with product innovation and marketing. In the past, we focused on a drumbeat of promotional offerings, which have not led to sustained growth, leading us to decrease the number of time-limited offerings by nearly 30% versus a year ago. Our new approach to marketing will be centered on meaningfully strengthening customer relationships by increasingly targeting our offers to each customer. While we still have unique products such as Crystal Ball Frappuccino, our focus will shift to leveraging platforms with broader appeal. For example, for customers who prefer a lighter, sweeter espresso experience, Blonde Espresso offers a second espresso roast, which can be applied to an entire platform of existing beverages. Initially, Blonde was only slated to have approximately six weeks of marketing support, but given our new focus and the early success of the product, we now plan to continue to market the platform throughout the balance of this year.","In addition to more platform marketing, we are also shifting our paradigm from singular offerings to more personalized offers by customers at the right time. Our revised Happy Hour is a testament to this shift. Previously we offered a special only on Frappuccino over a short time period to anyone and everyone, even customers who might have come in anyway. This worked for a few years as the lift we saw in the period following Happy Hour covered the cost of the discounts. But the past two years has not worked from a profitability standpoint. So we reimagined Happy Hour. The new program will be used to sign customers up for direct digital relationships and to promote the great variety of beverages that we offer all year long. This one-to-one offer will leverage our personalization capabilities and drive significant incrementality. Other benefits include more predictable and efficient scheduling of partners and an ongoing promotional opportunity to feature new beverages and drive afternoon. In Q2, we had our first Happy Hour using this new approach and saw strong incremental profits and appealed disproportionately to customers outside of the Starbucks Rewards program.","And while we're innovating in the way in which we reach our customers, it is an extension of having the right offering for each day-part. Our customers love cold beverages, and not just in summertime. In fact, Q2 is traditionally one of the coldest quarters in our fiscal year, and even then, iced beverages contributed nearly 40% of our overall revenue growth. We will continue to drive innovation in our cold offerings in Q3, starting with the recent introduction of cold foam, a creamy froth layer typically associated with our hot hand-crafted beverages that will now add more customization, more flavor, and more theater across our cold platform. Next week we will introduce our newest Frappuccino, which will become a core offering within our blended platform for customers who want a special up-level delicious afternoon treat. Along with our ongoing Nitro Cold Brew expansion and core products extension with plant-based milk, we will convey a balanced message on an array of offerings within our portfolio. Our goal is for our cold beverages to be a must-have by leveraging innovative ways of marketing to drive both morning and afternoon occasions.","Food also continues to be a critical opportunity for our future and has consistently contributed in the 1% to 2% comp range for many years now. This momentum continued in Q2 with food's share of total U.S. sales at 22%, up 100 basis points versus prior year and over 1% contribution to comps, driven by strength in Sous Vide egg bites and breakfast sandwiches. Beyond the AM, the lunch occasion remains a critical focus, and our ability to drive growth depends on a balance of leveraging our core offerings and relevant new innovations. As such, we plan to expand our Mercato platforms starting with San Francisco this month to reach nearly 1,800 stores across six markets by fiscal year end.","We know that our comp growth is directly linked to the engagement that our customers have with our partners. Knowing that, we launched the first change in our deployment routine in over five years this past quarter with what we call Deployment 2.0. What's unique about this new labor routine is that it moves us from a one-size fits all deployment plan to a dynamic store specific deployment solution that will continue to evolve with the business.","We believe this enhance to contributed to the comp improvement that we saw over the quarter. It considers an individual store's product and channel mix data by day-part, assigns responsibilities by role, and deploys baristas to production positions, thereby balancing work to optimize customer connections. It is that unlock, the time for our partners to connect directly with our customers, that will help us deliver a better experience in our stores overall.","While we are still in the early stages of this new deployment tool, and the initial benefits are weighted to peak times, we are already seeing success led by improvements in our critical morning day-part, which also drove most of our overall comp performance in Q2. We know there is additional opportunity ahead to continue growth in the morning and in the afternoon where we have struggled in recent quarters. We must perform in both day-parts.","Taking all the learnings gained in recent months, the consumer, marketing relevance, and operational efficiency, we are launching a focused campaign around afternoon starting next month and extending through August. We will be driving a consistent and sustained message to the consumer that leverages the fantastic line-up of new beverages that I spoke about earlier, great food pairings, a more welcoming environment for our customers, and reinforced engagement with our customers once they are in our doors. Much of this we already do well today, but the power will be in bringing it all together with the universal view of what we have learned and what we know about the 75 million customers that we have the privilege to serve.","As we look to the back half of fiscal 2018 and heading into fiscal 2019, our commitment to growth and elevate the business, I will highlight that the focus remains on two critical areas: Increasing transaction comps and cost efficiency. The specifics I've discussed above are all aimed at driving increasing transaction comps, particularly for beverage. Scott will discuss cost efficiency in more detail, and I'm deeply engaged in driving the middle of the P&L savings in labor, waste, and in our supply chain. While we have had some early success in these focused areas so far, we have so much opportunity ahead of us. I am confident of that. So as I sit here today, I have no doubt that our largest business has ample room for growth. I look forward to sharing more about our success next quarter.","I'll now turn the call over to Scott.","Scott Maw - Starbucks Corp.","Thank you, Roz, and good afternoon everyone. Starbucks delivered strong 14% year-over-year revenue growth in Q2 of 2018, including 3 points of net benefit resulting from consolidation of our recently acquired East China business and other streamline related activities. These activities include Teavana mall store closures in the quarter, the Tazo divestiture in December, and the conversion of certain international retail operations from company-owned to licensed models. Also, FX benefited revenue growth by 2% in Q2. Non-GAAP operating margin of 16.2% represented the decline of 170 basis points year-over-year, primarily driven by food mix shift and incremental partner investments, primarily in the U.S. It's important to note that the decline in operating margin in Q2 was in line with our forecast.","I'll now take you through our Q2 operating performance by segment. Roz covered many of the key operating metrics and actions in our Americas segment, so I'll focus on Americas operating margin decline of 220 basis points to 20%, largely attributable to an acceleration of our partner investments in the quarter and food-related mix shift. I will discuss specific improvements in our outlook for Americas operating margin shortly. New store profitability in the U.S. remains very strong with year one ROIs of approximately 60%, down somewhat from the expectation we shared at our most recent investor day, primarily due to rising labor costs in urban markets. Nonetheless, our store level returns in the U.S. remain among the strongest in our industry.","Moving on to China\/Asia Pacific, CAP revenues grew 54% over prior year in Q2 to $1.2 billion. Adjusting for the 41-point net impact attributable to the consolidation of East China, the licensing of Singapore and Taiwan, as well as foreign currency translation, CAP revenue still grew a very solid 13% in Q2. Japan delivered our first quarter of positive comp since Q1 of fiscal 2017, driven by a strong beverage line-up. Our recently launched Japan Starbucks Rewards program continues to outpace expectations with membership reaching 2.4 million only six months after launch.","CAP operating margin declined 570 basis points to 17.2%, primarily due to the 600-basis point impact resulting from the consolidation of the East China business. New store performance in both Japan and China remained very strong with year one ROIs of approximately 80% in China and 45% in Japan, both representing best-in-class performance and both in line with store level returns we discussed during our most recent investor day.","Turning to EMEA; EMEA delivered revenue growth of 15% to $266 million or 4% after adjusting for 11 points of FX. Given that 84% of EMEA's nearly 3,200 stores are now licensed, system sales, which increased 24% year-over-year or 15% adjusted for FX, are a more accurate reflection of our brand and business strength in the region. Similarly, while EMEA's company operated comp in Q2 was a negative 1%, driven largely by continued softness in the UK, the system-wide comp was a much stronger positive 3%.","EMEA Q2 GAAP operating margin included $31 million of incremental costs primarily related to the impairment of goodwill associated with our business in Switzerland, reflecting the difficult operating environment in that market. Excluding the nearly 12 points for these costs, non-GAAP operating margin of 10.1% declined 190 basis points year-over-year, but was flat excluding FX. We remain encouraged by the stronger performance of our EMEA licensed business, where we experience strong operating income growth and meaningful margin expansion and remain convinced that our shift to licensing will drive improved profitability as we move towards and into 2019.","On to Channel Development; Channel Development had a strong Q2 with revenues reaching $500 million, up 8% year-over-year. Our Channel Development team remains laser focused on profitably gaining market share in both premium roast and ground and K-Cup categories, and was successful on both counts in Q2 despite increased competition and increased promotional activity down the aisle. In the quarter, Starbucks outgrew the overall coffee industry by a 3 to 1 margin, resulting in another point of share gain in each of the roast and ground and K-Cup categories.","Channel Development's operating margin expanded 100 basis points to 43%, benefiting from the lapping of last year's unfavorable 220-basis point impact from the revenue deduction adjustment. The adjusted margin decline was largely a result of less JV income from our North American Coffee Partnership. We are confident that our NACP business will stabilize as we execute against marketing and innovation plans for the back half of the year.","Looking at our capital deployment efforts during the quarter, we continued to take action against our commitment to return $15 billion to shareholders over the next three years, repurchasing $1.6 billion in stock this quarter. In line with the strategy, we also issued $1.6 billion in long-term debt in February.","Let's move onto 2018 targets. We continue to expect consolidated revenue growth in the high-single digits, excluding approximately 2 points of favorability from the East China acquisition and other streamline related activities. We continue to expect full-year comps to grow near the low end of our 3% to 5% long-term guidance, and we remain on plan to open approximately 2,300 net new Starbucks stores globally. We continue to anticipate a moderate decline in full-year operating margin for both company and the Americas compared to 2017, inclusive of the incremental investment we are making in our partners and digital initiatives following U.S. tax law reform, most of which will begin impacting operating profit in the current quarter.","We still anticipate tax reform investments of $180 million to $220 million on a run rate basis in 2018 with a little less than half of this amount impacting 2018 profits given the timing of investments during this fiscal year. The moderate full-year decline in operating margin in the Americas assumes less margin contraction in Q3, with Q4 margin expected to approach the prior year level.","Given the magnitude of these sequential improvements, I'd like to spend a few minutes walking you through how we build our America margin performance from the second quarter through the fourth quarter of 2018. We will deliver several improvements to make it happen. First, comps improved to a strong 3% in the second half of the year. While we believe we will hit the 3% mark in the third quarter, we recognize year-over-year comparison requires progress across our initiatives to reach this level. These initiatives give us even greater optimism for the fourth quarter. Second, we expect beverage comps to improve and we will deliver at least 1 point of traffic growth. And third, we will accelerate our savings across COGS, waste and labor from approximately $120 million in the first half of the year to over $160 million in the second half.","Roz covered the first two components in detail, and as you saw over the last two quarters when we posted lower comps and higher food weighted product mix, both have a meaningful impact on margin. On the third component, our COGS savings target is over $170 million for the full fiscal year, consistent with prior years. And we are executing well against this goal by more effectively leveraging sourcing, manufacturing and distribution opportunities just as we have for the past several years.","We have a well-established set of processes in place, and they continue to deliver. During 2018, we have also significantly increased our focus on improving labor productivity and increasing labor leverage, and this focus is beginning to pay off at an accelerating rate. In Q2, labor run rate savings were driven by improvements in our store-specific coverage models, including the specifics Roz discussed with Deployment 2.0. Also, we have seen our major productivity metric, items per labor hour increase relative to the prior year, demonstrating that our focus on deployment and lean principles is also starting to pay dividends.","Regarding waste, the opportunity is significant, both in connection with waste itself and in connection with lost sales due to product availability. In our U.S. company-owned business alone, waste cost is about $500 million per year. That figure will always be significant because product availability combined with our strict product quality requirements inherently result in a certain amount of waste in our business model. But we believe we can cut this roughly $500 million by at least 15% over the next 18 months by leveraging lean principles and better managing outlier stores in our portfolio that generate greater waste than expected.","In Q2 alone, we realized savings by focusing on those stores that had very high waste as a percentage of sales and improving training around our bakery pull to thaw processes. This strong momentum in these three savings areas plus planned reductions in G&A and other store related costs will contribute meaningfully to Americas' margin over the next two quarters, and I would add that Roz is the perfect partner for finance to help capture these savings opportunities.","In the CAP segment, we continue to expect operating margin to be down moderately in fiscal 2018, relative to last year given the consolidation of East China. Excluding this impact, we continue to expect CAP operating margin to be moderately higher year-over-year. The East China acquisition is now expected to add approximately 2 points of growth to total company EPS for 2018, the high end of our previously discussed range. We now expect EMEA's operating margin to be roughly flat adjusted for FX compared to 2017.","For 2018 Channel Development, we now see low single digit revenue growth and a moderate decline in operating margin versus the prior year. However, when excluding the impact of Tazo and the 2017 revenue deduction adjustments, Channel Development revenue growth is forecast to be in the mid-single digits, and operating margin will decline moderately. We consider this slight downward revision prudent given increasing competition and our results through the first six months of the year.","Finally, we still expect a GAAP tax rate of 23%, but our non-GAAP tax rate is now expected to be 25% versus 26% discussed last quarter. While the absolute difference appears to be a full point, the actual impact is less than half a point, driven primarily by changes in several routine discrete tax items and not due to any changes in our estimates of tax reform. Given all of these inputs, we expect 2018 GAAP EPS in the range of $3.32 to $3.36. Non-GAAP EPS will be in the range of $2.48 to $2.53, up 20% to 23% from last year. Importantly, all of this guidance excludes the impact of store closures and U.S. partner training that Kevin mentioned earlier. We are still quantifying these impacts and will report back to you on the full impact on next quarter's call.","Before handing the call back to the operator for Q&A, I want to underscore that we have a clear set of actions underway to improve comp growth and profitability as we move through the year, and that we will continue to invest in our business strategically and with a long game mentality while at the same time taking decisive action to maximize our brand portfolio and ensure that we will continue to drive shareholder value long into the future. Our performance in Q2 once again demonstrates the correctness and success of the strategies that have guided the Starbucks business over the last 40 plus years. Once again, credit for our success goes to our 350,000 store partners around the world who continue to go above and beyond by delivering an elevated Starbucks experience to their customers every day.","With that, I'll turn the call back to the operator. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from Sara Senatore with Bernstein. Your line is open.","Sara Harkavy Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Oh, thank you very much. Two questions, if I may. They're related, and they're about the Americas and the U.S. top line, comp in particular. So the first is can you just talk about the growth in the rewards program? Because in the context of looking to expand your digital reach, I guess I've been surprised a little because you have seen some nice growth in that membership, but the comps have been softer. So does it \u2013 is there just a lag? Is it take time to learn what your customers are doing? Or is there something to be said about maybe the incremental digital relationship isn't quite as impactful as it used to be? And then the second point is could you just talk a little about the ticket that you saw in the quarter mix, and where it was coming from? Thank you.","Matthew Ryan - Starbucks Corp.","Sure. This is Matt Ryan on the first question. I'll hand it over to Roz for the second part of your question. With regard to the rewards program, we continue to see strong growth in the rewards program. That remains a driver of the positive momentum we saw across the quarter. Reminder, membership up 12% year on year, to almost 15 million, and the growth per member in spend was mid-single digits again too. So both of those are very strong numbers, and both reflect the contribution that the rewards program is making to our business right now. With regard to the newer digital relationships, that's going to be something that happens over time to our business, the contribution from those efforts which really began at the very end of the quarter, so that it was not a material impact yet to our business. We expect to see that really kick in sometime next year.","Roz, I'll have you answer the ticket question.","Rosalind Brewer - Starbucks Corp.","We had the question between transactions and ticket, and so transactions were flat across the quarter, and we saw improvement in ticket across the quarter as we move from the January timeframe through March. Remember, coming into January, we were just slightly under 1% comp, and then February, March, full comp of 3% in February and 3% in March, and getting us to the 2% overall for the quarter.","Scott Maw - Starbucks Corp.","Can I just add, the ticket was split pretty evenly between pricing and attach. So we still see really strong attach, and food continues to do very well. Our opportunity, as Roz said, is really in driving beverage.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Tarantino with Baird. Your line is open.","David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Hi. Good afternoon. Just first a clarification, Scott. I wanted to make sure I understood your commentary around the third quarter comps. I think, you mentioned that you expect it to be plus 3%, despite the tougher comparison, but I wasn't sure how to interpret that in light of your comment about the initiatives needing to work. So, if you could clarify that, that would be great. And then my real question is about the afternoon day-part, and what you're seeing in that day-part related to your operating metrics. And specifically, my question relates to sort of consumer feedback scores and how you're executing in the afternoon, and whether you think this new labor tool will help you to improve those execution scores and generate better momentum that way? Thanks.","Scott Maw - Starbucks Corp.","Thanks, David. I'll take the first part, and then I'll hand it to Roz. So we do see a 3% comp in the third quarter. I was trying to add a little color, recognizing that given the Happy Hour from last year and the Unicorn Frappuccino promotion from last year. We understand that comp momentum is likely to build over the quarter. But at the end of the day, the simple answer to your question is we expect to deliver 3% for the third quarter as well. Roz?","Rosalind Brewer - Starbucks Corp.","Yeah, so looking at the details around the afternoons, what we know about the occasional customer in the afternoon is that they don't shop with us as frequently, and they're not aware of our offerings as our Starbucks Rewards customers. What we also know about our business in the afternoons, is that we have used our afternoons to train our new partners that were just joining as baristas, and we have heavy routines in the afternoon. And so what we learned from managing our peak in the morning and managing routines, we're applying that to the afternoon so that we apply the right kind of labor when the customers are in the store. We are also looking at our afternoons in a different way. We know that the afternoon customer is looking for refreshment, and they are really interested in cold brew. So the new offering that we'll have in the product line is around cold brew, refreshers, and teas. We'll also be reducing the number of limited time offer, LTOs, that we have by 30% year-over-year. That gives us a chance to simplify the work in the afternoon so that the partners can engage with the customers so you'll get both the experience when you're in the Starbucks cafe. You'll also -- we'll also receive better efficiencies by use of the labor at that timeframe, and also too in the afternoons, we are introducing a new marketing platform around this new beverage line-up that we have in the afternoon. So we've learned a lot about that occasional customer. We've learned what happens in our stores with our partners, and we're adjusting that and getting their routines in line. And then we're investing in consistent marketing over a longer period of time for the afternoon growth.","Kevin Johnson - Starbucks Corp.","Yeah, David, this is Kevin Johnson. Let me just build on Roz's comments. Clearly the morning day-part, very important to us. And we've been increasing throughput at peak, recognizing that the dominant customer need state in the morning is the need state of convenience. And then what we've figured out too is that as we transition into the afternoon day-part, the need state starts to balance between both convenience and community. And so the deployment program that Roz mentioned earlier has acknowledged that and has figured out how we transition the way that we even deploy our labor, but how we also transition the activities that they do to create the right experience. So number one is experience. Number two is product as Roz said, and a lot of this has to do with cold beverages. And number three is then the changes we made in marketing to raise awareness. And we think the combination of the three: Improving the experience, delivering products that our customers want in the afternoon and raising awareness of those will tap into that occasional customer in that particular day-part. And I think, we've put all the right ingredients in place and we're executing on those with intent.","Operator","Your next question comes from Sharon Zackfia with William Blair. Your line is open.","Sharon Zackfia - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hi. Good afternoon. I recognize it's tempting to spend all of our time on the U.S., but China and Asia-Pacific is growing so rapidly at this point. And I don't want to steal the thunder from your Chinese analyst day, but I guess, given the rapid growth there as a percent of the operating profit mix, I mean, how do you frame kind of the size of the prize at Asia-Pacific, and what should we view as the main risk to you achieving your goals there?","Scott Maw - Starbucks Corp.","Thanks for the question, Sharon. I'll intro this a little bit, but I want John to talk a little bit about what we're seeing in China, and then we'll get back to the question on guidance.","John Culver - Starbucks Corp.","Yeah, so, Sharon, China, obviously we're approaching 20 years in the market, and the business there continues to perform above expectations. And really, for us, it's about taking the long term view on how we build the business there. If you look at overall growth around the entire CAP segment, revenue at 13% after all the noise around FX and equity changes, China far exceeded that growth rate. China drove 4% comp in the quarter. Transactions continue to grow which signals we're bringing in more new customers as well as increasing frequency of our existing customers. New store growth continues to remain strong. We opened 112 stores in the quarter. We now operate over 3,200 stores in 140 cities, and more importantly was the number as well that Scott I think highlighted on the new stores in the 80% ROI that we see. So the model within China is very strong and has a very strong foundation on which to grow.","Equally important have been the investments that we've made over the last 20 years, and particularly the investments we've made in our people, whether that has to do with the insurance benefits around critical care for parents that we announced last year, whether that has to do with initial paid benefits that we continue to add to. All those things elevate the partner experience for our partners in the market. The elevation of the brand is also important. In December, we opened the Shanghai Roastery, and end of the quarter, this was the first full quarter of operations. And I know we highlighted on the last call that the Shanghai Roastery does twice the dollar volume in one day that an average Starbucks store does in a week. And we've seen that still maintain and grow. Now in Q2, we did see a shift in terms of the business, and the shift that we saw was due to the shift in the Chinese Lunar New Year. And basically this year the Chinese Lunar New Year was three weeks later than it was the year before. And what we saw was that January started out soft, February came back from a comp perspective, and then once we got through Chinese New Year, we actually normalized to a regular comp performance that we had traditionally seen. So all in all, the China business remains very strong. We remain very bullish, and we can't wait to have you in Shanghai in May.","And then just around Asia-Pacific in total, we now operate 8,000 stores in the region. Japan also is a significant growth driver of our business. We saw for the first time in several quarters Japan return to positive comps. We also saw strong momentum with the recently introduced My Starbucks Rewards program in Japan. And then the other highlight I would just call out is Korea. Korea is also continuing to perform. We now operate nearly 1,200 stores in that market, and that business continues to do very well. So, overall Asia, China, is a big part in the most growth \u2013 biggest growth-driver for the company going forward.","Kevin Johnson - Starbucks Corp.","Yeah, Sharon, this is Kevin. I know, Scott will weigh in with sort of the near-term view on what this means for guidance as we look near-term, but let me just share a long-term view, long-term. We've been in China for 20 years, but you think long-term if China could achieve the same kind of results that we have in the U.S., you would say the number of middle class in China is 600 million, that's double the size of the U.S. Then if you look at what, in my comments, the current coffee consumption in China is 0.5 a cup per year per person versus 300 cups per year per person in the U.S. So you look at that math, that means it's over 1,200 times the opportunity size as the U.S. in terms of consumption. Now that's long term, and we have to do all the things that John mentioned, and we are taking a long-term view, but the opportunity is significant. Scott?","Scott Maw - Starbucks Corp.","And the only thing I would add is in the last quarter's call, we said that China Asia-Pacific will be 40% of our business unit operating income growth, obviously given both the performance this quarter in China Asia-Pacific, the outlook that we have and a little bit lower performance in some of the other segments, that now is going to approach 60% of business unit operating income this year. So that is clearly a big growth driver for Starbucks.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Great. Thank you. The question is on U.S. COGS and occupancy. Hitting 38% this quarter is obviously really high. And I understand that food is a specific part of that. But it does seem we've been in this cycle now for a while. It's the more food that you put on, the more your gross margins contract, and we're just not seeing it on the bottom line of operating income for the entire division. So maybe the question is for Roz, maybe it's for Kevin or all of you, I mean, how sure are we that we can add additional foods specifically from the fresh Mercato platform and have margins not be a problem from the incremental food? Obviously understanding that Mercato is a more complicated platform than what you currently have as part of the legacy system today.","Kevin Johnson - Starbucks Corp.","Yeah, John, I'll start and then I'll turn it over to Roz. I think it's important to understand within that pressure that we're seeing of cost of goods sold is not only mix within the different types of foods, so a shift, as we said, a little bit away from bakery which has slightly higher margin towards prepared foods such as breakfast sandwiches which has a slightly lower margin.","One of the things that we're doing to try to manage that, and Roz will talk about this more, is just making sure as we bring new products in that we have the right COGS and the right pricing up front. We're pretty good at that, but I think given the pressure from food in overall cost of goods sold, we're sharpening that capability a little bit. Back when we had 5% or 6% comp growth, we could have a broader array of margin within our food mix, and it still deliver operating income margin expansion and operating income. And now that comps have slowed a little bit, we're just sharpening that analytical capability even more. And then it's important to understand, there's still significant opportunities around savings and waste and beyond. And I'll let Roz talk about that a little bit.","Rosalind Brewer - Starbucks Corp.","Yeah, so a couple things here. First, just looking at foods, we're building a food supply chain while we're evaluating the Mercato roll out and we're learning a lot. And we're developing waste initiatives as we go and looking at ingredients very carefully to make sure we understand the cost as we design the product. And as we first entered the Mercato line-up, we were actually looking at this from a real broad scale. Now, we're down to the bare tactics and really managing waste.","And then waste outside of Mercato, we're even down to the point where we're looking at even our stores that are lower performing stores from a sales perspective typically have higher waste. We have those on our list. We're going after each one of those stores to improve their waste performance by store, so very detailed work. And we're applying for the first time lean principles against that work. So we're down into the brass tactics of reducing our cost from a waste standpoint and leveraging the lean principles.","I'll also tell you that food makes a lot of sense for us, but we are very keenly aware that we have to grow our beverage business. And we want beverage to lead and that's the plan as we go forward. And you see that in the second half of the year, a lot of focus on our beverage business, adding the new cold items to complement the rest of the product line. So its beverages, new beverages, marketing against those new beverages, and then applying a food-attached plan with that.","I'd also mention that there is also savings in other parts of the business having to do with what we're seeing with labor efficiencies, and we're seeing that come forward through the work that we're doing with Deployment 2.0. So it's really a comprehensive plan around, yes, we will continue to invest in our partners. We'll continue to invest in our digital platforms. Those are paying forward now and even more in the future, and then managing this higher food mix by looking at our cost and our waste initiatives. So we're down into the brass tactics on cost through waste and labor.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays. Your line is open.","Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thank you very much. Maybe just two related questions on your unit structure and ownership growth. First one just on the flip to the license structure. I know this has come up in years past, but maybe you could just update us on the pros and cons of whether you would consider increasing your U.S. license mix. You've clearly done it outside of the U.S., and it does seem like, over the past few years, you've actually seen that mix of license stores increase in the U.S. So I'm just wondering would this discussion on moving that further ease the cost volatility and reduce the capital requirements.","And the related question was just on the just broader unit growth, which I know comes up pretty regularly. But considering how difficult a period it is for all the brick and mortar retailers and with the comps not necessarily where you want them to be, I'm just wondering whether you have greater discussion around maybe taking a little bit of a pause. Obviously, you have the opportunity to reaccelerate the unit growth if the comps were to reaccelerate significantly, but the thoughts around maybe slowing down that growth in the short term as the U.S. business struggles to rejuvenate the comp. Thank you.","Scott Maw - Starbucks Corp.","Yeah. Thanks, Jeffrey. I'll start and Kevin can add in. What I would say is, as it relates to ownership structure, I think what we have done has been very analytical and open-minded about what we own and what we choose to license. And if you go back just over the last two years, we've moved to license Germany, Singapore, Taiwan and, the most recent quarter, Brazil. And we continue to analyze those markets that we own and look for opportunities to license or make a conscious decision to continue to own.","So we are looking at returns. We're looking at growth profile. We're looking at overall market size when we're making those decisions, and we're actually pretty, I think, analytical and disciplined when we do that. In the U.S., we've always had, as you said, a really good mix of licensed stores and company owned stores. And there's reasons to license, particularly when we can get access to real estate that we wouldn't otherwise. But owning in the U.S. and China and some other markets really makes sense for us because of the returns that we get in those handful of markets on the stores that we own.","And just to remind you, we see three to four times the cash flow and overall profit in a company-owned store in the U.S. than we do the average licensed store. And that's just because of the royalty structure and what you have to share with the licensee. Those are wonderful stores and we like those licensed relationships, but we also want to own where we can own 100% of the cash flows and drive the financial returns that we want.","In addition, in those larger markets, obviously owning has qualitative benefits. We're faster to market. We're able to do product roll-outs and training and responses and marketing that are more difficult to do when you have a licensed mix. And so it's really about understanding and driving those returns in those markets. I don't know, Kevin, if you would add anything to that, or...","Kevin Johnson - Starbucks Corp.","No, I think we've been very consistent in our approach to transition company-operated markets to licensed markets where it's makes sense, and you should expect us to continue to do so.","Scott Maw - Starbucks Corp.","And then on opening stores, the trigger for us to slow down new store openings in any country is, if we start to see returns on those stores and revenue in those stores start to come in below our expectations. And as we talked recently at a conference and walked through what happens when we open up a company-owned store in the U.S. is the net revenue and the net transactions that that new store is able the get.","And because of the analytics that we have when we open the store, the capabilities we have particularly around drive-thrus, we give up a little bit of sales from stores around that store that the vast majority of the revenue in year one in that new store is incremental. And then those new stores grow for four or five years much faster than the average for the rest of the market. And so when you add all that up, there's really no net comp impact, and you have all of the profitability that you've got in that first year growing over time. And so we look at those store by store, P&L by P&L, we watch what happens as sales transfer, and if we start to see decay there, we will take action and we'll lower openings.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Glass with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks very much. I wonder if you could share any more plans on how you plan to lap the Frappuccino Happy Hour from last year. Understanding that you're doing a bespoke version in the app and so I get the offers, but if it's an occasional user that you're getting in the afternoon, they may not get that. What do you have planned to defend against their coming in and being disappointed or not frequenting during that daypart?","And then also, is there a margin benefit as you talk about margin improvement in the third quarter in particular? Is there a margin benefit to not repeating Frappuccino Happy Hour, as your comments suggested it was not been profitable as it had been in the past?","Rosalind Brewer - Starbucks Corp.","Yeah, so there \u2013 this is Roz. I'll take the first part of that question and then I'm going to ask Matt to talk a little bit more about our digital relationships that happen to be growing. So first of all, when we think about the afternoon, we are actually going after a customer base that we really haven't touched. So it feels almost like a new customer that we're introducing to the brand. We have the opportunity to talk to them about the product offering and then introduce them to the experience in the stores, which has improved if they were a lapsed customer.","So there's things that are changing that we hope will attract them to the store and then get them to eventually engage as a Starbucks Rewards member and begin to react and respond to us like our Starbucks Rewards members. So we have opportunity there. I'll also mention that the marketing efforts that we're putting around this, they are not short-term focused as we have done in the past. And this gives us a chance to tell a fuller, longer story about the offerings, and keep them engaged with us. And this is something, again, that we've not done in our business, as far as many of us can remember. And we hope this is going change how the customer enters the store. So Matt, share a little about the digital growth.","Matthew Ryan - Starbucks Corp.","Sure. I think Happy Hour is a great example of how we're bringing this new strategy alive. So, last year, Happy Hour was a ten-day one-and-done stunt. What ended up happening is you gave the discount away to everybody. People came in, and whether or not they intended to come in, they got the discount if they're ordering a Frappuccino. Available on one product. What we are now doing is inviting people to sign up for Starbucks. And rather than it be a one-time-a-year promotion, this is an ongoing digital relationship that we will reprise over and over again, across the year and the years. What that means is that we won't just be doing Frappuccino for ten days in May. We will be able to use this very well-known device we have called Happy Hour to promote a variety of afternoon products across the year, using it not just in May, but across the year to bring customers back into our stores on an ongoing basis. Over time, we get to know customers, what they respond to, repeat, and we're able to personalize, and do things that we could do with the Starbucks Rewards customer right now, with a much broader segment of customers. The long-term strategy is something that is going to build over time, and its part of an ongoing shift in our marketing, from a short term one and done focus to a sustained platform ongoing relationship focus with our customers.","Rosalind Brewer - Starbucks Corp.","And just one last thing, on that note, is that this does allow us to plan labor much more effectively, because it's a planned Happy Hour extended over a longer period of time, and more predictable, and so we're able to get labor efficiencies out of the programs that we're running now.","Operator","Your next question comes from Andy Barish with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Andrew Marc Barish - Jefferies LLC","Yes, can you give us a little bit more on Deployment 2.0, and just kind of the way it rolls out over the course of the next year or so? And do you actually expect to get labor leverage? And maybe you can reference some of the markets where you've already done 2.0, you know, X-ing out some of the partner investment, obviously, that's been incremental?","Rosalind Brewer - Starbucks Corp.","Yes. So couple of things there. So, first of all, we have fully rolled out Deployment 2.0. We did that in February, fully rolled out by the end of the month. And actually what the program does is, first of all, it establishes the store-specific sales routines, and then we apply the labor against it. It looks at the actual product mix. It actually looks at the channel mix, and it does that by day-part. And this is the visibility that we had not had the data in our stores. And in the past, the deployment routine was actually a one-size-fits-all program. So if you were a store in Chicago, and a store in Omaha, Nebraska, we applied the same deployment plan. Now we can look at this routine by store-specific data. They have a visual digital data that shows them, and displays within the store how to apply their labor, so it's not a cookie cut or spreadsheet approach like it was before. The work is much more balanced. We are getting engagement by the partners. They're enjoying knowing their schedules, and knowing what to expect from their sales flow. So from that, we're getting two particular moves, is the partner engagement piece, and also the cost efficiency from it. We're also looking at ways that we look at the product plans, too. So again, this reducing the LTOs by 30% helps us also add predictability into the scheduling. So both of those are creating efficiencies that we need.","Andrew Marc Barish - Jefferies LLC","And Roz, that rolled out in the middle of Q2, and it's fully rolled out to all stores?","Rosalind Brewer - Starbucks Corp.","Fully rolled out, yes.","Andrew Marc Barish - Jefferies LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Palmer with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. Good evening. Question on just the priorities of the initiatives you've been talking about. I can tell that after this call, there's going to be an argument about the momentum that you laid out some sales targets over the next couple quarters that suggest and even mentioned in recent months that the momentum is building. And I know you feel like it is building, but which initiatives give you the confidence that that is going to be the case heading into fiscal 2019? You mentioned beverage innovation, digital user growth and drivers, and some of those more effective promotions. But if you had to prioritize the things that are really giving you confidence where you're getting traction or you see in the pipeline, that would be helpful. Thanks.","Kevin Johnson - Starbucks Corp.","Yeah, I'll \u2013 David, this is Kevin. I'll start by answering, I think, number one the Deployment 2.0 that was rolled out really addressed areas related to the customer experience in our stores. And we're seeing the results of that in terms of not only our partner engagement but in terms of our customer satisfaction by day-part. So I think clearly that is a very important attribute. Number two, digital. And as I've commented and Matt outlined, I think, the fact that we're widening the aperture of our digital reach far beyond rewards customers to include as many non-rewards customers as we can reach, giving us a direct channel to communicate with them. And frankly, what that does is it allows us to personalize the communications to improve their experience, but it also gives us that direct access to communicate with them which raises awareness. So that combination of personalized awareness of those customers, I think, is a very important attribute. And then third, I think the product innovation that we've been driving. And so those three things have to come together. The experience, the product innovation, and then the digital connection so there's awareness and reach.","Operator","Your next question comes from Matthew DiFrisco with Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open.","Matthew DiFrisco - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Thank you. I just had two follow-up questions. Specifically to the questions about the LTOs and the Happy Hour, can you just sort of quantify? You had a couple of these initiatives, the 2.0, begin in fiscal 2Q. They're going to be drivers in 3Q, and you're going to pull back a little bit less LTOs and things like that. How much of that was already reflected in the numbers you just reported versus sort of now that we're in fiscal 3Q they're going to start? And then my second question or clarification is with respect to the same store sales commentary, it appears \u2013 is this correct to walk away with thinking that the incident in Philadelphia and the subsequent protests and some of the negative headlines around that, that did not have a meaningful impact such as I guess in years past sometimes you've had political activism and things like that that have disrupted not specific to your store, but have disrupted some of your urban stores, and you saw a little bit of volume slow down? So I guess we've weathered the storm?","Kevin Johnson - Starbucks Corp.","Matt, this is Kevin. Let me take the question on Philadelphia first, and then we'll take your first question. But on Philadelphia, I spent several days on the ground in Philadelphia along with a number of members of our leadership team to ensure that we were fully reviewing and understanding the situation, and how that could have ever happened in a Starbucks. But also to begin to craft the appropriate actions to address it so that it doesn't happen again. And I believe we are focused on the long term and doing the right things, and we will be a better company because of this. Now, I acknowledge it's still early, but we are not seeing an impact on comp sales as a result of Philadelphia. We are still assessing the overall financial impact of the actions we are taking. We've announced we're closing stores in the afternoon of May 29, and we're embarking on not only a day of discovery, but work that we're going to do to ensure that all aspects of our review are captured in the actions that we're taking. And so one thing I do know for sure is that our approach to this will pay long term dividends for Starbucks.","Scott Maw - Starbucks Corp.","And Matt, on the first part of your question, what I would say is most of the things that you listed really will kick in in the back half of this year. We did see, we believe, some benefit from the Deployment 2.0 changes that Roz talked about, but the vast majority of what we talked about will build over the course of 2018.","Operator","Your next question comes from Andrew Charles with Cowen. Your line is open.","Andrew Charles - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great, thanks. I know in the China call in January, you spoke about the lower comping nature of the East China stores just given the denser penetration of these markets and since this is the first time we've seen the consolidated results, can you help to segment how the gap between legacy China and the new East China stores have historically trended just to help us model this new structure going forward and what we can expect as normalized growth rate there?","Kevin Johnson - Starbucks Corp.","I'll have John talk a little bit about the East China business and the opportunity, but what we said, I think, on the call is that they're a little bit lower on the last call. They have been a little bit lower over time. Not dramatically lower, but a little bit lower, and it's really because of the significantly higher store opening rate in that market. John, do you want to talk a little bit about what...","John Culver - Starbucks Corp.","Yeah, and just as a clarification, Andrew, it's not currently in the reported comp.","Andrew Charles - Cowen & Co. LLC","Right.","John Culver - Starbucks Corp.","So we won't be reporting that until next January, but overall, the integration gives us \u2013 I mean, it's on track, first off. It gives us a great opportunity to bring East China and company-owned China together and approach the market with a single voice to both our partners and to our customers and then leverage the back end across both businesses to drive more efficiencies and then also scale for growth going forward. So Belinda and her leadership team are focused entirely on the integration of East China and making sure it's a huge success for us. We've, in the first full quarter of the integration, obviously have welcomed all the partners from East China into the business.","We are in the process of normalizing pay and benefits across both company owned as well as East China. And then also, looking at financial and accounting systems and making sure that those are synced as well. We also continue to work on supply chain and supply chain efficiencies. That work is ongoing as well as the back office systems and other key areas. And that work will continue through FY 2019. So we'll be able to provide a great update to you during the Investor Day, and just \u2013 this presents just one more opportunity for us to really take advantage of the opportunity for growth and accelerating growth in China across the Mainland.","Operator","Your next question comes from Karen Holthouse with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Karen Holthouse - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hi. One quick clarification and a question. The 80% cash return number that you gave, does that include or not include stores in East China? And then actually moving sort of away from the U.S. business and actually China, looking at the other operating segment, at this point, are we down to this really is just U.S. food service and then the Roastery business? And within that, when-- I know that there's \u2013 it can be pretty substantial upfront pre-opening costs with the sort of leases you're signing, but when should we think about the Roastery business breaking even or sort of funding its own growth? Is that something that could happen in 2019 or do we need to look out farther than that? Thanks.","Scott Maw - Starbucks Corp.","Yeah, on the first question, Karen, it's just the company-owned stores in China as of the end of the year last year, so it does not include East China. We'll get our arms around those stores at a detailed level and we'll give you an update as we move through time. I will say that the profitability of those stores is also quite strong, but the 80% does not include those stores. On the other segment, substantially what's in there is definitely I would say broadly Siren Retail which includes the Roasteries. But will include for example the Reserve store that's downstairs in the building here in Seattle. It will include Princi stores as we open those. It includes I believe still some revenue related to SBC. And so there's a few things in there. And it will be beyond 2019 before that segment breaks even.","Operator","The last question comes from Dennis Geiger with UBS. Your line is open.","Dennis Geiger - UBS Securities LLC","Great, and thanks for all the detail on the U.S. consumer \u2013 or your U.S. customer. That's very helpful. But I wanted to come back to the non-MSR digital relationship platform. Is there anything else you can share on your learnings at this \u2013 of the initiatives at this very early stage? Perhaps how easy it's been to get sign-ups, how easy it's been to capture those emails? And I think you mentioned that there will be several million members on that platform by year end presumably that will build into 2019. So as we get into 2019, can that customer cohort actually grow spend similar to the MSR platform year-over-year?","Matthew Ryan - Starbucks Corp.","Sure, Matt, Ryan here. Thank you for the question. I think, the exciting thing about this strategy is that it is a long-term strategy. It's not something that is one and done this year, done in immediate response to the challenging environment we've been in. We see a huge opportunity because there are 75 million customers in our store, 15 million rewards. And the several million we're talking about this year is just the beginning.","There is a long, long road ahead of us, and we're encouraged by early signs. Now it's way, and it'd be very easy to get over our skis and get excited about the results we've seen to date, but what I can tell you is that after just a couple of Happy Hours, we know we're on the right track here. We also know that it's very easy to sign customers up because people want to have a relationship with a brand that they are very involved with. So what we have going for us that most companies don't have going for us is that people want a direct digital relationship, and we're now giving them reasons outside of Starbucks Rewards to do that. So with the kind of frequents that we have, the kind of brand love we have, we see a lot of opportunity there.","With regard to what we're going to see in terms of growth per customer and spend, too early to speculate on that. We're optimistic about what we saw in terms of the response to Happy Hours. I think Roz mentioned that we're seeing greater response to the Happy Hours from our non-SR versus our SR customer. So everything is very early, but everything is very promising. And the one thing I would stress is really it takes signing up customers, then getting to know them before we can really take advantage of the personalization and the benefits that come to the business, but we know we're on the right track.","Operator","I will now turn the call over to Mr. Shaw for his closing remarks.","Tom Shaw - Starbucks Corp.","Great, thanks Chris.

My name is Mike, and I\u2019ll be your conference operator today. At this time, I\u2019d like to welcome everyone to Starbucks Coffee Company\u2019s Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2013 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Thank you.","Ms. DeGrande, you may begin your conference.","JoAnn DeGrande","Thank you, Mike. Good afternoon. This is JoAnn DeGrande, Vice President of Investor Relations for Starbucks Coffee Company. Joining me on the call today are Howard Schultz, Chairman, President and CEO; John Culver, Group President of China, Asia Pacific, Channel Development and Emerging Brands and Troy Alstead, CFO.","This conference call will include forward-looking statements, which are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements. Any such statements should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements in our earnings release and the risk factor discussions in our filings with the SEC, including our last annual report on Form 10-K. Starbucks assumes no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements or information. This conference call is being webcast and an archive of the webcast will be available on our website at investor.starbucks.com.","With that, let me turn the call over to Howard Schultz. Howard?","Howard Schultz","Thank you, JoAnn, and welcome to everyone on today\u2019s call. I\u2019m very pleased to discuss the record Q4 and fiscal 2013 results that Starbucks reported today. Q4 capped off what was without question the best year in Starbucks 42 year history, driven by robust innovation and disciplined operating and financial performance across each of our business segments and virtually around the world.","Continued strong comparable store sales growth of 8% in each of our Americas and China Asia-Pacific regions in Q4 combined with positive comps of 2% in EMEA to produce global comp store sales of 7% marking our 15th consecutive quarter of comp growth in excess of 5%, despite continued challenging economic and consumer headwinds in many of the global markets we serve.","Starbucks consolidated Q4 revenue rose 13% to a record $3.8 billion while operating leverage and a continued focus on controlling expenses enabled us to expand our operating margin to a full 220 basis points over last year to a quarterly record of 17.6%. And outstanding execution across the company enabled us to deliver record Q4 EPS of $0.63 a share to our shareholders, a full 37% over last year\u2019s Q4 and the highest EPS of any single quarter in the 42 year history of our Company.","For the full fiscal 2013 Starbucks increased revenues by 12% to a record $14.9 billion, expanded its operating margin 150 basis points to a record 16.5% and draw a 26% increase in EPS to a record $2.26 per share. Noteworthy and immensely gratifying is that each one of our business segments contributed to a remarkable performance in fiscal 2013, equally significant is that each segment contributed to growing the equity and trust of the Starbucks brand around the world.","With over 3 billion customer visits to more than 19,000 stores in 62 countries around the world in fiscal \u201913, Starbucks is literally firing on all cylinders like never before. Let me tell you we\u2019re just getting started. I believe that fiscal 2013 will prove to be an inflexion point and a spring board to even greater opportunity and success in the future because of the strategic fly wheel we introduced June-July through which we leverage our global store footprint, growing CPG presence in world class digital and mobile assets is driving performance in gaining increased momentum.","I will provide a brief overview of segment performance in Q4 and then turn the call over to John Culver, Group President of Starbucks Coffee China, Asia Pacific and Channel Development and Emerging Brands to provide detail on those key businesses. Then Troy will take you through the financials in detail and provide you with an update on our fiscal \u201914 outlook.","Let me pause and congratulate Troy as I look to him, on his promotion to Group President, Global Business Services in addition to his ongoing role and responsibility as CFO. Thank you Troy for your leadership, our 20 year partnership and for the tremendous contributions you\u2019ve made to the business as CFO over the last five years.","Now turning to the Americas. The momentum we reported in Starbucks Americas segment in Q3 continued in Q4, with a stunning 8% comp growth driven by a 5% increase in traffic and a 3% lift in ticket. Noteworthy is that the 8% comp growth recorded in the U.S in Q4 an amazing accomplishment given the size and maturity of the store base we\u2019re comping against, representing our 15 consecutive quarter of U.S comp growth in excess of 7% and that many of our over 2,000 new renovated or relocated U.S stores were the strongest performers.","Strong performance in both our U.S and rapidly growing Latin American businesses contribute to a 11% increase in total Q4 Americas revenue to a record $2.8 billion. Having just returned from a market visit to Canada, a great Starbucks market with over 1,300 stores where I witnessed first hand deep passionate sense of mission that our partners are bringing to their customers and the communities they serve and the strong leadership provided by Annie Young-Scrivner, President of Starbucks Canada is bringing to the market. In Q4 we recorded the strongest comp growth in Canada in 13 quarters, helping us exceed $1 billion of full year revenues in that market for the first time ever.","Building on a strong summer sales, in September the Americas region kicked off for its Fall promotional calendar with what has become our most popular seasonal beverage ever, Pumpkin Spice Latte. 2013 marks the 10th anniversary of PSL with customers having purchased more than 200 million PSL beverages since launch.","Despite the proliferation of Knock Off and Copycat, sales of Starbucks PSL beverages are as strong as ever and once again exceeding expectations as customers continue to embrace the quality of the original Starbucks PSL.","Also in September we debuted a new single-origin coffee from Ethiopia, the birth place of coffee and in recognition of our 42 year history are purchasing Colombian coffee and our plans to open our first store in Colombia next year, we introduced Colombia Caldas, a wonderful Starbucks Reserve.","Recently we launched a national marketing campaign around coffee entitled Starbucks Higher Arabica standards that will benefit both our retail stores and CPG businesses. These initiatives underscore Starbucks ongoing commitment to bringing the world\u2019s most rare and exotic coffee for our customers and to constantly reaffirming our coffee leadership and authority worldwide.","In Q4, we also made solid progress against our plans to expand our La Boulange baked goods platform. La Boulange products are now available in more than 3,500 Starbucks stores in the U.S and we\u2019re now on track off for La Boulange in all 7,000 company operated stores in the U.S by the end of fiscal 2014.","Food continues to be an important component of our growth strategy and we\u2019re extremely encouraged by both customer response to La Boulange and the sales lift we\u2019re seeing over the food products La Boulange we placed. Building on the success we\u2019ve begun testing new La Boulange lunch concepts in a number of our San Francisco stores and targeting an initial rollout next fall as part of our plan to elevate and expand our lunch time day parts.","In the year since we acquired La Boulange we\u2019ve demonstrated the significant strategic benefits of the acquisition through the enhanced quality of our food platform and the corresponding sales incrementality it is driving.","You\u2019ve also undoubtedly heard that we\u2019re exploring another exciting innovative concept. Starbucks handcrafted carbonated beverages, in Atlanta and Austin as well as in Japan and Singapore. These efforts are part of a larger plan to enter and innovate in the cold, carbonation industry and over $100 billion global category by leveraging our unique customized beverage retail platform expertise to deliver innovation and personalization to customers like no other industry participant ever has.","Customer response to our carbonation innovation has been encouraging and we look forward to sharing more details around our plans for cold, carbonation in the months ahead. Stay tuned.","And beginning this Friday, we will begin rolling out Starbucks holiday beverages in our iconic red cups, a new Gingerbread Latte recipe and the Savory La Boulange Almond Croissant will join a wide variety of other innovative and delicious offerings that promise to make this holiday and winter season our most exciting and successful year.","Turning to the EMEA region, I\u2019m very pleased to report that the early progress we began to see in our Europe, Middle East and African region in Q3 continued to Q4, with positive 2% comp growth in the second consecutive quarter. As I\u2019ve previously shared with you the leverage and learning from our U.S transformation combined with strong leadership in the region are driving beverage and food innovation in efforts to elevate enhance the customer experience across the region as we open our 2,000 EMEA store this quarter.","We're particularly encouraged by the solid performance we saw in the U.K., our single largest market in the region, supporting our view that an early turnaround in EMEA may be underway and that we are moving down the correct path for sustained profitability. We also opened 34 new license and franchise stores in Q4, early progress against our plans to add more license and franchise stores in our EMEA portfolio.","Let me now turn it to Channel Development and Emerging Brands. John will be providing an update on our fast growing Channel Development and Emerging Brands business. There are a few noteworthy highlights I'd like to share with you. We have already exceeded the aggressive growth plans we laid out for Evolution Fresh upon acquiring the business and brand in November 2011. A wide selection of fresh healthy Evolution Fresh juices are now available in more than 8,000 Starbucks and grocery retailer whole cases [ph] and almost all Whole Foods locations nationwide.","Earlier this month, we reached a big milestone with the opening of our new state-of-the-art juicery in California. The new juicery will have 190 Starbucks partners and quadruple our capacity to reduce Evolution Fresh brand cold-pressed juices and enable us to accelerate our plan to significantly increase our share of the $1.6 billion super premium juice category.","As I said in the past the category of tea, a $90 billion global industry that is right for innovation is another major strategic opportunity for us to that leverages all of our core capabilities and existing infrastructure. We are making significant progress against our plans to integrate, develop and expand the Teavana retail platform. Last week we were in New York City for the grand opening of a reimagined Teavana Fine Tea and Tea Bar store on the Upper East Side and be followed by a second store in Seattle [indiscernible] shortly.","The store in New York is stunning but beyond the ascetics, the reimagined Teavana store brings the romance and theater of handcrafted beverages to the tea category like never before. We are convinced that with Teavana, Starbucks can reinvent and do for tea just what we have done for coffee and that we can grow and expand the tea industry and the Tea Bar concept by introducing the wide, innovative array of handcrafted tea beverages, tea inspired food and world-class tea merchandize. With the tea being our larger opportunity than coffee outside of the U.S. and Canada, we see a future with Teavana stores across North America and around the world.","[indiscernible] Teavana with the company's unmatched knowledge and authority around all things tea, then we learned about Teavana's extraordinary tea sourcing expertise and capabilities. In the quarters ahead you will see how we are expanding and deepening the presence of high quality Teavana branded teas within the Starbucks stores in order to leverage tea as a driver of additional customer occasions creating wide recognition for the Teavana brand and adding another layer of growth within the Starbucks stores. The opportunity to innovate within the global tea category is significant and we are poised to bring an unparallel retail experience to customers around the world.","Let me turn to mobile, digital and loyalty. Perhaps no single competency and capability is enabling us to elevate and amplify the Starbucks brand and to deliver an enhanced Starbucks' experience for our customers more than our global leadership position and continued investment in mobile, digital and loyalty innovations and technologies and no single competency is more important to the success of our proprietary strategic [indiscernible] that is adding so much value to the Starbucks brand and our financial performance.","Fiscal 2013 was another significant record year for our card program with over $4 billion loaned in globally and nearly one-third of all North American store tender paid with a service card. At the same time our loyalty program expansion continued around the world including 11 significant new markets including Germany, Hong Kong and the Philippines. We've also begun integrating our emerging brands and adding a number of exciting new features to the My Starbucks Rewards program. Members can now early redeem My Starbucks Rewards stars in Teavana stores and reading [ph] stars for Evolution Fresh juices and other bottled Starbucks ready-to-drink beverages in Starbucks stores, all of which further leverage our world-class card and mobile payment programs providing enhanced value to our customers.","Today with 11% of our U.S. and Canada in-store transitions being paid for with a mobile device, Starbucks is far away the clear leader in mobile payment. We are encouraged by how our customers have fully embraced our mobile apps as the most convenient way to pay, reload and keep track of their loyalty rewards. With the current average of over 4 million mobile transactions per week and more than 8 million customers using our mobile app, Starbucks mobile platforms are fast growing customer touch points. Through them we are communicating with and delivering innovation to our customers in a way that no other retailer can and on the horizon, our enhancement to our mobile apps that include mobile ordering and digital tipping are on its way.","As we enter the last two months of our calendar 2013, we do so with exciting plans for Veteran's Day, Thanksgiving and Christmas holiday shopping season that we know will delight our customers and further add to our operational and financial momentum. Considering there's never been a more exciting or more important time for our company. I'd like to conclude by congratulating and thanking my 200,000 fellow partners who proudly wear the green apron for the [indiscernible] results we've achieved in 2013 and extending my heartfelt appreciation to them for all they do for our customers all around the world every day.","I want to close on a very personal note. Fiscal 2013 was the year in which Starbucks recorded record financial and operating performance. It was also a year in which we delivered record value to our shareholders with over $20 billion increases in market cap alone. For the record of which I'm particularly proud of is that in fiscal 2013 our partners, our employees realized also over $230 million in value as a result of the commitment we made over 20 years ago to link returns to our shareholders and rewards to our people as well by providing equity in the company for all of our full and part-time workers who work more than 20 hours a week.","It is evident that 25 years ago when we set out to build a great enduring company, we said we want to achieve the balance between profitability and a social conscience by sharing our success with our people, by providing a great opportunity for our customers and doing everything we can to enhance the communities we are doing business with. This has been a phenomenal year, a stunning year for our company and for all those at Starbucks it is with great pride that we present Q4 and year-end results to you. John.","John Culver","Thank you, Howard. 2013 was indeed an extraordinary year for Starbucks and I couldn't be more proud for the significant role for the China and Asia-Pacific region and the Channel Development business is playing in our overall success. I'll begin with the incredibly charmed results for cap, Starbucks' fastest growing region with 13 countries, close to 4,000 stores and nearly 70,000 partners serving 11 million customers every week. As you can see from our results the growth throughout the region continues to be a meaningful component of the Starbucks overall story.","For the quarter I'm very pleased to share that the region is reporting record results in three key areas; total revenue, total operating income and new stores opened. In the fourth quarter revenue grew a very healthy 29% reaching 256 million which was driven by 8% comp growth and the opening of 588 net new stores in the year. This store growth represents a 31% increase over the prior year.","In the fourth quarter we delivered 96 million in operating income which represents a 46% increase over the prior year. Operating margin increased to 37.5%, a 440 basis point improvement over last year. This was driven by a combination of strong sales leverage, lower operating costs and a reduction to our estimated asset retirement obligations on certain store leases.","Today, we have a very well balanced portfolio of company-operated, joint venture and licensed markets led by China and Japan and these results demonstrate the strength of the Starbucks brand and the relevancy we are gaining with our customers across the region. We continue to take a holistic approach to building the Starbucks brand in our markets while making the necessary investments ahead of the curve that will fuel our future growth.","We now have localized capabilities in the region not only in store operations, real estate and marketing in category but also on the critical areas of store design, R&D, supply chain and IT. Coupled with the recent announcement of Jeff Hansberry as President for the region, we\u2019re now in a position to integrate channel development into our markets and expand the Starbucks footprint beyond our retail stores.","In the quarter we reached two significant milestones. We opened our 1000 stores in both China and Japan. The stores that we are building today across the region are some of the most unique and innovative store designs we have anywhere in the world. This is highlighted by the most recent opening of our two newest flagship stores in Beijing. These stores are designed to elevate the coffee experience for our customers and to further enhance and differentiate the third place experience from anything else that exists in the market.","Digital also continues to be a huge opportunity and focus for us in the region. We have now introduced the Starbucks Card in the aspects of our loyalty program in 11 of the 13 countries we operate in. We are seeing significant transaction with the card program in all markets as it now accounts for 23% of tender across the region. From a customer perspective our satisfaction and quality stores are achieving record levels. The frequency of our customer business continues to increase and we continue to attract new customers into our stores reflected by a 6% increase in transactions for the quarter.","Turning to China, we have been humbled by the way in which our customers embrace the Starbucks experience and recognize that we must continue to earn their trust and respect each and every day. We have seen first hand that Starbucks is increasingly becoming a daily ritual for local Chinese. Key drivers for this have been our innovative store designs, local product innovations and the My Starbucks Rewards program where in just two short years we built a base of over 3 million members and it is now grown to account for 35% of transactions in our stores.","For the year we opened 317 new stores in China and the initial performance of those new stores is very strong. The stores we opened in 2012 are currently averaging sales in excess of $700,000, while our 2013 classes stores are on track to annualize with a very similar result. Not surprisingly China will again be the largest driver of the approximately 750 new stores we plan to open across the region in 2014.","Beyond China we are accelerating growth in every other market. I\u2019m particularly encouraged by our strong results and future growth opportunities in key geographies including Japan, Korea, Thailand and Indonesia. And I would like to also congratulate our India partners on the one year anniversary of the market. Through our relationship with Tata, we have opened 25 stores and the response of our customers has been nothing short of amazing which gives us tremendous optimism for the future growth prospects for this market.","Finally, we have a very long runway for growth across the region based on the foundation we have built for our brand and the investments we continue to make. And I remain extremely confident in our ability to drive strong comparable store growth or balancing the rapid expansion of our new store footprint well into the future.","As optimistic as I am about the future growth opportunity we have in cap, I\u2019m just as excited about the long-term opportunity for our channel development business. With fiscal 2013 revenue of $1.4 billion, operating income of more than $400 million a very robust operating margin near 30% and a portfolio of market leading products, channel development has become a meaningful contributor to Starbucks results and is directly benefiting from the strategic flywheel as Howard mentioned earlier.","In the fourth quarter, channel development grew revenue by 13% to $361 million. At the same time operating income of $128 million grew more than two times faster than revenue in Q4, accelerating to 30% growth on the benefit of lower coffee cost and leverage from our strong top line growth.","In Q4 we were able to stabilize and grow dollar and pound share in 11 of the 13 weeks for our premium roast and ground package coffee. This was due in part of the list price reduction we took in May. We are also encouraged by the synergy we are creating with the emerging growth drivers such as linking the My Starbucks Reward program to our package coffee business where our customers have earned more than 1.5 million stars since launch.","We also continue to work with key retailers to increase our presence with the Starbucks Signature Aisle. Already in 100 grocery stores today and with plans to reach 400 by the end of the fiscal year Signature Aisle quantitatively elevates our brand while enhancing the customer experience. The combination of value, rewards and our premium positioning will allow us to continue our leadership position in premium package coffee.","Additionally premium single-serve continues to drive accelerated growth for the business with Starbucks K-Cup growing sales 42% in the prior 13 week period. We have a very diverse portfolio of K-Cup offerings that gives us the premium leadership position down the aisle. In the quarter we added vanilla and caramel flavored coffee to our K-Cup lineup and we will continue to bring new flavors and varieties to the market through our expanded relationship with Green Mountain in 2014.","It's now been a year since we launched Verismo and we\u2019re looking forward to another successful holiday season. This year we have significantly increased the number of doors we will be in for the holidays, introduce the new machine with a fresh design and functionality and are offering several new skews to drive the success of this platform. We remain very optimistic about the large and growing opportunity we have to expand Starbucks beyond our retail stores given the performance of the business throughout 2013.","For competition down the aisle continues to increase, both in terms of the emergence of the value segment and increased promotional activity in the coffee category overall we are in a position to win. Although we may experience volatility quarter-to-quarter, we will continue to elevate our brand through market leading innovation, strong cross channel rewards which leverages our MSR program and meaningful value and differentiation. Make no mistake, we are committed to delivering double-digit top and bottom line growth for this segment in 2014 and beyond.","In closing, I\u2019m incredibly proud and want to thank and recognize all of our partners throughout China and Asia Pacific and within our channel development business for the significant contributions they have made to the overall success of the Company. It is through their efforts that we have been able to deliver these record results and it's why we believe we are poised and positioned to capture the tremendous opportunity we have in front of us.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Troy. Troy.","Troy Alstead","Thanks, John. Let\u2019s turn now to the America segment where the fourth quarter represents an impressive continuation of the strength delivery in Q3. Revenue growth of 11% was driven by 8% of comp growth including 5% lift in transactions. And as the case has been for quite some time now there were a diverse set drivers behind the growth. In the U.S. food continues to boost our sales adding about two percentage points to comp in the quarter. That is a result of gains in both the tax rate and favorable mix in both lunch and bakery items. Food is a key driver behind our strength in the lunch hours of 11am to 1pm our fastest growth apart and the one with the highest incremental profit potential.","Pumpkin Spice platform now in its 10th year once again delivered strong growth. Additionally our focus on summer refreshment and ice beverages was a success. Those promotions combined for one point of comp. Treat Receipt was a hit again this year with 16% higher redemption rate than last year, and as a result of the favorable mix shift in food as well as recent pricing actions, ticket growth contributed three percentage points to comp in Q4 its highest contribution in two years.","While food was the single largest driver of U.S. comp in Q4, La Boulange is just 15% of our stores for the entire quarter does not yet have the reach to contribute meaningfully. It has, however, been very meaningful in stores that carry it which is encouraging to us as we proceed with the rollout. Profitability remains strongly in the Americas as operating income grew 16% to $606 million in Q4 with operating margin expanding 100 basis points to 21.8%. Sales leverage continues to be the primary driver of margin expansion in the Americas.","In Europe, Middle East and Africa, fourth quarter results demonstrated the improvement that has been building over the past two years. EMEA revenue grew to 3% driven by an increase in the number of licensed stores and sales growth within them. Our largest licensed markets in EMEA are among the best performing including the Middle East and Russia. We were also able to sustain 2% comp growth in our company-operated EMEA markets despite a still challenging macro environment.","Profitability continues to improve in EMEA as well with Q4 operating income reaching $27 million, the highest level of full year income since we started reporting EMEA as a separate segment in 2010. Our ongoing store portfolio optimization effort which we embarked upon a year ago has been greatly important in several ways. We brand [ph] our store development with licensees adding stores that are delivering excellent sales, strong profitability and high return on capital. We refocused our efforts on company-operated stores to those with a strong combination of excellent real estate, a practical cost structure and demographics that support sales levels that drive profitability.","This optimization [indiscernible] closure of 72 underperforming stores and relicensing 24 more in the past five quarters. This program coupled with a renewed focus on operations and the customer experience has helped drive transaction comp growth higher by 5 and by 3 percentage points respectively the past two quarters. Work in the past year has also enhanced margins in EMEA with 9.3% operating margin reported in Q4 was the highest we've achieved in 12 quarters and we continue to make progress on our target by improving profitability each year finishing fiscal 2013 at 5.5% up from 0.6% last year. We have made real progress on our long-term cash to the mid teens margin in this region.","Across all our other segments which includes Teavana, Evolution Fresh, [indiscernible] Coffee and our digital ventures business, revenue more than doubled to $105 million driven largely by the inclusion of Teavana revenue beginning in Q2; both in our digital ventures business and Evolution Fresh also contributed. The net operating loss of our other segments was $17 million in Q4 as we continue to invest in our emerging brands. The strong revenue and margin growth in all our businesses led outstanding consolidated results in the fourth quarter. Net revenue grew 13% to $3.8 billion, strong global comp store of 7% comprised of 5% transaction growth and 2% ticket growth were the key driver.","The addition of 1,701 netting stores globally including 356 Teavana stores over the past year and strengthened license stores in Channel Development also contributed to the revenue growth. Consolidated operating income of $669 million grew 29% over the last Q4 more than doubling the revenue growth rate. This led to record operating margin of 17.6%, an expansion of 220 basis points over last year. Strong sales leverage contributed 90 basis points of favorability with the EMEA portfolio optimization adding 60 basis points and lower commodity costs adding 50 basis points. Earnings per share of $0.63 grew to 37% over last Q4.","As I indicated to you in July the fourth quarter included a $0.03 gain on the sale of our equity in Argentina and Chile which will enable further growth and enhanced profitability for both parties in these markets. Even without this $0.03 gain, EPS will accelerate in each quarter throughout fiscal '13 demonstrating the momentum we have translating our strong top line into significant bottom line growth.","For the full fiscal year 2013, our results were equally impressive. Consolidated net revenue reached $14.9 billion, 12% higher than in 2012. 7% lower comp growth in 2013 was the largest driver and was our fourth consecutive year at or above that mark. Transactions grew by 5% for the year while average ticket grew to 2%. Consolidated operating income grew to a record $2.5 billion in fiscal '13, an increase of 23% over fiscal '12. We also delivered record operating margin in 2013 of 16.5%, a full 150 basis points higher than last year. Leverage on our record sales and 50 basis points of commodity cost favorability were the key drivers.","The strong revenue growth coupled with excellent margin improvement led record earnings per share of $2.26 in fiscal '13. This represents growth of 26% over the prior year and included $0.03 each in the second and fourth quarters for gains on the sale of equity in Mexico, Chile and Argentina. Globally we had 1,701 net new stores in fiscal '13 and of course is more geographically diverse than ever before. For instance, in 2007, our largest year of store growth ever, U.S. accounted for 70% of new stores.","By contrast in 2013 the U.S. accounted for just over 20% in new stores. This ability is allowing us to be selective on real estate while celebrating growth, ultimately enhancing return on capital. The strong business results we delivered in fiscal '13 had culminated in total cash generation. This has been critical in allowing us to reinvest in the business while [indiscernible] the increase in cash return to shareholders. For the year we returned a record $1.2 billion of cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.","Additionally, today we announced that our Board has approved a 24% increase to our quarterly dividend to $0.26 per share. This aligns with our commitment to increasing shareholder returns which includes growing dividends. As part of that commitment we have increased our targeted dividend payout ratio range now 35% to 45%.","Over the past several years and again in 2013, we've demonstrated the innovative capabilities and operational excellence to drive strong and consistent comparable store sales growth. We demonstrated the ability to accelerate new store development while also increasing return on capital. We've demonstrated a vision to [indiscernible] for the future in our channel development and emerging brand businesses. We've demonstrated the ability to expand operating margins and consistently drive earnings growth faster than revenue growth and we demonstrated the ability to deliver earnings above our targeted range [indiscernible] for growth.","As we close 2013 and look ahead, the strength of our fiscal 2013 results further increases our confidence in our ability to deliver another strong year. [indiscernible] 2014 outlook and as you then subsequently establish your own expectations for our financial performance in the coming year, I would ask you to both recognize the strength and consistently of our historical performance as well as recognize the challenge of the task ahead, the challenge of again driving store comp growth through this large system, the challenge of again expanding margins after several years of driving margins higher, the challenge of overcoming increased interest expense and a higher tax rate.","We are more optimistic about our future than ever before and at the same time we're realistic and practical in our expectations and I would encourage you to be as well. Targeting revenue growth in 2014 of 10% or greater driven by local comp growth in mid single digits and continued growth in channel development.","Now let me clarify a misunderstanding about our revenue guidance. That revenue growth target is no different from the guidance we provided last quarter. The 10% of greater just recognizes that we have great confidence that we can consistently drive [indiscernible] top line growth in the short term as well as the long term. Now as we said last quarter and on heels [ph] of phenomenal global comp growth in the third and again in the fourth quarter that level of high single digit comp growth [indiscernible] accomplishment for a system as large and mature as Starbucks.","We strongly believe that we have the innovation pipeline, customer trust and loyalty and operational capabilities to continue to sustainably drive same-store sales and equally strong we believe that the mid single digit level is challenging and achievable. As we move into the new fiscal year it would unreasonable to plan for or set expectations any higher.","Also contributing to our revenue growth in fiscal '14 will be our planned 1,300 net new stores. China and Asia-Pacific is now targeted to open 750 net new stores with approximately two-thirds have been licensed. EMEA is now targeted for 150 net new openings especially all licensed. We continue to anticipate opening 600 net new stores in the Americas with approximately high licensed.","Full year consolidated operating margin is expected to expand by 150 to 200 basis points at fiscal '14 as we continue to drive leverage on our strong revenue growth as well as recognize the benefit of lower coffee cups as we expect moderate improvement in operating margin driven by strong sales leverage. In EMEA we anticipate operating margin percentage reached single digits driven by the benefit of the portfolio actions taken in fiscal '13 as well as continued performance and improvements.","In cap we anticipate operating margin moving towards the low 30% range and our rapid growth continues to shift away from our historically licensed model. In channel development, lower coffee cups will provide a modest operating margin expansion in fiscal '14. Our strong revenue growth in margin expansion target gives us confidence in targeted earnings per share in the range of 255 to 265 in fiscal \u201914. We are targeting EPS in the range of $0.67 to $0.69 in the first quarter with $0.54 to $0.55 targeted for quarter two, a traditionally lower quarter due to seasonality.","Contributing to the EPS growth will be another year of tail winds on coffee costs, still expected adding approximately $0.09 to $0.10 net benefit for the year. This benefit is expected to be spread evenly throughout the year and reflects the gross coffee impact partially offset by the recent pricing reduction in CPG as well as routine investments in the business.","We now have the vast majority of our coffee needs locked for fiscal \u201914 and have begun selective buying of certain varietals in to fiscal \u201915. Perhaps one additional comment regarding coffee, I sometimes hear speculation as Starbucks might -- significantly more from favorable coffee costs in 2014. Given that we\u2019re essentially fully price protected now, our price reduction in CPG was executed earlier this year and our other offsetting investments throughout the business are fully planned in various stages of implementation. I would encourage all of you to take close attention to my coffee guidance just provided and not create expectations of winning more than the $0.09 to $0.10 net benefit.","Capital expenditures in fiscal \u201914 are expected to remain flat with the previous year at approximately $1.2 billion. Continued investment in store renovation, new stores and other retail initiatives will continue to comprise majority of the spend. We anticipate resolution for the suit with Kraft before the end of this calendar year and believe we have adequate liquidity to cover any outcome.","And finally our cash rate in fiscal 2014 is expected to increase to 34.5%. This is meaningfully higher than fiscal \u201913 which included non-routine benefits from prior year audits and state tax true-ups. At our Investor Conference last December, I summarize 2012 in one word, execution. For 2013 strong execution again led to outstanding financial performance. Record revenues in all our segments, margin growth in all our segments, comp growth at the top of our peer set, more than $1 billion in cash return to shareholders, across the board 2013 was truly the year to remember.","With all the success in 2013, the best is still in front of us. Our stores are in excellent shape. We\u2019ve renovated nearly half of our stores in the U.S over the past two years. Our product line up is deep with premium coffee at the core and new high quality food, juice and tea to compliment it. Loyalty is on the rise and new technologies continue to enhance the customer experience.","Our growth appetite remains large and opportunity abounds in China, India, Latin America and with licensed partners globally. And our financial discipline remains strong as we balance height, return, investments in our business while increasing return to shareholders.","With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to the operator for Q&A. Mike?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Sara Senatore with Sanford Bernstein. Your line is open.","Sara Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.","Great. Thank you very much. I actually had two quick questions on the Americas. One is, I think with respect to La Boulange, the last time we heard from you said they react -- the response from customers has been phenomenal and I just wanted to see, if you could give us either a quantification or qualitatively East Coast versus West Coast in terms of contribution. And then the other piece is on the margin. I\u2019m surprised the Americas margin tied into -- is it from moderate expansion because I would think on strong comps and some coffee benefit and then mix shift towards license we would see -- we see better expansion than just moderate. Can you give a sense of what investments or offsets you might be making? Thanks.","Troy Alstead","Sara, I\u2019ll take the margin question first and then I will hand over to Cliff to talk about La Boulange. First, on the size and skill of a U.S business has big and profitable and as many stores as they we\u2019re very pleased that we can commit to the kind of margin expansion -- in fact deliver the kind of margin expansion we have over the years, again in fiscal \u201913, again in Q4 and again promising in fiscal 2014. So we\u2019re quite pleased with our ability to deliver that comp growth into stronger growth on the bottom line. Recall that coffee benefit does not have meaningful impact on our store segment. So the Americas and the U.S does not get a significant benefit from the coffee tailwind that primarily lands in our channel development business. So that\u2019s the first thing to remember.","And then beyond that as we\u2019ve significantly elevated margins over the years, I\u2019d anticipate our ability to continue to slowly and moderately over time raise the profitability you got system, which is recognize how far its come already in a short period of time. Cliff?","Cliff Burrows","Yes, thanks Sara. La Boulange, we are seeing incredible excitement around the new product. It is showing up really well in store and we\u2019ve achieved in the last nine months what we didn\u2019t achieve in the previous 20 years around food. So the quality East coast, West coast, every market, we\u2019re launching in we\u2019re getting a real passion around it from our teams in stores and customer reaction is superb. That said, we\u2019re still in the early days we\u2019ve launched in 3.5000 stores. We will complete that rollout in the next 12 months and we will be able then to see that meaningful contribution is making. But wherever we launched it and particularly around the pastry, the croissant, the chocolate croissant we\u2019re seeing a huge difference in experience, the customers are getting. We continue to refine the range. We continue to refine our operations in store, but it is elevated in a whole experience and it really is a testament to the investment we\u2019ve made in La Boulange to help us grow a capability around food, I\u2019m really excited for the future.","Sara Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jeff Bernstein with Barclays Capital. Your line is open.","Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital","Hello?","Howard Schultz","Hello. Go ahead Jeff.","Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital","Thanks. Two quick questions as well. One just from a cash usage perspective, Troy you talked about the share purchase and dividend, I\u2019m just wondering how the Board evaluates or balances between the repurchase and the dividend in terms of -- you boost the payout ratio and if you could just tie that in with the 750 million of leverage you guys just took on whether it\u2019s opportunity for more leverage or better yet, what\u2019s the appropriate debt level that you guys think the system can handle?","Troy Alstead","Sure. Let me speak to that Jeff. First of all, in terms of how we evaluate repurchases versus dividends, we\u2019re committed as a company to return cash through both avenues. Dividends of course will be much more sustainable and routine and we\u2019re very, very fortunate in our business to have healthy and consistent cash flow that has rapidly grown over time and which we anticipate will continue growing as we go forward. That\u2019s given us confidence both to grow our dividend rate faster than our rate of earnings as we \u2013 as I announced today in terms of what our Board has approved, but also to give us flexibility over time to expand that payout ratio higher, which is also we announced today. Share repurchases are also important to us, but we will always be a bit more opportunistic as there are plenty of times when we as a company are blacked out of the market or updating our plan. So I would expect repurchases to over the course of any three or four, five quarter period of time to be a component of our cash return not unlike its been over the past few years. But there will always be quarters where it\u2019s higher rather than lower and vice versa. In terms of debt levels, its -- I would suggest you that in our history we tended to be a bit underleveraged and we recognized some opportunity, particularly given where the market conditions have been over the past year to bring a little bit more debt under the balance sheet and to enhance our liquidity. So we\u2019ve done that. That still leaves us, we believe with a very strong credit rating which we intend to maintain and capacity within that credit rating over time if opportunity warrants and market conditions warrant to bring on more debt. So let me be clear, we\u2019ve no immediate plans to do anything more than that $750 million offering that we just placed.","Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital","And if I could follow up, you mentioned just the coffee costs being a 100% locked. Just wondering whether you\u2019re seeing any unusual or irrational behavior from peers with the very favorable coffee costs than -- or maybe better yet. Internally how you guys think about price to be taken or whether using value to drive traffic when coffee costs are so favorable?","Troy Alstead","Well, at times because our -- many of our peers buy shorter term than we do and frankly are chasing us often. So I would suggest trying to catch up with -- catch us with whatever pricing actions they can take. Sometimes we see those actions down the aisle. Frankly and perhaps even in competing coffee stores around the country. Frankly that tends to be less of a driver of our own action particularly in the stores as does, [ph] plus pricing to meet customer need. Now down the aisle it is much more competitive and reacting to that marketplace we took a price reduction earlier this year. We believe that positioned us very nicely and I would suggest that the Q4 results for our Channel Development business that we just released today underscore that we did the right thing with pricing action that we are now competing nicely again down the aisle. We're positioned well and we strongly believe not only by competing on price but on innovation, packaging, about the leadership we can bring down the aisle, all those things will contribute to our ability to continue to hold and grow share over time in all forms of consumption.","Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Sharon Zackfia with William Blair.","Sharon Zackfia - William Blair","Hi. Good afternoon. I was hoping to touch a little bit more on the food in the Americas. If you can update us on where food ended as a percent of sales for fiscal '13 versus '12? And then Troy if you could help us think through the impact of the increased food penetration as we think of the pushes and pulls in the Americas gross margin for 2014, I'm understanding the new food is higher margin than the old food but probably still lower margin than coffee. So just if you could talk through that?","Troy Alstead","Yes. On margin first, Sharon, what I would say is that over time there were a few dynamics that happened as we grow our food business which we believe still continue to be a significant opportunity for us and we've been experiencing that as food has been a [indiscernible] driver of comp growth this year as you heard from us each quarter recently. With that said and you netted all the pushes and pulls of profit margin and distribution, the efficiencies we get in the back office, the weak management initiatives that we do from our stores, all those things in the long term we believe negate each other and we don't think that there will be meaningful movement whatsoever in gross margin. Yes, food is a moderately lower product gross margin than is beverage but remember as we sell more food to an existing system, it is extremely accretive to percent margins not just to mention dollar margins at the bottom line of the store and highly profitable for the store profitability and return of capital in that existing asset we have with our store systems. So the economics top to bottom are very, very good for us. In terms of food mix, food remains right around 19% of sales mix of our stores. There's some upper movement over that over time, but again huge base of business we have and I think that will be a slow and moderate progression reaching next toward 20 and we think ultimately a bit higher.","Sharon Zackfia - William Blair","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Michael Kelter with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs","I wanted to ask about La Boulange as well and the first is, can you talk to any food book constraints that may have developed in your stores as well a bit out and whether you've come to the conclusion that you may need to flex that a bit to keep the stores moving? And then also on La Boulange you talked about extending it to lunch for next fall and I was curious if you could talk us through what makes sense for lunch at Starbucks and what doesn't?","Cliff Burrows","Yes, thanks Michael. It's Cliff. In terms of what we're seeing on the La Boulange operation, it's obviously new. We're investing in La Boulange launch as we can share these fantastic new products with our customers and once we're through that launch phase it becomes part of our operation, it's not about adding labor, it's just being very deliberate and how we deploy our labor. The customers are already there and we're obviously trying to move the percentage of customers who buy our food on a regular basis, we're going to increase that. The opportunity is significant. We're already serving the customers. And give you an example. I was in New York which is one of those recent markets we launched those there last week. I was extremely plaintiff I saw in terms of customer engagement, the way the partners are embracing La Boulange routines and disciplines and the food and beverage were being served with great experience to the customer. As we do it in New York, we can do it in all our markets. So I think that's a great start for us. If we look at the lunch, we start in the same premise. A great ingredient building on the opportunity to serve existing customers who come into the stores. The lunch time, as Troy said, we're starting to see some growth in that earlier. I think the investments we're making in a combination, investments in tea will also both complement that lunch time occasion and give us time [indiscernible]. The food again will be starting from a fantastic ingredient relevant for our customers and will give them a fresh and healthy approach to food, really complement beverages we've done. The investments we made in supply chain supplies and the investments we made in our store so far will all help us with this food range. We've invested in [indiscernible] segment, a small test in San Francisco and it's around [indiscernible] it's around science, it's around convenience food for customers that are enjoying the store or take back to their office and it's been again extremely well received and we're extremely excited that we'll be able to follow on from the morning enhancement of our food with a lunch time offering which we think will be the start of a significant business around lunch.","Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs","Thank you very much.","Cliff Burrows","Thanks, Michael.","Operator","The next question comes from John Glass with Morgan Stanley.","John Glass - Morgan Stanley","Thanks. I guess still two things on La Boulange. One is when will you feel comfortable in talking about the sales lift, it's the question I guess that's imposed a number of times and what point or how many stores do you need to feel comfortable that you've got a good baseline? And then secondly why wouldn't this be additive? I know you noted a couple of times mid single digit comps and I understand you want to be reasonable in terms of the expectation, but it doesn't seem like any \u2013 is there anything that's going to fall away from this that you lose, is there some anniversarying of some of the lunch items you've added recently that you have less confidence in or do you simply just see the business maybe be more moderate in the last few weeks or months and maybe that gives you rise for caution?","Troy Alstead","John, let me speak to comp growth and then I'm going to ask Cliff to come back to a bit more on La Boulange. The first thing to remind you and everyone is and of course you know this, John, but comp growth trends towards zero every year for everybody out there, every retailer, anybody who measures it. Everything we did over the past year to drive the fantastic and amazing comp growth because of the new system that we've done, beverage generation, food, contribution from loyalty, all those things now are in the baseline and as we move into this coming year just doing those things again would provide zero additional conflict. What we need to do and what we have great confidence in by the way is our ability to come up with that next level of beverage generation, the next fantastic food program, the elevation of food that continue the enhancements to consumer technology and to the loyalty program. But all those things need to be more and better than last year [indiscernible]. So comp growth can never be active. It starts over and we believe we had the ability to take what we've done in the past year and yet add to it in terms of traffic, volumes, in terms of dollar sales to our system. And by doing that we believe a mid single digit comp growth on a system, the size of our Starbucks and the maturity of Starbucks is nothing short of outstanding.","Howard Schultz","Troy, let me add one more thing. It seems like we can't get through our conference call without somehow this tension between us and you with regarding to comp growth guidance. But let's just try and establish common language so there's an understanding about what it is we're trying to do and what it is we're trying to guide. Last quarter we had a 9% comp in the U.S. business and I had said then as I think we're trying to say now that was an 8% comp this quarter and it would be just irresponsible of any of us at Starbucks to project to you or guide you to that level. Now, do we have aspirations to try and do it again as we did this year? Absolutely. Do we think we can? Many of us think we can but we're not going to sit here and put a number out there that is such a stretch target and have you put it in your model. And then we come up with a 6 or 7 which gets our peer group as stunning and incredible and then you write reports that says we've disappointed. That's not going to happen. So the guidance we're giving is the most responsible guidance we could possible provide you especially when you consider the maturation of our store base and the number of stores. Now one other thing. What La Boulange is providing us well beyond the morning pastries and the lunch is a significant platform to go after need states and dayparts well into the future. And what we've learned over the years is that our stores now provide a third place well beyond the morning daypart which was our core business just five, six years ago. The opportunity to expand Starbucks significantly in the future with the innovations that we've talked about in our prepared remarks and the food is well beyond what we are today. But I think we've always tried not to provide aspirations and guidance that was so far out field from reality and provide you with an opportunity with real numbers and I think not to allow any of us to get so far ahead of us of this specially when we have a situation in the U.S. whether it's quite a bit of uncertainty in terms of customer confidence, consumer confidence and consumer behavior that relates to the government shutdown and what can happen in February, well once again we\u2019re looking at a possible to fall. So this is the most responsible thing we can do on the heels of a record year in our 42-year history a record quarter and a comp number that no one, no other company in our peer group, well no other company that any of you analyze has put up against us. So this is a remarkable opportunity for us to have a yearend result and once again try and provide a comp number that we think is responsible, and I think the most judicious thing we can possible do.","Troy Alstead","So John, just to say when we will be able to share the contribution La Boulange is giving us and quite frankly it will be after we\u2019ve rolled out all markets and we\u2019ve really what happens in the first year. We are going very quickly with the rollout. I am absolutely delighted about the fact we got to 3,500 stores by the end of the financial year. We\u2019ll complete the rest of the stores and we\u2019ve already said the stores company operated will be completed in FY \u201914. We will also have the opportunity to bring a new food range to our Canadian business into our licensed stores, so we\u2019re busy working on that. It is a new skill for us. It is a new discipline, we\u2019ve been beverage led for a very long time and we will continue to work on the operational data. The fantastic thing is we can respond very quickly on recipes, on customer feedback and that is also part of this. So we\u2019re in that learning phase, but I really am excited by way our partners and our customers are receiving the food. We have some great success stores. Really again, I just want to go through with the operational discipline we\u2019ve brought to be Americas and make sure that when we share something with you, we can continue to build up that, but it's definitely complementing the experience for the customer, complementing the beverage purchase and our potential for the future is exceptionally strong with food. Thanks, John.","John Glass - Morgan Stanley","Great. Thanks, Troy.","Operator","The next question comes from Joe Buckley with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Joe Buckley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. I want to ask two questions if I can, I want to take advantage of Howard and John being on the call and I\u2019ll just ask about the recent media coverage about pricing in China and just your perspective on it. And then secondly I want to go back to an earlier question; that\u2019s much the staffing that\u2019s needed for La Boulange, but kind of a broader question, not just La Boulange base, while you had a point in terms of speed of service where something else has to change to handle this tremendous level of traffic growth that you\u2019re driving?","Howard Schultz","I\u2019ll take the later question. Unlike others who have talked about speed of service or throughput issues that is not a problem that we have or anticipate. So, you can take that off the table. And in fact what we have been able to do with mobile payment in the card have absolutely cracked the code in terms of to me it's the speed of service and we\u2019re only going to get better at that because we will be introducing new levels of technology in calendar \u201914. We have no speed of service or throughput issue inside Starbucks to take that off the table. John?","John Culver","Thanks Joe, for the question. Regarding the recent media speculation on the price issue on China, as you know Joe we\u2019ve been in China now for 15 years and we have over a 1000 stores. We operate in over 60 cities across the mainland. And as this issue became public, we acted very swiftly and as we always have communicated in an very open, honest, transparent and very factual way with our customer\u2019s, and one thing I would say is that we have been able to build a level of trust, loyalty, respect with our customers and key stakeholders across the country and we felt it was important that we should respond very openly and transparently to them. In terms of the speculation, there\u2019s a couple of things I\u2019d like to point out. First is, that the prices that we charge for our products in China, the Latte are comparable to and in some cases lower than the competition; so that\u2019s number one. Number two, the prices that we are charging in the market actually reflects the cost of doing business in that market, and at the same time reflect a level of investments that we\u2019re making ahead of the curve so that we can feel the future growth of the business. So, we will continue to be very transparent, very open and very factual with any questions that come up around pricing. But let me just add that, as a company building a large business in China well over a 1000 stores and beyond, that we\u2019re not immune to the challenges and complexities of building a large business in China, but at the same time given the trust and loyalty that we\u2019ve been able to build with our customer base there as well as key stakeholders across the mainland that we have tremendous confidence in our ability to continue to build a very strong business, not only in 2014 but well into the future.","Joe Buckley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","John Culver","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Jason West with Deutsche Bank.","Jason West - Deutsche Bank","Well, thanks. Just one on the channel development side; the revenue growth accelerated there. It sounds like that was mainly driven by the better pricing positioning I guess, but just wondering if you could talk a little bit more about what drove that revenue growth and is that the kind of number you guys are expecting kind of going forward?","John Culver","Well, I think that we obviously had very strong growth in the quarter and finished the year very strong double-digit revenue growth for the year. The results that you saw on the fourth quarter were the results of the momentum that the business is beginning to get around the LTR on package coffee. But then also the momentum that we\u2019re building on K-Cups. And as I said, K-Cup growth during the quarter was 42%. We\u2019ve added two additional skews in the quarter and we got aggressive plans to continue to expand and grow the K-Cup offering in 2014 throughout the year. I think it's also important to note that I talked a little bit about the My Starbucks Rewards down the aisle. And as we\u2019ve talked in the past, this is our opportunity to leverage the strategic flywheel that Howard spoke about. And in a very short period of time just over three months, we\u2019ve been able to provide over 1.5 million stars to our most loyal customers down the aisle who are purchasing our package coffee. So, we remain very optimistic that we can continue to accelerate stars down the aisle and leverage that flywheel. Going forward, as I said there is volatility that\u2019s happening down the aisle and in the grocery segment particularly as it relates to package roast and ground coffee. We feel we\u2019re very well positioned to navigate that volatility. We\u2019ve got a lot of new innovation that\u2019s coming into the business this year not only on the package coffee side but also K-Cups, VIA and other items. And what you\u2019re going to see this year in 2014 is that our performance is going to build by quarter and with the back half being stronger pieces of business due to the first half LTR rollover. So again my comments earlier we\u2019re committed to sustain double-digit growth in this business both on the top and bottom line in 2014, and we\u2019re looking forward to another very successful year in the channels.","Jason West - Deutsche Bank","Okay. Thanks for the color.","John Culver","Yeah.","Operator","The next question comes from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.","John Ivankoe - JPMorgan","Great, hi, thank you. First quickly and then a longer question. Troy, do you have the Starbucks card balance at the end of the quarter in front of you?","Troy Alstead","Yes, we do. I\u2019m going to have Adam Brotman actually make a couple of comments about that. Adam is our Chief Digital Officer. He is here with us. Go ahead, Adam.","Adam Brotman","Hi, John. At the end of the quarter the balance in the U.S. was $621 million and reflected by the record year we just had $4 billion loaded across U.S. and Canada.","John Ivankoe - JPMorgan","And do you have that corporate balance as well that we see on the balance sheet?","Adam Brotman","I don\u2019t have that with me at the time.","John Culver","Yes, let me (indiscernible) the question John, I\u2019ll try to answer (indiscernible).","John Ivankoe - JPMorgan","Okay, all right. Great, thank you. And Howard maybe this question is for you, a couple of years ago, I guess in 2009 at least part of the Starbucks revitalization you included a refocus of excelling at your store level base which obviously you did in a fairly profound way. When we listen to the call today, I mean there's a number of initiatives that are coming into the stores the next couple of years, Teavana, cold carbonated drinks, the continued expansion and focus on La Boulange specifically and maybe food more generally that does add more complication to the stores perhaps than the risk today. So it's kind of like a little bit of broader question just talk about how the system has been prepared and maybe relative to five years ago to handle this increased complexity with the lowest nature that you demonstrated over the past couple of years?","Howard Schultz","John, I think that's a very important and appropriate question and if you were in many of our meetings during this year as we prepare for fiscal '14, that was much of the conversation. We want to do one thing and one thing well and that is whatever we bring into the store we want it to be enhancing to the customer experience and complementary to our leadership position in coffee. Having said that I think the last two years of our stores that we've opened couple with the comp number demonstrates the significant health and strength and I say unequivocally the U.S. business has never been stronger or healthier than it is today in terms of financial results and the equity of brand and the experience. We feel very good that we have prepared our stores and if you go through them, Evolution juice when we brought into the store as we replaced an existing used product and enhanced the quality and hence the experience. Teavana tea that we're going to bring in at some point in calendar '14, we're already in the tea business. The tea represents less than 1% of our sales and we believe we can significantly expand that and in doing so create significant awareness and trial and use our [indiscernible] to drive new traffic and incrementality to Teavana stores. When we get to La Boulange we been selling food for 30 years, it just haven't been as good as our coffee. Now our food is as good as our coffee as we have a story to tell and we're going to tell that story in multiple dayparts and fulfill multiple needs states. Carbonation, that is a new category for us. The test results in Austin and Atlanta and in Japan and Singapore are very encouraging. We think there's a significant opportunity and again, we learned a lot over the last few years with our refreshment category that we have other than coffee and the opportunity in coffee, we have an opportunity to provide a need state in the afternoon and evening around refreshment. And also we've learned in the carbonation test itself that there's a significant food attachment to the carbonation beverages. So this works hand in hand with our opportunity and I think we're going to create more incrementality. I think Cliff and his team have done a wonderful job in not taking the entire country at once with any of these initiatives but sequentially going from market to market and learning from it and not leaving one market to go to the other until we have it right and that's why La Boulange has worked so successfully. That's exactly what we're going to do with all these initiatives as we did with Evolution juice. So the short answer is it's an appropriate question. We learned valuable lessons in 2006 and 2007. Those lessons have been learned and they will never ever be repeated. And we're in a position right now we're playing to our strength and we're going to continue to do that and leverage the fact that our stores are a meeting place and a gathering place for multiple dayparts well beyond the core coffee business that we began 42 years ago but we're always going to be the primary destination to the world's best coffee.","Troy Alstead","John, to your question about Starbucks card, at the end of the fourth quarter, so at the end of the fiscal year, the deferred revenue balance on our balance sheet and that deferred revenue balance especially the Starbucks card balances was $654 million. And by the way that's almost 30% growth over the same period a year ago, over the yearend 2012. And that 30% almost same growth in that balance on the balance sheet just reflects the continued tremendous uptake of Starbucks card of the adoption of loyalty of how mobile was contributing and how we're resonating with our customers in a way that is unique anywhere else in this space and by prepaying essentially a significant amount of transactions and having that sit in our balance sheet long before it turns into revenue.","Cliff Burrows","Let's start with [indiscernible] for the future of the company in the near term by having 30% greater loaded on the card versus a year ago and that 30% is almost three times greater than the growth rate of the company.","John Ivankoe - JPMorgan","Great. Thank you so much.","Operator","The next question comes from Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer.","Brian Bittner - Oppenheimer Company","Great. Thank you very much. Just two questions. The first one is on EPS guidance for Troy. Particularly relating to the second quarter guidance, it looks like the first quarter guidance you're implying basically about 20% EPS growth and then fits down on a year-over-year basis to that 13 percentage range for the second quarter. So that's kind of below where you're going to be at for the full year. So what exactly is going on in that quarter, anything you can point out for us?","Troy Alstead","Yes, Brian, I'm happy to do that. First I'd make sure when you look at the second quarter growth rate over prior year, that got an unusual non-routine gain from a gain on the sale of our [indiscernible] business from Q2 over a year ago. So it's important you do that adjustment.","Brian Bittner - Oppenheimer Company","But it's still 13% off that 48.","Troy Alstead","Actually Brian, it's the range that we use 13% to 15%, so we will search for that mid teens EPS growth rate and then give me a moment, I'll explain what's going on. Our investment spending that we do throughout the year will vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter and initiate to the second quarter. We are planning to spend a bit more in marketing just timing the spent throughout the year as we look at that quarter. We have a number of other routine investments that come and go from quarter to quarter the timing of which every year can move a little bit from here to there. So we put that guidance out there to-date but you have some more visibility and transparency into how we're planning the year and how we see the earnings progression. With that said there will be some quarters that are more like mid teens and there will be some quarters as we have delivered over this past year that will tip for the higher part of that range and that's why we have an earnings range out there that I would have you think about as we go forward.","Brian Bittner - Oppenheimer Company","Okay. And just something about cash flow on balance sheet, I mean you guys did almost $2 billion of free cash flow this fiscal year. I think you generated more free cash flow this year than you generated in operating cash flow last year. I know you took on some debt this quarter but it looks like you have over $3 billion of cash and short-term investments on the balance sheet I think. Obviously that looks to be more than enough liquidity to deal with any resolution with Kraft. Is there any update on that arbitration that you guys can give us any timing update or anything like that?","Howard Schultz","Brian, what we can say is that we expect resolution of that to hear from our trader before the end of the calendar year. Naturally our only news for today is that we expect that to be sometime before the end of this calendar year.","Brian Bittner - Oppenheimer Company","Okay. Thank you.","Howard Schultz","And you're right on your earlier points. Our cash flow was phenomenally strong in the year and I think that's very, very reflective of our strong performance in the fourth quarter and for the full fiscal year and that consistently of strength of cash flow and the phenomenal strength of our balance sheet and the amount of cash we have sitting in the balance sheet both give me tremendous comfort that we have adequate liquidity to cover whatever the answer may be coming out of that arbitration and also gives us tremendous possibility as we look for the future and we make investments into our business and renovations and store development and gives us stability of elevating cash return to shareholders.","JoAnn DeGrande","Mike, we're available for one last question and we'll follow-up with those that are left in queue.","Operator","The last question comes from Nicole Miller Regan with Piper Jaffray. You may ask your question.","Nicole Miller Regan - Piper Jaffray","Thank you. Thanks for the time. Of the royalty the 1.5 million I believe was incremental stars earned through the channel development. Can you talk to us about if anybody signed up new, so new users of the royalty program and then also what was most surprising versus what you tested and expected as you started to launch? Thank you very much.","Adam Brotman","Sure. Nicole, I'll take this. This is Adam. So first of all I would say that we \u2013 yes, we see a lot of new users coming to [indiscernible]. We're not ready to quantify those publicly but it's been exceeding our expectations in terms of both new users, it's been exceeding our expectations in terms of the velocity of take up of our loyalty members as well as new loyalty members that are being participating and frankly we were just getting started in terms of how we will integrate loyalty with our CBG business. So it's a great example of the strategic [indiscernible]. There's a mini version of it, there's a digital strategic [indiscernible]. We're integrating our loyalty card, mobile and now across channels and across brands and even across geographies. So this is just one example of how it's working well for us.","Howard Schultz","I would just add one thing that is in the sense what we're establishing is the Starbucks currency and that currency can be interchanged between Starbucks and Teavana stores and the stars the currency of the stars can now be leveraged across consumer products that are unparallel because its no other consumer product that has a retail store that can provide our customers with a reward and an incentive to come back and forth and this is just the beginning of us being able to thread these multiple channels of distributions and brands so that the customer has significant value in supporting and shopping at Starbucks Teavana and Starbucks consumer products.","JoAnn DeGrande","Thank you, Howard. That concludes our call for today. Thank you for joining us and we will speak to you again on the next call for Q1 fiscal 2014 earnings. Thank you. Have a good day.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s Starbucks Coffee Company\u2019s fourth quarter and fiscal year 2013 earnings conference call.

Ms. Doraisamy, you may begin.","Durga Doraisamy - Director of Investor Relations","Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. This is Durga Doraisamy, Director of Investor Relations at Starbucks Coffee Company. Thank you for joining us today to discuss our third quarter 2016 results, which will be led by Howard Schultz, Chairman and CEO; Kevin Johnson, President and COO; and Scott Maw, our CFO. Joining us for Q&A are Cliff Burrows, Group President, U.S. and Americas; John Culver, Group President, China, Asia-Pacific, Channel Development and Emerging Brands; Matt Ryan, Global Chief Strategy Officer; Adam Brotman, Global Chief Digital Officer; and Michael Conway, President of Global Channel Development.","This conference call will include forward-looking statements, which are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements. Any such statements should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements in our earnings release and risk factor discussions in our filings with the SEC, including our last Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Before I turn the call over to Howard, I would like to take this opportunity to make you aware of our Biennial Investor Day, which will be held on December 7 in New York City. More details will be coming soon. We hope to see you there, so please reserve December 7 on your schedule.","With that, I will turn the call over to Howard Schultz. Howard?","Howard S. Schultz - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Durga. Good afternoon and welcome, everyone. In Starbucks' 24 years of public life, I can't recall a quarter quite like Q3 of 2016, when a confluence of social and political turmoil at home, weakening consumer confidence, increasing global uncertainty, and the launch of one of our most significant long-term initiatives of all-time all occurred within a single earnings period. In light of these circumstances, it would not be unreasonable to simply celebrate another quarter of record revenues and record EPS, our first non-holiday quarter with $1 billion of operating income, and operating performance well above our competitive set and at the very top of our sector.","But I want to address right out of the gate the two questions you're likely asking yourselves. Does a 4% positive same-store sales comp from our U.S. business in Q3 signify or even suggest a turning point in Starbucks' long-term growth trajectory? And does this comp figure in any way relate to the success and value of our Starbucks Rewards loyalty program? On today's call, we will demonstrate with clarity and specificity why our U.S. comps in Q3 were an anomaly, and that we have clear line of sight to returning our business to historic levels of comp growth, which has been at or above 5% for the past 25 consecutive quarters. We will demonstrate how the Starbucks Rewards program has been strengthened in Q3 and how the improvements will fuel an even more powerful digital flywheel that will propel our business forward for years to come. And we will share details around a number of exciting new developments as we head into Q4 and prepare for fall and holiday that demonstrate why we are so confident going into fiscal 2017, and why we remain optimistic about the long-term growth prospects for each of our businesses around the world.","That said, with candor and humility, we acknowledge that in certain areas, we did not execute as well as we could have in the U.S. in Q3. Had we done so, we certainly would have reported stronger U.S. comps. So let me try and put you in our shoes and take you through what actually occurred. Very early in the quarter, and after months of planning, we began executing against what I am convinced will prove to be among our boldest and most strategic moves ever, the strategic shift of our tremendously successful loyalty program from a frequency-based to a spend-based model. The shift was a one-time event, a once-in-a-decade change built on carefully vetted analysis that showed that a spend-based program would best reward our most loyal customers and encourage all of our customers to visit us more often and spend more on each visit, and it would be more fair for all of our customers as well.","In addition, the shift would instantly eliminate a vexing in-store operating issue, order splitting, that was and has resulted in shorter lines, increased speed of service, and reduced line attrition. Now, given the sheer size, scale, and complexity of our Starbucks Rewards program and the mobile and digital technologies that support it, we knew there could be some hurdles to navigate at launch, particularly since the launch would coincide with the kickoff of our annual Frappuccino Happy Hour promotion, a nationwide event that typically ushers in the busiest time of year in our stores and consistently drives significant traffic and incremental revenue.","By way of example, 2015's Frappuccino promotion drove a 30% increase in revenue over the prior year. You may recall that on last quarter's call, we cautioned that the launch of the new Rewards program could result in some noise in our comp figures as customers and partners adapted to the program changes. What we underestimated was the interdependence of Starbucks Rewards and Happy Hour, and that two powerful initiatives competing for partner and customer mind share during a discrete period of time would disrupt what should have been strong, positive interdependence and leverage.","In hindsight, what we should have done was build customer awareness anticipation for the Frappuccino Happy Hour promotion as we have done so successfully in the past and given the promotion the breathing room it needed. At the same time, the Happy Hour promotion interfered with the results we were expecting from the Starbucks Rewards program launch.","By anyone else's standards, our Rewards results have been outstanding. We entered nearly 2 million new members year-over-year, representing 18% growth, and 300,000 net new members in Q3 alone, a time of year when we often see flat to negative membership growth. And we now have 12.3 million active Reward members in the U.S. and millions more worldwide.","We are already seeing the percentage of tender from Starbucks Rewards U.S. customers rise to 33% in Q3, up three full points from last year, continuing an established pattern in which revenue growth from Rewards customers typically outpaces revenue growth from non-Rewards customers. And we are seeing both incrementality of spend and increase in total profit per customer, both directly attributable to a customer's having joined the Rewards program. These powerful metrics bode extremely well for our business going forward, and having us continue to lean in and convert even more customers into the Rewards program.","In the months ahead, we will be launching even more initiatives to fully leverage Rewards as incentives for customer behavior and to encourage greater ticket and attach. What we did not and could not have fully anticipated was the profound weakening in consumer confidence in Q3 that has caused sharp declines in QSR and restaurant traffic overall and has many of our competitors struggling with negative transaction comps. And as I have mentioned in the past, Starbucks is not immune to macro challenges that impact our competitors and retail overall. But as with weather, we will not hold these challenges out as excuses. Instead, we will successfully manage and navigate through them as we always have.","So while we may have significantly outperformed the industry and our competitors in Q3, we did not fully overcome all of the headwinds to the extent that we, and you, are accustomed. And in this regard, we, and I, are Starbucks' harshest critics. But before rushing to judgment on what one quarter's U.S. comp means, let's think back just 90 days to our Q2 call. Then, and following some slowing in Starbucks' China business, and specifically in comps and traffic, some were proclaiming the demise of our China strategy and perhaps our China business overall. Yet, here we are just 90 days later, approaching 2,300 stores in over 100 cities in China, opening more than one store a day and posting stunning Q3 results, including 7% comps, almost all of that growth coming from increased traffic. Again, demonstrating the strength, relevancy, and resiliency of the Starbucks business and brand in China.","As many of you have covered Starbucks for some time, you have seen us occasionally experience periods of slower growth in our U.S. business, only to see the business rebound with greater strength and vigor in the quarters that follow. This is precisely the pattern I personally believe you're going to see as we head into fiscal 2017 and beyond.","Perhaps the best evidence of the strength and resilience of Starbucks' business and brand is the robust performance of our newest class of retail stores, both in the U.S. and around the world. Record AUVs and record profits, with both growing and causing no net cannibalization of existing stores in the same trading area.","This consistently strong performance drove our decision to open 1,900 net new stores around the world and over 600 alone in the U.S. in fiscal 2016, a pace of new store openings that we will be increasing both in the U.S. and around the world in 2017 and beyond.","A few words on the great strides we made in Q3 against plans to expand our cold proprietary beverage platform and to elevate and further create premiumization at the very highest end of the coffee industry and create further separation from competitors. Our proprietary Cold Brew platform was nothing short of a runaway success in Q3, adding incrementality and driving attach, particularly in the afternoon daypart, and Nitro has been so well received in the stores it's in today that we are now accelerating the national rollout.","And we are delighted to announce the opening of two new Starbucks Roasteries, one in Shanghai opening in 2017 and one in New York opening in 2018. Both are now under construction. Just as with our Seattle Roastery, each of the Shanghai and New York Roasteries will showcase the newest coffee brewing methods and offer consumers the finest assortment of exclusive micro-lot coffees from around the world in a complete, immersive coffee experience like none in the world and advance our plans to build 500 plus new format coffee forward Starbucks Reserve stores in key markets around the world. And the new Roasteries will be offering an elevated artisanal food experience through our new exclusive relationship with the renowned Italian bakery and caf\u00e9 operator, Princi.","In a few moments, Kevin will take you through individual segment operating performance in Q3 and provide some color around the positive momentum we are seeing as we enter Q4 and prepare for holiday, and he'll introduce you to personalization, our new one-to-one personalized marketing capability that I strongly believe will prove to be a retail industry game changer, unlocking even more digital flywheel potential and driving even more growth in our business in the quarters and years ahead.","Then Scott will take you through the financials in detail and provide Q4 guidance, and then we'll turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.","As we continue to work to achieve our aspirational goal of becoming a great, enduring company, we are reminded that Starbucks' greatest strength and its greatest asset remains its people. This has always been and always will be the case.","Credit for our ability to post record revenues, margins, and profits in Q3 over a very strong Q3 last year and still achieve the upper-end of our Q3 EPS target range, despite less than expected sales lift from our U.S. Retail business, goes to our dedicated in-store partners who continue to serve our customers with the warmth and welcome that are the unique hallmarks of the Starbucks brand and the experience. Our Starbucks partners have my respect and my appreciation for all they do each and every day.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Kevin.","Kevin R. Johnson - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Thank you, Howard, and good afternoon, everyone. These record financial and operating results demonstrate the strength and relevance of the Starbucks brand around the world. This quarter was an anomaly, and while we are not pleased with the U.S. comp result, we understand the drivers and have a clear action plan already in motion.","Our Summer 2 marketing campaign launched earlier this month, and we are seeing positive customer reception. We are experiencing good early results from our personalized digital marketing, with more customer-focused enhancements to our mobile app in the pipeline, and execution across our seven core strategies for growth continues with progress in each initiative linked to growth.","On today's call, I will provide an overview of segment performance, update you on the Summer 2 campaign, and highlight some key digital flywheel initiatives. Let's start with the Americas segment. Our Americas business, with over 8,800 company operated and 6,400 licensed stores operating in 16 countries, delivered 4% comp growth on top of 8% comp growth in Q3 of last year.","This resulted in record Q3 revenues up 7% over prior-year. We're on track to open 750 net new stores in the Americas in fiscal 2016, and our new classes of stores continue to outperform and deliver record-setting profitability in AUV sales.","Our U.S. business delivered 4% comp growth and 8% revenue growth in the quarter. Howard highlighted the fact that the one-time transition to the new Rewards program in Q3 required marketing and field resources, which disrupted the normal cadence of our Summer 1 campaign and impacted Frappuccino momentum in the quarter. This was reflected in our same-store comparable with core beverages, excluding blended, contributing two points of comp, Food contributing one point of comp; and our Teavana and refreshment platforms contributing one point of comp each.","Overall, our U.S. business grew in every daypart with the morning being our fastest-growing daypart. Morning was driven by the combination of increased Mobile Order & Pay transactions, strong performance from our core brewed and espresso product line-up, and breakfast sandwiches, which grew 20% year-on-year. We continued to successfully execute our strategy of elevating and growing our cold beverage platform. Iced beverage revenues, excluding blended, grew 25% year-on-year. We expanded our Cold Brew coffee platform through the successful launch of the Vanilla Sweet Cream Cold Brew, and we're excited by the prospects for our cold coffee beverage lineup, including Iced Coconut Milk Mocha Macchiato, and Starbucks Nitro Cold Brew. Teavana handcrafted beverages continue to resonate with customers, as iced tea sales increased 30% in the quarter, led by Mango Black, Peach Green, and Passion Tango Herbal iced teas.","Our refreshment platform has also shown strong growth, up 50% over prior year, driven by the rainbow drinks phenomenon. The Pink Drink generated significant social media buzz and demonstrates the power of customer-driven innovation. Our Summer 2 campaign is now focused on the broader cold coffee and tea beverages, and we're off to a good start.","Our Food platform continues to build and drive attach. In Q3, Food grew 10% and contributed one point of comp. While the comp growth has slowed, Food is at a record 20% of total sales. We actually saw an increase in attach. Our new Power Lunch has been well received as a convenient, personalized lunch offering, which is increasing customer awareness of our lunch and snack options.","Let's now move on to China\/Asia Pacific. Starbucks China\/Asia Pacific region delivered another quarter of strong performance with year-on-year revenue and operating income growth of 18% and 22%, respectively. Comp sales in CAP increased 3% in the quarter, with China comp accelerating to 7%. Japan comps were positive but impacted by the recent earthquakes and ongoing economic challenges in the country. Profitability in Japan remains strong. We're optimistic about the long-term potential in the country. We now operate over 6,100 stores in 15 markets across CAP, including more than 2,200 stores in over 100 cities throughout Mainland China.","Noteworthy is that despite moderated GDP growth in China, Starbucks China business was very strong, particularly in our largest cities. The acceleration of comp sales to 7% in the quarter was driven by 6% transaction growth, reinforcing that we are reaching new customers, as well as increasing the frequency of existing customer visits. Our newest China stores continue to deliver record-breaking volume and profit, and we remain committed, and we're on plan to increase our store count to over 3,400 in China and to over 10,000 in CAP overall by the end of fiscal 2019.","Our loyalty program is the cornerstone of our digital flywheel, and CAP now has over 19 million Starbucks Reward members, with over 10 million in China alone. We recently launched mobile payment in China, leveraging the Starbucks mobile app with Starbucks stored value cards linked to Rewards. In Japan, we launched our first-ever Starbucks mobile app, giving customers the ability to pay for their purchases and send eGifts. We're extremely pleased by the rapid adoption of the mobile app in Japan. Our China\/Asia Pacific business continues to perform well, reinforcing our confidence in the long-term growth potential of this market.","Let's now move on to EMEA. EMEA continues to execute against a strategy to achieve an appropriate balance between company-operated and licensed stores. This is enabling us to grow our store footprint more rapidly, while expanding underlying operating margin over time. While the reported revenue decline in EMEA was 7%, when you adjust for the transfer of company-owned stores to licensed stores and for FX, which together impacted revenue by 12 points, revenue growth was 5%. We opened 92 new stores in the quarter and we've successfully transitioned our company-operated stores in Germany to our licensed partner, AmRest. Following this transition, 79% of the 2,565 stores throughout EMEA are now licensed.","System comps across our EMEA business grew 2% in the quarter. A slow-growth European economy, Brexit, a weakened British pound, and ongoing security concerns throughout the region have contributed to consumer uncertainty throughout Europe. Our brand continues to hold up well in this challenging environment. We continue to see strength in the morning daypart from espresso growth and breakfast sandwich attach. In addition, the recent launch of the Teavana Shaken Iced Tea platform in Starbucks stores across 32 EMEA countries has exceeded our most optimistic projections. Featuring core beverages, including Peach Green Tea Lemonade, Classic Iced Tea and Iced Tea Lemonade available in black, green or hibiscus, the initial reaction from customers has been fantastic. We continue the global rollout of Teavana at Starbucks in most CAP markets later this quarter.","Let's move on to Channel Development. Channel Development had a very strong Q3, with sequential acceleration of revenue growth to 9%. Operating income grew by 31% year-on-year, with each of the U.S. CPG, international CPG, and foodservice channels contributing to these outstanding results. Both the Starbucks Roast and Ground and Starbucks K-Cup platforms grew dollar share and maintained share leadership in the quarter. Our K-Cups business posted a strong dollar share growth of 13.3%, which was almost twice the category growth overall and gained just under a full point of share. With a 15.8% share, Starbucks is the number one brand on the K-Cup platform for the fourth consecutive quarter. Starbucks Roast and Ground continues to be the number one premium packaged coffee brand, with dollar sales growth of 8%, also roughly twice the category growth in the quarter overall, and gained just under one full point of share. Once again, our foodservice business led the industry, posting 6% growth, driven by strength in sales from national customers and the Office Coffee channel.","Turning to Ready-to-Drink, our North American Coffee Partnership with PepsiCo posted excellent results in the quarter. System sales, as measured by IRI, grew 11%, translating into a 1% share gain, bringing Starbucks to 13.3% of the total liquid coffee plus energy segment. And we are very excited about the prospects for our new Cold Brew Ready-to-Drink coffee launched just this month. Premium Ready-to-Drink tea is the fastest-growing segment in the tea category, growing 16% CAGR over the past five years and now generating an addressable market of $1.1 billion in sales.","In Q3, we announced our entry into this new category through a new partnership with Anheuser-Busch. The Teavana Ready-to-Drink product line will offer consumers premium flavor options currently available to consumers only at Starbucks and Teavana retail stores. Teavana Ready-to-Drink teas will launch regionally in the first half of calendar year 2017 and expand across the U.S. over time.","We continue to build our global CPG footprint. In the quarter, we began shipping Ready-to-Drink products within Latin America in partnership with PepsiCo. In Europe, we are on track for a fall launch of Starbucks Nespresso-compatible capsules in the U.K. and France. In partnership with Tingyi, we are tracking to launch Ready-to-Drink products in China by the end of calendar year 2016. The Channel Development segment continues to perform extremely well.","Before handing over to Scott, I want to close with just a brief update on our digital flywheel. Having successfully navigating transitioning customers to the new program, we are now positioned to further accelerate program growth with a structure conducive to greater innovation and expansion. During the time of year when we typically see little, if any, program growth, we grew active membership to 12.3 million members. With strong retention across all customer segments, the vast majority of these customers now use our mobile app as the payment vehicle, accounting for approximately 25% of all transactions.","Mobile Order & Pay was deployed less than one year ago and now represents nearly 5% of total U.S. transactions, close to 20% of all mobile payment at Starbucks. But that doesn't tell the entire story. When you look at our busiest stores at peak, when Mobile Order & Pay is most valuable to our customers and most effective at unlocking capacity in our stores, we see an even more impressive trend. In more than 2,700 stores across the U.S., Mobile Order & Pay represents more than 10% of total transactions at peak. In several hundred of those U.S. stores, Mobile Order & Pay represents more than 20% of transactions at peak.","Adoption and usage continue to grow, and the upside is significant, as it is helping our customers and partners in our busiest stores at peak. We continue to make progress on app improvements that includes menu functionality and response time, while enabling new features, including favorite stores, favorite items, favorite orders, and personalized recommendations, most of which will be released over the next three months.","Over the next several years, we will continue to enhance and expand personalization, both in our app and in other digital channels. We are now driving personalized offers through e-mail, which are yielding extremely encouraging results. We are building a true, real-time, personalization capability which will begin to power personalized experiences and communications within our app. The digital flywheel is a powerful asset, with a clear innovation roadmap.","In closing, we have navigated the onetime event of transitioning to the new Starbucks Rewards program and our actions going forward are clear. Drive the Summer 2 marketing campaign around cold, enable the next wave of digital innovation and personalization, and continue to execute against our seven core strategies for growth.","I'll now hand over to Scott Maw to take you through the financials. Scott.","Scott Harlan Maw - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Kevin, and good afternoon, everyone. Starbucks' third quarter results, once again, reflect strong revenue and profit growth, although below recent trends. For the first time in our history, consolidated operating income exceeded $1 billion in a non-holiday quarter, increasing 9% over last year despite a full point of negative impact from foreign exchange.","Operating margin expanded 30 basis points to 19.5% on a GAAP basis, and 19.8% on a non-GAAP basis, both new Q3 records. Margin improvement was driven by sales leverage and favorability in cost of sales that more than offset the impact of ongoing partner and digital investments, primarily related to our Americas segment.","On a GAAP basis, EPS increased 24% to $0.51 in Q3, and on a non-GAAP basis, EPS increased 17% to $0.49. Noteworthy is that non-GAAP EPS in Q3 excludes the impact from the net gain resulting from the sale of our business in Germany to an existing licensed partner and an incremental tax benefit related to certain additional domestic manufacturing deductions for periods prior to FY 2016.","Additionally, non-GAAP EPS continues to exclude certain costs related to our purchase of Starbucks Japan discussed on prior earnings calls. You can see the amount, timing, and description of each of these non-GAAP items in the detailed reconciliation table provided at the end of the earnings release. Please review that table in conjunction with our results.","I'll now take you through the operating performance of each of our major segments in Q3. Americas' Q3 operating income grew to a new third quarter record of $899 million, a 5% increase over the prior year quarter. Operating margin, while declining 40 basis points year-over-year, remains strong at 24.6%. In addition to the details Kevin provided on U.S. comps, we did see nearly one point of transaction splitting impact during the quarter following the Starbucks Rewards launch. This is consistent with our previous estimate we provided and impacts both ticket and transaction by about one point.","Store partner and digital investments increased in Q3, impacting operating margin by 140 basis points. Included in that figure is 90 basis points of impact related to a $30 million onetime cash award for tenured U.S. Retail hourly store partners. The impact of these investments was partially offset by sales leverage and savings in cost of sales.","Given our Q3 results and outlook for Q4, we expect operating margin in fiscal 2016 for the Americas to increase slightly over fiscal 2015.","Let's move on to our China\/Asia Pacific segment. Our China\/Asia Pacific segment delivered its highest-ever quarterly operating income in Q3, $183 million on a GAAP basis, representing a 22% increase year-over-year, and an 80 basis point increase in operating margin to 23.8%, as the segment benefited from higher income from our joint venture operations and increased sales leverage, partially offset by a negative 130 basis point impact of foreign currency translation. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, CAP margins expanded by 210 basis points in Q3. For the year, we now see CAP operating margins expanding slightly over last year, an increase from our most recent guidance given our strong operating performance in the region.","Let's move on to EMEA. EMEA's operating margin declined 130 basis points in Q3 compared to last year, to 10.9%, largely due to the sale of our Germany retail operations, driven by costs related to the sale of 110 basis points. While licensed store profitability continues to improve, EMEA is facing significant ongoing economic and geopolitical headwinds. As a result, we now see fiscal year 2016 operating margin roughly equal to last year.","Our Channel Development segment once again delivered very strong performance and results in Q3. Channel Development operating income reached a new quarterly record of $188 million, up 31% over last year, as operating margin increased 710 basis points in the quarter to 42.6%, driven primarily by favorability in coffee costs, lower marketing spend, higher income from our North American Coffee Partnership with Pepsi, and leverage on cost of sales.","Year-to-date, our North American Coffee Partnership has grown its operating income contribution by a remarkable 33%, reflecting strong demand for core bottled beverages such as Frappuccino and the success of innovative new products. Given the performance to-date, we now expect strong operating margin expansion for Channel Development with the full year 2016 in line with the segment's Q3 year-to-date margin.","I want to take a moment to comment specifically on our Q3 tax rate, because it came in lower than our expectation and yours. Our reported Q3 effective tax rate of 29.7% included several items worth mentioning. As noted in the non-GAAP reconciliation at the end of our earnings release, we recorded a true-up related to a specific domestic manufacturing tax benefit in the quarter, and also the net gain from the Germany sale, the majority of which was non-taxable. These items had a favorable 260 basis point impact on the tax rate. The remaining net favorability, which was not included as a non-GAAP adjustment, related to various other items that we recorded during the quarter. We do not anticipate that the benefit from most of these items will recur in Q4.","I'd like to cover in some detail our expected performance for Q4 given our Q3 results, particularly in connection with our U.S. Retail business and the impact of the 53rd week. For Q4, we are expecting GAAP EPS in the range of $0.53 to $0.54, and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.54 to $0.55 including the impact of the 53rd week that will add roughly $0.06 to the quarter. I want to underscore that the $0.06 is our best estimate of the 53-week contribution. Forecasting the impact of a single week out of a year with complete precision given the size and scale of our global business is challenging at best.","For our fiscal 2016, our GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.88 to $1.89, including the $0.06 for the 53rd week, and we are reiterating our non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.88 to $1.89, including the $0.06 for the 53rd week, consistent with prior guidance. On a 52-week basis, non-GAAP EPS growth represents 15% to 16% over the prior year, our seventh straight year of at least 15% non-GAAP EPS growth.","We now expect global comp growth of 5% for Q4 and mid-single-digit comp growth globally for fiscal year 2016. This includes some anticipated improvement in Q4 U.S. comps from Q3 levels. On a 52-week basis, we now expect consolidated revenue growth of approximately 10%, with the 53rd week adding approximately two points and one point of negative impact from FX.","For the full year, foreign exchange is expected to negatively impact consolidated operating income growth by approximately two points. For fiscal 2016, we continue to expect investments in our partners and digital initiatives globally to be between $275 million and $300 million, compared to approximately $145 million in fiscal 2015. We continue to expect consolidated operating margin for fiscal 2016 to increase slightly relative to 2015 on both GAAP and non-GAAP bases, reflecting sales leverage and increased operating efficiency and performance, partially offset by the impact of increased partner and digital investments.","Moving on to commodities, with 2016 coffee needs fully priced, we still expect to see a slightly favorable impact for the year, and we are now over 50% price locked for fiscal 2017. We will update you on the projected 2017 impact of coffee costs in conjunction with our overall initial 2017 guidance next quarter.","Given the strong operating results we're generating from our new stores, particularly in our largest markets such as the U.S. and China, we now expect to add approximately 1,900 net new stores globally in fiscal 2016, up from our previous guidance, including 750 in Americas, 900 in China\/Asia Pacific, and 250 in EMEA. I want to emphasize that we are seeing no change in the strong profitability or growth trajectory of our new stores. We now expect our effective tax rate for the year to be approximately 33%, and we still expect capital expenditures of $1.4 billion for fiscal 2016.","Consistent with the timing of targets for the current fiscal year, we will be providing our initial growth target for fiscal 2017 during our fourth quarter earnings call. You will recall that a year ago we made the decision to shift providing guidance to Q4 in order to have the time necessarily to fully vet and finalize our annual operating plan for the subsequent year.","As Howard mentioned, Q3 was an unusual quarter, characterized by very strong results from both China\/Asia Pacific and Channel Development but challenged top line results in the U.S. due to less than expected sales lift from the launch of the new Starbucks Rewards program and Frappuccino Happy Hour and the high bar to clear from Q3 of last year. Yet despite this challenge and because of the dedication and commitment of our store partners around the world, we delivered another solid quarter and record revenues and profit.","Our path forward is clear. We are confident in the correctness of the strategic, operational and digital moves we outlined today, and remain steadfast in our commitment to deliver the long-term profitable growth that you have rightfully come to expect. We're looking forward to sharing more of our plans around reimagined store designs and new store formats, coming mobile, digital, and loyalty innovations, new food and beverage offerings, and the many other initiatives underway at our Biennial Investor Day on December 7.","Now I'll turn the call back to the operator for Q&A. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Sara Senatore with Bernstein. Your line is open.","Sara H. Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you very much. Howard, I was wondering if maybe you could give some historical context. You've seen periods of weaker consumer confidence before. For me, the second quarter of 2012 kind of comes to mind and maybe late in 2014. And Starbucks has always been able to address it and re-accelerate comps. So could you maybe just talk about it in the context of what you're seeing now and your confidence in your ability to do that again similar to as you've done in prior years?","Howard S. Schultz - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you for the question. You know, let me say that I think we've been very fortunate over the years to be able to create the kind of product and experience that provides our customers with a sense of community and an emotional attachment that I think, over time, despite the conditions in the marketplace and the economic pressures, have been very inviting for our customers. I say that because I think what we are experiencing to-date is something different. And before anyone rushes to judgment what I mean by that, let me explain it.","I think we have a situation where you have a very uncertain election. You have domestic civil unrest with regard to race. And I think the issues around terror have created a level of anxiety. And so, we're no longer looking at just an economic downturn. There are a number of things that we are facing as citizens, and I think the direction of the country.","And so, I think this is a multi-prong issue that almost every company and every consumer brand is facing as a result of what I've just described. As I said in my prepared remarks, though, we, at Starbucks, look at this not as an excuse but feel very strongly that what we offer our customers, the sense of community, the longing for human connection, a safe place, an affordable luxury and, obviously, the innovation that we have brought forth gives us the confidence that we will be the kind of company and the kind of brand that will demonstrate to our customers the aspirational connection.","And I think also it's very \u2013 I know this is a long-winded answer, but it's important. So much of what we've been able to do over the years is linked to the equity of the brand which is linked to the experience. That experience comes to life with our people. The investments we continue to make with our people are as important as anything we are doing to overcome the challenge and the headwinds that I've just described.","In addition to that, I think the social impact initiatives that we have brought forth over the last couple of years has created a level of trust and confidence in the brand, in the experience, I think, that demonstrates that our ability to navigate through this time and time again will give us the ability this time as well to put up the kind of numbers that Scott just described, and we will do everything we can to not only meet the guidance but, as we've done in the past, try and overachieve it.","But no one should misinterpret or in any way look at the challenges that we and many, many other companies are facing as something that has been done before. This is quite unusual. It's unsettling. It's unnerving, and as a result of that, it requires an approach that is quite different than anything we've done before.","But I must say that I'm confident that the team, the leadership, the field, the equity of the brand, the innovation, what Kevin has described in digital, all of these things, coupled with the offset of being able to create the kind of business in Asia, and specifically China, which gives us the ability to offset some of the concerns that are going on in the U.S. and create the kind of business in China that one day \u2013 and I've said this in the past \u2013 will be as large or larger than the U.S.","And as a result of that, we won't be as dependent on the domestic relationship we currently have. You look at the China business today, the growth, the revenue, the equity of the brand, the experience \u2013 for those people who haven't seen it, it's quite something to see after 17 years what we've been able to do there, and we are just getting started.","When that Shanghai Roastery opens, it's going to be something that is going to probably be as strong an experience as what Disney has done recently in Shanghai.","That's a very long-winded answer, and the short response is I am confident with cautious optimism that we will continue to be able to deliver despite the challenges I've just described.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Great. Thank you so much, and I do apologize if I missed this but, Howard, it's been my impression with all of the exceptional things that you do at the store level that not everyone is aware of things like the benefits of my Starbucks Rewards, and even some of your core customers don't necessarily realize the benefits that they get from mobile ordering, given that 5% of transactions are currently mobile ordering. So everyone knows what Starbucks is in the United States, but is there an awareness opportunity for you to communicate directly, indirectly, in the Starbucks way, some of the key attributes that does make it different that perhaps gives us an opportunity as we think about 2017?","Howard S. Schultz - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. One second. Here is Matt Ryan, who is going to take that.","Matthew Ryan - Executive Vice President, Global Chief Strategy Officer","Thank you, John, for the question. You're absolutely right. We do have an opportunity there. When we look over time, there are a lot of customers who are not aware of the benefits of the Rewards program. There are a lot of customers who have not joined it yet there. There are a lot of customers who don't know about Mobile Order & Pay and the tremendous benefits.","We're very fortunate that we have that in front of us, so we're leaning in constantly. We've seen a lot more recruitment of members in our stores this year. You're going to continue to see that, and you're going to continue to see us lean in hard on Mobile Order & Pay, continuing to improve the experience and showing people just how good it can be.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Palmer with RBC. Your line is open.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi. Thanks. With regard to Food growth, you mentioned that it was perhaps not quite as strong as it was in previous quarters. Do you think you're reaching near-peak levels of Food attachment? Or is this just quarterly noise? And relatedly, from a menu composition standpoint, what do you think is perhaps the more exciting sales layers that you're pursuing currently? Thanks.","Kevin R. Johnson - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Yeah. This is Kevin, David, and then I'll hand it over to Cliff to give you some more background. I think we have not reached some level of saturation on how much we can grow Food. I think we've seen very good growth of our breakfast sandwich lineup. We're seeing increased attach of Food. I think if you look at each daypart, there are opportunities in every daypart for us to do more around Food, and I think we recognize that as one of our seven core strategies for growth and the work that we're doing, both in R&D and innovation and testing things in stores and markets, I think continues to present an opportunity.","We did see Food contribute one point of comp growth this quarter. I think in prior quarter I think it was at two points of comp growth. So we're still seeing good comp growth coming from Food, and there's more we can do there. Cliff, I'll let you add some more to that.","Clifford Burrows - Group President-Americas, US & Teavana Region","Yeah. Thanks, Kevin. And, David, it's great to see the strength and the continued growth on breakfast sandwiches, and that morning daypart just continues to get stronger and stronger. The opportunity is to provide choice, variety and a competitive approach around lunch and later dayparts. And we've started our journey, and if I remember back rolling out breakfast sandwiches I think took us several years, and the growth we've seen since we've brought in the baked goods at La Boulange and the enhancements to the quality and the choice of breakfast sandwiches gives me every confidence that we will continue on this journey, 20% of our sales now coming from Food, it's a great opportunity for the future, and we're working hard on it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Glass with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks very much. You recently announced that you were going to raise wages in the U.S. by between 5% and 15%. So I'm just wondering, I know you don't talk about 2017 yet, but it begs the question since you brought it up at least in discussing that, what is the cost of that in dollars? What are the expenses that roll off this year that might help offset that? And can you fund that kind of investment in the context of 15% to 20% earnings growth? Any help there would be greatly appreciated.","Scott Harlan Maw - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, John. It's Scott. I think the first thing I would say is the vast majority of that investment that we announced recently was already in our initial plans for 2017. And both those investments and any other investments that we choose to do as we move into next year, we'll talk about during the next earnings call, but I want to make sure both the performance this quarter, the guidance next quarter, the investments we're making, there is no wavering in our commitment to deliver at least 15% EPS growth every year, and that is true for 2017. So we'll get into more specifics, but as comp growth reaccelerates, as we take a look at additional investments, as we lap over investments that we make this year, the sum of all of that will be at least 15% earnings growth.","Howard S. Schultz - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And let me add something qualitatively to that. Because of the degree of frequency that the average customer has to their core store, their home store, whether it's at work or at home, there is a relationship that is built between the barista, the manager, and the customer. And we know from our own research that anything that we can do that lowers attrition, that creates a relationship with our customers and the people who are proudly wearing the green apron, that performance that you've seen year in, year out, is directly related. So what we want to try and do is really get ahead of any federal or state mandate to be the employer of choice, whether we go back to the late 1980s with Bean Stock and healthcare, and what we've done in the last couple of years with college achievement, and now what we're doing now on wages, we want to try and do everything we can to share success, because we know that the brand of Starbucks is directly related to the experience in our stores and our brand, unlike almost any consumer brand or retail stores directly linked to the pride and the trust that our people have in the company.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Tarantino with Baird. Your line is open.","David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Hi. Good afternoon. I have a clarification question and then another question. First, on the clarification side, when you say, Howard, that you have line of sight into comps improving, is that meant to be a signal that you're already seeing that in July? Or you're expecting that to happen in the balance of the quarter? So if you could help to clarify that, that would be great. And then I think there was a reference to better leveraging the new Rewards program as you move forward. If you could just elaborate on what you're planning there and if that's something we should expect to see in the current quarter or as we move into next year.","Howard S. Schultz - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I think it would not be responsible to comment on the first 21 days of the quarter with regard to where comps are, but I think those of you who have been covering the company all these years in our public life of 24 years, we do not have a habit of giving guidance that we don't believe we can achieve. So take it on face value that Scott said that comps are going to improve in the quarter, and we believe that's going to be true.","Kevin R. Johnson - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Yeah. And then, David, in terms of your question on better leverage of the Rewards program and the digital flywheel, I'll give you three dimensions in which I think we have an opportunity to better leverage that asset. Number one is continued geographic deployment. We talked about what we did this last quarter in Japan and China as examples, and the more we take the Rewards program and the mobile app on our digital flywheel to other geographies, that's one way to leverage. The second is growing the number of customers that we have in the Rewards program, and Matt Ryan highlighted that as a big opportunity, and that's one piece of it. And then the third is the way that we deepen the engagement with the existing customers in the Rewards program, and that's done through a combination of the work we're doing around personalization, and it's also done through the work we're doing to incent things like a trial of Mobile Order & Pay. I think we've got some number of customers that have tried Mobile Order & Pay. And statistically, when we look at \u2013 once a customer tries Mobile Order & Pay once, it's a very sticky feature. Once they try it once, they start using it regularly. The vast majority of them do.","So those are three dimensions. And I'm going to hand over to Matt Ryan to talk a little bit more about the personalization work we're doing, but those are three dimensions that we are going to use to leverage that asset. And, Matt, to you on personalization.","Matthew Ryan - Executive Vice President, Global Chief Strategy Officer","Thanks, Kevin. I think the one thing I would add here is there's a direct linkage between the changes we made in our Rewards program and our ability to launch personalization moving forward. As you know, the past program only rewarded frequency. We couldn't reward any other behavior but that. We now have the opportunity, both in e-mail, which we've just begun, and this quarter, in our app, to do suggested selling. So we will be suggesting and making personalized offers within the context of our app that will allow people to see things that are right for them.","In the year to come, you'll see more of this in the context of ordering. So at the moment, when somebody is there, we'll be able to suggest items that are additional purchases and reward that with a currency that now rewards not only frequency but also spend. So connecting the dots there you can see how this will build on itself and give us leverage to drive the total customer sales.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Charles with Cowen & Co. Your line is open.","Andrew Charles - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you. I've noticed a heightened level of Star Dash e-mails since the MSR transition, and this obviously isn't Starbucks-specific as the whole industry's promotional intensity has increased. But I'm curious as you think about improved trends in 4Q, is this taking into consideration weaning off these promotions, or given the fragile consumer environment Howard noted earlier, if a heightened level of promotions remains necessary near-term? Thanks.","Matthew Ryan - Executive Vice President, Global Chief Strategy Officer","Matt Ryan here again. I that what I'd like to call attention to that what you're actually seeing are more personalized and relevant communications. So very late in the quarter, we turned on, what we call, one-to-one marketing. It's actually close to one-to-30, but we are getting down to the level of personalized rewards based upon what people actually will do and knowledge we have of that individual customer's behavior. Previously, we sent e-mails to very large segments of customers. Now, we're able to do it on a very targeted basis, and what that allows us to do is to be more efficient and more effective with our communications so that we don't have to peanut butter a broad discount. We can go in more selectively and offer just what's right to get the next incremental level of engagement with us.","Howard S. Schultz - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Let me add one other thing that I think is very important. If you think what the size and scale of the national footprint of Starbucks and the amount of stores we have, we've achieved something that is quite rare and unique, and that is we've achieved a level of ubiquity in terms of our scale and national footprint and, at the same time, without question, a premium position in the marketplace. That is as a result of a very disciplined and thoughtful view of how to build and maintain a premium brand.","What we saw this past quarter and, for that matter, even beyond that, was given the challenges that exist in the marketplace that we've all seen and discussed, there is a tremendous amount of discounting and promotion going on in the market where people are buying business. We do not want to be in the business of buying business. We do not want to discount or dilute the integrity of the brand. We know who we are. We know what our core purpose is. And we've got to play the long game and have faith and confidence in what we stand for in terms of the experience, the quality of the coffee.","What we keep talking about really internally is we want to take the equity of the brand and the position of Starbucks up. The premiumization of Starbucks is linked to the Roasteries and linked to this new format of stores that we are working on that you'll begin to see in calendar 2017 which is Starbucks Reserve which, in a way, is like a cousin in a smaller format of the Roastery. All of that will shine a halo on the brand, shine a halo on the experience, and we don't want to do anything that would dilute that halo by buying business or discounting, and we're not going to get in that game, despite the fact that so many other people are throwing that at us.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jason West with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Jason West - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Yeah. Thanks. Just going back to the kind of broader margin outlook here, you guys have made some significant investments in the partners and technology over the last two years. I think there's a perception out there that as you roll into next year, you'll be able to lap some of those investments and perhaps will give you some room to let a little more margin flow to the bottom line. Can you kind of address your thoughts on that perception that's out there? Is that the right way to think about it? Or are we just in the earlier stages of these types of investments and you expect them to continue into next year, particularly given the labor environment that we have today?","Scott Harlan Maw - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Jason. This is Scott. What we said in the past is the significant investment started in 2014. They ramped in 2015, and we increased them again in 2016. And I think that, as we look ahead to 2017 and we start to put together our plan, I think there will be another significant level of investment in our partners in particular. We announced some of those recently. They're vital to driving the right level of retention, the right level of customer execution, as Howard talked about. So I think looking forward to 2017, you can see \u2013 I can see another significant amount of investments and also on the digital front. So as you look at the things that Matt talked about, the ability to drive personalization, we see an additional opportunity there.","So I don't think we're in the early innings, but it will probably continue for a number of years as we continue to drive digital innovation and we continue to drive the right level of investments in stores and partners. But what I think is important is that doesn't have any impact on our long-term guidance of at least 15% earnings growth, 10% profit growth, and as a result, margin expansion. I just think we're investing more of that margin into our core partner and digital investments.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nicole Miller with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","Nicole M. Miller Regan - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","Thank you. My question is just tell us more about Channel Development, but what I was hoping you would comment on is I know dollar growth was up 9%, but how does volume growth compare? And then I was looking back in my model and historically the fourth quarter for the past few years is the highest operating margin quarter. So is there any reason that wouldn't hold true for this year? And the final part of that is, is everything in that's been renegotiated or added in this quarter such that it's a sustainable peak? Or do you think just in any timeframe in the future, it could be even higher? Thank you so much.","Michael Conway - President, Starbucks Global Channel Development","Thank you, Nicole. This is Mike Conway. So you're right, the 9% growth actually is quite, quite strong. We're pleased with that, and I would say that the combination of our strong in-store execution, the strong distribution that we've been able to have, the strength in general that we're seeing in foodservice is all contributing to that.","As I look at volume, I'd say our volume growth was a little bit higher than that, but not much, and I think the combination of our base and promotive pricing has been able to deliver both the kind of margin expansion that we want to see as well as the share improvements that we would see.","As we look forward to the fourth quarter, we feel very good about the innovation that we have coming. We've got our Cold Brew that is coming in our ready-to-serve segment. We also have our new Caff\u00e8 Latte launch that is in our K-Cup format. That is going to be launched in the fourth quarter. And then on a global basis, we have a lot of new initiatives that are coming, particularly in the ready-to-drink and single-serve segments with our Nespresso launch in EMEA. So we feel good about the quality of our growth in the third quarter and our outlook for the fourth quarter we also feel good about as well. And I'll let Scott take the margin expansion question.","Scott Harlan Maw - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","On the fourth quarter Channel Development margin, it will be the highest quarter again for us this year, and it will expand over last year's Channel Development margin and expand over this quarter's margin. There's a lot of good things, as Mike talked about, that will impact that quarter.","And what I would say to the second part of your question, Nicole, is we continue to forecast, as we move through time, margin expansion in Channel Development. It won't be 710 basis points very many quarters. This was unusual and excellent, but we do expect channel operating income to grow faster than revenue growth, and that will drive margin expansion as we move into 2017.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Buckley with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Joseph Terrence Buckley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. Can I take you back to the effects of the Rewards program on the quarter? If you could just walk through in a little more detail how you think it disrupted some of the other things you that may have typically done. And maybe tie into that just customer acceptance. I mean, I know the membership is up quite big, but just sort of customer acceptance of the new program.","Howard S. Schultz - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Joe, this is Howard. I think Kevin is going to take the bulk of the question. But I think ask yourself rhetorically, with 25 consecutive quarters of 5% or greater, if we did not have the confluence of the Rewards program and the Frappuccino launch at the same time, what would comps have been for this quarter? And I can tell you unequivocally that we know internally that this was an anomaly as a result of what I described in my prepared remarks. Now, we own that from an execution standpoint because we underestimated what would take place. But if any of that did not exist, the comps in the quarter would not have been before that we have outlined in the release. And I think as a result of that, we feel very comfortable that things are going to improve. Kevin?","Kevin R. Johnson - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Yeah. Let me build on that, Joe. I think there's three primary drivers behind our Q3 results in the U.S. business. First, we launched Starbucks Rewards in mid-April, which impacted the timing of our annual Summer 1 campaign, and that Summer 1 campaign is what kicks off and launches our Frappuccino Happy Hour season.","Now, in many ways, the Rewards launch went exactly as planned, with the vast majority of our customers excited about their ability to earn more rewards and with nearly 20% year-on-year growth in membership. Customers that could potentially be disadvantaged have not materially changed their behavior, and we're seeing increased lift in activity and early signs of success from the personalization efforts Matt described.","So the launch of Rewards required a significant amount of cross-company focus from our marketing teams, store execution, our digital teams, and this included specific training and marketing in our stores. We trained our store partners on Rewards programs so they could explain it, and educate customers, and help them through that transition. We used our stores to market and launch the Rewards program. And in order to make room in the marketing calendar to do this training and launch it in our stores and communicate it to customers, we delayed our normal Summer 1 campaign launch by one week. So we launched it one week later than we did last year. And so this resulted in a slower launch or start to the Frappuccino Happy Hour. So that's number one.","Second, and related, was the implication of having two major marketing campaigns, Rewards and our Frappuccino Happy Hour, running simultaneously. Let me give you some more context. Over time, we've seen a little bit of slowing in the afternoon and some of the blended products such as Frappuccino, but this quarter stands out with a negative 1% comp in blended. And as you know, Happy Hour is a significant event each May and makes that month the biggest month of the year for us in terms of total U.S. transactions. And because of the foundational importance of the new Rewards program and the need to connect with customers, we had to have the marketing message around Rewards and communicated and unfortunately having two major marketing messages running simultaneously, we didn't get as much traction behind Frappuccino Happy Hour. We didn't get as much social media buzz and that translated into not as many transactions.","So launching it a week later and then have having two marketing messages simultaneously were the contributors. And then I think the potential third aspect that we acknowledge but can't quantify is the overall impact of customer sentiment. Given the significant economic and geopolitical uncertainty in many parts of world, and we believe consumer confidence has weakened.","Now, industry-specific spending data for retail broadly, and for restaurants specifically would support that that's the case. And, we've navigated these situations in the past. And I think, as Howard articulated, this one may be a bit different. But, we think when we put these three factors together, this quarter was an anomaly. And I think that gives you a little bit of perspective and a little bit of color around the drivers. Cliff, do you want to add to that?","Clifford Burrows - Group President-Americas, US & Teavana Region","Yeah, Joe, it's Cliff. I think one of the things just to share, change is always difficult for both partners and customers. The frequency we have people coming into our stores and the relationship between the barista and the customer is absolutely key to our business. So we invested in a lot of fronts in making our partners ready for the change. The good news is we transferred and changed over the program virtually overnight. It was a very, very seamless transition.","Functionality is great and growing, and the personalization just gives me so much confidence for the future. The opportunity now for us is to grow the awareness of the program with the existing customers about the benefits and personalization will really help with that. And then continue to grow the number of members in the program, and I think Mobile Order & Pay ties nicely into that. And as Kevin \u2013 I'm sorry, as Howard outlined earlier, the year-on-year growth on active members at 18%, taking us to 12.3 million, just gives us great confidence for the future.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matthew DiFrisco with Guggenheim Securities. Your line is now open.","Matthew DiFrisco - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Thank you. Just a little bit of a follow-up on that also with respect to looking back on the comp and just trying to understand the going-forward trends. I know there's been some publicity about the 1% price increase or about a $0.05 per beverage to come, and being taken. And I'm just curious as far as the way I understand it, two points for the core beverages in this quarter, one point for Food, one point for Teavana, so we're assuming then no price in 2Q \u2013 in fiscal 3Q and all of the reported then sort of 1% price increase would be incremental going forward?","Kevin R. Johnson - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Yeah, Matthew, one correction I want to add to your comp bridge that you just went through. There was also one point from the refreshment platform. There's one point from Teavana and one point from the refreshment platform. And so, if you add that up and you look inside, there was also then the negative point for blended, and that's how you get the bridge.","Scott Harlan Maw - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","And what I would add to that, Matt, is Kevin's comp numbers include pricing for those categories. So on your broader pricing question, the first thing I want to make sure you realize is, as we take price, we look at very carefully using our elasticity models, as you know, we look at it by product, we look at it by geography, and we're very careful to be sensitive to significant changes to customer impact. We're really cognizant of that. And as we've done that over the years, including this year and the most recent pricing changes that we just made, we are not seeing any change in customer attrition. So that's not happening.","And then to your core question. As you know over the last few years, we've had one point to two points of price in our comps every quarter. This quarter, in the third quarter, will fall into that one point to two point price range, and the fourth quarter will fall into that one point to two point price range. So there's no acceleration of comp pricing in the guidance that I gave.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Karen Holthouse with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Karen Holthouse - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. So I'm asking a little bit of the same question as you're looking from this quarter into sort of next quarter and then fiscal 2017. Where are the puts and the takes on the comp algorithm? Is it that Food can re-accelerate or particular categories or does a lot of it come down to this one-to-one marketing and more of a traffic or frequency-driven acceleration? Thanks.","Scott Harlan Maw - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","I'll start and then if Matt wants to add. From a product standpoint, the first thing that's going to happen is blended sales will rebound. We obviously don't anticipate another negative 1% comp from blended. In addition, as we look at the Summer 2 platform that Kevin talked about with things like Iced Coconut Milk Macchiato and Mocha Macchiato and the early results from that are quite encouraging. We've got a number of things on the product lineup, Card, Nitro Cold Brew, as well as acceleration of some of the features within Mobile Order & Pay.","So later this quarter, we'll get favorites of stores which will make it easier for people in New York and other dense areas to select and save favorite stores, favorite orders, makes it easier to save favorite orders. And when we look at broadly our innovation pipeline, digital product, things that we're doing in the stores with things like Nitro, marketing, there's just a significant amount of momentum already, and then that we have planned as we look forward. And as we get into 2017, the second part of your question, and Matt touched on this, we will further refine our personalization capability to have suggested selling one-to-one as you're building your order with relevant products based upon what you've ordered in the past, daypart, your preferences. So all of that is stacked up, and that's what makes us think we can get to 5% at least as we get into Q4 and try to accelerate as we go into 2017.","Howard S. Schultz - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","There's one more I think significant opportunity. Cliff, do you want to talk about that?","Clifford Burrows - Group President-Americas, US & Teavana Region","Yeah, let me just talk, Karen, about a real opportunity that exists playing off or drafting off the work we've done at the Roastery here in Seattle, and that is an opportunity to elevate coffee to a new level within our stores. And that is showing up as a Reserve bar. And we've started to deploy Reserve bars and we will continue to grow that, and it will be a significant opportunity for us to elevate the handcrafted, the artisanal nature of the barista, and you'll start to see that showing up across the country. And that will introduce new beverages which are at a premium, and it will give customers an opportunity to try some of the incredible coffees that are roasted in our Roasteries, in our Roastery here in Seattle.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of R.J. Hottovy with Morningstar. Your line is open.","R.J. Hottovy - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Thanks. I had a follow-up question on the earlier question about better leverage in the Rewards program. Appreciate the geographic enrollment and personalization goals that you outlined as goals of better leverage in the program. But in the last quarter, you talked about opportunities such as the debit card, potentially the grocery store linkage and other partnerships like Lyft and New York Times as potentially a way to leverage the loyalty program. Just curious if we could get an update on that and the outlook for that the rest of this year and into 2017? Thanks.","Matthew Ryan - Executive Vice President, Global Chief Strategy Officer","Sure. Matt Ryan again here. We are actively at work on that. As you know, we've announced a significant partnership with Chase and there's a core product that we are just trying to figure out when to place on the calendar right now. We're not going to exactly commit to a date because we want to give it the right opportunity to launch across the next year.","We're very excited about that, because when Kevin talked about the leveragability of a spend-based program as opposed to a frequency-based program, it allows us to do these kinds of things like award people for everyday spend. And right now it's simply a matter of execution and when we can get it on the calendar and give it the justice that it deserves from a timing perspective.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Your line is open.","Mark Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah, thanks. And good afternoon, everybody. Wanted to ask about the global opportunity for expansion of packaged and single-serve coffee? And sort of the puts and takes of building it alone versus partnering with other folks? And then sort of related on the Channel Development business, how should we think about the ramp of the RTD coffee partnerships outside of the U.S. contributing to equity income going forward?","Michael Conway - President, Starbucks Global Channel Development","Thank you. Yeah, this is Mike. So as we look at our global opportunity for Channel Development, we've really focused on Ready-to-Drink as being the key driver versus packaged coffee, and a lot of that I think has to do with the strength that we've been able to create in our U.S. business with PepsiCo and the North American Coffee Partnership, and we think that's a more immediate opportunity.","And you're right, the success for us is finding the right partners across the globe, and we have essentially done that as we look across our major markets. So within EMEA, we have a partnership with Arla that is quite strong, and we're building our business there in key markets.","In Latin America, we just signed a deal with PepsiCo last year to strengthen the business within that region, and we're just starting to ship into new markets and into new channels within the region this quarter. And then within China\/Asia Pacific, Japan and China being our key markets, we have key partnerships in Japan, which is our biggest market with Suntory, in Korea with Dong Suh Foods. And then, as we've talked, we have a partnership with Tingyi in China, where we are in the final phases of scaling up both the distribution and manufacturing so that we'll be in the market by the end of this year. So we feel good about the prospects for our Ready-to-Drink business across the globe, and we think that will be the really driver for Channel Development, at least in the near-term.","Operator","And that was our last question.","Durga Doraisamy - Director of Investor Relations","Thank you all very much for joining us today, and we look forward to seeing you on December 7 in New York City.

My name is Mike, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Starbucks Coffee Company's Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2012 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Ms. DeGrande, you may begin your conference.","JoAnn DeGrande","Thank you, Mike. Good afternoon. This is JoAnn DeGrande, Director of Investor Relations for Starbucks Coffee Company. Joining me on the call today is Howard Schultz, Chairman, President and CEO; and Troy Alstead, CFO.","Before we get started, I'd like to remind you that this conference call will include forward-looking statements, which are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements. Any such statements should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements in our earnings release and risk factor discussions in our filings with the SEC, including our last annual report on Form 10-K.","Starbucks assumes no obligation to update any of the forward-looking statements or information. Please refer to the financial statements accompanying the earnings release to find disclosures and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today's call with their corresponding GAAP measures. ","This conference call is being webcast, and an archive of the webcast will be available on our website at www.starbucks.com under Investor Relations. ","With that, let me turn the call over to Howard Schultz. Howard?","Howard D. Schultz","Thank you, JoAnn, and welcome to everyone on today's call. I'm very pleased to report the record second quarter fiscal 2012 results that Starbucks announced today. As we sit here today, Starbucks has 17,420 stores in 58 countries, serving nearly 60 million customers each week.","Our record Q2 revenues and earnings were driven by strong overall global comparable store sales growth, a significant increase in our CPG, what we refer to as Channel Development segment revenues and operational excellence. A strong top line combined with increased efficiencies and continued discipline around controlling costs enabled us to deliver second quarter EPS of $0.40 to our shareholders. ","I'm particularly pleased that we were able to accomplish these results despite the challenges posed by high-legacy commodity costs and a particularly difficult consumer environment in Western Europe, further highlighted by the recessionary news out of England just this morning. ","I would not ordinarily begin a call with discussion of one particular market, but we had such a memorable trip to China last week that I wanted to share a few of the details with you upfront. Starbucks' business in China is strong and poised for significant disciplined profitable growth. We have seen a tremendous increase in momentum in China since my last trip, as more and more Chinese consumers frequent our stores and connect with the Starbucks brand and store experience.","You almost have to see the customer engagement for yourself to fully appreciate the transformation. In the past, our typical core customer in China was an expat or tourist visiting a store in Shanghai or Beijing. Today, without question, we have made the significant transition to serving local Chinese customers who enjoy a wide variety of locally relevant products and a welcoming third place environment.","We are well on our way to achieving our plan of having 1,500 stores in Mainland China by 2015. In fact, we are so encouraged by the customer adoption we are experiencing and the momentum that has been growing that we announced today that we are increasing our China\/Asia Pacific store opening targets for the fiscal year to 400 from 300, with China stores representing half of that growth.","Our comps in China continue to grow at a double-digit rate, reminiscent of our U.S. growth in the early 1990s, and store profit contribution is among the highest we have ever had in the company's history. Our progress and level of customer loyalty in Tier 1 cities like Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen is now being mirrored in the 44 other cities that have embraced us as well. And our China leadership team, led by John Culver and Belinda Wong on the ground in China, are doing a terrific job building the foundational elements of our brand imprinting our partners with our values and delivering a fantastic customer experience in our store.","The team has also engaged in ongoing forums with multiple stakeholders so that we are building our business with great sensitivity and respect for the Chinese culture. While I was in Beijing last week, we brought together for the first time a group of the leading real estate executives from all over the country in order to share our values and long-term growth plans for the China market. The event was an overwhelming success that brought us closer to Chinese developers and landlords and will help us better compete for choice locations as we expand our operations.","Perhaps at no time during the trip was our enthusiasm and optimism greater than as the 2 first-of-their-kind partner family forums we held in Beijing and Shanghai. Following a theme of growing together, the forums provided us with an opportunity to connect with 1,200 of our partners, their parents and other family members. Through these events, we were able to demonstrate our recognition and appreciation of the importance of family in Chinese culture, to share our own tradition and values and to communicate our commitment to investing in and developing our partners so that they and we succeed together. We made it evident to Chinese parents that Starbucks can give their children career opportunities and important life skills that will prepare them for the future. Our Chinese partners are passionate to grow with us, and they are eager for opportunities to share more of the Starbucks Experience with their customers every day.","As a result of this trip and in response to the growing strength and relevancy of the Starbucks brand, our team has also made the decision to bring at home single-serve espresso and brewed coffee to the rapidly growing Chinese middle and upper middle classes. We'll do this by introducing Verismo by Starbucks a single-serve espresso beverage and brewed coffee machine, and Starbucks-sourced 100% arabica coffee and milk pods to the Chinese market sometime in calendar 2013, much earlier than initially contemplated.","We believe that we have a strong competitive advantage and that we can use our stores as the distribution system to build trial and awareness that will help create excitement and adoption of Verismo in China. Our success in China is built on the solid foundation and the dynamic efficient organization that evolved from the work we did in connection with our U.S. transformation. As John and his team are executing in China, we are also taking this fully integrated proven playbook into markets around the world.","I would now like to speak to changes in the macro consumer behavior and consumer confidence issues facing most consumer brands and retailers around the world. There is no doubt that the seismic change in consumer behavior that has occurred over the last several years and coincided with the economic crisis that moved around the globe is in many ways here to stay. Now more than ever before, businesses and particularly consumer brands, must innovate and create differentiated value propositions for their customers in order to succeed.","Starbucks identified the shift very early, and we responded with My Starbucks Rewards loyalty program to both create value for our customers and build loyalty to our brand, and it has been widely successful. Today, there are more than 4.7 million active members in our loyalty program in the U.S. alone and over 2 million members in our loyalty program internationally loading more than $2.5 billion on cards annually. We have introduced the card in multiple markets around the world and have plans now to add even more in the months and quarters ahead as we build and share our value proposition around the world.","We are also at the forefront of mobile payment convenience and capability, where our mobile app has generated more than 45 million mobile payment transactions over the last 14 months, making Starbucks the largest and most widely embraced mobile payment program of any retailer in North America. The successful integration of our card and loyalty programs with our mobile apps has exponentially increased the relevancy and attachment of all 3 platforms, giving us an ongoing competitive advantage.","Starbucks is also an early mover in recognizing the disruptive opportunity for social and digital platforms. We are among the most liked brands on Facebook, most checked-in retailers on Foursquare, tweeted-about brand on Twitter and followed brand on the explosive Instagram platform. But those accolades mean less -- may mean little unless they drive a higher level of trust and a deeper emotional connection between the brand and the consumer in order to drive incremental revenue and create value for shareholders Starbucks' social and digital media capabilities do just that by enabling us to connect more deeply and more often with our customers and to compete more effectively by dramatically driving a higher return on our overall marketing investment all around the world.","Just yesterday, I was a featured keynote speaker at Facebook's Annual Global Leadership Meeting where I spoke to over 1,000 Facebook leaders and where Starbucks was highlighted as one of the leading innovators in the world on the Facebook platform.","Let me now shift my comments to a number of initiatives, developments and investments we have undertaken that have contributed to our achievement of our record financial performance and the highest level of customer relevancy as measured by any metric in our history. Then I will share a few exciting examples of how we are bringing our Blueprint for Profitable Growth to life and turn the call over to Troy.","In Q2, we announced several significant initiatives that further solidifies Starbucks' authority and leadership position in both packaged coffee and the exciting fast-growing at-home single cup and espresso specialty coffee categories. In January, to complement our full line of medium and dark roast coffees, we introduced Blonde, a lighter roast coffee available both packaged and in VIA and in K-Cup portion packs in response to strong demand from the 50 million-plus consumers who prefer a lighter coffee roast.","Early results suggest that our Blonde Roast coffees have been very well received, and that we are seeing incrementality in sales of brewed coffee, whole bean and VIA since launching in our stores. In March, we announced the Verismo system by Starbucks, a premium single-cup category innovation. Verismo enables consumers to craft both Starbucks' quality espresso beverages and brewed coffee consistently and conveniently one cup at a time from a single machine.","Through an exclusive strategic relationship with Germany-based Krueger, we will begin marketing and selling the Starbucks Verismo system and Starbucks-sourced 100% arabica coffee and milk pods this fall in our stores and in specialty retail stores as well. And also in March, we announced the expansion of our strategic relationship with Green Mountain Coffee Roasters to include the manufacturing, marketing, distribution and sales of Starbucks-branded Vue packs for use in Green Mountain's recently introduced Krueger -- I'm sorry, Keurig Vue Brewer.","At Starbucks, coffee remains at the center of everything we do. Starbucks Blonde Roast, together with Starbucks VIA, Starbucks K-Cup portion packs, Vue and now Starbucks Verismo demonstrates our commitment to absolutely lead the premium coffee category globally. From espresso to specialty roast and ground coffee to the rapidly emerging $8 billion premium single-serve market, our commitment is to deliver Starbucks quality coffee to our customers wherever, whenever and however they wish to enjoy them.","In March, we also announced plans for a global launch of a new beverage platform, Starbucks Refreshers, making Starbucks the first to bring natural energy from green coffee extract to consumers on a global scale. Refreshers will be viewed globally as the handcrafted beverage in our stores later this summer, and ready-to-drink Refreshers is currently available in 50,000 outlets and will grow to over 100,000 outlets in the U.S. alone, literally creating millions of additional impressions for the Starbucks brand, further enhancing our Blueprint for Growth.","Our commitment to innovation is impacting in a very meaningful way how we approach both our new store openings as well as store remodels. In Q2, we opened 50 net new company-operated stores around the world built to achieve LEED certification standards and with a commitment to local relevance in the local community. And we are on plan to open 1,000 net new stores globally and to remodel approximately 1,700 company-operated stores in the U.S. by the end of the year. Our shareholders are already realizing very favorable incremental returns on the investments in the remodels and new stores.","A few words on how the decisions we make are being informed by our Blueprint for Profitable Growth business strategy. Last year, we acquired Evolution Fresh, a fantastic company and brand with great people that is providing us with an exciting opportunity to revolutionize the $3.4 billion premium cold frappe to juice category. Last month, we introduced consumers to a unique premium juice and healthy food experience with the opening of our first Evolution Fresh retail store in Bellevue, Washington. Customer response to the store has been very positive, and we are incorporating the early learnings from the first store into plans for future retail expansion.","But there is much more to the Evolution health story. Drawing upon and leveraging Starbucks' unique merchandising and marketing expertise, we have transformed the look and feel of the Evolution Fresh packaging to more fully and effectively communicate the pure wholesome ingredients found in each nutritious and delicious Evolution Fresh juice. Consumers have embraced the new packaging, and consistent with the Blueprint, have already begun making Evolution Fresh bottle juices available in grocery stores in the West Coast and in our Seattle area of Starbucks retail stores. Customer response to the introduction of Evolution Fresh juices in each of these channels has been quite strong. In Starbucks retail stores alone, early results are pointing to a doubling of units sold as compared to the products Evolution Fresh juices are replacing.","We will be employing all facets of the Blueprint to make Evolution Fresh the success we know it will be. Our U.S. retail store footprint, our social and digital media expertise, our Starbucks loyalty card program, our growing Channel Development muscle, and our more than 100,000 U.S. store partners to promote trial and awareness of Evolution Fresh juices in our stores. We plan to have Evolution Fresh beverages available across the Starbucks U.S. retail store system this summer and to leverage our new CPG distribution capabilities and roll out Evolution Fresh into multiple CPG channels over the next 18 months. We are extremely encouraged by the channel partner and customer response to the Evolution Fresh brand and platform and are more convinced than ever that Evolution Fresh will become another billion-dollar Starbucks brand.","Today, innovation and a laser focus on leveraging our social and digital media capabilities and delivering best-in-class products and a materially enhanced customer experience is part of Starbucks' DNA at every level of the organization and around the world. We are connecting more deeply and interacting more often with more customers than ever before in our history. ","Starbucks business and the Starbucks brand have never been stronger, and we are both uniquely and ideally positioned to go after the enormous opportunity that lies ahead as we execute against our Blueprint for Profitable Growth in a disciplined and deliberate fashion all around the world.","On a personal level, I cannot be more excited, enthusiastic or optimistic about our future, and I thank the over 200,000 Starbucks partners who bring the Starbucks Experience to life every day.","I'll now turn the call over to Troy.","Troy Alstead","Thanks, Howard, and good afternoon, everyone. You can see based on Howard's remarks why we are so optimistic about what the future holds for Starbucks, and why we have communicated such aspirational growth targets for this year and beyond.","But before I move to that, I'd like to take you through our fiscal second quarter results. Today, we reported second quarter records for revenues, operating income and earnings per share. We continue to drive strong incremental traffic despite lapping significant comp growth from the past 2 years, and we continue to offset uncontrollable headwinds, particularly the struggling global economy and high coffee costs with operational efficiencies and innovation.","Our second quarter consolidated net revenues were $3.2 billion, up 15% from $2.8 billion a year ago. Revenue increase was primarily driven by a 7% increase in global comparable store sales, attributable to a 6% increase in traffic and a 1% increase in average ticket. Higher channel development revenues and solid gains in our licensed stores also contributed to the global revenue increase.","Operating income for the second quarter reached $430 million, a 14% increase over last year's second quarter. Consolidated operating margin was 13.5%, which was equal to the second quarter of last year. Higher commodity costs, primarily coffee, had a negative impact on operating income of $64 million and added 200 basis points of pressure on operating margin. Primarily offsetting this was increased sales leverage throughout much of the P&L, driven by our strong top line results.","Our consolidated G&A spend for the second quarter was 6.5% of net revenue, flat for the second quarter of last year. 3\/4 of our total $207 million expense in G&A in Q2 are presented in our financial statements in other, and as a percentage of total net revenues, declined slightly over the second quarter of last year. This was largely made up of support expenses such as IT, marketing, finance, partner resources and other global functions.","This quarter also included investment to launch our Evolution Fresh brand. The remaining 1\/4 of our G&A expenses lie within each business segment, and our expense is directly related to the support of those businesses. Our total business unit G&A as a percentage of total net revenue increased slightly over last Q2, due largely to growth in our Channel Development segment as we ramp up support of this high-growth business.","Earnings per share grew 18% to $0.40 for the second quarter, which included approximately $0.02 from the income benefit of a court ruling related to recognition of unredeemed stored value cards. You will see this reflected in the Interest Income and Other line. Finally, we continue to generate strong cash flow to fund capital expenditures and growth initiatives while returning capital to shareholders.","Let me now discuss our Americas business, which continued its excellent performance in the second quarter. Net revenues of $2.4 billion were 10% higher than the second quarter of last year, driven by strong comps of 8%. Comp transactions grew 7%, which despite still cautious consumer spending, was positively impacted by continued operational excellence in our stores, accelerating the benefit of the My Starbucks Rewards program, further success with our warming program and incremental visits due to the launch of Blonde Roast coffee.","Speaking of Blonde Roast, one of the highlights in the Americas in the second quarter was its launch on January 10 in the U.S. and on February 7 in Canada. Blonde Roast has been well received by both partners and customers. As we expected, we are seeing new customer occasions from our brewed coffee drinkers as they now have an offering to satisfy their desire for something lighter in addition to their usual visits. And whole bean sales in our stores have also increased, with 70% of Blonde Roast whole bean in-store purchases being incremental to previous purchasing patterns. It is still very early, but all these signs are encouraging for the future contribution of this great new offering.","Operating income also grew by 10% in the quarter, and we saw a slight improvement in operating margin despite the negative 150 basis point impact of higher commodity costs, mostly coffee. Store operating expenses as a percentage of company-operated store revenue were up slightly year-over-year. This is due to increased marketing expenses in support of the Blonde Roast launch and increased bank fees related to debit card transactions stemming from recent legislation.","We have talked a great deal about our success in driving efficiency in our stores and the resulting improvements to our margins. Our store operating expenses in the Americas has improved 380 basis points from 2009 to the first half of this year. We continue to relentlessly pursue opportunities for further efficiencies. We're also actively analyzing opportunities to invest in operating expenses such our labor and marketing spend to further drive the top and bottom lines.","Looking forward, the pipeline of new offerings in our stores remains robust. We've already begun adding Evolution Fresh bottled juices in our Seattle area stores, and we'll expand to additional cities throughout the year. In July, we will add Refreshers ready-to-drink and handcrafted beverages, and in the coming months, we will begin selling Starbucks K-Cups in our retail stores to meet our customer's in-home brewing needs.","Outside the U.S., we're seeing solid comps and margin improvement in Canada as we're leveraging the learnings from the U.S. in the past few years. And in Latin America, the markets continue to perform well with strong comp growth in a long runway for additional stores. In fact, our comp growth in Brazil is outpacing our expectations, which is evidence that our stores and brand continues to be well received.","In Europe, Middle East and Africa, the second quarter results reflect both the investments we've begun making in the transformation of the region, as well as the macroeconomic headwinds that we and others face there. While net revenues grow 14% year-over-year, the bulk of that was due to the consolidation of the Switzerland and Austrian markets. Same-store sales for our company-operated stores in the region were negative 1% for the quarter, first negative comp growth in this region since 2009.","And while we comped positively in the U.K. and France, it wasn't enough to offset softness in Germany and Ireland. We are not immune from the high unemployment and fragile consumer confidence across the region, but just as in the U.S. 3 years ago, we're actively working to overcome those challenges.","In March, our EMEA time launched what we are calling the Renaissance Plan, our blueprint for turning around performance in that important region, which is modeled after the success of our transformation agenda in the U.S. Already, our efforts are resonating with customers. In the second quarter, we saw the largest quarterly gain in our customer satisfaction scores in more than 2 years. We're sharpening our focus on in-store execution, including taking the steps to retrain all partners on preparing the perfect beverage each and every time. We're also adapting our approach to become more locally relevant, including adjusting the U.K. tall latte standard to include 2 shots of espresso, offering a second varietal of espresso to meet French customer needs and personalizing each experience by writing customers' names on cups. ","Adjustments are being made to the long-term business model, including revamping our distribution model in the U.K. and increasing visibility to our strong digital marketing capabilities. These changes were largely the result of extensive customer research in the region and are a beginning step in the long road of correcting our course there.","EMEA saw an operating loss of $5.5 million in the second quarter, higher implementation costs as we work through the transition to what will be a much more efficient distribution model in the U.K. contributed to the loss. Additionally, we lost leverage in our store opening expenses in parts of Europe due to softer sales, and our G&A grew to support the new vision for the region.","The turnaround story in EMEA will be told over many chapters in the coming quarters and years. With our deep capabilities and sharpened disciplined honed over the past few years, we are confident the story will have an ending that is familiar to those who watch the U.S. turnaround unfold.","Howard spoke to the positive momentum we're experiencing in China and Asia Pacific, and we're seeing that momentum flow through to the P&L. Net revenues in this region increased 32% over the second quarter of last year, driven by a balanced equation of new stores and same-store sales growth. 18% comps in our company-operated markets were comprised of a 14% increase in transactions and 4% increase in average ticket. Combined with the 18% comp growth last Q2, this puts our 2-year comps at 36% and is evidence of how much the brand is gaining consistent traction with consumers across Asia. Including our joint venture and license markets, all 12 countries in the region comped positively, driven by growing brand awareness and acceptance throughout the region, coupled with beverage, food and merchandise offerings linked to cultural events like the Chinese New Year.","Speaking of China, we once again saw comps exceed 20% in the second quarter. The Starbucks brand is resonating with the Chinese consumer, and we are in the early stages of building a very loyal base. In fact, we celebrated our one-year anniversary of the My Starbucks Rewards program in China in Q2, and we already have more than 0.5 million members across a base of 330 company-operated stores.","Operating income in Cap [ph] was also strong, increasing 59% to $70 million in the second quarter. Operating margin grew 650 basis points to 39.8% despite higher commodity costs of approximately 140 basis points. This quarter's results also were impacted by the favorable timing of income for certain of our joint venture operations, which we do not expect to occur in the future.","Our team is continuing to do an excellent job of flowing our growing revenue through to the bottom line despite continued inflationary pressure in key Asian markets like China.","I'm going to move now to results from our Channel Development business. As a reminder, the name of the segment changed from Consumer Products Group or CPG but still represents the same business. The second fiscal quarter was an active one, as we marked the one-year anniversary of the transition of our packaged coffee business to a direct distribution model, rolled out several new products including Blonde Roast Coffee and Refreshers ready-to-drink beverages and announced even more innovative products that will be available later this year.","Our IRI-syndicated data revealed strong performance for many of our channels in the second quarter, and the most recent numbers show trends that are improving further. For the 4-week period ended April 15, Starbucks' dollar share of premium coffee continued to increase with packaged coffee sales and food, drug and mass channels, up more than 17% over the prior year. This was aided by Blonde Roast, whose distribution reached more than 50% ACV in less than 3 months and hit 90% ACV in our Tier 1 accounts.","The strong customer response we've seen in Blonde Roast Coffee, both in the grocery aisle and on retail stores, has given us another proof point that the product innovation and go-to-market strategies we put in place are working as intended.","In the premium single cup market, Starbucks has rapidly grown from no presence in the segment to a 21% share in just 2.5 years, driven by the continued growth of Starbucks VIA Ready Brew and the recent strong launch of Starbucks K-Cups. VIA sales were up 54% in the most recent 4-week period as we increased both SKU count and distribution. And K-Cups continued to see gains with the 15% share of the premium single cup market and more than 230 million cups shipped since their launch 5 months ago.","We also recently announced the introduction of our Verismo premium single-cup brewing system, which will be available this fall and will allow users to make both Starbucks quality of special beverages and brewed coffee at home. The addition of the Verismo system to our portfolio and product offerings once again demonstrates our commitment to provide our customers with premium coffee whenever, wherever and however they like it. We're also demonstrating product innovation in our ready-to-drink product line as we are now one month into the launch of Starbucks Refreshers in the CPG channels, a line of naturally flavored drinks made from real fruit juice and green coffee extract.","The results of our Channel Development business was strong once again, with total net revenues of $322 million in Q2, an increase of 57% over the same period last year. The addition of Starbucks K-Cups accounted for more than half of the increase, with the transition of the packaged coffee business in-house among other drivers of the revenue growth. ","Channel Development operating income for the quarter was $82 million, a 22% increase over the same quarter last year. Operating margin of 25.4% was as expected, 740 basis points lower than the same quarter last year. Higher commodity costs once again had a significant impact in the second quarter, accounting for 620 basis points of margin deterioration. As we enter the second half of fiscal 2012, we remain solidly on track with our plans for the Channel Development business and are focused on executing against the diverse opportunities for growth we have in our portfolio.","Now that we're halfway through fiscal 2012, I'd like to provide an updated outlook for the year. Given the strength of the first half of the year, revenue percentage growth over last year is now expected to be in the low teens. Due to the fact that we have now lapped the transition to a direct distribution model for our packaged coffee business, our balance of year trends will be modestly lower than the first half.","We expect company-operated comparable store sales to grow at a mid-single-digit pace. We continue to expect operating margin to grow by 50 to 100 basis points over our FY '11 non-GAAP results, driven by a second half uptick in margins due to easing commodity cost pressure. We continue to expect the Americas segment to improve slightly over last year's 20%. We now expect EMEA, while remaining profitable for the full year, to decline compared to last year due to the current economic climate in many of our markets there and due to our continued investment to support our turnaround efforts. We're now targeting CAP to end the year with operating margin of approximately 30% to 35%, recognizing the consistently strong results this region continues to deliver. And finally, we're targeting Channel Development operating margin in approximately 25%, down from prior years due largely to higher commodity costs.","As we have generated considerable momentum in our business, we're raising our expectations for earnings per share growth for the second half of fiscal 2012 to a range of 25% to 29% over last year's second half, excluding non-routine gains. For the third quarter, we're targeting EPS in the range of $0.45 to $0.46; and for the fourth quarter, we're targeting EPS in the range of $0.46 to $0.48. Our full year EPS target range is now $1.81 to $1.84, representing 19% to 21% growth over the $1.52 EPS in FY '11 excluding last year's non-routine gains.","The expected impact of higher commodity costs in FY '12 remains unchanged from what I previously guided, approximately $230 million. We anticipate an approximately $0.06 unfavorable impact to EPS for the second half of the year. While I will give targets for the next fiscal year, 2013, during our third quarter earnings call, I do want to give you a look at what we're expecting for next year as a result of declining coffee prices. We're now approximately 11 months price-protected for fiscal 2013 at prices favorable to 2012. This should equate to an operating income tailwind somewhat higher than $100 million. It's important to note that we expect to reinvest at least half and perhaps more of this commodity upside back into the business. We're looking to further build infrastructure to accelerate growth in China, we'll continue investment into the transformation of Europe and as we did in New Orleans in October of 2008, we're holding a global leadership conference this October in Houston that is expected to cost between $35 million and $40 million.","Moving on to store counts. Given the strength of our business and new store performance, we are increasing our new store target to approximately 1,000 net new stores globally. We're accelerating new store growth in the Americas, now expected to add approximately 500 net new stores and also accelerating in CAP, which allowed approximately 400 net new stores. We had no change to our EMEA estimate of 100 net new stores as we're largely focused on the improvement in our existing assets in that region.","The new store growth and a record number of renovations will drive capital expenditures of approximately $900 million in FY '12. We continue to expect the tax rate of approximately 33% for the year, and marketing is still expected at 3.5% of revenues, with increases in each quarter versus the prior year.","The second quarter just ended reflects the fundamental health and relevance of the Starbucks brand, the continued strong trends of the Starbucks business and our ability to drive growth in the top and the bottom lines. The quarter underscores our financial discipline, deep capabilities and unwavering commitment to overcome the challenges we face in the business from the economic crisis in the U.S. beginning in 2008 to the unprecedented commodity costs of the past 2 years and now to the macroeconomic turmoil in Europe. ","The quarter demonstrates our deep commitment to the core coffee category, including introduction of Blonde Roast to provide existing and new customers a new way to experience Starbucks coffee and to provide the company access to a greater share of the overall coffee category. The quarter deepens our leadership in the premium single-cup segment, with a continued strong growth of VIA, the rapid acceleration of Starbucks K-Cups, the expanded partnership with Keurig on the Vue platform and the announcement of Starbucks Verismo.","The quarter reflects our ability and commitment to drive growth in the current quarter and year, while also investing in the business and in focused innovation to plant the seeds of growth in China, in single-serve, in Blonde, in Evolution Fresh and in Refreshers, that will produce growth in revenues and profitability for years to come. And the quarter just ended once again demonstrates the passion and talent and dedication of our Starbucks partners all around the world.","With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to the operator for Q&A. Mike?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Keith Siegner from Credit Suisse.","Keith Siegner - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just one quick question on one of the opportunities that we've talked about a little bit in the past. And Howard, you said coffee is at the center of everything you do. But to some extent, so is tea, and it continues to feel like a little bit of an untapped opportunity. And I know there's a new individual kind of in charge of tea. And I was just wondering if you have any thoughts about maybe what is the opportunity in tea, how should we think about that, and how are you approaching that opportunity either the rest of this year or into next year?","Howard D. Schultz","Thank you for the question, Keith. Let's level set [ph]. First off, Tazo, within the Starbucks family currently represents on its own $1 billion business in terms of its brand position, in terms of revenue from our store base and in CPG. The acquisition of Evolution is not only to expand and explore the opportunities within juice. But when I talked about this publicly, we spoke about the significant interest and the study we've done around health and wellness. Obviously, we think that the medicinal qualities and the efficacy of tea will play a very large role in the overall category of health and wellness at Starbucks. Today is not the day to talk specifically about Tazo and our future plans, but I can tell you that we recognize the unique opportunities we have with Tazo in multiple channels of distribution as part of our health and wellness initiative, and there'll be more about that in the months and quarters ahead.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe from JPMorgan.","John W. Ivankoe - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I just wanted to get a sense of timing of what's happening in EMEA. The transformational agenda in the U.S. obviously bore fruit very, very quickly, and it included some of your very substantial reorganization of the way that the overall division was managed. So I guess the question is how far along are you in the process, kind of deciding what you want to do in Europe, with being a smaller business but a more profitable business? I mean, I guess to some extent, that was the case in the U.S., be a possibility at least in the short term, and I think in the press release, you talked about new regional strategic initiatives. Is that the type of thing that's already at its peak in the P&L right now, or we could expect margins to increase or might they even get worse in the near term as you continue to invest and figure out what you want to do there?","Howard D. Schultz","John, this is Howard. First off, let's split off EMEA into 2 parts, the Western Europe and the Middle East. The Middle East market for Starbucks, in which we have hundreds of stores in the Gulf, is quite healthy, and we continue to feel very bullish about that part of the equation. With regard to Western Europe, let me walk you through what we've done in anticipation of the transformation of that business. First off, one of our most senior and most experienced executives and operators, who is at our side co-authoring the U.S. transformation is Michelle Gass. She has moved to become the President of that region, and she's living in the U.K. In addition to that, the largest company-owned market within that region is the U.K., and we've also moved one of our strongest retail operators from the U.S., Kris Engskov [ph], who is managing the U.K. business reporting to Michelle. I think we -- in a sense, we've seen this movie before, and I'm proud to say it had a very good and positive ending in terms of what we were able to do in the U.S. I think there are many similarities in terms of the downturn in the economy and consumer confidence. And I think that we all feel quite optimistic over the long term that we're going to be able to not only turn this business around, but it's going to be a profitable market for Starbucks. Having said that, the situation is very, very tough and it's not one Europe. The situation in Greece, the situation in Portugal, the situation in Spain, I can go on and on, and then just this morning, we wake up to the news of an announcement of a double-dip recession in Great Britain. So what we've said early on within the U.S. transformation is that we were not going to use the economy as an excuse for our inability to transform and succeed in that market, and we're not using it internally as well. But we can't ignore the headwinds. But I think the short version is that we have put in place a strategic plan that we feel is going to address the issues at hand, in many ways takes a lot of the proven successes we had in the U.S. with Michelle in the lead, and she is getting all the support and resources from the corporation. We also think that we should invest into the market in terms of innovation and be very strategic in how we're going to grow the market. But the short version here is that it's going to take a while. We are cautiously optimistic and we think over the long term, we will succeed in this market, but it's -- this is not going to happen overnight.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Greg Badishkanian from Citigroup.","Gregory R. Badishkanian - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just wondering maybe if you could talk a little bit about potential weather impact in the quarter in the U.S. and maybe how same-store sales trended or throughout the quarter or by geographic region or some other color based on that.","Howard D. Schultz","In all due respect, we do not allow weather to enter the equation of Starbucks comp store sales internally, and we're certainly not going to allow it to enter the conversation publicly. We are going to succeed in good and bad weather. I don't think the weather had any significant impact on comps. I think that 8% comps in the U.S. business on the backdrop of the economic issues is a stunning number. And to be honest with you, I was a little bit surprised to see some of your reactions in terms of disappointment.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Glass from Morgan Stanley.","John S. Glass - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","The Channel Development category has a number of moving pieces. I think you've actually added several even this past quarter and so it's very difficult, I think, to track it. So 2 questions, one is general and one is more specific. Generally, Troy or whoever would like to take this, could you sketch out maybe the next few quarters if there are major milestones in which pieces of these businesses should drop in? Or if you want to maybe just more generally talk about what you think the revenue from the Channel Development category ought to grow over, say, the next 4 quarters? That's the general one. And specific to that in the K-Cup business, it looks like the 230 million that you shipped in 5 months is a slight deceleration from the previous comments like on a monthly basis. I'm not sure if there's channel loading or that -- not. Can you talk about what the revenue associated with that was specifically? And I think before you said $0.03 to $0.05 accretion, this year, is that still the right way to look at that?","Troy Alstead","John, let me start with part of the answer, and then I'm going to turn it over Jeff Hansberry to take more of it. First of all, we have all along said we anticipate a $0.03 to $0.05 of incremental profit impact this year from Starbucks K-Cups, and then a quarter ago I said we expected, given the rapid acceleration and great customer response to that product launch, that we expected the top end of that range and that's still what we expect at this point in time for this year, given the launch as it's progressing throughout the year, right near the top end of that incremental impact is what we would expect. Now certainly, as we move into 2013 and with greater distribution, continued growth and velocity and at that point in time presence in the Starbucks stores we'd certainly expect an additional increment in 2013, and that's something will talk about a bit later. Channel Development continues to be our fastest revenue growing business, and I would expect that to continue to be true as we face the quarters and years ahead for quite some time. There's one mechanical element that everyone should remember, which is we have just as of one month ago lapped the point in time a year ago where we've brought into our P&L and onto our revenue line the packaged coffee revenues as we brought that business back in-house. And so that the consolidation impact will go away from this point forward, so there's a little bit of a trend difference that simply happens as a result of that accounting. But beyond that, Channel Development is progressing rapidly as a bright spot for us, and I'll ask Jeff to address more specifically some elements of his business.","Jeffery J. Hansberry","Thanks, Troy. Hi, John. So with regard to K-Cup, we actually shipped more K-Cups in the second quarter than we did in the first. We're very pleased with the progress that we're making on K-Cup and in fact, in the last 4 weeks versus the 4 weeks prior to that, we actually grew share by 210 basis points. So we're continuing to see a very solid ramp in our share growth. We're now getting to the point where we've got distribution built out -- actually continuing to build some additional distribution. We are now turning on our marketing and merchandising efforts. So we expect our K-Cup business to continue to grow going forward.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Jason West from Deutsche Bank.","Jason West - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just a -- I have question on the coffee side. You gave a number, Troy, of about $100 million incremental benefit on the commodity. That's a little bit lower than we might have thought, given how far coffee prices have come down. So can you talk a little bit about if -- I'm assuming the average for fiscal '13 is quite a bit above where the current price is on coffee. And could you talk about the outlook for pricing in the retail stores in light of lower prices on coffee.","Troy Alstead","Thanks, Jason. Yes, what we expect now is that, firstly [ph] we're past the peak of the year-over-year impact, negative impact on our P&L. The peak of that was really the first quarter. The second quarter also included quite an increment of extra expense due to commodities. And that will ease as we go through the balance of this year. There's still some incremental costs, but it will get a bit easier for us. We are now price protected about 11 months of our needs of fiscal 2013, while there's still some open position that it could impact cost for that year. That has given us fairly good visibility now into what that increment looks like. And that's what led to that estimate of at least $100 million benefit to our P&L next year. Now to your point, yes, our average cost in 2013 is higher than where the cost is traded on the open market today. And that's because, as we have said all along, we've been buying throughout this market and buying on the way down. And part of that is about giving us access to and ensuring the supply of the best coffee in the world. That's always our top priority when we're buying coffee. And the second priority is we're moving risk from the P&L and managing that long-term coffee exposure that has led us to that strategy of buying throughout and buying long. That also suggest to me that if coffee prices remain where they are today, I would expect tailwinds in 2013 as I mentioned earlier. And again, it remain where they are today. And that's not a prediction. I don't have that kind of crystal ball. But if they did, that would also suggest better coffee prices for us coming in 2014. So we see the light at the end of the tunnel on commodities, and we're looking forward to that turning around for us on the P&L.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Michael Kelter from Goldman Sachs.","Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I wanted to ask about the unit development. You raised your guidance to 1,000 units, which was up a lot from last year's 100 or 200. Where do we go from here? For the Americas, for example, is that a stable number, 500, or is that the start of a ramp back up? And when you look beyond that to Asia and emerging markets more broadly, it looks like that's wide open to you. How quickly do you plan to ramp that up over the next several years, and what's the limiter?","Howard D. Schultz","Michael, it's Howard. I can't give you a specific number, but let me just share with you what kind of goes into our thinking in terms of the future. A few things. One is that we're quite encouraged that in the U.S., the stores that we've opened over the last 12 months and then in the last 24 are performing extraordinarily well in terms of a class of stores. And in many ways, as good as any new class we've seen in a decade. So any thought of saturation or inability to find quality real estate and continue to expand in the U.S. or for that matter, North America should be taken off the table. I think we're quite encouraged with what's going on in the Americas on a macro level in markets like Brazil. And we touched on that earlier in our prepared comments, we have less than 100 stores in Brazil, and we're seeing very, very strong sales results, and we're going to accelerate under Cliff's leadership the number of stores we can open in Brazil, and in addition to that, places like Argentina and others. We just had a meeting with our Mexican partner, and he feels very strongly that he too can accelerate his growth. And then you get to Asia and China, and we didn't speak specifically about India. But the prospect of having thousands of stores in China alone is no longer a statement that we don't -- it's not a dream. This is a reality. We are -- we've turned the corner in terms of the iconic nature of the brand, the position, the leadership team. And we feel very strongly that we're going to be able to do that effectively. And then John and his team are getting ready to open up India with really the #1 partner in that nation, which is Tata, and we should have great results there. So net-net, I can't envision in the coming years that we would open up less stores than we've just announced and feel very good about the teams that are in place and the trends that are in place. And having just returned from China last week, which was just an extraordinary trip, eye-opener for all of us, I think we are on the cutting edge of becoming really one of the most admired Western brands to enter China in a very long time.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sara Senatore from Sanford Bernstein.","Sara H. Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I want to go back to Europe, understanding that Middle East and I think that Eastern Europe probably are, as well, are pretty strong for you. Is there anything -- the one thing -- the one distinction between Western Europe and the U.S. a couple of years ago is that you're such a dominant brand and retailer in the U.S., whereas in Europe, it feels like maybe it's a little bit more competitive. So can you just talk broadly about that market and whether or not structurally, there are differences there that might make it harder for you to get margins up? And likewise, whether or not it says anything about how competitive maybe the consumer products market is, given that my sense was that the Krueger partnership would be particularly well-suited to Europe.","Howard D. Schultz","I mean, thank you for the question. That's Cliff who was the resident U.K. person with that around the table and used to run that region for us. So Cliff, you want to take that?","Clifford Burrows","Yes, I'd like to take it. Thank you, Sara, for the opportunity. I think all the things you said about the dominant position we've had here and the competition in Europe is very, very true, and the economy across each of the markets we're all too well aware of. In each of the markets now, we have very strong leaders. And we, through Michelle, have a very strong president. And we know what we need to do there, and I believe that the team are equipped to do that. And making local -- ourselves locally relevant, whether that's the strength of the coffee in the U.K., or the varietals in France, the fruit assortments in each of those markets, is really the key to this because as you say, very competitive. We focused totally and very intensely on the U.S., Michelle was my business partner at that time as we focused market-by-market here in the U.S. And now that segment tends to come to vary [ph] in Europe, and it is going to have to be country-by-country to beat local competition. And sometimes, that is national chains and sometimes that is very local players. But I think they are very well equipped to do it. And I would just make a comment, having been in the U.K. recently, that places like London are still thriving because of global money and just the strength of those economies. When you get outside of the main cities, it is quite depressing at the moment with streets upon streets of shops with for sale and closure signs, which I think just goes to show how deep that recession is in the U.K. And they are going to do hard work but they're well equipped to do it. I'm absolutely confident that the relevance of the Starbucks proposition from the quality of the coffee to the third place to the people bringing it to the customer, they'll have a great experience, and we will win in each of those markets over time.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Palmer from UBS.","David Palmer - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I too have a question on Europe. I know you have a long-term goal of reaching mid-teens margins in that division, and you're talking about certain investments that you're making in this year. Is the thought that some of these bigger margin improvements towards these ultimate goals can really begin in earnest in fiscal '13? And separately, as we think about your business, oftentimes, McDonald's will talk about things that it can do almost a Plan B from its own marketing when things get tough to stabilize sales, maybe give up a little bit on the margin but also create a little bit of a floor on sales. Is there a Plan B for Starbucks when things get tough? Are there things that you can do to help your business in Europe?","Troy Alstead","Let me at least take the first part of that question. And I would just say that the investments we're making in Europe are very much about addressing the critical issue we face in the consumer environment at this point in time. And what we're seeing is a very quick response to that. Our consumer -- customer satisfaction scores improved more meaningfully in the second quarter in the U.K. than they had in years. So we know that reaction is already happening. I would expect that the payback would produce and come over time. And I would also react a little bit to your words of the goal of mid-teen margins in Europe. We don't have a goal. We actually have a plan to get to mid-teen margins. We have a vision toward the elements and how that margin march will happen over a period of time, including improvement in top line through our engagement with customers, a disciplined focus on the middle of the P&L as a part of that effort, improvement in the overall infrastructure, supply chain, G&A and otherwise over time. So we have a very well-thought through plan that we are as confident as ever. What we can't control and predict it so much is the macro environment but needless to say, our plan A is approaching investments in Europe both from customer side, the P&L side and the infrastructure side remains the same and I think you'll see us approach that consistently from here forward.","Howard D. Schultz","Let me add one thing. I think many of you were around 3 years ago, 4 years ago on conference calls just like this when the headlines around Starbucks and the inability of us potentially to navigate through the financial crisis and, to be honest, some self-induced mistakes. I don't know how many of you would honestly say today that you thought that we would be able to not only transform the business but in fact, produce record revenue and record profits. I will tell you unequivocally, and you can hold us to this, that we will turn the European business around in the same way that we turned the U.S. business around. I can't tell you when and I can't tell you with specificity what the margins are going to be but we will emerge as the leader in Europe the same way we emerged as the constant leader in the U.S. The advantage that we have going forward in Europe versus the U.S. is that we have fantastic JV partners in many of these markets, who will understand consumer behavior based on living in those markets, have the leverage and the understanding of how to navigate through the storm, they've seen it before. We also have less of a store base so the problem is not as big. And then lastly, we are looking for ways to leverage licensed partners in very unique types of real estate. For example, we just opened in train stations in France with a license partner, and we are opportunistically looking at ways to offset the burden on the P&L that we have today with many of the company-owned stores based on license opportunities that we have not yet taken advantage of. The one thing we learned in the U.S. that if we would've known, we would've invested heavily ahead of the problem, which we did not do. And so we're confident we will turn this around, and we're going to be opportunistic about our abilities and when we come out of this, we're in a stronger position. But please, I don't want anyone to leave this phone call with any feeling whatsoever about the lack of confidence that we have as a management team, with Michelle and Kris [ph] in that region, that we will absolutely turn the situation in Europe around despite the significant headwinds that we are facing.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sharon Zackfia from William Blair.","Sharon Zackfia - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","I'm going to shift back to the Americas, and the comp obviously was very strong and has been very strong for quite a while. And Troy, when we saw you recently, the day part still seemed like it was relatively skewed to the morning as it has been forever. So I'm just curious on throughput in the morning, what you're seeing there? Obviously, there's continued improvement getting those lines to move faster. How much faster we can go, kind of where the ceiling is on the morning?","Clifford Burrows","Sharon, this is Cliff. Let me just set up the day for you because you're absolutely right, morning remains our strongest period, and we continue to see increased transactions in the morning. But I'm delighted to say we are seeing growth in all day parts, and that is very encouraging because we are focused on building capacity in the morning to deal with the increasing customers coming through. At the same time, as you know, we've worked with our food programs to stretch some of those other day parts whether it's bistro boxes in a lunch program or Cake Pops in the more afternoon treat. And as you know we're trying a few things to lengthen the day and for the evening. And I have to say very encouraged by all of those. Since time, the work we started 3 years ago, 4 years ago now with lean and improving our efficiencies so that we can get people through more quickly while paying much more personal attention to them, we have -- still have considerable runway. And although we're achieving really record transactions every day on our New York stores, we are confident we can continue to do that. So we'll grow our transactions, I'm confident, and we'll continue to focus on food attach for all day parts. So we have a lot of runway ahead of us.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog from Wells Fargo.","Bonnie Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I wanted to ask a question about your packaged coffee business. And just in terms of what you're seeing, I guess what appears to be moderating pricing yet faster volume growth. What are the drivers of this? And then do you think you're achieving the right balance here between pricing and then volume growth for this business?","Howard D. Schultz","Jeff?","Jeffery J. Hansberry","Bonnie, it's Jeff Hansberry. We think that we are, and we have seen recent continued share growth in the Starbucks packaged coffee brand. And that coming through Q2, it's very significant and important for us at this milestone quarter as we cycle through our first full year of a direct model, and at the same time moved into Starbucks Blonde Roast, which represents an opportunity for us to better serve a broader segment of coffee customers outside of our retail stores, where we're seeing growth driven by not only the introduction of Blonde Roast but also we have grown share by over 100 basis points during the quarter -- during a period when we faced a significant competitive launch by the Gevalia brand. So we feel like we're striking the right balance, maintaining loyalty with our current customers and bringing new customers to the Starbucks franchise while maintaining and defending our premium position.","JoAnn DeGrande","So that concludes our call today.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Starbucks Coffee Company\u2019s Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2014 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Thank you. Ms. DeGrande, you may begin your conference.","JoAnn DeGrande","Thank you, Mike. Good afternoon. This is JoAnn DeGrande, Vice President of Investor Relations for Starbucks Coffee Company. Joining me on the call today to discuss our second quarter results are Howard Schultz, Chairman, President and CEO; Troy Alstead, COO; and Scott Maw, CFO. Also joining us for Q&A are Cliff Burrows, Group President, U.S. and Americas; John Culver, Group President, China, Asia Pacific and Channel Development; and Adam Brotman, Chief Digital Officer.","This conference call will include forward-looking statements, which are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements. Any such statements should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements in our earnings release and risk factor discussions in our filings with the SEC, including our last Annual Report on Form 10-K. Starbucks assumes no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements or information.","This conference call is being webcast, and an archive of the webcast will be available on our website at investor.starbucks.com.","Before I turn the call over to Howard, I would like to announce the date of our next biennial analyst conference. That would be December 4 of this year. And although we are in the early planning stages and we\u2019ll not be formally sending out invitations soon, it is important to note that we will be hosting this event in our home market, Seattle. We hope you\u2019ll be able to join us for the first conference in Seattle since 2006.","I would now like to turn the call over to Howard Schultz. Howard?","Howard Schultz","Thank you, JoAnn, and welcome to everyone on today\u2019s call. I\u2019m very pleased to comment on the record second quarter results that Starbucks announced today, and to provide detail around several exciting new initiatives we have underway.","Q1\u2019s momentum continued in Q2 with each of our retail segments around the world contributing positively to global comps for sales increase of 6% representing our 17th consecutive quarter of comp growth of 5% or greater and record Q2 revenues of $2.9 billion.","Particularly noteworthy was a 7% comp increase delivered by our China and Asia Pacific segment, and 6% comp increase delivered by our EMEA segment. The strongest comp growth in EMEA in 14 quarters. EMEA\u2019s performance in Q2 provides powerful evidence of the success of our continuing efforts to transform that important region, where we currently operate 2,065 stores and to position EMEA to resume delivering revenue growth and operating profitable new stores fulfilling the commitment we made on prior calls.","Record revenues combined with reduced operating costs to drive 130 basis point increase in consolidated operating margins to 16.6% enabling us to deliver an 18.4% or $100 million increase in operating income to $644 million and a 17% increase in earnings per share, after excluding last year\u2019s non-recurring gain to a Q2 record of $0.56 per share.","In January, I shared with you our new senior leadership organizational structure. Central to the new structure is Troy Alstead\u2019s promotion to Chief Operating Officer. Today, Troy is focused on day to day execution and operational excellence across Starbucks business, providing me with the additional time to focus on driving faster and profitable growth and go over to more disruptive innovation across our company in around the world.","I\u2019ll provide you with a preview of what to expect from us in the quarters ahead and then turn the call over to Troy and Scott Maw, our new CFO to take you through our Q2 operating and financial results in detail.","Over the last several years, we have further honed our best-in-class retail site selections, store development and design and construction expertise. That\u2019s evidence of that fact is the tremendous success of our new store class. Sales to investment ratios of over 2 to 1. Return on investment in excess of 50% and first year average unit volumes of over $1.2 million, all while delivering an enhanced experience to our customers.","Several years ago, we saw an opportunity to reinvent the traditional QSR drive-through format. And as a result, our new class of drive-through stores are providing Starbucks with a unique ability to the increasing numbers of our customers on the go. Highly profitable drive-through represent a significant growth opportunity for us and continue to remain a focal point of our store development efforts. And with this tremendous success of our recently introduced award winning design drive-through only stores with walk-up windows, we are leveraging our drive-through store portfolio to provide further incrementality and add new runway for growth at a strategically complementary to our high profile urban street front locations.","Despite currently operating over 20,000 Starbucks stores in 64 countries, our research clearly demonstrates that Starbucks still accounts for very small share of total global coffee occasions and that we are significantly under-stored in many markets, including North America, China, Brazil and India, today our fastest growing international markets.","Over the months and quarters ahead, you will see us execute against the disciplined, highly targeted retail store development and rollout programs.","Turning to coffee and tea. Coffee will always be at our core and we are making significant investments across our business, including building our supply chain capabilities and elevating an operating standards to ensure that we continue to innovate and provide global thought leadership and undisputed authority of coffee quality sourcing and roasting.","At the same time as we have previously mentioned, we recently purchased our first operating coffee farm in Costa Rica and opened our seventh agronomy and farmer support center, this one in Ethiopia.","As I said in the past, tea is the most consumed beverage on earth behind water, and represents a $90 billion global category that we strongly believe is right to innovation and it represents an enormous global opportunity to Starbucks. And we are seizing that opportunity with Teavana. Teavana\u2019s sources and offers consumed as the highest quality of state teas available anywhere in the world.","By summer, Starbucks customers will be able to sample and experience the whole range of Teavana branded handcrafted tea beverages loose-leaf teas and tea merchandize inside their local Starbucks store. At the same time, we are putting a whole power of Starbucks digital, mobile, social and rewards programs against all the assets we have against the Teavana brand, affording us the unique ability to target and connect with consumers, providing us with an unparallel competitive advantage in the marketplace.","Following the opening of our Teavana Tea Bars in New York and Seattle, we\u2019ll be expanding the concept to Chicago, Los Angeles and additional locations in New York City in the months ahead. And that does not nearly all. Last month, we announced one-of-a-kind partnership with Oprah Winfrey. And starting this time in Tuesday supported by a comprehensive national advertising and marketing campaign, specially blended Teavana Oprah Chai will be available in Starbucks and Teavana stores across the U.S. and Canada, enabling us to further leverage and elevate Teavana brand.","Importantly for every Teavana Oprah Chai tea beverage or product sold, the donation will be made to the Oprah Winfrey Leadership Academy Foundation to benefit educational opportunities for youth, a program we at Starbucks could not be more excited about supporting.","In the months and quarters ahead, you will see firsthand of Starbucks will disruptive tea categories in ways large and small that will be reminiscence of how we change the coffee category. At the same time as we extend our coffee leadership and authority all over the world.","Customized beverage innovation continues to be a core strength of our company, and an area of a great interest to our customers. We have a fantastic line up of cold, refreshing beverages ready for our customers as the warm weather arrives, with many markets experiencing Fizzio, Starbucks\u2019 new platform of handcrafted cold carbonated beverages for the very first time.","Last summer, we\u2019ve tested Fizzio in select markets in the U.S. and Asia. And following the overwhelming success of those tests, we will be rolling Fizzio out to 3,000 stores across the U.S. sunbelt, in Singapore, Korea and several cities in China this summer. We are launching the Fizzio brand with three fantastic flavors, Ginger Ale, Spiced Root Beer and Lemon Ale. We\u2019ll be adding additional locally relevant flavors as the summer progresses.","Fizzio combines the healthy all natural, preservative-free alternatives to sugar filled sodas with a theater of a custom handcrafted beverage that I am convinced will be a big hit with consumers and drive traffic and incrementality during the key afternoon daypart, just as it did in the test markets last summer.","Last quarter, we called your attention to a seismic shift in consumer behavior and migration from bricks and mortar retailing to the web and e-commerce. While many retailers including many food and beverage QSRs continue to grapple with on how to navigate these shifts, Starbucks\u2019 record Q2 results unequivocally demonstrates of the investments we began making years ago to create the world\u2019s premier portfolio of digital, social and mobile technology assets are paying off and in a very big way.","Our integrated gift card, loyalty, social and mobile platform is bar none the largest and most successful in the world. Consider these metrics. Today, the Starbucks Card program is available in 28 countries. Card transactions now account for over one-third of all transactions in the U.S. and Canada stores. Over 10 million Starbucks customers are actively using our mobile app, twice the number from only a year ago, and mobile payments now account for over 14% of tender in our company-operated stores in U.S. and Canada, rising 75% from just a year ago.","Over eight million active My Starbucks Rewards members are earning rewards in the form of stars with purchases, representing 25% of all transactions in our U.S. company-operated stores. And our first of its kind cross-channel Stars Down the Aisle program has awarded more than five million stars to customers purchasing packaged coffee at U.S. grocery stores since the program debuted last July, demonstrating the value and the early stage opportunity of what we are calling stars as currency.","Together, our best-in-class card, loyalty and mobile apps has enabled us to deepen our connection to our customers and create further separation from competitors. More than that, we believe that to be successful today, a pure play bricks and mortar consumer retailer must create a high degree of mobile, social and digital engagement, and develop a seamless relationship with customers.","We further believe that accelerating global adoption of smartphones and mobile technologies in general will continue to transform and evolve the retail landscape in areas of payment, loyalty and consumer experiences in years to come and ways of just a year ago, we probably could not conceive of.","Today, as the retail industry\u2019s unquestioned leader in mobile payment and mobile loyalty, we are uniquely positioned to leverage our digital leadership and to both, develop and monetize new platforms, revenue streams and opportunities for growth in ways that will be highly complementary to our existing core business and our customer base. By way of example, major tech companies and retailers have recently begun inquiring about whether or not Starbucks would be willing to license and\/or white label our technology and mobile platforms.","We are taking a very thoughtful and disciplined approach as we consider these overtones in what we believe will ultimately prove to be a very significant additional driver of long-term shareholder value. You\u2019ll be hearing much more about our plans around mobile, digital and royalty in the months and quarters ahead.","Let me close by underscoring that despite our size and scope, the Starbucks brand and business is still in the very early stages of its growth and development. The day to day management that our senior leadership team is providing the organization is framing up to the lead the company into and through the tremendously exciting next phase of breakthrough innovation and acceleration.","Mobile growth lies ahead in ways that possibly you probably could not believe just a few years ago. And I strongly believe unequivocally that there has never been a better and more exciting time to be a Starbucks partner.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Troy.","Troy Alstead","Thank you, Howard, and good afternoon, everyone. Our record second quarter was the outcome of a continued strong effort of each of our four reported segments. Our business remains extremely healthy and poised for continued growth with all retail regions growing revenue at rates faster than the industry and the channel development business just beginning at top line acceleration.","I\u2019ll spend the next few minutes discussing the performance of these businesses. Then, I\u2019ll turn it over to Scott for a discussion of our consolidated results, segment margins and our outlook for the balance of the year.","Let me start with the Americas segment, which delivered another quarter of solid results in a persistently difficult retail environment. Total net revenues in the Americas grew to $2.8 billion in Q2, up 8% over the prior year. The largest driver of our revenue increase was the strong comp growth of 6%, with 3% coming from ticket growth and increased traffic contributing 2%.","Encouragingly, both traffic and ticket growth accelerated throughout the quarter. This combined with a healthy pipeline of innovation ready to get our stores into Q3, gives us great optimism for the back half of the year.","One key component for our momentum is food. With food attached to only about one-third of U.S. transactions, elevating our food programs to the level of our coffee excellence represents both a top priority and significant business opportunity for us and we\u2019re making great headway.","La Boulange has significantly improved the quality of our bakery offerings, and now in 6,000 U.S. company-operated stores and another 2,500 licensed stores is driving results as well, up in the food category contribute two points of comp growth in the second quarter. We continue to make enhancements throughout the line up, and as a result as we expand to new cities and leverage the operational earnings from those before, we see stronger results after launch.","We remain on track to complete the bakery rollout across all U.S. company-operated stores before the end of September. And thanks to the strong results that demanded from our licensees, we will complete the rollout across all U.S. licensed stores this year as well. As is our successful breakfast sandwich offerings which we launched nationwide in March 4 and have already lifted sales of those products by nearly 50%.","As our bakery rollout completes, we\u2019ll turn our attention to food and another dayparts including lunch. We have significantly advanced our lunch program of bistro boxes, paninis and salads over the past few years, but there is a much larger price here and we\u2019re ready to go after it. We began testing different lunch options and are narrowing our focus to the best performance best on the results thus far.","To ensure we have the right products rolling to our customers and to the dayparts and to ensure strong execution when we\u2019re ready to roll out the new lunch program, we will deliberately do the test with a strong purpose. And as we rollout our enhanced lunch program next year, complemented by a diverse beverage line up including Teavana tea and handcrafted sodas, we absolutely believe Starbucks grows across the U.S. will increasingly be seen as a destination for quick, delicious and high-quality lunch.","Now let me wrap up this discussion of food by saying very clearly that food is a huge opportunity and future growth driver, and we are already seeing very clear and tangible success as we roll the program throughout our stores. Specifically food was the single largest incremental driver of comp growth in the second quarter, and food attaches clearly and consistently higher after the launch of La Boulange in the market.","Most importantly, we\u2019re delighting our customers in new ways with amazing food and we\u2019ll continue to elevate the food experiences across all dayparts. Speaking of dayparts, I will now talk briefly about what is becoming another opportunity for us going forward and that is our Evenings program.","We have tested the Evenings program for the past few years in selected stores across several markets with great results. The Evenings food offerings combined with beverages including wine and beer, drive a meaningful increase in sales during that time of the day, which has opened up to us an entirely new opportunity to provide great experiences to our customers and to drive incremental sales and profitability to the stores.","Based on these results, we are no longer testing Evenings. We\u2019re now moving forward with the rollout of the program in a disciplined way over multiple years. Ultimately I would expect certainly greater than 1,000 stores across the U.S. to have an Evenings offering.","Our average ticket grew 3% in Q2 as I mentioned food was a driver, as was favorable beverage mix and pricing. Both limited time and new core beverage offerings continue to resonate with our customers. Our winter and spring promotion featured Caramel Flan, which delivered growth even over last year\u2019s tremendously successful Vanilla Spice promotion. And the introduction of Vanilla Macchiato was very low received, delivering incremental transactions at a higher price point.","Additionally, we\u2019re just beginning to leverage our vast My Starbucks Rewards member base to deliver meaningful marketing and promotions to the right person at the right time. While the absolute number of offers we\u2019re sending is increasing, each one is going to smaller, more precisely segmented sets of members. The effectiveness is that our members receive offers relevant to them and want to take advantage of, as our membership base and our intelligence in this area grows, this will be an important tool to increase customer frequency and improve already strong retention.","We continue to be pleased with the growth of our licensed stores in the Americas as well. We drove double-digit revenue growth in our Americas licensed store business, fueled by strong comp growth in grocery stores as well as our Latin America markets.","Moving now to EMEA where our momentum continues to build with each quarter. Q2 was outstanding in every way, in what is our seasonally softest quarter, revenue growth at its highest rate in two years, comp growth at its highest rate in three years and profitability more than tripling over last Q2.","Revenue growth in the EMEA of 13% to $310 million was a function of favorable foreign currency exchange, strong comp growth and strong license store growth. Comp growth of 6% was driven by 5% less than transactions and 1% rise in average ticket. And we continue to show strong improvement across the region, especially in the U.K. where a deep focus on operational excellence continues and results are very evident especially during the morning peak.","The improved product line up is also contributed, bolstered by the now complete upgrade of the breakfast program. The shift to higher quality offerings as well as the addition of certain healthier options has been well received, and certainly a continually improving economic climate in the U.K. is also contributing.","As good as our company-operated growth was in EMEA in Q2, licensed store growth was even stronger. The Middle East continues to outperform the comp growth in double-digits, while excellent results continued from Russia and Turkey among others. The strong performance in these markets supports our licensed focus of growth strategy in the region, were today nearly 60% of our stores are licensed, up nearly 5 percentage points from just a year ago.","In China and Asia Pacific, the continuity of high margin growth fuels our long-term aspirations to this dynamic region. CAP total net revenues grew 24% to $265 million in Q2. This is the 14th consecutive quarter of revenue growth in excess of 20%. In fact in 2010, the first year we recorded CAP as a separate region, revenues totaled only $410 million. Now in 2014, we are well on our way to exceeding $1 billion in annual revenue.","It is an impressive growth trajectory for a tremendous market and a testament to the passion of our partners throughout Asia to deliver a fantastic startup experience day-in and day-out. Our future in CAP remains extremely bright. The largest driver of our Q2 revenue growth was from new stores, which totaled 174 net in the quarter to nearly 700 for the past 12 months.","These new stores are delivering outstanding first year sales and generating strong first year profitability. And the welcoming sophisticated new store designs are enhancing our already strong brand reputation in the region, and trying to trial new customers.","Our existing stores are also driving delivering 7% comp growth in Q2, all as a result of increased traffic. This included a sharp decline in comp growth in Thailand where the impact on the consumer from political instability weighed on the previously strong traffic trends. China grew even faster than the region evolved and accelerated over the first quarter, with low balance contributions from seasonal promotions, core beverages, tea and food.","Finally, let me touch on our channel development business, which again contributed nicely to our record Q2 performance and is triumphed for strong second half of fiscal \u201814. Revenues of $370 million represented 10% growth in Q2, in line with our previous guidance accelerated throughout the year.","Our diverse premium single cup portfolio was again the largest driver of revenue growth. We continue to gain share of the K-Cup market, experiencing 33% growth in dollar sales for the quarter than U.S. food, drug and mass channels. And our recently amended agreement with Keurig Green Mountain will help drive additional future growth and profitability from this platform.","We are nearing the anniversary of the May 2013 price reduction taken on packaged Coffee. Encouragingly, we reached 10% revenue growth in Q2 even with this headwind, as that pricing effect normalizes in the second half of fiscal year and as we continue to innovate in this space, we see packaged coffee as another growth driver that will sustain channel developments double-digit revenue growth.","Now, I\u2019m going to turn the call over to our new CFO, Scott Maw, to take you through consolidated results and targets for the full year. Scott?","Scott Maw","Thanks, Troy, and good afternoon, everyone. I am pleased to join you on my first quarterly earnings call as CFO. It was an outstanding quarter as our global operations continued to produce record breaking results.","We delivered comp growth in the heart of our target range. We over-delivered against our earnings per share target. We also set Q2 records for revenue, earnings, operating margin and operating cash flow. And we returned nearly $0.5 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase. At the same time, we invested back into the business including the addition of 335 net new stores globally, and by introducing La Boulange to over 3,300 U.S. company-operated and licensed stores.","It\u2019s important to note that many of our metrics were impacted by unprecedented store closures and other disruption from severe weather in the U.S. With that said, the 6% total company comp number was still very much in line with our targets. We also saw excellent balance globally in our comp growth with two regions at 6% and one at 7%. Consolidated net revenues are $3.9 billion, an increase of 9% from last year, despite unfavorable impacts from both, weather and foreign currency exchange.","Consolidated operating income grew 18% to $644 million in the second quarter, a full $100 million higher than Q2 last year. Consolidated operating margin expanded to 130 basis points to 16.6%. Importantly margins expanded in the all four reported segments. 100 basis points of commodity cost favorability coupled with strong sales leverage drove the improvement.","Taking a quick look at regional profitability, operating income in the Americas grew to $606 million, an increase of 10% over last Q2. Operating margin expanded by 50 basis points to 21.6% due primarily to favorable commodity costs. We did experience a bit of suppression to Q2 margins, due to the incremental marketing investment. However, we anticipate greater leverage to resume the second half of the year.","The combination of solid company-operated and licensed store growth is driving EMEA profitability higher as well, with operating income growing 240% over the last year to $18 million. We also drove significant expansion on operating margin, up 380 basis points to 5.7% in Q2, with improvements in every line item.","Sales leverage in line with our intense cost focus across the region, both in stores and in G&A were key drivers to the margin expansion.","Moving onto CAP. Operating income of $87 million represented strong growth of 27% over the last Q2. GAAP operating margin expanded 80 basis points to 32.8% as we were able to successfully offset the unfavorable margin impact of the portfolio mix shift towards company-operated stores through leverage on strong sales. And our joint venture partnerships continue to thrive with particular strength in South Korea and in East China driving 21% growth in JV income in Q2.","And flow-through for channel development in Q2 was exceptional, as we leveraged 10% revenue growth in the 35% profit growth to $127 million. This was aided by another solid quarter from our North America coffee partnerships, primarily due to strong sales of bottled Frappuccino and iced coffee. Operating margin of 34.4% was a 660 basis point improvement over the last year.","The largest driver of this improvement was favorable coffee cost contributing 510 basis points, sales leveraging cost efficiencies also contributed to the margin expansion.","With regard to our other segments, revenue of $119 million was down slightly from last Q2. We saw continued growth from our newer emerging business, including Teavana and Evolution Fresh. However these are more than offset by lower revenue from Seattle\u2019s Best Coffee as we lapped significant inventory sales for new account activity last Q2.","Our operating loss in all other segments expanded slightly in the second quarter to $8 million due to investment in our emerging businesses. Adding in all that, our robust global revenue growth and margin expansion drove earnings per share to the Q2 record at $0.56.","Finally, a quick comment on liquidity. In addition to amounts available under our credit facility, we had $1.2 billion of cash and cash equivalents at the end of the quarter. Q2 operating cash flow was $418 million, up 37% from last year, driven by strong business unit performance in ongoing working capital efficiencies.","Now that we\u2019re half way through fiscal 2014, I\u2019ll provide an updated outlook for the back half of the year. With the over-delivery on EPS in Q2, we are now targeting full year fiscal 2014 EPS in the range of $2.62 to $2.68. That represents very strong 20% to 22% growth over fiscal \u201813 when excluding last year\u2019s non-recurring gains due to the sales of equity in Mexico, Chine and Argentina and a fourth quarter recording of the Kraft litigation charge.","Specific to the third quarter, we continue to target EPS in the range of $0.64 to $0.66. And with better visibility into our business outlook for Q4, we are now targeting EPS in the range of $0.71 to $0.75. With respect to commodities, we continue to expect a $0.09 to $0.10 EPS benefit for fiscal 2014, which is net of pricing taken in CPG last Q3 as well as investments back into our business.","Our coffee needs are virtually locked for 2014 and more than 40% locked for fiscal \u201815 at prices slightly favorable to 2014. So while coffee prices remain volatile, bouncing back up to $2 per pound this week, our strategic coffee buying practices have insulated us from an impact this year, and will allow us to continue to target strong earnings growth next year.","Consolidated operating margin for fiscal 2014 is now expected at approximately 175 to 200 basis points. We continue to expect moderate improvements in the Americas consistent with the first half of the year. In EMEA, we remain on target for operating margin reaching the high single digits as evidenced by our strong performance so far this year.","In CAP, we continue to target operating margin in the low 30% range including year-over-year margin deceleration in Q3 and Q4, as we allowed the extremely strong Japan performance of last Q3 and some non-routine items in last Q4. And in channel development, we are now targeting approximately 500 basis points of margin expansion in fiscal \u201814 driven largely by a lower coffee costs and leverage on revenue growth.","Due to a lower than anticipated tax rate in the first half of the year, we are taking our full year tax rate target down slightly to 34%. All other targets remain unchanged including revenue growth of 10% or greater, strong global comparable store sales growth in the mid single digits, 1,500 net new stores globally and capital expenditures totaling approximately $1.2 billion.","Halfway into fiscal 2014, we are extremely pleased with where our business stands. The first half of the year was challenging with a soft holiday period, unprecedented winter weather and political instability in a number of our global markets. However, our customers, our partners and our brands had been extraordinary resilient.","Through these challenges, we have grown revenue by more than 10%. We\u2019ve grown earnings 20% and we\u2019ve expanded operating margin 200 basis points. Our business model is built to adapt. It was built to scale. And it was built to deliver results even in the most challenging periods. It has done that. And as we look to the second half of this year and beyond, we are extremely well positioned to benefit from investments in our people and our stores and in innovation to continue to deliver world class shareholder value.","With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to the operator for Q&A. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","(Operator Instructions) In order to allow as many of you as possible the opportunity to ask questions, we ask you please limit yourself to one question only at a time. We will come back to you for follow-up questions as time allows. We will pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster. Your first question comes from Sara Senatore, Sanford Bernstein.","Sara Senatore \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","Thank you very much. I just wanted to ask a quick question about comments that Howard made about being under-stored in the U.S., and I guess \u2013 or North America. I would say very high cyclical with such strong comps, but one of the things that I\u2019ve noticed as you did step-up unit growth over the past year and asking transactions start to trend a little bit lower. So maybe I\u2019m off here and maybe it\u2019s particularly weather and ex-weather, your traffic would have been in the 4% to 5% range. But is there any reason to be concerned that maybe stepping up the unit growth, there is some cannibalization impacts that happens? Thank you.","Howard Schultz","Thank you for the question. I wouldn\u2019t isolate any quarter or any period, whether it\u2019s been any slight downturn traffic as any indication of a slowing or a lesser opportunity than we strongly believe we have. We\u2019ve done a fair amount of research this year with regard to the share of coffee occasions that we have, as well as looking at the density of our stores in relationship to revenue and share. And I can tell you that there is a strong indication and we have a significant upside in the U.S. and in Canada.","Also I think we\u2019ve done a very good job over the last 12 to 18 months in creating store designs that are linked to real estate segmentation, which gives us the ability to almost create any configuration now in terms of size and the kind of real estate it is. And as I indicated in my comments, this new drive-through opportunities that we think we have, both in the traditional sense and in these walk-up drive-throughs and drive-through only are very, very unique and proving to be a very strong economic model.","And I think playing off Troy\u2019s comments, you\u2019re so much upside we believe in the incrementality of creating new dayparts, fulfilling the needs that customers have other than the peak morning period. And as a result of that, we can put Starbuck stores in areas that previously we probably thought would not the kind of stores that we would have gone after because they were morning daypart driven.","And so I think we\u2019ve got significant upside. And I also want to say one of the things very quickly. This is not 2007 when we\u2019re going to grow the company in an undisciplined way. The disciplined and thoughtfulness around our real estate strategy, both coupled with the qualitative nature of design and the quantitative analysis that we\u2019re putting these decisions through are very, very strong and very disciplined, but we do believe \u2013 ensure that we have a significant level of runway domestically and in Canada.","Sara Senatore \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","And so just to follow-up, you can maintain the traffic that we\u2019ve seen so strong with this additional growth?","Howard Schultz","Well, I don\u2019t see any reason in the near-term that we can\u2019t have mid single-digits in our company in terms of comp growth and a significant portion of that over time will be transactional.","Sara Senatore \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Palmer, RBC Capital Markets.","David Palmer \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Hi, and congratulations on the quarter. You said in the opening remarks, that you\u2019re starting to leverage My Starbucks Rewards with more directive marketing, which I found interesting. Could you expand on how you might be evolving your marketing and what the impacts that will have? And relatedly, is it possible that you\u2019ll be making alliances with retailers to find ways to share loyalty programs and perhaps spread this targeted approach across channels to get these benefits to the channel development segment? Thank you.","Howard Schultz","Thanks David. Adam Brotman, our Chief Digital Officer is here. Let\u2019s have him answer that question.","Adam Brotman","Sure. Well on the first part David, we are seeing an increasing amount of ability for us to learn what is really relevant for our customers, because of the data that we have from their card and loyalty purchases. So that is driving our ability to drive incremental revenue in our core business through personalized offers and use more relevant communications in general.","And then as far as your second part of your question, we are indeed seeing the expansion of stars as currency, Stars Down the Aisle, as Howard mentioned and as Troy mentioned. And that\u2019s something that we are going to continue to build on. So we make sure we\u2019ve had nearly five millions stars redeemed already. We continue to see better results we expected in terms of Stars Down the Aisle and we plan on continuing that.","Troy Alstead","So I\u2019ll just quote something Howard said in his remarks and Adam just alluded to that it\u2019s important to recognize this. We are in a very, very early stages of building out this entire digital program, understanding how to connect with customers across multiple channels through the loyalty program, the experiences they have in stores and with the power of the stars that we\u2019re already seeing. We\u2019re already seeing and still at early days as that translates down the aisle. Very early days, so much more to come ahead of us.","David Palmer \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Tarantino, Robert W. Baird.","David Tarantino \u2013 Robert W. Baird","Hi good afternoon, and congratulations as well. I wanted to ask about the traffic trends in the Americas segment, being up 2% this quarter. And I know you\u2019ve referenced weather several times, and I think Troy, you mentioned that the traffic accelerated as the quarter progressed, which seems to mirror the weather impact. But maybe you could just talk about the context of that number and what do you think maybe the underlying trends might have been outside of the weather impact?","Troy Alstead","David, let me start that and I\u2019ll have Cliff Burrows give you some expansion on it. First of all, as we said there is no question it was in acute extreme weather quarter, and of course that is underlying our performance. I don\u2019t \u2013 we\u2019re not going to put a number on what things would have been without, but it was \u2013 in terms of the quarters we measured on our history, we had more stores closed and more disruption to opening hours than we never experienced before since we\u2019ve kept track of things.","So a very few quarter, with that said we currently see more ecstatic. We delivered 6% comp growth in that kind of environment. And I think that speaks to the power of brand, what our food programs doing, loyalty is driving customers. The experiences we\u2019re providing every day. All of those things are way of help us overcome \u2013 what everybody else out there is experiencing is flat to negative growth as a result of weather, it\u2019s allowed to deliver 6% comp growth.","We did see an acceleration as I mentioned throughout the quarter. Again not to comment specifically on what it would have been with or without, but a very, very strong results overall and something we\u2019re very pleased with. I mean perhaps Cliff can add some more texture.","Cliff Burrows","Yes, I\u2019m not sure was it was a great deal to triumph [ph] just beside what really played in the quarter. Not only did it disrupt our lives in our operations, the extreme weather, but it also disrupted the lives of our customers. And they changed their routines, they changed their habits. We will see overtime I am sure the balance particularly in transaction change, that was said by Harold earlier. If we look forward, we are confident that we can maintain that mid single-digit comp growth and the balance of taken transaction will change I am sure from quarter-to-quarter.","Howard Schultz","As we sit here heading into spring and summer, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve had this strong of a pipeline of product that we think is, really I think on target for what our customers are expecting for us in terms of beverage innovation. And I think we\u2019re all hoping that we\u2019re going to get a very unique level of response given the power of Oprah Winfrey.","David Tarantino \u2013 Robert W. Baird","Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Glass, Morgan Stanley.","John Glass \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Thanks. Scott, I know you said that coffee is still volatile etcetera and you\u2019ve locked some in \u201815, but if you had to lock it in today around these prices, what kind of headwind do you think you\u2019d propose us to \u201815? And perhaps more importantly, I think earlier in the quarter, you talked informally about some offsets you think you can have and the number varies. What are those if you involved your thinking about how big those offset cost opportunities are?","Scott Maw","Yes. We haven\u2019t really quantified, because it depends on so many things. It depends on where the market is, how much pricing we knew between now and then. Can I say calculated at any point in time, but given where we are today and the fact that pricing over the last couple of months, we haven\u2019t been pricing a lot of coffee. Because of the length of our position both for this year and next year, we didn\u2019t have the luxury of find, if you will, to see how things allow in Brazil.","To second part of your question and be more specific, when we look at various scenarios, when doing the calculations, we know that up and down the P&L there are all sorts of things we can do to offset taking a look at investments we made, taking a look at our cost structure. And those are things we\u2019d do if we need to, as things get more clear on the coffee price side.","The thing to remember is that coffee is only about 15% to 20% of our COGS and occupancy line on the P&L. It\u2019s less than 10% of our total operating cost. And so just sort of scale that gives us a quite a bit of flexibility on things we could do.","Howard Schultz","And John, I\u2019ll perhaps underscore some of what Scott said well, and the step-up a bit and look at this in a historical context. We have over a lot of years faced these kind of movements consistently time after time. The last time just being a few years ago. And it\u2019s important to remember that during all those times, we delivered very strong earnings growth and margin expansion.","In fact, over-delivered in our earnings range during the period of that difficult coffee cost prices, just a few years ago. So my point being that, number one, we are as protected as I think anybody and more so than most with respect to forward pricing in contracts. We have long relationships with our farmers, and we have every confidence in delivering our ability to continue to manage what happened in the marketplace. And we also have increase discipline and capability around managing the P&L as Scott has referred to. It gives us every ability to continue to deliver great comp growth, almost despite what will happen in the broader coffee markets.","John Glass \u2013 Morgan Stanley","That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Sharon Zackfia of William Blair.","Sharon Zackfia \u2013 William Blair","Hi good afternoon. Howard, you made some interesting comments about licensing of the technology. And being a consumer analyst and not a technology analyst, I\u2019m just curious as you think about it as a company, what would be the potential risks if you\u2019re licensing out your technology?","Howard Schultz","Let\u2019s go back to what I said, so there is no misunderstanding. We\u2019ve been approached by tech companies and national retailers as to whether or not we would consider licensing or white-labeling the Starbucks\u2019 mobile platform. I think you have to ask yourself, why are they asking us to do this? We have such a significant lead. There isn\u2019t a company that we can identify that is processing anything close to a million transactions a week, and we\u2019re now way over five million. Most of the national retailers did not invest ahead of the growth curve. They do not have the capability in-house at this point to really execute this and to fully understand it.","Tech companies themselves obviously have the tech background and the insight that they do not have the interface on the physical side with the consumer to execute it. So we are in a very unique position having kind of saw, chicken and egg problem of both, the digital technology and obviously the interface with the consumer.","I think we don\u2019t look at it as a risk, we look at it clearly as a very significant upside. And the question we\u2019re asking ourselves and we\u2019re asking it through a very positive lens is we strongly believe that there is an opportunity in creating a monetization here that will be very complementary to the core business, and in a way it could add a flywheel effect of exposing more people to the Starbucks platform.","We have not made the decision as to what we will do, but I can share with you that we are actively pursuing a number of conversations because we probably strongly believe that one is a title wave of consumer adoption and smartphones and mobile commerce, and we are in the sweet spot of being in a position to take advantage of that in a very unique fashion. And I should say domestically and internationally, don\u2019t forget we are doing this now in over 20 countries.","Operator","Your next question comes from Joe Buckley, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Joe Buckley \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. Can I just hear you talk a bit about the channel development segment and the opportunities, both in the U.S. and internationally over the next year or so?","Howard Schultz","Sure Joe. Thanks for that question. We\u2019ll have John Culver, Group President of China and Asia Pacific, but also Channel Development, speak to that.","John Culver","Yes. Thanks a lot, Joe. Obviously we\u2019re very excited on the quarter performance of double-digit revenue growth of 10%, operating income growing to 35% and margin expansion of over 600 basis points. So momentum in the business continues to grow, and particularly as it relates to our K-Cup execution. For the quarter, K-Cups grew 33% on the quarter versus a category growth of about 28%.","And we finished the quarter with the highest share ever since we launched K-Cups. So really strong momentum in that business. And with the new agreement with Keurig, we\u2019re in much better position to add skews, as well as to accelerate the growth Down the Aisle as it relates to K-Cups.","On the packaged coffee side, we\u2019ve also done a lot of work around innovation in that area, introducing the new package graphics as well as introducing new Blonde skews into the mix as well as adding to the Pike Place Roast expansion as well.","Stars Down the Aisle continues to be a big piece of the growth in channel development. As was previously mentioned, five million stars redeemed. And really leveraging the strategic flywheel that we\u2019re building on the digital platforms through our retail stores and driving those customers from our retail stores, Down the Aisle.","From an international perspective, we\u2019re very bullish on the opportunity internationally, particularly as it relates to ready-to-drink and the opportunity to exist there. We have strong businesses that have been built in Japan and Korea. We\u2019ve launched China earlier this year, and we continue to see very strong momentum in performance as it relates to the international business. And we are making investments in that area.","Jeff Hansberry, who recently ran channel development is now in Asia, running not only or retail business but is charged with integrating the channel business into the retail business there. So a lot of positive momentum and we\u2019re very excited about the future.","Joe Buckley \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Is the ready-to-drink opportunity a North American opportunity as well, or do you see that it as international? I mean I really [indiscernible] as I ask that.","John Culver","Yes, Joe I think it\u2019s both. I think we\u2019ve got a very strong ready-to-drink business here in the U.S. We\u2019ve got 11% share of the coffee in energy category. We grew share in the quarter 40 basis points here in the U.S. And we\u2019ve got a strong level of base business with our bottled Frappuccino or Doubleshot. And then a pipeline of innovation between, as it relates to ice coffee, as it relates to refreshers and then also our discoveries multi-served product that we\u2019ve introduced recently in the last couple of quarters.","So both domestically as well as internationally, RTD will be a big piece of the growth opportunity for the channel business overall.","Joe Buckley \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Karen Holthouse, Credit Suisse.","Karen Holthouse \u2013 Credit Suisse","Hi, congratulations on a great comp in the quarter despite all the headwinds. One of the things I think there is a huge opportunity for longer term is the lunch business. And when you look at sort of driving that lunch and afternoon daypart, has there been differences in adoption in suburban markets were having drive-throughs might add as unique sort of convenience factor to that. And then also if you\u2019ve started to do some targeted offers around it? How successful has that been and starting to drive frequency in the daypart versus the core breakfast daypart?","Cliff Burrows","Yes, Karen. It\u2019s Cliff Burrows. Thanks for the question. Obviously our focus over the last \u2013 really in last two years has been in the acquisition of La Boulange, finding this fantastic range of products and capability. And then building infrastructure to rolling out, and as we said today we\u2019re in 6,000 stores and 2,500 licensed stores. At the same time, we are starting now to really test lunch, and we will be starting the test in a significant number of stores in summer. And I would expect us to start rolling that out in 2015 and get to most of the markets during that time.","Lunch over the last couple of years, we have seen growth with our paninis, with our salads and with our sandwich range. So we know the opportunity is there, but we know we\u2019re only just beginning. What we will be doing is leveraging what we\u2019ve learned around breakfast and that in part is not only in pastries but it\u2019s what we\u2019ve done recently with breakfast sandwiches.","So that basis, plus the infrastructure around the three temperature distribution platform and freezers in the stores gives us opportunities to serve all our stores, sometimes remote markets and sometimes drive-through. One of the things been really encouraging for us is the strength of adoption and purchase of food items through the dry-through. And I think we have really cracked the code on how do we optimize the customer experience with the connection with our baristas, how do we manage a tight range of products to best serve our customers.","So you\u2019re going to see us at that range, in drive-through, you\u2019re going to see us adapt it for remote markets and you\u2019re going to see us utilize our three temperature distribution. So lots to come on that and we\u2019re excited about what the opportunities in 2015. We\u2019ve started the journey through. Delighted with the quality that we\u2019re being able to deliver, and we keep getting stronger and stronger. So, much more to come.","Karen Holthouse \u2013 Credit Suisse","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jason West, Deutsche Bank.","Jason West \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Yes, thanks. I guess just touch on that same topic a little bit. You guys mentioned, I think La Boulange added a couple of points to the comps in the quarter. I was wondering if you could kind of frame that versus what had been adding in the prior quarters. And there has been talk about some hiccups and the rollout there in some press articles about the consumer response to some of the items. If you could just kind of go over? How do you feel about the success of what you\u2019ve rolled out? Do you need to make changes in the way things have been executed whether its product or the actual rollout?","Cliff Burrows","Troy and myself are both fine to answer the question. Jason, thank you for that question. There is no doubt that the challenge that we set for ourselves to transform our food business in a very good time. We are really, really delighted with the progress. We set ourselves a two-year timeframe to roll this out across the whole of the U.S. to put in a consolidated food platform, distribution channels and transform the way we deliver food to our customers and we have learnt great deal.","One of the advantages we\u2019re having is in-house capability is we can check and adjust very, very quickly. Each rollout we\u2019ve done has got stronger than the one we\u2019ve built. The ones was that rolled out since the start of the year have been absolutely fantastic. We\u2019ve listened to the customers. Sometimes we will change the ingredients. Sometimes we will change the shape of product. In our stores next week, will be the new ingredients in a familiar form to Lemon Loaf Cake, which I think will be extremely well received, adds to that the strength in breakfast sandwich platform, where we\u2019re up a 150% and adds to that fantastic responses we\u2019ve had to the platform [ph]. We are really, really pleased and that we\u2019re building a new capability.","Troy Alstead","Thank you, Cliff. And Jason let me add just a couple of points to that. First of all, food in most recent quarters had been closer to a point or strong point of comps, so we\u2019re seeing an acceleration of the contribution from food. And remember that is coming despite the fact that food is only in three-fourths or so of the U.S. system, and we\u2019re already seeing that significant contribution. So it\u2019s very powerful. It\u2019s a huge contribution to the business. It is natural and normal in any nature or system rollout we do going back to the days when we rolled up Frappuccino to refreshers a couple of years ago. They will always do learnings and check and adjust.","And most importantly focused on what are we hearing from our customers. And if there is a place for us to respond, we\u2019ll do that. It\u2019s important to note there is nothing more than we\u2019re doing in La Boulange than we doing it rollouts historically. So frankly it\u2019s been a bit overblown what these changes or issues are.","There aren\u2019t any. In fact throughput will be at its highest level, highest historical level this year. There is absolutely no slowdown in the business. Food is an important contribution to comp growth. We expect that that tailwind from food will continue to the next year or two at least as we continue the bakery rollout and then move onto lunch.","So very significant contributions, overwhelmingly positive feedback from customers and we could be more excited about what food would mean for us in the quarters ahead.","Jason West \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Thanks helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Ivankoe, JPMorgan.","John Ivankoe \u2013 JPMorgan","Hi great. Thank you. I think I have two questions related to the same point. Store operating expenses in the Americas didn\u2019t lever in this quarter, despite the comps. So whether it\u2019s something like weather that maybe influence your ability to time, labor in the stores, or was there something unusual there that might not repeat? And secondly and maybe related to that line maybe not, when we see the use of the Starbucks card grow mobile, which is now 14%. It\u2019s growing very, very quickly. Does the consumer use of mobile allow you to be perhaps change the cost structure in the store significantly enhanced the change to the customer experience, and perhaps ways that we\u2019re not thinking as more and more consumers do use the mobile platform to interact with your store?","Scott Maw","So I\u2019ll take the first part and then I\u2019ll turn it over to Adam for the second part. This is Scott. There is a number of puts and takes in store operating expenses, but I would say that it was definitely impacted by both \u2013 for the Americas, by both weather and foreign exchange as revenue was impacted. So we did see core operating leverage excluding with.","Adam Brotman","And mobile payment is definitely helping us with both the customer experience and the store operational experience in terms of key areas such as throughput. We are taking \u2013 it\u2019s not only the fastest and easiest way to pay, we\u2019re taking reloads out of the line and giving customers more information literally at their fingertips as they\u2019re waiting in line around personalized offers, [indiscernible] and loyalties status in their star counts.","Cliff Burrows","So in terms of the longer term \u2013 John, it\u2019s Cliff, I would really see as utilizing any efficiency we get from mobile payments to focus on our customer experience. We are introducing a fantastic line up whether it\u2019s new Frappuccinos this summer, whether it\u2019s the Teavana Oprah Chai tea or whether its Fizzio later in the year. So any benefit we can get, we\u2019re going to use that opportunity to share these fantastic new products with our customers.","John Ivankoe \u2013 JPMorgan","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein, Barclays.","Jeffrey Bernstein \u2013 Barclays Capital","Great. Thank you very much. Actually just one clarification, and then a question. I\u2019ll start with the clarification. I think I\u2019ve heard in your commentary recently, I\u2019m not sure if it was from yourself or others but just specific to commodities and everyone is focusing on coffee. And I\u2019m just wondering what I\u2019ve heard to maybe dairy to be more concerning or we should be paying more attention to the dairy versus coffee. So I\u2019m wondering if you could add some color from what you are provided on coffee in terms of how you protect yourself on dairy and what mix that is and. And then my question is just the ownership structure, broadly speaking both in the U.S. and aboard. Just wondering whether are you any shifts or directionally where you guys are thinking in terms of \u2013 in the U.S., I guess a 60% company ownership. I\u2019m wondering whether you think about moving that more towards licensing and obviously you\u2019ve already done that in EMEA, but I think you mentioned that 60% licensed. We were looking back a few years, it was 40%. So just wondering is there further opportunity to take that to 80% or whether 60% is the right amount in EMEA? Thanks.","Howard Schultz","So let me have Scott take the first question related to dairy commodities and what we\u2019re doing in that space, and then I\u2019ll talk about ownership.","Scott Maw","Thanks Jeffrey. I think the first thing I\u2019d say about dairy is we do hedge dairy out about three to six months. The challenge of dairy is the market for hedging and price effective. It\u2019s just much shallower and much shorter than it is for coffee, but we do protect ourselves out in a couple of quarters. So we\u2019ve been able to manage through some of the price increases that we\u2019ve seen in dairy.","With that said, we have seen some headwind. We still \u2013 it\u2019s in that commodities cost favorability of $0.09 to $0.10, so that\u2019s all inclusive. So we\u2019re completely confident we can cover it, but we do spend a lot of time looking at ways that we can hedge and manage dairy costs.","Howard Schultz","And then with respect to global ownership, when you see each region individually, there is a somewhat varying answer. In the U.S. we\u2019ve always been predominantly company-operated. I expect we will always be predominantly company-operated for about 60% of our so stores in the U.S. owned and operated. In the coming years, we see a tremendous opportunity to continue accelerating licensed store growth. So it\u2019s likely that license stores will grow somewhat faster than do company-owned units, even though we are accelerating both within the U.S. in coming years given the opportunity that we see.","And even with that licensed store growth, we will remain still predominantly company-operated in the U.S. and with very, very strong returns both at the P&L level and also return on capital, even with that predominantly company-operated structure.","In EMEA, we began discussing and articulating the volume a year or two ago are very focused strategy to migrate more toward the license structure. And we are well in the path as I commented in my earlier remarks and we\u2019ll continue on that path. We\u2019re not at the ending point yet with the license opportunities we have. And we see opportunity at high return on capital, company-owned stores in places, but far and away our growth would be dominated by license executions in Europe. And that will continue over a long period of time to shift that ownership mix more towards license in EMEA.","And then in Asia Pacific, it\u2019s actually somewhat different. We\u2019ve been predominantly licensed going back to our earlier stage of opening in that region back in the last 90s. And we are on a progression out for shifting that mix a bit closer to company-operated particularly as we accelerate growth into China with the amazing returns and the huge opportunity we see in China. So Asia Pacific will slowly push a bit more for the company-owned overtime, although still likely remain 50\/50 or stronger for licensed for the long run.","Jeffrey Bernstein \u2013 Barclays Capital","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Diane Geissler, CLSA.","Diane Geissler \u2013 CLSA","Hello?","Howard Schultz","Hi Diane.","Diane Geissler \u2013 CLSA","I wanted to ask the role on the Evening hours moving from tests into launch. Not every store is going to be conducive to having Evening hours. Can you talk about what percentage of the store base do you think will add that daypart, and also kind of the timeframe you would envision?","Cliff Burrows","Yes, thanks Diane. It\u2019s Cliff. We have been testing Evenings about 25 stores in a number of cities across the U.S. We\u2019ve been testing in urban locations and in suburban locations. What we have seen is the wine and beer is the opportunity on the occasion for people to use our stores in a later daypart, and use it as a meeting place, use it as relaxing place, they use it for informal social groups to meet.","What we are seeing which is really positive it\u2019s not just about wine, but it is about the shareable plates of food. It is also people buying our traditional beverages, our core beverages. And that\u2019s really healthy place to be, because that\u2019s how the mood of the store evolves. We feel very, very confident. This is now \u2013 it\u2019s resonating with our customers. It gives us an opportunity to grow daypart and increase our revenues and profits in those stores.","We see as we said earlier that we can have a 1,000 or more over the next several years. We haven\u2019t got final limits in it, and we\u2019re just going to learn and grow over into, but it\u2019s extremely significant concern to the number and it is accretive to everything you do in those stores.","Howard Schultz","She was also asking about hours.","Cliff Burrows","I\u2019m not sure the hours will vary greatly, because many of our stores stay open quite late and serve the population. It just gives us \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t describe it as a peak, but it makes the stores much more alive, and we will put those hours out and adjust them as we do now. I don\u2019t see a major cost increase by spanning the hours as soon as taking more use of the hours for open.","Diane Geissler \u2013 CLSA","Okay, thank you.","Operator","The last question comes from Keith Siegner with UBS. You may ask your question.","Keith Siegner \u2013 UBS","Thank you. And a strong quarter everyone. Cliff, one more question for you. High quality, rapid customized service has always been the hallmark of the retail stores. And it used to several backs on top of just the strong underlying traffic growth, just moving to the three temperature model, as you add the La Boulange breakfast before warming and now its Fizzio and the La Boulange lunch. Could you talk that the operations hurdles of pulling this all of, and maybe tie in what\u2019s the customer feedback has built in, not about the products but about the service and is it keeping up with those standards to how are you doing? Thanks.","Cliff Burrows","Thanks Keith for the question. And really add aha in everything we do, we need to make sure we take care of the work our partners do and that they are able to be successful in the product. And we recognize the tremendous steps that we\u2019ve taken over the last 40 odd years and they continued to deliver amazing experience as far our customers. Everything we do, we are testing to make sure operationally is as simple as it can be, but it\u2019s relevant for the customer and enhances the overall experience.","There is no doubt with every new product, there is a learning curve. And we do everything we can to give the right tools, to give the right support. I do believe the work we\u2019re doing around digital, in mobile technology overtime that will help and make it much more seamless experience. Obviously as we build new stores, as we refurbish new stores, we look at ways to make it more efficient. And that journey will carry on.","When we look at Fizzio, the simplicity of making those beverages, and we are learning from the work we did with Frappuccino reinventions several years ago, just to try and make that work simple. So we\u2019re very, very consciously engaged. And one; we\u2019ve got a long line of sight to the launch of these products. Two; we are testing them. And three; we just keep checking and adjusting, involving our partners and listening to customers to make sure we check and adjust.","And I think that\u2019s the way, Keith, we feel confident and I\u2019m very aware that we will focus on the spirits and that relationship between our partner and customer is key to our success.","Keith Siegner \u2013 UBS","Thank you.","JoAnn DeGrande","Thank you, Cliff.

Joining us for Q&A are Howard Schultz, Executive Chairman; John Culver, Group President, Global Retail; Adam Brotman, EVP of Global Retail Ops; Kris Engskov, EVP, U.S. Operations; Belinda Wong, EVP and CEO, Starbucks China; and Tony Matta, President, Channel Development.","This conference call will include forward-looking statements, which are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements. Any such statements should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements in our earnings release and risk factor discussions in our filings with the SEC, including our last Annual Report on Form 10-K. Starbucks assumes no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements or information.","Please refer to the tables at the end of our earnings release and on our website at investor.starbucks.com to find a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures referenced in today's call with their corresponding GAAP measures. Also on our website, please note that we will be posting our updated financial targets following the conclusion of our prepared remarks on the call. This conference call is being webcast and an archive of the webcast will be available on our website.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Kevin Johnson. Kevin?","Kevin R. Johnson - Starbucks Corp.","Thank you, Tom, and welcome to everyone on today's call. I'm pleased to comment on the record financial and operating results that Starbucks reported today. In Q3, Starbucks grew revenues by 9%, excluding one point of foreign exchange, expanded non-GAAP operating margin by 100 basis points, and grew non-GAAP earnings per share by 14% over Q3 last year, excluding two points of FX. We also delivered 5% comp growth in the U.S., including a transaction splitting adjusted 1% increase in traffic, our strongest comp growth in the U.S. in five quarters. Another quarter of 7% comp growth in China, largely attributed to increased traffic, and 4% comp growth globally. Noteworthy is that in addition to delivering record financial and operating performance in Q3, both our retail and CPG segments also gained meaningful increases in U.S. market share, despite the softness in both sectors.","You will recall that our revenue growth in the first half of fiscal 2017 was roughly 6.5%, and our U.S. comp growth was about 3%. So, our Q3 performance reflects the back-half acceleration we've anticipated. I'm particularly pleased that our Q3 results were delivered in the face of today's rapidly unfolding retail industry disruption. Yet despite record industry-leading performance through three quarters of fiscal 2017 and a robust pipeline of food and beverage and digital innovation coming in Q4 and the quarters ahead, today's challenging retail and consumer environments, compounded by headwinds related to the retail disruption underway has us taking the slightly more cautious view as we enter Q4.","On today's call, we will discuss the drivers of our Q3 performance and update you on the progress we've made against our operational priorities, including an update from Matt Ryan, our Chief Strategy Officer, on the ground-breaking new digital capabilities that we've contributed to our comp, revenue, and profit acceleration. We will explain how each of the strategic actions we announced today will further align Starbucks company-operated and licensed markets for maximum growth and shareholder value creation, and results in the exiting of certain non-core or slow-growth operations and assets. And we will demonstrate how together, these actions will support our growth strategy by strengthening our core, sharpening our focus, and increasing our efficiency. Then Scott will speak to the financial implications of these actions. He'll take you through our Q3 financial and operating results in detail and provide an update on Q4 guidance. Then we'll turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.","Now, to set the backdrop for today's call, I refer the comments I made last quarter regarding the two critical, transformative elements required for any brick-and-mortar retailer to survive, let alone succeed in the future: an emerging digital and mobile relationship with customers that is threaded into a branded and immersive experiential retail destination. Retailers who are agile and reimagine the art of the possible will be big industry winners. Those who do not will struggle mightily. The evidence is clear that the pace of retail transformation is accelerating with a common theme: extending the in-store experiences to include relevant digital scenarios. It is the driving force behind combinations including Walmart's acquisition of Jet.com, the combination of PetSmart and Chewy.com, and last month's announcement of Amazon's intent to acquire Whole Foods. Each of these combinations demonstrate that pursuit of enhancing the physical retail experience with a relevant and complementary digital experience.","Starbucks identified the coming seismic shift in retail years before it consumed the industry. And we are well positioned because we invested ahead of the curve to extend our global leadership around all things premium coffee and tea, developed world-leading digital and mobile capabilities linked to loyalty, create experiential third-place environments, and deep authentic connections among our customers, our partners, and the communities we serve, providing an increasingly elevated and engaging Starbucks Experience. Successful execution around each of these initiatives is why, despite the powerful retail headwinds and cross-currents underway, Starbucks continues to produce record financial and operating results quarter after quarter, and open a new class of over 2,000 stores around the world every year that continue to outperform competitors and deliver industry-leading AUVs and profit, starting virtually from the day they open their doors.","Now, let me just pause here a moment and interject a thought. At the same time as we continue to internally extend and expand our own digital capabilities, we will also continue to explore commercial partnerships with third-party digital companies. Now, these partnerships, we believe, will enable us to leverage our brand, our global retail footprint, and the customer base in order to extend our reach, including into payments, loyalty and social gifting among others, just as we are doing with great success in China with Tencent.","Now, with almost 27,000 stores in 75 countries serving roughly 90 million customer visits each week, no traditional brick-and-mortar retailer is better positioned to navigate and flourish in the global retail industry of today or better positioned to lead in the digital retail world of tomorrow. And we will do so with speed, agility, and a focus on creating long-term shareholder value.","The strategic actions we announced today are fully aligned with the long-term strategy we communicated at Investor Day last December, and they will enable us to focus on the fastest growing, highest return aspects of our growth agenda. We have clear principles that guide us in determining which markets are best served as company-operated versus licensed markets. Adherence to these principles prompted us to transition the German market to long-time license partner AmRest in 2016 and to sell our 50% interest in our Taiwan JV to long-term partner Uni-President Group in a transaction we announced today.","At the same time, we will not shy away from expanding our presence in markets that evidence strong growth opportunities at scale. We entered China almost 18 years ago, and today recognized as among the most respected brands in that country; along the way, establishing relationships, relationships with millions of customers, tens of thousands of partners, and a meaningful presence in 130 communities. Starbucks' opportunity for growth in China is unparalleled and our purchase of the remaining 50% of our East China JV is a significant milestone, reflecting our long-term commitment to China and our unwavering optimism about our future in that key long-term growth market. And we are just getting started.","We also made a significant announcement related to our growing tea business. Tea is a large fast-growing category and a key addressable market and core focus for us. Since acquiring Teavana, we have built the business into a well-recognized, super-premium global brand. We expect to sell over $1.6 billion of Teavana branded, handcrafted beverages through Starbucks stores around the world this year. Overall, our tea business has grown 40% since we launched Teavana in the U.S. five years ago, and it is up over 60% since launching in China and Japan roughly one year ago.","Innovation is key, and we continue to innovate around tea, just this month introducing Teavana Infusions, a flavor platform made from real fruits and botanicals that strengthens our lineup of healthy, less indulgent, premium cold beverages. Through our partnership with Anheuser-Busch, we've extended the Teavana brand into a ready-to-drink platform that will create even greater brand awareness and fuel further growth.","We have big plans for tea in Starbucks retail and CPG globally, but as we shared with you on our last call, many of our Teavana mall-based stores have been persistently underperforming. We conducted a strategic review of the Teavana mall-based store business and concluded that despite our efforts to reverse the trend through creative merchandising and new store designs, the underperformance was likely to continue. As a result, we will be closing all 379 of our Teavana mall stores over the coming year. Scott will speak to the financial implications of this decision shortly. Each of the actions I just described is a powerful driver of value creation that will strengthen our business and enable us to focus our resources on priorities that drive outsized current returns and long-term shareholder value, supporting our strategy and sustaining profitable growth into the future.","On our last call, I outlined five operational priorities: continuing to accelerate comp sales and transaction growth in the U.S., driving breakthroughs in food for the lunch day-part, enabling long-term growth in China, extending our digital flywheel assets, elevating through our Roasteries and the Starbucks Reserve brand. Today, I'm adding a sixth: gaining share of at-home coffee down the aisle, a subject Scott will address shortly.","Now, let me comment briefly on a few of these priorities. On our last call, I outlined a broad set of initiatives focused on accelerating U.S. comp sales. We are very pleased with the progress we've made to increase throughput in our stores in the face of rapidly increasing customer usage of Mobile Order & Pay. We are unlocking incremental growth potential across all dayparts, particularly at peak, while at the same time improving the Starbucks Experience for all customers. Food plays an important role in our growth agenda, contributing 21% of our U.S. revenue in Q3. We remain focused on driving breakthroughs in food for lunch, as we create new offerings in a relevant daypart and greater choice for our customers. These objectives were behind our decision to up-level our lunch menu lineup with Mercato, our fresh food concept. Mercato is exceeding expectations in its Chicago launch market and we're moving up the launch of Mercato in the Seattle market to August.","We are extremely excited about our strategy and the opportunity to further enable long-term growth in China. Our business has never been stronger or more robust, with revenues that consistently increase over 20% annually, driving significant margin and profit growth. We continue to open roughly 500 new stores in China every year at a rate of new store growth that will accelerate over time. Our newest class of stores continue to outperform and deliver record AUVs, now nearly 700,000 per unit, and world-leading returns. In fact, given our performance and success in China and the momentum we are seeing across the country in both retail and CPG channels, we now see the opportunity for Starbucks in China being even greater than we originally thought. We are committed to a long-term growth agenda in China, executed in a respectful fashion that instills pride in our Starbucks partners and deepens our connection to our customers and the communities we serve.","The data are clear that our beautiful stores, engaging store partners, new beverage, food, and digital innovations, and our focus on operational excellence are attracting new customers into our stores in China and bringing existing customers in more often. And with the transition of East China to a company-operated model, we will meaningfully advance our China agenda by enabling our strong, local leadership team to fully leverage our infrastructure and scale economics in order to maximize the growth opportunities ahead.","And, I'm pleased to report that already 90% of our eligible China partners are taking advantage of the fully sponsored critical illness insurance for their parents, a breakthrough partner benefit we introduced in Q3. We will continue to invest in our people and are committed to remaining one of the most admired brands and an employer of choice in China. And with the opening of our Shanghai Roastery in December, we will further elevate the Starbucks brand and introduce our customers in China, as well as visitors from all across Asia, to the immersive, ultra-premium coffee-forward Starbucks Roastery experience.","Now, our digital flywheel is a powerful proprietary asset that is driving deep customer engagement, revenue, and profit growth around the world. And we're pleased with the contributions that our digital flywheel made to our business in Q3. Given the significance of the digital initiatives underway, I've asked Matt Ryan to provide you with an overview of the Q3 contribution and share some thoughts with you on the future of digital. Matt?","Matthew Ryan - Starbucks Corp.","Thank you, Kevin. Digital relationships are becoming increasingly important to Starbucks' growth, contributing both the majority of U.S. comp growth in Q3 and to our continued outperformance compared to our sector. U.S. Starbucks Rewards membership rose to 13.3 million active customers in Q3, up over 8% from last year and up 28% from two years ago. We have seen spend per member rise to record levels, up 8% over Q3 last year. Between new member acquisition and increases in spend per member, 36% of our U.S. revenues came from Starbucks Rewards members in Q3, driving the 41% of our revenues that are prepaid on our own proprietary payment platform, reflecting rapidly increasing customer adoption of our digital platforms.","At Investor Day in December, we identified our digital flywheel's four key drivers of incrementality: customer acquisition, spend-based rewards, personalized offers, and convenient ordering. The data are clear that when we acquire a new customer, the act of signing up for a digital relationship results in a sudden and sustained lift in spend, as measured by careful pre\/post tracking. That's how we're able to drive so much value from a relatively small portion of customers, 13 3 million active reward customers compared to a total of approximately 75 million unique customer visits to our stores each month. We know that even modest increases in the total universe of active customers drive tremendous long-term value and we have detailed plans in place to significantly expand our universe of digitally engaged customers and drive strong, sustainable, profitable growth into the future.","Second, Starbucks Rewards are highly motivating and the conversion to a spend-based program has resulted in a clear lift in member spend. Third, personalization, in which we target specific messages and offers to individual customers based upon their history with us, has proven highly effective, as evidenced by test and control measurements in spend per member. Fourth, mobile ordering remained highly incremental, resulting in many more occasions per customer than would be the case otherwise because the convenience encourages more on-the-go visits.","Last year, we deployed new personalization technology and a new front-end experience in our app, investments that have contributed to the measurable success in digital we are experiencing. Today, we are enabling a new generation of digital innovation that will begin rolling out in waves starting this fall. This fundamental modernization of our technology stack will replace legacy rewards and ordering functionality with the new scalable cloud-based platform for rewards and ordering, improved customer data organization, and tighter integration with store-based operating systems, including inventory and production management.","The first phase of the platform rollout will enable us to flexibly change and configure rewards programs and become more nimble in creating new benefits for customers. It will enable new features and extend and expand the program by creating the ability to award exclusive benefits to subsets of our customers. For example, to customers who sign up for the new co-branded payment products we will be launching in the U.S. with Chase. The first application of the new technology will support the rollout of Starbucks Rewards in Japan this fall, with other markets following thereafter.","The second phase of the platform rollout will include new ordering functionality. We will still require stored value accounts for customers to receive stars with every purchase, but we'll no longer require customers to use a stored value account to place an order, removing a barrier to expanding usage of Mobile Order & Pay, a service that is highly incremental to our business.","This will result in digital relationships with a new pool of customers who have Starbucks accounts and payment credentials on file, expanding the universe of customers we can target with offers and communications driven by our personalization engine. As a first step, we'll be testing a guest checkout feature for first-time users of the app early in 2018.","Over time, our new technology platform will also flexibly interface with inventory and point-of-sale systems in our company-owned stores and inventory and point of sale systems owned by our licensed partners. This new foundational technology will also enable even more convenient ways for customers to order their beverages and food, providing even more reasons for customers to set up digital relationships with us.","In addition to our long-term digital technology roadmap, we continue to innovate in the short term around our newer technology platforms. We are expanding personalization by offering new offer constructs, real-time triggers and push notifications to engage customers more deeply, building on the momentum that is generating the higher spend per member. We've also committed to increase registration into the program, taking advantage of the seasonal momentum that begins after the summer season. We are removing friction in the sign-up process, improving the digital interface and registration flow, and are in the early days of testing solutions that greatly streamline sign-up.","We're also seeing results from our efforts at personalization that far exceed our own high expectations and recognize the value extending personalization to non-Rewards customers. Our marketing teams are now building the universe of customers that opt into direct communications from us. In the future, you'll hear more about our efforts to grow not just Starbucks Rewards, but the total number of people who engage with us digitally in any fashion, as our personalization engine will help us deepen engagement with customers beyond our core loyalty customers.","New ordering capabilities also means transforming our store operations, and as part of the next generation of technology in our stores, we're adding the Digital Order Manager, or DOM, now present in roughly 1,000 of our busiest Mobile Order & Pay stores. We are also making improvements to our inventory management technology, and in the future, we'll be adding capabilities to enhance customer service, including introducing tools that enable baristas to recognize customers that deserve differentiated treatment, perhaps customers celebrating birthdays or regular customers from one store who show up at a different store.","Building digital relationships takes time and focus. We see ourselves as pioneers and leaders in building digital relationships with customers and have a proven track record of success that is unrivaled in retail. At the same time, we recognize that digital companies are trying to get into traditional retail businesses, like grocery. In our business, where the scale of our physical footprint, our customers' relationships with our partners, and the third-place experience we deliver are so critical, we have an inherent advantage that digital companies will struggle to replicate.","We're not complacent and recognize that digital relationships will increasingly be the key drivers of demand generation, even in physical stores. By leading in the combination of physical and digital, we not only drive superior business results in the short term, based on rewards, ordering, and personalization, but we also make it very challenging for digital companies to outmaneuver us in the physical world. While digital companies may win in other sectors, we will be the digital company that wins in ours. The current digital trajectory we have demonstrated is proof that we are winning today and will continue to extend our lead into the future. Kevin?","Kevin R. Johnson - Starbucks Corp.","Thank you, Matt. In addition to our digital agenda, we're also investing to elevate both our brand and our customer experience around coffee through our Roasteries and the Starbucks Reserve brand. Starbucks Roasteries are at the center of our innovation strategy around branded experiential retail customer destinations. Complementing our first Roastery in Seattle are additional Roasteries now under construction in Shanghai, New York, Milan, and Tokyo, and under development in Chicago. Our Roasteries will ultimately be complemented by Reserve bars in thousands of Starbucks locations and several hundred new Starbucks Reserve stores around the world. Roasteries and Reserve stores will delight our customers with delicious food offerings through our partnership with Italian artisanal baker, Princi.","In Q3, we continued to solidify and extend our brand and market positions and our global leadership around all things coffee and tea. While our investment in Roasteries and Reserve stores enables a world-class, ultra-premium, coffee-forward experience in flagship locations around the globe, it also establishes a core innovation center second to none that will continue to fuel innovation across the Starbucks platform.","The ongoing disruption and transformation of the retail industry is accelerating, with very few winners. With another quarter of solid global growth and record financial performance, Starbucks is a clear winner. And we will continue to win by playing the long game, all around the world. The strategic actions we announced today were developed and pressure-tested against the requirements that they strengthen our core, enable profitable growth, reduce costs and complexity, and facilitate a more tactical deployment of our capital and resources to areas where they will generate the highest returns. Each will achieve those objectives, and by doing so, contribute to our ability to continue delivering industry-leading increases in revenue and profits, and outsized returns to our shareholders.","I'll now turn the call over to Scott for a deep dive into our operating performance and financial results in Q3. Scott?","Scott Harlan Maw - Starbucks Corp.","Thank you, Kevin, and good afternoon, everyone. Starbucks once again reported record operating and financial performance in Q3, reflecting the back-half acceleration we've been anticipating. Nonetheless, as Kevin shared, despite posting record performance in Q3 and further extending our lead compared to the industry overall, the combination of trends in the quarter and ongoing macro pressures impacting the retail and restaurant sectors overall, has us a bit more cautious going into Q4. On today's call, I'll cover three topics. First, I will provide an overview of our Q3 operating and financial performance. Next, I'll provide additional context around the strategies under way to sharpen our focus and enable accelerated growth and further increases in return on capital, and finally, I will provide guidance for Q4. We will be providing our initial growth targets for fiscal 2018 on next quarter's earnings call, just as we did coming into this year.","GAAP operating income was $1 billion and non-GAAP operating income was $1.2 billion, up 15% including one point of negative FX. Operating margin totaled 18.4% on a GAAP basis and 20.8% on a non-GAAP basis, up 100 basis points year-over-year, primarily driven by sales leverage partially offset by increased partner investments in the Americas. GAAP EPS was $0.47, inclusive of impairment charges primarily related to the closure of our principally mall-based Teavana stores, a development I will discuss shortly. Excluding these and other charges, non-GAAP EPS grew 12% to $0.55 in Q3 including two points of negative impact from FX.","I'll now take you through our Q3 operating performance by segment. Americas revenue grew 10% year-over-year to $4 billion in Q3, primarily driven by 1,002 net new store openings over the past 12 months, and 5% comp growth, this segment's strongest comp performance in five quarters. Excluding the impact of order consolidation following last year's transition to the new Rewards program, America's segment transaction comp was a positive 1% in Q3. We expect Q3 of fiscal 2017 to be the last quarter reflecting any meaningful impact from order consolidation.","While we are pleased that our Americas segment delivered top-line improvement in a difficult retail and consumer environment, we did experience a softening in transaction comps as we moved through the quarter. Momentum entering the quarter, beginning with April's wildly successful introduction of the Unicorn Frappuccino was strong, but comp trends softened in the back half of the quarter, and this softness has continued into July. The slowdown included a lower than expected lift in non-discounted Frappuccino beverages following Happy Hour, as well as somewhat lower than expected sales of other core beverages during the period. Lunch was our fastest growing daypart, driven by increased customer adoption of our food lineup and better-for-you beverage options.","Peak showed sequential quarter improvement, albeit somewhat less than we had forecast, and the afternoon was pressured across several core beverage categories. Reversing this trend and increasing transactions in the U.S. remains a key priority for us and we have several initiatives supporting this priority underway, including strengthening and leverage our digital and marketing capabilities, driving food and beverage innovation, and further improving our operations and in-store execution.","Matt covered digital innovation, so I'll take food and beverage innovation and our progress on improving throughput. As we move through summer, we have a full pipeline of food and beverage innovation, including hot and cold, better for you and indulgent offerings for all dayparts. On the beverage side, our recently introduced Teavana Shaken Iced Tea Infusions, an innovative approach to delivering robust flavor in a healthy way by combining our core iced teas with the unique, freshly-steeped blends of fruits and botanicals is performing very well. So, too, are our new Iced Cascara Coconutmilk Latte and returning favorite Iced Coconutmilk Mocha Macchiato.","And within food, we have expanded our lineup of protein-forward offerings with improved Bistro Boxes and the introduction of a seared steak and egg wrap and two new varieties of lunch bowls. Clearly, our commitment to food innovation is delivering, as evidenced by the two points of comp growth from food we reported again this quarter.","Let's now turn to our throughput initiatives. You will recall that our throughput improvement is slated to come in three waves. So first, targeted improvements in labor, resulted in our introducing dedicated Mobile Order & Pay rolls during certain hours in our busiest stores and has already contributed to both improved throughput at peak and improved customer service scores. Noteworthy is that our highest volume MOP stores experienced the greatest increases in customer experience scores this quarter.","Second wave initiatives include deployment of the Digital Order Manager, a high-value, low-cost technology that is both further increasing throughput and providing us with an extremely valuable source of new data to further optimize store operations and further elevate our customer experience. The DOM contributes to an improved MOP customer experience by providing mobile notifications to customers when their order is ready and facilitating a smoother experience at the handoff point. And it improves the MOP partner experience by replacing the paper-based ticket consolidation process with a modern touch screen order consolidation tool.","Additional wave two actions include further carefully targeted investments in labor and the introduction of a new approach to beverage production and deployment that we call channel production. By creating distinct production channels utilizing current equipment and labor allocations, this new order production and deployment capability is enabling a throughput unlock in the stores where we are testing the approach. Our third wave enhancements begin rolling in October 2017 and include improved spacing and production capacity in all new and remodeled stores, new production sequencing software, and an enhanced labor scheduling platform.","In Q3, Americas operating income grew 8% and operating margin was roughly flat compared to last year. Increased investments in our U.S. store partners remained a headwind, though the Q3 impact was more muted than in prior quarters as the business lapped a significant one-time bonus paid to partners last year. In addition, the mix shift resulting from lower beverage comps combined with strong food sales put some additional pressure on gross margins again this quarter. Of our 5% U.S. comp growth in Q3, three points were driven by beverage with continued strong sales of iced beverages, including iced coffee growing 33% year-over-year, and Refreshers, including the highly successful Pink Drink, growing 57%. And for the second consecutive quarter, food delivered two points of comp, driven entirely by attach.","Let's move on to China\/Asia-Pacific. Starbucks China\/Asia-Pacific region delivered another quarter of strong performance with year-over-year revenue and operating income growth of 9% and 22%, respectively. CAP revenue of $841 million was driven largely by net new stores and comp growth of 1%, driven by an acceleration in China comps to 7%, offset by softness in Japan. As we have previously noted, CAP comps are currently more heavily weighted towards Japan, where revenue, profitability, and new store performance remained very strong. Noteworthy is that over the nearly three years since we acquired the market in Japan, it's been delivering an average of 3% quarterly comp growth, profitable new store growth, and that has accelerated, and total revenue and profit growth in Japan are running in line with our initial deal assumptions.","CAP has now reported five consecutive years of double-digit revenue and operating income growth through Q3. CAP's operating margin expanded 280 basis points to 26.6% on a GAAP basis and 270 basis points to 28.3% on a non-GAAP basis. Contributing to CAP's Q3 margin expansion was the final impact from the now fully-lapped transition to a value-added tax structure in China and a nearly 30% increase in income from our joint venture operations, including South Korea and East China.","Turning to EMEA. Our EMEA segment delivered solid results, and at 2%, its strongest comp growth in seven quarters. In Q3, led by strong performance in the U.K. System comps in the region were even higher, increasing 5% and once again validating our decision to move certain EMEA markets to a licensed model. Revenues in EMEA totaled $250 million in Q3, a 9% decline versus prior year. However, when normalized for a 16% impact of portfolio shifts and FX, EMEA revenue actually grew 7%, driven by incremental revenues from over 311 net new stores added in the last 12 months. EMEA's GAAP operating margin totaled 4% with non-GAAP operating margin at 11% after adjusting for the impact of goodwill impairment in Switzerland, roughly flat to Q3 last year, despite 130 basis points impact from FX. We will continue to focus on improving operations and shifting the mix towards licensed stores in EMEA, efforts that have contributed to EMEA delivering solid mid-single digit system sales growth and double-digit non-GAAP operating margins for 12 consecutive quarters.","Turning to Channel Development, Channel Development had a very solid Q3, delivering strong revenue growth of 9%. Starbucks K-Cup sales increased 10% in the quarter compared to 0.5% growth for the K-Cup category overall, driving our share of the K-Cup category up 1.4% to 16.6% overall and our roast and ground sales grew 8% in the quarter compared to 0.4% growth in roast and ground overall, resulting in a 1% category share gain to 13%. We will continue to focus on profitably growing share of both K-Cup and roast and ground, but expect somewhat lower top and bottom line growth in Q4 as deceleration in the categories overall has invited increased competition and discounting.","Tea is a core focus of ours and, as Kevin mentioned, we're having great success with Teavana in both Starbucks retail stores and grocery. We have already shipped over 2.5 million bottles of Teavana ready-to-drink teas in just five months with all four flavors already ranking in the top ten in the premium single-serve RTD tea category in our active markets. And we plan to launch Teavana branded packaged tea in grocery channels by the end of the fiscal 2018. Channel Development's operating income grew 12% in Q3 and the segment delivered 130-basis-point improvement in operating margin to 43.9%, driven principally by lower coffee costs and higher income from our North American Coffee Partnership with Pepsi.","Let's now shift to the strategic actions we announced today. Despite our size and scale, Starbucks remains very much a growth company. The opportunities that exist for us globally are significant and we are doubling down on our investments in key profitable growth areas, including Mainland China and digital, to further accelerate growth in the years ahead. This shift in capital deployment towards more profitable, higher returning assets will result in increased focus and be accretive to returns going forward. You could hear of additional actions as we move towards and into fiscal 2018, but let's start with details around the actions we announced today, beginning with tea.","As Kevin mentioned, today, we announced the decision to close all of our Teavana stores. As a result of this decision, we took an asset impairment and goodwill charges of approximately $100 million in Q3. The charges are specifically called out in a separate line item on our income statement where we will also include various charges related to streamlining our operations over the coming quarters. Closure of the Teavana stores will occur over the next several quarters and additional related charges are likely to be incurred over the same periods. While resulting in near-term costs, removing the ongoing operating loss and associated overhead will result in a fairly rapid payback of our exit costs.","We're also extremely excited about expanding our ownership of the Mainland China market. Funding for the estimated $1.3 billion purchase of our JV partner's remaining stake in Mainland China will come from existing offshore cash and result in no additional debt. Excluding the substantial gain we will recognize on the acquisition, amortization of acquired intangible assets, and other acquisition related expenses, we expect the transaction to be break-even to slightly accretive in the first year. We expect accretion to build over time, as we integrate the acquired operations into our existing Mainland China business.","The acquisition will add approximately $1 billion in revenue in the first year following closing. The final sales price will not be determined until our fiscal Q2 of 2018. We will provide further detail around the financial impact of this transaction when we report our Q1 FY 2018 results in January and will likely schedule a separate modeling call related to the acquisition as we did in connection with the Japan transaction in 2014.","Clearly with this acquisition, we are entering a new phase of our growth strategy in CAP and we look forward to sharing additional details about the opportunity and our progress in CAP in the quarters ahead. At the same time as we are consolidating our position in Mainland China, we are shifting our 50% JV ownership in Taiwan to a fully licensed structure in exchange for approximately $175 million. This represents the largest licensing transaction in our history and is in complete alignment with our strategy to license in markets that we have growth potential, but where returns are better served by a partner with deep local expertise.","So, let's move on to 2017 targets. We said consistently that the back half of the year would show improvement compared to the front half. That continues to be our expectation, but we now expect results a bit lower than our previous guidance, given the choppiness we saw in Q3 and are seeing in early Q4. Specifically, we now expect revenue growth to come in at the low end of our previous guidance range of 8% to 10%, excluding one point of FX and two points of impact from the 53rd week in fiscal 2016. We are also projecting global comp growth for Q4 at 3% to 4%. As a result, our EPS guidance is revised as follows: full-year GAAP EPS in the range of $1.96 to $1.97 and full year non-GAAP EPS in the range of $2.05 to $2.06, representing an EPS growth range of 12% to 13%, excluding one to two points of FX. Fourth quarter GAAP EPS will be in the range of $0.53 to $0.54 and non-GAAP EPS will be in the range of $0.54 to $0.55.","We continue to expect non-GAAP consolidating operating margins to show slight improvement compared to FY 2016 on a 52-week basis. For segment operating margins in FY 2017, we expect Americas operating margin to be moderately lower than last year, CAP operating margins to show strong expansion, EMEA operating margins to be roughly flat to 2016, excluding FX, and Channel Development to post strong operating margin improvement for the year with Q4 margins roughly flat year-over-year. Looking at commodities and FX, our coffee needs are locked for fiscal 2017 and we expect commodities to be slightly favorable for the year. We are also 70% price-locked for fiscal 2018, at coffee prices roughly comparable to 2017.","As we've discussed our goal is to grow G&A at the core at half the rate of revenue growth and we are on track to achieve this goal for the year. Specifically, G&A as recorded year-to-date fiscal 2017 was up 5%, up 10% from last year after adjusting for current and prior year anomalies of approximately five points. Core G&A, which comprises over 80% of the total, was roughly half of the 10% increase with innovation G&A comprising the other half. We remain committed to managing our core G&A growth rate while investing for the near- and long-term and, as Kevin mentioned, renewed focus on our core business will positively impact our ability to keep G&A at or below the current target.","We have significantly increased our capital returns to shareholders over the past five years with buybacks up from roughly zero in 2009 to $1.2 billion this year to date in 2017. Going forward, we will continue to accelerate cash return to shareholders, and as we announced in Investor Day, to increase our dividend payout range to 40% to 50%. We now expect to open 2,200 net new stores globally in 2017. This reflects an increase of 100 net new stores for the Americas to 900 net new stores for the year. All other targets for FY 2017 remain the same.","At the time of our last earnings call, we were seeing significant positive momentum in our principal global retail markets, particularly the U.S. However, that momentum ebbed and flowed over the quarter. The actions we have put in place are beginning to gain traction, but stiff consumer and industry headwinds remain. So, while lowering current year guidance as we enter Q4 is difficult, given the uncertainty we are seeing in the marketplace, we feel that doing so is the better part of valor and the appropriate action to take. At the same time, we know that each of the strategic actions we announced today will strengthen our core and be accretive to future returns.","Consistent with past practice, we will provide 2018 targets on our Q4 call. This allows us to complete our annual planning process and have further clarity around critical investments in 2018 and more granularity around the timing and impacts of the strategic actions we announced today. Given all of this, we will also discuss any revisions to our long-range targets on the Q4 call. Despite our size and scale, Starbucks' financial aspirations remain unchanged, to be a best-in-class growth retailer at scale. As always, credit for our success today and tomorrow belongs to our 330,000 passionate Starbucks partners around the world who deliver an authentic Starbucks Experience roughly 90 million times around the world each week. Our partners have our great respect and appreciation.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from John Ivankoe from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, thank you. The question is just broadly on the Americas business. Your comps aren't quite what you hoped they were going to be, very well documented consumer and industry issues, yet 900 net new stores in the Americas, which is a big addition. You could potentially put pressure on comps, which is what I'd like you to talk about and also difficulty in attracting or retaining labor this far into an economic cycle. So, the question is really two different things. Does it make sense to begin to think about whether that 900 net new stores in the Americas should hit a plateau or even come down over time, given challenges that may even worsen in the out years? And then secondly, if you can update us in terms of your practices of attracting and retaining partners, at this point, both for existing and new stores.","Scott Harlan Maw - Starbucks Corp.","Thanks, John, it's Scott. I'll take the first part and then I might have John Culver help me a bit with the second. The first thing I would say is our portfolio growth rate in the U.S. has stayed pretty constant over the last few years, so while the number of stores have come up, the percentage of portfolio growth has stayed pretty stable. And we're able to track quite accurately the cannibalization results that happened from those new stores, and what we've seen over many years is very, very little impact of net new cannibalization of those new stores. And I attribute that to a significant improvement in the analytics under Matt Ryan's team of where we place stores, the trade areas we place stores in, the type of stores that we're putting in those trade areas, and so we continue to see that kind of very, very small cannibalization and extensive store growth opportunities. And the only other thing I'll say before I hand it to John is remember that that 900 is split roughly evenly between company-owned stores and licensed stores, and those licensed stores are unique opportunities for us to get access to real estate.","John, do you want to talk about labor?","John Winchester Culver - Starbucks Corp.","Yeah, just real quick. One thing I would just add on the new stores and the performance, clearly, we believe that there's still a long runway for growth for new stores in the U.S. And there's a lot of opportunity to continue to infill. We are seeing strong performance, not only in our core stores in the new stores, but then also through drive-through. And we're going to continue to focus in this area. We have not seen cannibalization, as Scott highlighted, and we believe in the growth strategy we have in place. It's been 13 consecutive quarters that our new and non-comp stores have contributed at least 4% to our growth on a quarter-to-quarter basis, so I feel good about the trajectory that we're on.","In terms of partner retention, obviously we continue to make investments in our people, both in terms of wage and in terms of benefits. We continue to see retention increase. In the most recent quarter, our retention sequentially increased versus the previous quarter as well as versus last year's same quarter.","We feel good about the partner engagement that we have in our stores. When you look at how we measure partner engagement, those scores on a year-over-year basis exceeded last year. So, we feel good about the engagement that we're having from our partners, and then more importantly, how that translates into the customer experience. And we all know that our partners bring the experience to life for our customers, and, as part of that high level of engagement that they have, our customer experience scores are sitting at record highs right now, so we feel good about what we're seeing there.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Tarantino from Baird. Your line is now open.","David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hi, good afternoon. I have another question on the Americas business. I guess, as we think about the trends you saw through the quarter softening after April, there's been a lot of talk on the call about sort of macro issues. I was just wondering how you determine that this is more of a macro issue and not a company-specific issue. And perhaps could you comment on whether you think April was just inflated by the Frappuccino launch, and maybe when you take that out, maybe the trend has been a little bit more stable or do you actually see a deceleration in the overall business? Thanks.","Matthew Ryan - Starbucks Corp.","Thanks, David. Matt Ryan here. And I want to get to the short-term question. Well, let me frame first with a little bit of a long-term view here, which is that in the U.S. and just about any other market we've studied, there's been a decades-long trend for growth away from home, food and beverage consumption, driven by demographics and people just want more convenience. And we're strongly bullish on the long-term continuation of that trend.","However, in the past year, we've seen some pullback from that trendline, as we have from time to time, with consumers in the U.S. shifting some discretionary spend to other categories. We look at all sorts of sources of data here, including corroborating credit and debit card spend data. But we think the best source of industry comp intelligence comes from the APT index, which is a metric developed by Applied Predictive Technologies, that's the name of the company, that aggregates and tracks actual comp data from a broad set of more than 100,000 retail restaurant and QSR competitor locations on a weekly basis, allowing us to understand just how well we're doing versus important benchmarks.","And for Q3 overall, the APT index showed decelerating and negative comp for QSR and restaurant industries, while Starbucks' own metrics accelerated comp to 5%. In fact, the differential between Starbucks and the industry increased significantly in Q3 compared to the past several quarters, and that's just on the comp stores. It excludes the effect of any further market share gains we have as a result of our strong pace of new store openings.","Within the quarter, we did see some deceleration in month-to-month comp performance for both industry benchmarks and Starbucks, but Starbucks steadily outpaced the competition. And I'll let someone else (51:56) comment on that as well.","What we really think this is about is the strong performance in share capture having to do with the pipeline of product innovation, the continued improvements to store operations that you heard about, and growth in digital engagement. And it's the trifecta of these three things: product innovations, ops excellence and digital, will continue to support market share capture in the short term. And should the current pullback in industry performance go back to the long-term trend, as we think it will, it will help align us and set us up for success there.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sara Senatore from Bernstein. Your line is open.","Sara Harkavy Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Yes, thank you very much. I'd like to also just ask a few questions about the comp drivers going forward. On the core coffee, it sounds like it's been a bit softer for the last couple quarters. So, I'm just trying to understand what might be driving that. We know some of the QSRs have gone aggressively against coffee beverages and I was wondering if it might be competitive in nature. And then food, by contrast, is doing quite well. So, as we think about that going forward, is this largely going to be a kind of a ticket-driven comp with attach driving that food? And how do we think about food offsetting the core coffee? Thanks.","Kevin R. Johnson - Starbucks Corp.","Yeah. Sarah, this is Kevin. I'll comment and then hand to John Culver. In our U.S. business, 2 points of our comps came from our core beverages, and that's across all dayparts. So, certainly, our core coffee and espresso and core beverages contributed 2 points of comp. Food contributed 2 points of comp and then innovation beverages contributed the other 1 point. So, there's 3 points of comp from beverage, 2 points from food. And that just highlights why it's important for us to continue to drive innovation, both in food and in beverage.","So, when you think about the innovation on beverage side, we've got a number of new things we've been doing around both hot and cold. You take some of the iced espresso beverages that we've been launching and bringing to market, Iced Macchiato is an example, continued innovation and deployment of Nitro into more stores for Nitro Cold Brew, very popular. Certainly, this quarter, the Teavana Infusions is an example of that. And then in the last quarter the Refreshers; kind of evolved around the Pink Drink as an example, but the Refreshers also helped. So, we've seen good comp growth from not only our core beverages, but also the innovation that we've been doing around other beverages as well as food. John, I'll let you add other comments if you have any.","John Winchester Culver - Starbucks Corp.","Yeah, just to add a few things to what Kevin expressed. First off, we're very pleased with the success food is having in our stores and the continued attach rate. And we talked about the success across all dayparts and the growth that we saw in the quarter across all dayparts. Lunch was the fastest growing daypart and it was driven by food attach, as well as our refreshment and iced beverages. And when you break down that beverage growth for the total quarter, we saw good growth in espresso, core espresso. We saw growth in brewed and we did see growth in blended as well as refreshment, all right?","And to put a finer point on that, a couple of highlights there. First was Iced Coffee and Cold Brew. We actually grew Iced Coffee and Cold Brew 33% in the quarter. In addition, we also grew iced espresso, a core beverage, plus 27% in the quarter. And then refreshment, driven by Pink Drink, grew 57% in the quarter. So, we're seeing strong growth as it relates to core, as well as refreshment and in iced drinks.","From a food standpoint, we saw innovation come into the quarter with the new protein boxes and the enhancements that they brought and the additional attach that they drove at lunch. We also saw growth in our core bakery and breakfast egg sandwiches in the morning daypart, which was great. And then we continue to see great success with the Sous Vide Egg Bites and we have plans to have that available nationally in the early part of August, which we're excited about.","So, we feel good about the mix. Clearly, we want to continue to focus on transactions, and transactions is all about making sure that we're building those customer connections and that we are operating our stores at the level we expect and that our customers have come to expect.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein from Barclays. Your line is now open.","Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thank you very much. Just following up on the U.S. trends that you talked about kind of post-April, I'm just wondering whether you \u2013 as you read the data, whether you see a noticeable change in the actual consumer behavior, or perhaps the way they're using Starbucks products. Just wondering, kind of as you tie that in with maybe promotional activity, it seems like the industry is aggressive. I was just wondering whether you'd characterize Starbucks as being aggressive or what type of offers are more successful. Fearful that maybe people are getting too aggressive with the promotions where you can actually turn off customers, especially with the one-on-one offers. So, anything related to change in usage patterns and the aggressive nature in terms of your promotional activity.","Scott Harlan Maw - Starbucks Corp.","Yeah, thanks, Jeffrey, it's Scott. What I would say is there was no real impact other than the normal positive lift we saw all quarter around Starbucks Rewards. So we're not seeing any fatigue at all on the offers or in personalization. If anything, as Matt discussed, that's accelerating.","What I would say, and I think this is what John was talking about, we did see some softness in the afternoon. It grew, it just grew a little bit less than we had expected and that was partly Frappuccino, but not only Frappuccino. We saw some softness in some of our iced products, as well, again versus what we expected, they still grew, but just a bit lower as we moved through the quarter. And then Morning Peak, as I said in my prepared remarks, that accelerated linked quarter, which was great because we're starting to see real traction around some of the throughput things we're working. But again, the acceleration we saw as we moved through the quarter wasn't quite as much as we'd hoped. And so, that's how I would describe the slowdown. It wasn't really in that promotional afternoon period, and we didn't see any impact from what we do with Starbucks Rewards other than continued lift and acceleration.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Glass from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks very much. When you look at the last four or so quarters in the U.S., transactions have been roughly flat. So, it seems like you're not attracting new customers, you're getting a lot out of your existing customers, and that's been one of the benefits of My Starbucks Rewards. So, when you talk to the customers that either aren't going or lapsed, what do they want to see from Starbucks that would get them to come? In other words, is it a value issue that keeps them away? I mean, retail may be tough, but many QSRs are thriving in this environment. Maybe it's because you're emphasizing value and that's not the game that they play. But what is it that people who don't go to Starbucks want that you can try to provide them that would get them to come? It seems like the brand is well known, but it's narrowly used.","Kevin R. Johnson - Starbucks Corp.","Yeah, John, this is Kevin. I'll comment and then hand it over to Matt to add to this. I think, as Scott said, there's no evidence that the discounting that's going on amongst the value players is affecting us. I think they serve a different market and we're very focused on the product innovation and the more premium experience that we think attracts a different customer type. And so, the things that we've got to continue to do are number one, we've got to ensure that operational excellence in our stores is maintained and constantly enhanced. Now, we saw growth in every daypart. A lot of the operational enhancements in our stores has been focused on peak to make sure that we're creating a great improved experience in those stores with high volumes with Mobile Order & Pay, great progress there. And then it's also product innovation. I think, as John mentioned, the product innovation we've had both around food and beverage has helped us in the lunch daypart, in the afternoon daypart. And then the third aspect, in addition to a great in-store experience in food and beverage innovation is as we bring new customers into Starbucks, one of the most important things we want to do is find ways to establish a digital mobile relationship with those customers, even if they're not at the point of joining the Rewards program.","And so, that's a lot of what Matt talked about in his section on the digital agenda. We're going to now start opening the aperture of the reach that we can get with the digital mobile relationship and we're going to start by experimenting with things on this guest checkout and some other initiatives that we have on the digital side. But I think the key has got to be a great in-store experience and innovative new food and beverage offers that bring those customers in or perhaps, who are less frequent into the stores and then figure out how to translate that into a longer relationship. And I'll let Matt extend his thoughts.","Matthew Ryan - Starbucks Corp.","Yeah. Not a lot more to add to that except for that when you're in a difficult periodic from time-to-time operating environment, what becomes very critical is your ability to talk to customers. And we saw that clearly in the results. It wasn't anything more than our ability to communicate that helped bring in our Starbucks Rewards customers at the level they were doing. So, for us it's important to extend the number of relationships we have so that we can continue to bring people into the franchise and we have plans to do that.","Howard S. Schultz - Starbucks Corp.","This is Howard. I was just going to remind people, we seem to be focusing a great deal on the slowdown in the second half of the quarter, and potentially the early part of April, but let's re-establish the fact that we had a 5% comp in the quarter and a 1% increase in traffic. We have not seen any other retailer or QSR company this quarter report a 5% comp. So, while you are beating us up a bit for lowering comps for Q4, which is the better part of valor because we are only three weeks into July, which is linked to the last quarter, let's reestablish common language. We had a 5% comp, 1% increase in traffic, and a 6% increase in China, mostly on traffic, while we're doubling down on the growth and development in China, which we have said publicly will be as large or bigger than our U.S. business. But once again, 5% comp, your number, in the quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt DiFrisco from Guggenheim Securities. Your line is now open.","Matthew DiFrisco - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Thank you very much. My question is with respect to sort of looking at the earnings side related in the fourth quarter to that 2% to \u2013 3% to 4% comp that 12% to 13% growth. How much of that earnings growth is reflective of that 3% to 4% environment versus some new investments that you started to begin to talk about that are going to take effect in yield in 2018? I wonder is the model supportive in a 3% to 4% comp environment, 12% to 13% EPS or is that diluted also from some ramped-up investment to return to mid-single digit comps for 2018?","Kevin R. Johnson - Starbucks Corp.","Great. Thanks for the question, Matt. Just to remind you, what we guided last quarter for the fourth quarter, I think it's important for the question. So, last quarter, we adjusted our rest of year earnings guidance because of an impact we saw from the Teavana mall store performance. That will continue as we get ready to close those stores. We also significantly increased our investment, primarily in the fourth quarter around what we call Cyber Retail, so Reserved, Roastery and Princi, as well as digital.","So, the short answer is indeed the fourth quarter reflects an acceleration in those investments, so that's important. And then the second thing is there is a little bit of slowdown in the earnings growth in the fourth quarter compared to what we guided last time from the lower comps, both in the U.S. and in Japan, but the last quarter, you'll remember, we adjusted fourth quarter because of those investments, so that is an increase as we move through the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Karen Holthouse from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Karen Holthouse - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hi. So, taking a step back, if, hypothetically speaking, some of these headwinds, whether it's retail traffic or food app, food away from homes don't go away, are there particular things that we should be looking at or initiatives layering on the horizon that you think would be able to be pretty proactive changes in the comp trajectory? Specifically, the digital management tool, is that so that you can go back to driving growth at peak in those stores? Maybe the Mercato lineup, just anything you can kind of think of layering in going out through fiscal 2018? Thanks.","Kevin R. Johnson - Starbucks Corp.","Yeah, Karen. This is Kevin. I'll comment and then hand it over to Matt. Clearly, the initiatives that we're driving around food and innovation around food and beverage is driving lift today, and that's going to continue to help us in comp going forward, independent of what's happening in the industry and the initiatives that we have in digital. And sort of the outline that Matt took you through.","I think the fundamental improvements we're making in throughput and the customer experience, especially at peak, those are three things that are giving us good results today and those results will continue. So, Matt maybe I'll let you comment a bit more on the digital.","Matthew Ryan - Starbucks Corp.","Yeah. Just to re-summarize digital, you have to think about it as short-term and long-term things we can do to unlock value in digital. In the short term, we're going to continue to lean in hard to personalization and that spend per member metric (01:06:36), so we see that coming. But we also have a major opportunity to lean hard on customer acquisition, as well too, and we have strong plans throughout the remainder of this quarter and into next to do exactly that.","In addition to that, moving forward, we laid out some broad ideas for where the digital flywheel goes down the road, and by broadening the digital flywheel beyond the narrow aperture of people with stored value cards and Rewards right now, we see large long-term opportunities for growth by creating more digital relationships. And we see, even in a tough environment like today, digital relationships enable us to communicate with customers and bring them into our stores with frequency.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Palmer from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you. Matt, Kevin, you both mentioned detailed plans to get after the digital customer and acquiring those customers has a powerful impact. That growth in that customer has slowed over the last few quarters and you're talking about the Chase collaboration. Is that the major way that you're going to get after getting new customers? And if so, do you have any sense of how meaningful that can be and what the runway would be? Thank you.","Kevin R. Johnson - Starbucks Corp.","There are a few things here. First of all, just as a reminder that the lower 8% number that we reported in membership growth for Starbucks Rewards this quarter was a result of having had last year an unusual growth in Q3. So, if you look at our two-year growth, it's still at 26% year-on-year and it's fairly consistent.","That said, we know that there's more for us to do and we're going to continue to lean in. Chase will become a reason why we'll engage more people down the road, but in the short term, we see some significant promotional and just old-fashioned block and tackle customer acquisition opportunities in the quarter ahead, as well as continued improvements to the user experience and the sign-up experience to reduce frictions that cause people to drop off in the activation funnel. So, we're leaning in hard in that in the short term and then we have a lot more plans in the longer term including Chase.","Matthew Ryan - Starbucks Corp.","David, I'd just remind you that the increase from last year that was higher than normal was when we launched the new program. We had a lot of marketing and promotion against that.","John Winchester Culver - Starbucks Corp.","And David, one of the things I would just add, this is John, we are also looking at ways that we can activate our customers in the stores. How can our stores become much more active to activate and bring new Rewards members into the program and that's something else we're looking at, as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jason West from Credit Suisse. Jason, your line is now open.","Jason West - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Yeah, thanks. I guess it's along the lines of these investments, and you guys talked about some investments last quarter as well. Were these contemplated in the longer-term guidance that you had provided or are you sort of stepping up the level of investment here in the near term and we should expect that to put a bit more pressure on margins than usual, I guess, particularly in the Americas segment? Thanks.","Kevin R. Johnson - Starbucks Corp.","Let's talk about this year and then the longer term. Jason, what I would say is last quarter we definitely stepped up the level of investments this year and that's part of the reason we adjusted guidance last quarter. And as I responded to Matt, that was a piece of the reason the fourth quarter earnings growth decelerates a little bit. Broadly, what I said about the three different investments in the profile, is for Siren Retail investments, so, Reserve Roastery and Princi. Those, as far as their impact on margin this year, I think it's at its peak this year. We will continue to grow those investments from a dollar basis, but because we have a significant number of Roasteries that are in pre-opening right now, the impact on March is pretty high. And as we get into next year, it will be lower. It will still increase in investment. When I look at partner investments, I think we're in the middle of that cycle, so, we'll continue to lean in on partner investments as we get into next year although again, we'll talk to you a little bit on what happens from a margin standpoint as it relates to those.","On digital investments, we continue to grow that and it will continue to grow from a dollar spend year-on-year. Some of that is capitalized, so the impact on margin and P&L is a little bit less. But the reality is, all of those investments, particularly around digital and around partner investments, we need to continue to make those because they're driving the kind of returns that allowed us to do a 5% comp this year and take additional share.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Charles from Cowen and Company. Your line is now open.","Andrew Charles - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you. Kevin, switching gears a little bit, your discussion about the opportunity to partner with third-party digital firms reminds me of around five years ago when Starbucks discussed opportunities to partner with third-party technology or financial services companies and monetize the My Starbucks Rewards loyalty data. Just given your background and connections in the tech space, are these partnerships you're looking to enter involve revisiting these conversations?","Kevin R. Johnson - Starbucks Corp.","Well, I think, Andrew, clearly, the entire retail sector is going through this massive disruption and it's clear that the winners coming out of this are going to be those companies who find elegant ways to bring an in-store experience together with a digital experience. And I highlighted the number of examples of companies and the work they're doing, you know, including the most recent discussion around Amazon's announcement to combine with Whole Foods. And so, we certainly have a lot of experience in different partnerships with digital tech companies that we've engaged in over the years. And I think we're continuing to have dialogue with a number of pure-play tech companies around are there things that we could do that create significant breakthroughs? And we're going to continue those discussions and see where it leads us. But it is about accelerating the pace of transformation that we're going through. Howard, you want to add to that, please?","Howard S. Schultz - Starbucks Corp.","I would just add, as Kevin had in his prepared remarks, what we've seen over the last few months with Walmart and Jet.com and PetSmart and Chewy and most recently Amazon and Whole Foods, I think this is just, we're in the nascent stage of these kinds of commercial relationships that are going to elevate the experience of a brick-and-mortar retail company. And having said that, Starbucks is probably best positioned, given our national footprint, the demography of our customers, and where we're located to have those kinds of conversations. I think it would be premature to kind of get into who they are, but clearly, we are a very viable partner, given the change in the industry.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andy Barish from Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Andrew Marc Barish - Jefferies LLC","Hey, guys. One more, I guess, on the margin side of things. It seems like the focus on the mix in the Americas U.S. stores is shifting more to food and kind of hand-crafted beverages, which, I think, have lower gross margins, as you pointed out, more labor complexity to them. What is the offset to that over time, if in fact, that's going to continue to be the sort of main products that help drive comp right now?","Kevin R. Johnson - Starbucks Corp.","Yeah, Andy, what I would say is hand-crafted beverages actually have some of the higher margins on a gross margin basis that we have in our stores. So, that includes iced teas and espresso beverages, very high gross margins and actually quite high operating margins, as well, even with the labor. But I take the spirit of your question. The way I would describe it is the challenge we have a bit with our mix is mostly versus what we had forecast in the quarter, where food is actually coming in a little bit stronger, which is a good thing because it's accretive to operating margin after leveraging all of the fixed cost and labor and rent, so that's the first thing. Where we've come up a bit short, and it's pressuring gross margins is, we just don't have quite as much beverage comp as we would like to see. So, adding more hand-crafted beverages, more iced teas, more core beverages, that will help with the mix challenge that we have. And I think as you see comps hopefully accelerate as we move through and into next year, that will help with the gross margin. So, it's really strong food growth and a little bit underweighted mix from beverage.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gregory Francfort from Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Gregory R. Francfort - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, guys, just one quick one. Can you just help us on the China business provide any insight into just the recent margin profile and sort of rough margin breakdown? As we think about sort of over the longer-term China's contribution to the growth algorithm, is this something that's going to be additive to the longer-term algorithm or do you view it as replacing some of the U.S. contribution, just given the size and scale of that business? I guess, is it an additive piece or maybe more of a replacing, in terms of the longer-term thinking?","Kevin R. Johnson - Starbucks Corp.","Yeah, Greg, let me start. This is Kevin and then I'll hand it over to Scott for some specifics. First of all, we have been in China now for 18 years. And as a company, we have worked very diligently to build our brand, build relationships with our partners, create beautiful stores, a connection to customers, and when you think about a consumer brand that has more reach and relevance across China, it's hard to think of anyone that is better positioned.","Number two, the unification of Mainland China as a company operated model will enable us to accelerate the pace of growth, and do it in a way consistent with the values and the culture that we've created in China. We have a world-class leadership team with Belinda right here on the phone with us today. And so if you think about the next two decades, I think the growth opportunities before us are unparalleled by anyone. So, I think of this as we have two major growth engines for Starbucks: the U.S. that's operating at scale and China that has this huge runway of growth in the form of new stores and reaching millions, tens of millions, of more customers. And so, both of them are core to what we are doing and they're core to our strategy, which is why the strategic actions we announced today, we believe are the right things to do because it allows us to put more energy and more focus behind the things that matter the most. Scott, you want to...","Scott Harlan Maw - Starbucks Corp.","Yeah, I think the only thing I would add to that is when you look at the performance of China, we've got 20% revenue growth and operating income is growing quite a bit faster than that. So, operating margins in China have been expanding at a pretty rapid rate over the last handful of years. So, as we look at this acquisition, we see significant opportunity once we get through probably the first year or so, where we get a little investment done, some integration done to significantly accelerate the East China market and broaden the types of returns we've seen across the rest of Mainland China.","Kevin R. Johnson - Starbucks Corp.","Belinda, do you want to add anything before we close the conversation on China?","Belinda Wong - Starbucks Greater China","Sure. Thank you. What I would add is that the momentum for our business here has never been stronger, and it's really the early days of China. Yes, we have been investing heavily ahead of the curve, but we're really just in chapter one and I think this acquisition will really well position us to leverage our scale and the infrastructure we already built. But again, this is only at its very early stage and we have to continue to invest in our infrastructure, our system, and especially our people. And with the middle class rising, the coffee consumption rising, people picking up more and more drinking coffee, I see enormous opportunities ahead, and we're really just getting started.","And one last thing I would add is that our job every day here is to make new friends and get new connections going and really being very good at getting new customers to understand Starbucks and to go through the Starbucks journey. That is what we have been doing the last 18 years, basically, and I see that as our focus and we'll stay laser-focused on bringing new customers into our business and continue on with our new store growth in China.","Howard S. Schultz - Starbucks Corp.","The question that was asked earlier of Kevin regarding potential commercial partnerships with tech companies or pure-play digital companies, we've learned a great deal from the relationship we have with Tencent in China. In only six months we've had over 2 million social gift transactions, which is just an unbelievable level of acceleration and velocity in a very short period of time. We do not have social gifting at that level here in the U.S., but clearly, we've got sightline on what that could be in the U.S. and the relationship that we have built with Tencent.","So, the other thing I'd say is when you asked the question, a lot of the answer is based on the fact that bricks-and-mortar retailers are in need of a pure-play digital partner. But what we're also seeing in these discussions is that the digital companies and tech companies realize more than ever that there's going to be one customer interface, and that interface is as important to a tech company to have a brick-and-mortar relationship as it is for a brick-and-mortar relationship company to have a digital relationship.","And so, once again, I think you're going to see lots of these kinds of things take place, as well as what I've been saying for the last few years, and that is, a level of consolidation and store closures, which we've all seen. But Starbucks, despite the cyclical issue of the macro environment, we are in the mix not only in these conversations, but clearly, the level of store growth, the level of customer profile, and the continuation of the velocity of building the equity of the brand domestically and around the world, and as Kevin said, the power we have to grow two businesses at once, a more mature business that clearly is not saturated here in the U.S. with the number of stores we continue to open with great success, and as Belinda said, the very early, nascent stages of what we're going to have, which is thousands of retail stores in China, multiple points of distribution in terms of product, and a digital relationship with multiple companies, based on the fact that the consumer in China is well more advanced than the U.S. consumer in terms of being a digital native.","And we are at the intersection of that in ways that no other brick-and-mortar company is in China, based on the fact that we're in 130 cities with 2,800 stores, but it's also the profile of the consumer in China, and with almost $1 million AUV in the morning ritual starting in China building almost every day, this business in China, I think, is significantly underestimated both by the people who analyze our business and, I think, candidly, in the market value of Starbucks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nicole Miller from Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open.","Nicole Miller Regan - Piper Jaffray","Thank you. Good afternoon. I very much respect and understand the prudent nature of revising your guidance as you exit the year. The number one question I get asked from investors, so I'm hoping you'd be willing to address it, is why not just do so for the long-term guided range? I think the algorithm currently states 10% to 15%, and again, it's the number one question I get asked. So, do you want us to think about that differently going forward, either to the lower end or an actual restatement or removal of that as you go forward? Again, just to the nature of being as transparent and prudent as you can be. Thank you so much.","Kevin R. Johnson - Starbucks Corp.","Nicole, this is Kevin. Thank you for the question. As we think about long-range guidance going forward, we certainly understand and acknowledge the question. People look and say, FY 2017 year-to-date performance has been slightly below that long-range guidance, and so it's a valid question.","First of all, I think it's important to know that when we guide for fiscal year 2018 next quarter, we will also in that guide provide you with any updates to our long-range guidance. Now, you might say well, why do you wait until then? Well, look, we've got line of sight to what \u2013 these strategic announcements we made today. Scott commented on the fact that East China acquisition is neutral to accretive in year one. We've got some variability in the Teavana mall store in terms of the pace of closures that we've got to work through over this next quarter. And so, I think it's important for us to take the time to ensure that if there are any other strategic actions we take between now and Q4, that we factor those into long-range guidance, that we have the final results for FY 2017 as the basis for long-range guidance. And then, frankly, we're right in the middle of creating our annual operating plan for fiscal year 2018. And we think it's important that that annual operating plan is completed as part of any update we give in long-range guidance. And then you should expect that on our October call.","And I appreciate that's a question and I know it's an important one and I just ask for your patience, but we are completing the process and the things to do it thoughtfully and responsibly and be transparent with you and our investors.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Will Slabaugh from Stephens. Your line is now open.","Will Slabaugh - Stephens, Inc.","Yeah, thank you. Wanted to shift back to China for a minute if we could. If we're able to look out one, two, three years down the road, will we be talking more about tea, coffee, or food growth in China? And how do you think that that might change versus what you're seeing today?","John Winchester Culver - Starbucks Corp.","This is John. I know that you'll be talking about growth across all those categories. Clearly, the growth of espresso-based beverages and the way in which our customers in China have embraced that, we see a long runway for growth, and we have a strong innovation pipeline around that. In the comments we talk about tea and the growth of tea that we've seen since we've introduced Teavana being at nearly 60% in China and Japan, and so tea will continue to be a focused area as well.","In food, we've just done a lot of work around transforming our food program in China and rolling that out to our stores and we're seeing traction. So, we're going to continue to grow across all categories. And when we open up the Shanghai Roastery, that will give us a whole other level of innovation that we are going to be able to bring into our stores, whether it's coffee-based beverages or tea-based beverages or our food items. So, Belinda, I don't know if you want to make any...","Kevin R. Johnson - Starbucks Corp.","Yeah, Belinda, maybe you could give us some more color and share a little bit more of how you're driving both food and beverage innovation and what you see unfolding here over the next few years in China.","Belinda Wong - Starbucks Greater China","Yes, well, thank you. When you look at our 7% comp, what's nice about it is it's mostly from transactions. So, we're getting new customers to come in and trial the experience. And also, what's nice about that is we see growth in all dayparts. That means we're serving different segments of customers. Some come in for our breakfast and we're seeing morning daypart increase as well as the afternoon and evening. So, we continue to open stores to serve different customers and their needs.","Like what John said, we're heavy up on our investment on food. We're also seeing great results from our launch of Teavana from last year, especially summertime right now and the iced tea is doing very well. And this is only the beginning and we're going to double-down again on our investment for afternoon refreshment in the tea category, especially in the afternoon segment.","So, I guess what I'll summarize it to be is that, we're going to laser-focus on making sure all dayparts will be relevant for different customers, depending on the location, the cities that we're in. We're also opening a lot of new stores and entering new cities as we meet our customer for the first time. So, we're doing all that at the same time, and I'm very certain that we'll see growth in all dayparts coming in the next few years.","Operator","And our last question comes from the line of R.J. Hottovy from Morningstar Research. Your line is open.","R.J. Hottovy - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Thanks. Just one last question on U.S. and really around product innovation here. One of the things we're hearing from a lot of the QSR and other restaurant firms is more on the menu simplification part of the equation, and obviously, it seems like you're going against the grain on that with more products and more innovation. What's the right balance? What is your analysis showing in terms of the right balance with the right amount of products on the menu? Is it something that could streamline and speed up the throughput process? Just kind of curious to get your thoughts on that as you look at a number of the things within the restaurants?","Kevin R. Johnson - Starbucks Corp.","R.J., this is Kevin, I'll start and then hand over to Scott to add to it. First of all, one of the things that we're always very thoughtful about, as we're doing innovation around food and beverage, is to be thoughtful about how that lands in the store and the experience it creates for our partners who prepare the food and beverage for customers and for customers. And so, if you think about much of the work we do is innovation around what we think of as platforms. And we are, in many ways in beverage, we have the capability to customize beverages for individual customers at scale. And the way we've been able to do that is be very thoughtful about the platforms that we launch and then the things that differentiate or allow a customer to differentiate and customize that platform. Example would be when you think about our espresso platform. Certainly, customers can substitute different types of milks, whether it's coconut milk or almond milk and the set of things we've done there. Flavor profiles.","So, by being thoughtful about how we do that innovation, we actually do it in a way that simplifies that customization in our stores for our partners. That said, we always have to be cautious that we're not expanding the platforms or the complexity or the SKU counts too much.","The final comment I'll make, and I'll hand over to Scott, is that I also think we're going through an exercise right now, really looking at the SKUs and doing some SKU rationalization. We're not at end of job on that, but I think that's one that we're constantly looking at the long tail of SKUs that are low volume in stores and figuring out how to constantly prune those and put more energy than in keeping things fresh and vibrant for customers. Scott?","Scott Harlan Maw - Starbucks Corp.","I would only add I think Kevin nailed it on the beverage customization side. There is opportunity around food and around packaged coffee in our stores and we're in the process of looking at that, so we'll come back to you in future quarters as we work our way through that.","Kevin R. Johnson - Starbucks Corp.","You said last thing...","Howard S. Schultz - Starbucks Corp.","Yeah, just the last thing. I think one of the hallmarks of Starbucks, which continues to be highly relevant, is customization, and our ability to customize beverages is not about the number of SKUs we have. It's about the customer's demand and preference to customize their own beverage. And so, when it goes back to the question about our people and retention and the training, this is where we are at our best and this is where we do not have any other company in our space that is even second to us.","So, I think you're going to see us play up customization at a higher level as we enter fiscal 2018, because we've always known how important that is, but it's becoming more and more important with this millennial consumer.","So, just in closing, what I would say is we remain as optimistic as ever about the future of our company. We thought it was very prudent to really share with you what we experienced at the tail end of the quarter, and what we're experiencing the first few weeks, only three weeks into the 13-week quarter in Q4, but enough information to just be sensitive and be straight with you. We understand the question about long-term guidance, but as Kevin said, we have a lot to absorb and digest while we are in the AOP period, and like always, we'll be straight up and be very honest with you about where we stand. But our optimism for what we're doing inside the U.S. and what we announced today in China has never been stronger, so you should hang up this call, I hope, with realizing how bullish we are and how strong we feel about the future of our company. Thank you very much.","Operator","And at this time, I'd like to turn it over to Tom for any closing remarks.","Tom Shaw - Starbucks Corp.","Thanks again, everybody, for joining us and we look forward to speaking with you again on our fourth quarter earnings call, which we have tentatively scheduled for Thursday, November 2.

Starbucks third quarter of fiscal 2015 stands as among the most remarkable quarters in our over 23 years as a public company. Our global comp store sales grew 7%, driven by a stunning 4% increase in global traffic.","Let me put that 4% traffic increase figure into perspective. A 4% increase in global traffic on a business of our scale translates into having served over 23 million more customer occasions in Q3 of 2015 than in Q3 of 2014 or an average of approximately 25 more customer occasions every day from every single store in our nearly 10,000 store global comp base.","Our fast-growing Americas segment posted 8% comp growth, also driven by 4% increase in traffic and a 12% increase in revenues. EMEA delivered 3% comp growth with over 2% from increased traffic and a 23% increase in operating income.","As we announced last week, our EMEA segment is preparing to open its first store in Johannesburg, South Africa during the first half of calendar 2016 in partnership with established food retail operator, Taste Holdings Limited. We believe that South Africa could ultimately support 150 or more Starbucks stores over time.","Starbucks fast growing China\/Asia-Pacific segment now with over 5200 stores delivered company leading comp growth of 11% in Q3, virtually all of which coming from increased traffic.","Our now fully owned and controlled Japan market, our first international market outside of North America and a market in which we now operate over 1000 stores, delivered among its strongest quarterly comp sales increases in years. And I'm very pleased to report that we now have exceeded 1700 stores across 90 cities in mainland China.","Cap remains a focal point of our future growth plans, and we are on track to meet our goal of doubling our cap store count to roughly 10,000 locations, tripling our revenue to over $3 billion and tripling our operating income to over $1 billion over the next five years.","Strong global comp sales growth, combined with record performance from our new store class, drove an 18% increase in total company revenues to a Q3 record of $4.9 billion and a 24% increase in non-GAAP EPS to a Q3 record of $0.42 per share.","Noteworthy is that our Q3 results were achieved despite continued meaningful investment in food and beverage innovation, our mobile and digital platforms and our partner experience investments.","All of which these investments will continue in Q4 and despite formidable foreign exchange headwinds and difficult retail and consumer environments in many of the global markets in which we operate.","Starbucks Q3 of fiscal 2015 was a fantastic quarter across the board, clearly evidencing a continuation of the strong momentum we've seen across our business and around the world this fiscal year and solid in-store execution by our people who now deliver the Starbucks experience through nearly 80 million customer transactions from over 22,500 stores in 66 countries around the world every week.","In a moment, I will highlight a few of the innovations and strategic initiatives and digital partnerships that were announced or took shape in the quarter that will enable us to further extend Starbucks global coffee authority and leadership around all things coffee and tea, retail, mobile and digital and position us to continue to grow, lead and win around the world and into the future.","Then I'll turn the call over to Kevin who will take you through coffee and beverage innovation and total company and individual segment operating performance in the quarter. Finally, Scott will take you through our Q3 financial and operating results in detail, and we'll close the call out with Q&A.","Two years ago I reported on the seismic shift in consumer behavior that would significantly impact traditional bricks and mortar retailers. I was not clairvoyant. The coming change was apparent.","Since then, many traditional retailers and consumer brands have responded simply by substantially increasing their digital advertising budgets, significantly driving up their cost of customer acquisition and producing little to show for it. We on the other hand, took a very different approach.","By further enhancing our already world-class digital technologies through the introduction of capabilities like Mobile Order & Pay and soon to be delivery and expanding our loyalty program, we are driving traffic as reflected in the 4% growth in traffic in Q3.","Bringing in new customers and deepening our connection to our existing customers, elevating the Starbucks brand and our customer experience and streamlining our in-store operations.","At the same time today, you will hear about unique digital partnerships that we are forging with like minded businesses in a number of verticals that will further leverage the Starbucks brand and our digital assets in order to further reduce our already low cost of customer acquisition and drive additional incremental traffic.","Starbucks superior customer experience depends in part on delivering world class service and convenience, and we are pleased to report great progress on several game-changing initiatives that are only in their infancy.","We first introduced Mobile Order & Pay into 150 of our company operated stores in the Portland area last December and then quickly expanded it to the full 650 store Pacific Northwest region in March.","Given the powerful positive impact Mobile Order & Pay had on our business in Portland and Seattle, we accelerated the rollout of this offering and now offer this innovative mobile capability in over 4000 of our US company operated stores.","And we are now on track to offer Mobile Order & Pay capability across the entire US company operated store portfolio in time for the upcoming important holiday season.","Mobile Order & Pay is enabling us to serve more customers more quickly and efficiently and to significantly reduce attrition off the line. We are already seeing positive impact on operating results.","But keep in mind that the rollout to 4000 stores occurred only in the last couple of weeks of the third quarter. So the real impact for Mobile Order & Pay and increased convenience remains in the quarters and years to come.","That said, mobile order and pay is fueling both revenue and profit growth in every market in which it has been deployed with customer adoption starting faster and accelerating with each new phase we roll out.","By enabling our customers to order ahead and avoid waiting in line, Mobile Order & Pay is enabling us to capture more on the go customer occasions, and the data is clear.","In those stores where Mobile Order & Pay has been deployed, lines are shorter, service is faster and in-store operations are more efficient. The net result is increased traffic, incrementality that is exceeding expectations, improved throughput and an elevated Starbucks experience for our customers.","We will add the Mobile Order & Pay feature to our Android app in the US, as well as introduce Mobile Order & Pay technology into our international markets in the months ahead. Importantly, key features like suggested menu recommendations that will drive increased ticket have not yet been deployed, as we are still in the beta mode.","In another important initiative designed to improve Starbucks superior convenience, we have opened our first express store in New York City, and while it still very, very early in terms of how many days it's been open, initial results are nothing short of extraordinary.","In approximately 500 square feet of space, we are now handling volumes we would normally expect from a store 3 times its size and nearby stores less than a few hundred feet away have not seen any adverse impact or cannibalization.","This helps validate the assertion that we made at our investor conference last December that many places in the US we have far more demand than our current stores conserve, indicating opportunities to significantly grow our domestic store footprint in the years to come.","And the express store is only one of several innovative new formats that we are pursuing to take advantage of the different kinds of real estate opportunities we need to address in order to tap into the demand that exists for more Starbucks occasions.","The initial success of Mobile Order & Pay in the express store are testaments to the growth potential that remains for us in the US where our ability to serve demand rather than the need to create demand will be key to our achieving our growth.","In addition to more express stores, another will open in New York City later this summer. The next big initiative to satisfy customer demand and provide added convenience is delivery.","We remain convinced of the huge demand for Starbucks delivery to your home or office and are on plan to pilot delivery in Seattle and in the Empire State Building in New York City before the holiday.","We have no doubt that delivery like Mobile Order & Pay will drive further incrementality and increase profitability and enhance the equity of the Starbucks brand.","Just as digital technologies are enabling us to add convenience with features such as Mobile Order & Pay and delivery, digital technologies are enabling significant expansion of our My Starbucks Rewards loyalty program.","MSR continues to be our most important business drivers as new members contribute not only short term increases in revenue and profit, but also to long-term loyalty for years to come. We now have 10.4 million active MSR members, up 28% from Q3 of 2014 with 6.2 million being Gold members, up 32% from Q3 last year.","The significant increase in Gold level membership means that an increased number of our MSR customers are transacting in our stores more frequently than before with MSR members now accounting for approximately 30% of total tender in North America.","And our mobile commerce platform is literally stronger than ever. We have reached the milestone where mobile payments now represent 20% of all in-store transactions in our US stores, more than double the figure from only two years ago, and we are now processing nearly 9 million mobile transactions each week.","Now our plan all along has been to bring both our MSR membership and our digital capabilities to scale, and we are now there, and so then leverage the Starbucks brand, our deep engagement with customers, our global store footprint and our world leading mobile digital card and loyalty assets to create the foundation of a much broader external mobile digital and loyalty platform. One that would extend to purchases and experiences outside of the four walls of the Starbucks store.","This new digital external platform will enable businesses whose customer demographics are similar to our own and with whom we choose to partner. To purchase stars from Starbucks and then to distribute the stars in order for them to acquire, retain and reward their own customers with the gift of Starbucks. And what's really wonderful about this opportunity is that gift can only be redeemed at a Starbucks store.","Let me explain the enormity of this emerging digital and loyalty opportunity to you through the lens of the first three expanded loyalty partnerships that we've recently announced.","The first partnership we announced was with Spotify. Under the arrangements, Spotify will purchase Starbucks Stars from us and then distribute these Stars to drive premium subscriber acquisition.","It will allow Spotify to differentiate themselves from competitive music streaming services and reward customer loyalty. In addition and as an added benefit to our own employee partners, all Starbucks partners are being given a Spotify premium account ","free of charge.","The second partnership we announced was with the New York Times. Under the Times arrangement, as with Spotify, the Times will purchase Starbucks Stars from us and distribute Stars to drive customer acquisition and to reward customer loyalty.","And as an added benefit, Starbucks customers will be provided with free, unique, curated New York Times content to the Starbucks digital network within our stores.","Our third digital and loyalty platform partner is Lyft, one of America's leading mobile transportation network companies. As part of our partnership, Lyft will purchase Stars from us and distribute the Stars to increase customer acquisition and loyalty, reward their drivers and distinguish Lyft from competitive services.","There are a number of innovative elements to this partnership, but a few that highlight the like-minded nature of our companies include that we will be making all Lyft drivers Gold members of our MSR program and that Lyft will be offering their writers the ability to thank their drivers with Starbucks e-gifts.","In addition, later this year we'll be testing the possibility of introducing a convenient and cost effective transportation benefit to Starbucks employee partners in conjunction with Lyft in order to gauge partner interest and to determine the long-term viability of this benefit.","What each of these partnerships affords is the opportunity for consumers to earn Starbucks Stars outside of Starbucks stores and then to redeem them for their favorite food and beverages within Starbucks stores, providing a unique opportunity for incrementality, increased profitability and the opportunity for us to serve, connect with and become part of the daily ritual of an even more larger based number of consumers, and adding further momentum to Starbucks unique increasingly global flywheel.","And since each and every Star has significant perceived value to our MSR customers, these digital platform partners will be conferring a meaningful benefit upon their new and existing customers and even their drivers in the case of Lyft.","We strongly believe that no other bricks and mortar retailer has the brand strength, digital and physical assets or connection to consumers to create, build and execute a program anything like this.","We have identified prospective partners in multiple attractive business verticals, and you may expect to hear about many more carefully curated, customized digital partnerships in the quarters ahead as we roll out this proprietary Starbucks Star-centric digital and loyalty ecosystem.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Kevin. Kevin?","Kevin Johnson","Thanks, Howard. Good afternoon, everyone. Before handing off to Scott to take you through the financials, I thought I'd build on Howard's comments about the quarter and share some personal observations.","As Howard made clear, Q3 was an exceptional quarter as measured by any standard or metric. Ongoing beverage innovation and global leadership around all things coffee and tea remain at Starbucks core.","In Q3 we continued to invest and elevate the premium, highly differentiated, locally relevant coffee and tea, beverage, food and in-store experience we deliver to our customers around the world.","We grew global revenues by 18% over prior year to a new quarterly revenue record of $4.9 billion with a 7% increase in global comparable store sales, representing our 22nd consecutive quarter of comps sales growth of 5% or greater and on the heels of global comp sales increases of 6% in Q3, 2014 and 8% in Q3, 2013.","These are truly extraordinary topline results given the size, breadth and complexity of our increasingly global operation. 4% of our comp growth came from increased traffic, a testament to the increasing strength of our business and the global relevancy of the Starbucks brand.","In addition to driving strong revenue growth, we also expanded operating margins 70 basis points to a Q3 record of 19.2%. We grew operating income by 22%. This reflects a Q3 record, $939 million of operating income and a non-GAAP EPS of $0.42 per share.","I think there are three core drivers of this momentum. Number one, we are delivering innovation that is relevant to both our customers and our employee partners. Two, we are driving operational execution on a global basis. And three, we are leveraging the scale, reach and breadth of our capabilities.","Our fast growing Americas segment is firing on all cylinders, opening 658 net new stores over the past 12 months and posting an 8% comp growth in Q3 with a 4% increase in traffic. This resulted in 12% revenue growth and 17% operating income growth.","Ongoing beverage innovation that resonated with our customers and increased food attached across all regions and dayparts contributed meaningfully to the Americas segment's outstanding performance.","Q3 was the 22nd consecutive quarter, and the Americas delivered comp growth of 5% or greater. More importantly, transaction growth for the quarter of 4%, the best in six quarters was an extraordinary accomplishment and reflects the success of our efforts to drive traffic and incrementality through ongoing beverage and food innovation and increased store throughput.","Core beverage offerings contributed half of the US comp growth in Q3 with blended and espresso platforms driving over two thirds of that growth. Beverage innovation such as flat white, Frappuccino minis and cold brew combined to contribute approximately 1 point of comp growth and continue to perform ahead of initial expectations.","S'mores Frappuccino, a new limited-time offering, became the highest selling LTO Frappuccino ever. Noteworthy is that Teavana branded shaken iced teas continue to resonate with our customers, helping drive a 10% increase in tea beverages in our US stores and again contributing 1 point of comp growth.","We continue to make progress, creating new locations and growing our lunch and afternoon dayparts. Food sales contributed over 2 points to US comp growth this quarter, once again representing double-digit revenue growth over the prior year.","Our expanded breakfast sandwich platform delivered 30% net revenue growth with half of that growth coming from increased attach. Our lunch platform continues to grow, delivering greater than 20% growth in Q3 with the noteworthy success of warm sandwiches, bistro boxes and wraps, reflecting the fact that Starbucks is increasingly being recognized by our customers as an attractive option for lunch.","In addition to growing new dayparts, we've also made significant progress growing transactions at our peak daypart through a combination of great in-store execution and positive early results around innovative new store formats.","We are especially pleased with the progress we're making in growing transactions at peak even before Mobile Order & Pay is fully rolled out across the US company operated store portfolio in time for the upcoming holiday season.","Our new class of stores are performing extremely well, generating record first year sales and unit economics. Noteworthy is that our new stores are delivering record performance without cannibalizing sales from established stores in the local trading area. The data suggests that we are creating deeper engagement with our existing customers, and we're attracting new customers to Starbucks.","US licensed stores are seeing similar patterns and delivered strong results with revenue increasing 27% year-over-year. Looking ahead to Q4, we're confident that our rich pipeline of innovation will deliver a strong finish to the year.","Starting with cold brewed and Teavana mango black tea lemonade, both launched just in time for the summer heat and are exceeding initial expectations. The carefully curated selection of innovative, delicious new snacks to enhance our afternoon daypart offerings.","Customer feedback and research has shown us that snacks represent 50% of all American eating occasions each day, with busy lifestyles on the rise, the demand for snacks both in the moment or planned is increasing.","Our new portfolio of snack offerings is available in more than 3,400 high traffic Starbucks stores in major metropolitan areas. We continue to innovate around all things food with positive response customers.","Let's now take a look at the EMEA segment. EMEA third quarter results continued the segment's steady, measured improvement in profitability, despite the impact of unfavorable foreign currency translation, the primary driver of the 9% decline in reported revenues over prior year.","Excluding approximately $44 million of FX, the impact of the closing and transfer of certain stores from company-owned to license, EMEA revenues actually increased 5% in the quarter.","Comparable store sales in EMEA grew 3% in Q3, despite the FX headwinds and macroeconomic challenges in several markets, with a 2% increase in traffic representing its ninth consecutive quarter of positive comp growth with every EMEA market posting positive comps. EMEA also delivered a 320 basis point increase in operating margin and a very strong 23% increase in operating income over Q3 last year.","Our EMEA license markets are performing exceptionally well with Turkey and the Middle East in particular continuing to outperform. EMEA's results support our license-focused growth strategy for the segment where 66% of our nearly 2300 stores in Q3 were licensed, as compared to only 54% three years ago. We will continue to accelerate growth in our EMEA license store portfolio as demonstrated by two very exciting new partnerships.","In June, we entered into an important partnership with Casino Restauration, one of France's largest and most respected grocery retailers to open Starbucks stores within a number of casino stores. We view partnerships in the grocery channel in Western Europe as an opportunity for Starbucks.","And just last week, we announced plans to enter South Africa in partnership with Taste Holdings, a leading South African restauranteur, and we'll be opening our first store in Johannesburg during the first half of 2016. We will look to extend into other markets in Central and Southern Africa over time.","As aggressively as we are growing our license business in EMEA, we are equally committed to improving the profitability of our company-owned store portfolio in the region, and we are making continued progress on that front. Scott will provide details on that progress in a moment.","Our China, Asia-Pacific segment delivered an amazing quarter with company leading comp growth of 11% and revenue growth of 127%, 20% excluding the $390 million incremental revenue from the acquisition of Starbucks Japan. Overall, cap operating income grew by 49%.","We've added 750 net new stores in cap over the past 12 months. Our new class of company operated stores in cap is even more profitable than the prior class, reflecting the increasing strength and relevance of the Starbucks brand in the region and improved operating leverage.","We remain on track to increase our cap store count to 5500 by fiscal year 2015 and roughly double our store count to over 10,000 stores over the next five years.","As Howard mentioned, we've now surpassed 1700 stores operating in over 90 cities in mainland China. The passion and commitment of our partners in China is enabling us to deliver a great customer experience that is driving strong comp growth throughout the region.","Our business in Japan delivered among the strongest quarterly comp sales increases in Japan in years. We are benefiting from solid execution against our plans to leverage our brand in connection with consumers to drive growth in all channels and across all dayparts in the key Japanese markets.","By way of reminder, Japan company-operated stores are not yet in our global comp base. We will include these stores in both the global and cap comp base beginning in Q1 of fiscal year 2016.","Limited-time offering Frappuccinos in particular are extremely popular in Japan. Our spring and summer promotions featured locally developed products that have successfully positioned Starbucks as a top of mind destination for summer beverages.","The increasing strength of the Starbucks brand in Japan gives us confidence that with full ownership we can accelerate growth in this market as we head towards our 20th anniversary in Japan in 2016.","At our recent store opening, in the Tottori prefecture, the last prefecture in Japan without a Starbucks store, 1000 customers queued up for the store opening, and more than 50 reporters showed up to cover the event.","Starbucks brand strength spans the entire cap region. It is not limited to China and Japan. In fact, Starbucks ranked 15th on Nielsen's annual regional list of Asia's top 1000 brands for 2015 and has been ranked as the number one restaurant brand in Asia for the fourth year in a row.","Let's now move on to the channel development segment. Channel development revenues of $404 million in Q3 were up a solid 8% over the prior year, despite the increased competitive pressure in the at-home coffee categories and the timing of the Easter holiday which impacted the comparison to Q2 of this year.","K-Cup portion pack sales continued to be a primary driver of the revenue growth for channel development, and we are very pleased that our total K-Cup portfolio continues to gain share, despite increasing price pressure and new market entrants.","Innovation has been a key driver in establishing our leadership position in the K-Cup category and will continue to drive our sales growth.","Cinnamon dolce and mocha performed very well in Q3 as our flavors platform increased its share of the total category, and Starbucks iced coffee K-Cups launched only three months ago gained strong momentum ahead of the peak summer season.","Looking ahead, we are excited for customers to experience our third K-Cup beverage, hot cocoa. A new platform we are launching with classic and salted caramel hot cocoa flavor profiles.","Ongoing innovation, combined with increased marketing activities in Q3, give us confidence that we will continue to extend our leadership position on the K-Cup platform.","Foodservice had a strong Q3 with 14% revenue growth year-over-year. We offer a very broad product portfolio to the foodservice trade that is becoming increasingly appealing to businesses seeking to differentiate themselves by providing employees and guests with premium amenities in these establishments.","Beyond the US, we're seeing strong growth in China Asia-Pacific ready-to-drink sales, underscoring the size of the opportunity presented by the strategic partnership we announced with Teeney [ph] where we are on track to launch ready-to-drink Frappuccino through a large number of outlets in 2016.","As part of our plan to accelerate growth of ready-to-drink products in international markets, I am pleased to announce our expansion throughout Latin America ready-to-drink with our long-term business partner, Pepsico. Starbucks has been operating in Latin America for 13 years and now has more than 870 stores in 14 markets with plans to add several hundred more stores in the years ahead.","The new agreement with Pepsi will bring the Starbucks ready-to-drink coffee and energy portfolio to this important region and will leverage the Starbucks brand and store footprint, along with Pepsico's marketing and distribution capabilities, in order to unlock the growing $4 billion Latin America ready-to-drink coffee and energy business.","Customers will see Starbucks ready-to-drink bottled beverages throughout the grocery and convenience store channel in 10 Latin America markets in calendar year 2016. Innovating in ways that amplify our leadership in coffee is a key strategic priority.","Starbucks immersive 15,000 square-foot Starbucks reserve roastery and tasting room continues to attract customers and tourists from all over the world and is exceeding our most optimistic expectations.","The roastery is also enabling us to build a new ultra premium coffee brand, Starbucks Reserve. With the additional small batch coffee roasting capacity provided by the roastery, we can outsource, roast, blend and market spectacular, limited availability, micro-lot coffees from around the world under the Starbucks Reserve brand.","This is elevating the super-premium coffee experience we deliver to our customers, and we're able to find many Starbucks reserve varietals sell out as soon as we bring them to market.","To facilitate the expansion of the Starbucks Reserve brand, we are leveraging some of the design elements from the roastery to create a new store format called Starbucks Reserve that will showcase both our super-premium Starbucks Reserve coffees from around the world and the newest coffee brewing methods.","Starbucks Reserve stores will also incorporate an integrated Teavana kiosk to increase customer awareness and interest in Teavana super-premium loose-leaf and packaged tees. We expect to launch new Starbucks Reserve stores in targeted global markets over the next year, laying the foundation for an exciting, highly differentiated, new global growth opportunity for us.","We're on plan to open our new Starbucks reserve flagship store sometime later this calendar year, and we are already opening Starbucks Reserve coffee bars within selected existing Starbucks locations across the US as part of normal Starbucks store renovation cycles.","I'm confident that the addition of Starbucks Reserve coffee bars will drive incrementality in existing Starbucks stores and build customer awareness around our new Starbucks Reserve brand.","After more than six years on the Starbucks board, combined with the past five months deeply engaged with the management team, I must say it's a privilege to be a part of the Starbucks journey.","I want to thank all my Starbucks partners for the great work they do to create that magical Starbucks experience for our customers each and every day.","I'll now hand the call over to Scott to take you through our Q3 financial results in detail. Scott?","Scott Maw","Thanks, Kevin. And good afternoon, everyone. The Starbucks business has performed exceptionally well in fiscal 2015, and our third quarter reflected the continuation of prior quarter's trends.","Strong global comps, record revenues, record operating margin and record operating income once again demonstrate the impact and the success of our laser focus on our customers and our customer experience and fantastic execution by our partners across the globe.","Our Q3 results are particularly meaningful in light of the size of our global system today and the increasing complexity of our business.","Our Q3 GAAP EPS came in at $0.41 and non-GAAP EPS at $0.42 per share, 24% over prior year and our strongest quarter in 2015 thus far, despite a meaningful ramp in the investments we are making in the business.","Non-GAAP operating margin expanded 100 basis points in Q3 to 19.5%, and excluding non-GAAP items, our operating income increased 24% over last year to $950 million. Sales leverage from the Americas and cap segments and an increase in COGS leverage drove this improvement.","Clearly, the supply chain initiatives we have previously discussed and are implementing are benefiting our operations in a significant way. In fact, we have seen 120 basis points of gross margin improvement to date in 2015.","In addition, we remain on track to eliminate $1 billion of supply chain costs over a four-year period. I would like to personally and publicly thank all of our supply chain partners across the globe for helping us deliver our Q3 results and our future supply chain savings while at the same time supporting the very significant growth in our business.","I'll now take you through individual segment performance in Q3. Our Americas segment grew revenues 12% in Q3, primarily driven by strong 8% comp growth with transactions and ticket contributing 4% each.","Americas operating income grew 17% over the prior quarter in Q3, reaching $855 million, a record high and a particularly excellent result, considering our US store partner investments continued to ramp during the quarter.","Operating margin expanded 120 basis points over Q3 last year to 25%, and importantly sales leverage was significant, more than offsetting the approximately 80 basis point impact from increased partner investments.","Our EMEA segment increased its operating income 23% over Q3 of last year to $36 million, a Q3 record. EMEA's record results are even more impressive in light of challenging macroeconomic conditions across the region, significant foreign exchange headwinds and the fact that only two short years ago EMEA was essentially operating at a breakeven operating margin.","Particularly noteworthy is that EMEA's operating margin expanded 320 basis points to 12.2%, also a Q3 record. Continued progress against our plan to improve operations and evolve our store portfolio from company operated to higher-margin license stores drove double-digit operating margin for the fourth consecutive quarter.","And our license store portfolio in EMEA continues to perform exceedingly well with high single-digit comps for the seventh quarter in a row.","Our China Asia-Pacific segment continues to perform extremely well in Q3, delivering company leading quarterly comp growth of 11%, a 49% increase in year-over-year operating income to $150 million and becoming our second most profitable business segment for the first time in our history.","GAAP operating margin and cap declined from 35% to 23% as a result of the impact of our acquisition of Starbucks Japan. As Howard and Kevin mentioned, we have a very long and opportunistic runway of growth ahead in cap with stores that continue to deliver among the highest profitability and strongest unit economics of any stores in the world.","Excluding the nearly 16 point financial impact from the ownership change in Starbucks Japan, cap's operating margin increased by 370 basis points. Strong revenue growth and margin expansion driven by the performance of company-operated stores, as well as sales and operating leverage, all contributed to cap's excellent results.","Channel development's operating income increased 3% to $143 million, while segment operating margins decline 160 basis points year over year to 35.5%, largely a result of increased marketing to support our ongoing product introductions and commodity copy costs.","Noteworthy is that our portfolio continues to increase its share of the K-Cup category despite competitive pricing pressure from new and existing market participants. Year-to-date performance in channel development remains strong with 11% revenue growth, margin expansion of 220 basis points and an 18% operating income growth.","I want to shift gears a bit and take a moment to discuss our balance sheet and capital deployment activities. Earlier this month we took advantage of the continued low interest rate environment to opportunistically refinance our $550 million 6.25% coupon senior notes that were due in 2017 with $850 million of lower coupon 7 and 30 year bonds. This transaction enabled us to both reduce our interest expense going forward and to significantly extend the maturity of our debt.","Upon redemption, we incurred a charge of approximately $63 million that will impact our P&L in Q4, namely for the premium related to the early redemption of the 2017 notes. This charge is included in our updated GAAP targets that excluded from our Q4 non-GAAP targets.","As we've previously shared, we will target share repurchases at least equal to the dilutive impact from our broad based stock compensation programs. We've also noted that we will modestly add to debt and may from time to time increase the pace of our buybacks.","Given the strength of the quarter and the favorable economics on our most recent debt offering, we increased our buybacks somewhat in the quarter. In Q3 we returned a record $874 million of cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.","And today I am pleased to announce that the Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of an additional 50 million shares under our ongoing share repurchase program. This is on top of the 11 million shares that remained available at the end of Q3.","Strong results during the first nine months of fiscal 2015 enabled us to deliver both earnings per share above our initial EPS target growth range and current quarter earnings above our updated range.","Our full-year GAAP EPS targets are now $1.77 to $1.78, and we are increasing our full-year non-GAAP EPS target range to $1.57 to $1.58. This relates to GAAP EPS growth of 31% to 32% and non-GAAP EPS growth of 18% to 19% for the full fiscal year.","Noteworthy is that this growth above our initial non-GAAP EPS growth range of 16% to 18% and that it will be accomplished despite 2 points of foreign exchange impact on both our revenue and earnings per share growth rates. For Q4, we now expect GAAP EPS in the range of $0.38 to $0.39 and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.42 to $0.43, consistent with our prior guidance.","A few comments on our Q4 guidance. We're expecting another excellent quarter in Q4, albeit with somewhat lower earnings growth rate than we delivered in Q3. This is consistent with what I had noted on last quarter's earnings call. And I want to again clearly caution against extrapolating Q3's extraordinary performance onto Q4.","Several factors support the Q4 guidance we have announced. First, we are continuing to ramp our partner in digital investments. They will reach their peak in Q4 and be up notably from Q3 levels.","Our results this quarter demonstrate that these targeted, carefully considered investments are beginning to bear meaningful fruit, and we will not hesitate to accelerate investment where we see opportunity. Second, we expect the impact of foreign exchange on our top and bottom line will be at its peak in Q4.","And finally, we are lapping over phenomenal results in Q4 of fiscal 2014 when we reported an operating margin above 20%, our highest operating margin ever, which was 280 basis points over prior year on a non-GAAP basis.","Breaking down Q4 operating margin by business unit, we expect Americas to deliver year-over-year margin improvement that is somewhat lower than the 90 basis point improvement year to date.","GAAP operating margin is expected to finish the year slightly above 20%, which is significantly higher than our initial guidance. The cap's Q4 margin will be roughly flat to Q3's very strong 23%.","Channel development's operating margin in Q4 is expected to be up nicely from Q3, but down slightly compared to last year Q4, reflecting the challenging and competitive retail environment, additional marketing investments and somewhat higher coffee costs.","Finally, EMEA operating margin is expected to show strong year-over-year expansion with the full year margin - operating margin at or slightly better than the high end of our 10% to 12% guidance range.","For the total company, we expect non-GAAP operating margin to be up from Q3, but down slightly from last year's fourth quarter, reflecting the impact of the Japan acquisition, offset somewhat by favorable operating and COGS leverage.","We continue to expect commodities to be roughly neutral in 2015 with coffee somewhat unfavorable and dairy offsetting this impact. We now expect revenue growth of approximately 16% for the year, including two points of FX impact. All other guidance for 2015 remains consistent with what I shared last quarter.","One final reminder before turning the call back to Howard and then on to Q&A. As I mentioned on our earnings call last quarter, we will be providing our initial growth targets for fiscal 2016 and all future years during our fourth quarter earnings call.","Given the size and the scale of our increasingly complex global business, we've been contemplating shifting the issuance of this guidance from Q3 to Q4 for some years now in order to have it coincide with the completion of our annual operating plan. The shift will allow us to thoroughly vet our AOP prior to providing targets. Finally, I would point out that we are now over 80% locked for coffee costs into 2016 at rates slightly lower than 2015.","Starbucks' strong year-over-year financial performance demonstrates our commitment to delivering best-in-class financial and operating results, while at the same time investing in our future growth, building new stores, renovating existing stores, deploying new technology and investing in our partners and delivering an elevated Starbucks experience to our customers.","We believe that by getting the balance right, we will be able to continue delivering best-in-class growth, profitability and increased capital returns to our shareholders.","Now, I'll turn the call back to Howard. Howard?","Howard Schultz","Scott, thank you so much. Before we head into q-and-a, I just wanted to make one comment as it relates to how you might be looking at comps and traffic going forward. I think I speak for everyone at Starbucks in saying how proud we are and how gratified we are that we've been able to put up the kinds of numbers that really are unprecedented given our scale.","But I've said in previous quarters and I think it's really worth repeating again, that we don't expect internally to maintain these kinds of very high level, high single digit comp numbers and the kind of traffic numbers that we provided with you today.","So I would hope that there is common language and common understanding that the guidance we've been giving for years now is mid single digit comps, and I would hope that you would hold us to that. And if we are in a position to surprise on the upside, that's wonderful, but not to count on it and certainly not to model it.","In our quarter, this quarter demonstrates a unique opportunity for many, many things that have come together. We're certainly going to work very hard to reproduce that. But I think going forward mid single digit comps numbers and a modest traffic number should be the kind of number you are putting in your model. And I hope that you would respect that as we go forward to Q4 and fiscal 2016. Thank you very much. JoAnn?","JoAnn DeGrande","All right. Thanks, Howard. Mike, go ahead and open up for Q&A today, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] First question is from Keith Siegner with UBS.","Keith Siegner","Thank you and congratulations on such a record quarter. As exciting as the Mobile Order & Pay is and you all know how excited I am. A lot of others will eventually get somewhat close. What I think really is interesting about this is the ecosystem expansion, such a long-term competitive advantage.","So Howard, when you think about this expansion is there any limit to this? Is this a nice slow gradual pace? Is this something that can get really broad and pervasive? I mean there is no precedent for this, right. How do we think about this ecosystem expansion with other retailers evolving?","Howard Schultz","Well, let me try and answer this way. I think you have to go back to the 2 years when I did share with many of you the concern that I had about what is meant to be a bricks and mortar retailer today in terms of the challenging issue of mobile commerce in the web. And that has resulted, I think, in lots of activity that is not producing the kind of positive results across all of retail, especially those that are mall-based.","So, on the one hand, traditional retailers that are bricks and mortar based are longing for ways in which to accelerate and leverage their core assets and specifically drive traffic as opposed to waiting to intercept it.","I think we've established not only a very successful application in Mobile Order & Pay, but we've established Stars as a currency that is highly relevant to our customer base. And when you look at our customer base, at how broad it is and the demography of it.","When we start looking at verticals and like-minded companies, it's very easy for us to integrate our data against the way in which our customers are shopping and spending their free time and spending their money.","And as a result of that, we've identified a number of companies in unique verticals that we think sequentially can be part of this external ecosystem. However, like anything else, I think that we have to walk before we run, and I think we have a core responsibility to demonstrate to the initial partners that in fact, the proposition that we created is going to drive incrementality for them.","I can tell you that the phone has rung with many, many inquiries from both regional and national retailers in all types of business, who are very much interested and intrigued to be part of what it is we're building.","Now there is a company and you probably have seen it, and that\u2019s what plenty is doing, and what they're doing is assembling an amalgamation of companies as part of that ecosystem, and you see many companies jumping into that.","What's different about what we're doing and why I think it's going to be better and more proprietary is that we are offering a single currency, and that currency has to come back to Starbucks, and we know that the value of a Starbucks store and the equity of our brand is very, very relevant to this kind of proposition.","So the short answer to your question is, I think this is a very big idea, but it's an idea that I think we have to prove internally and prove to these partners. And you are going to see sequentially more partners in the quarters to come. And I think it will be more than a domestic opportunity over time as we introduce Mobile Order & Pay and the features and benefits in the international markets.","But this strategy goes back 2 to 3 years when we started talking about leveraging this internal system once we got the scale and creating this external flywheel, and I think we're in a very unique position that will create incrementality and a very low-cost of customer acquisition.","So - and I think what we're trying to do here is recognize that we can't embrace the status quo. We have to keep pushing for innovation inside and outside of our stores, and we have to be as relevant for our customers on their phone as we are inside the Starbucks experience.","And I think this is exactly what we're doing. I think the first three partnerships represent a level of diversity in terms of New York Times, Spotify and Lyft, and you're going to see a lot more in the days ahead.","Operator","The next question is from John Glass with Morgan Stanley.","John Glass","Thanks very much. I wanted to ask about the Mobile Order & Pay rollout. My ultimate question is if you're willing at this point to talk more specifically about the kind of lifts you're experiencing in the older markets that when it's rolled out?","If you're not willing to talk about that more specifically, can you talk about to what extent these are new - when people are joining in, is it new members to through my Starbucks Rewards, the existing members?","How deep is the penetration, the usage in your existing user base of the My Starbucks Rewards? Any kind of qualitative comments around that would be helpful.","Howard Schultz","Go ahead, Adam.","Adam Brotman","Okay. Thanks, John. This is Adam. So, first of all, specifically to answer your question, we're seeing both our existing user base using order and pay, as well as bringing in some new members into the My Starbucks Rewards loyalty program, as well as them using the Mobile Order & Pay.","And while we can't breakout specifics as you mentioned, it's worth noting that obviously this program is gaining tremendous momentum. We've been exceeding our own internal expectations in terms of the number of mobile orders we are seeing, in terms of incrementality that we are measuring, and in terms of the qualitative factors like customer and partner satisfaction are all exceeding our expectations.","And that's even more true in our busiest stores, which bodes well as we continue to finish the US rollout in such cities as New York and San Francisco and Chicago. And I'd also add that we're seeing we are happy to be seen that the adoption rate is accelerating as Seattle actually started out faster than Portland, which we were quite happy with and then this last wave, the Sunbelt has succeeded even that in terms of its initial adoption rates.","So we have momentum, we're just getting started, and you can imagine we're pretty excited about this.","Operator","The next question is from Joe Buckley with Bank of America.","Joe Buckley","Thank you. A couple questions if I can. The deals with Spotify, Lyft, New York Times, do they all involve a commitment to buy certain number of Stars, and are there upfront payments for the Stars?","And just explain a little bit more how it works? And who is heading up that effort, Howard, is it you at this point, or is it Kevin or someone else within the organization?","Howard Schultz","Sure. Kevin, do you want to take that?","Kevin Johnson","Sure. I'm happy to Howard. Yes, Joe, thanks for the question. I think that without getting into the specifics of each of these deals, they all have a common element which is each of these partners is paying us for Stars that then will be used to reward MSR customers or in the case of Spotify or the New York Times for subscription, in the case of Lyft for rides, and in the case of Lyft for some benefits they have for their drivers as well.","In each there is a range of terms in each of those agreements, but there is a fundamental principle around how we're going to pivot and help them achieve their goals in terms of subscriptions, and rider ship, and in return they are going to buy Stars or pay us for Stars, they are going to reward MSR customers for those benefits, and that's where it becomes a win-win-win, if you will.","MSR customers win because it's another place for them to earn valuable Starbucks Stars that they can redeem at Starbucks. Starbucks will win because that will bring traffic into our stores, and our partners will win because we are going to help them bring MSR customer base and bring customers to their offerings, whether it is subscriptions or rides, and we're going to go from there. So certainly, that is the foundational concept behind the 3 deals that we've done in the vision that we have going forward.","I think, as Howard mentioned, we've got to walk before we run, and so right now I think the plans are to get to Spotify this fall, and we queued up New York Times and Lyft in January, early Q1 calendar year 2016.","And in the interim, we're going to continue to have dialogue with other interested partners. But I think the priority right now is we're going to make sure that we do a great job with these first three partners and that our customers have a great experience, our partners get benefit from that, and that's where we are going to put our energy.","In terms of your questions around who's managing this, I mean obviously a big part of this links into the digital experience we've created with our mobile app. And so Adam Brotman and his team are doing a lot of the software development that's enabling this. Certainly between Howard, Adam, Matt Ryan and myself, we've all been involved in these dialogues and helping shape these.","I think we're now at a point where we're going to now start formalizing organizationally where the accountability is to scale it. But now clearly the implementation of getting this done is the responsibility that I have along with Adam Brotman.","Joe Buckley","Okay. And then one more if I could, on the 4% transaction growth, that is obviously a very, very strong number. Can you talk about what you've done? You mentioned peak hour throughput transactions being up, but if you are doing 4%, I'm sure they have to be up.","But what have you done to kind of streamline that process. You know Mobile Order & Pay, I'm assuming wasn't in enough stores long enough in the quarter to have too much impact. So what else is going on to help drive those transactions?","Cliff Burrows","Thank you, Joe. It's Cliff here. The focus has been on all the basics in our stores, and really those peak hours in the mornings in our busiest stores, we have really focused on labor and making sure we have enough labor in the right place. That is helping us sell to more customers.","We're also seeing an increase in occasions with the work we're doing around dayparts, and that can be lunch, that can be our Frappuccino platform, right through to the evenings in stores. And all of those are helping us to grow all our stores across all dayparts, and it really is an absolute focus on the basics.","You're right in your assumption that Mobile Order & Pay is not yet a material part of that. As Adam said, it launched too late in the quarter. But we are really encouraged by the work we're doing investing in our partners, investing in labor and stores, and serving more customers.","Joe Buckley","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Sara Senatore with Bernstein.","Sara Senatore","Thank you very much. I wanted to actually ask about food and in particular in daypart expansion. In particular, when you talk about you have some very aggressive growth in some of the categories breakfast and then even lunch.","Could you maybe help me think about ultimately if you have an idea about where food could get to in terms of share of mix? Are there limits by not having a full kitchen?","And on that note, could you maybe update us on Starbucks Evenings, the rollout there, and how you would think about that daypart a bit more expansively?","Cliff Burrows","Thank you, Sara. And as was highlighted by Kevin, we've seen a real growth around that breakfast daypart, driven in part by the breakfast sandwiches seeing a 30% growth, lunch as we've expanded into that. We've seen a very healthy 20% growth in that daypart.","And it really is focused from the work we started with level large products, feels like almost 3 years ago now and great quality ingredients that are resonating with our customers. We keep refining and improving not only the choice of food, but the relevance of the different dayparts. As we expanded our offer of Teavana shake and teas, again the complement to lunchtime food gives us encouragement that we're in the right direction here.","We said in the analyst conference at the end of last year that we would see our food mix growing up to the mid 20s% in terms of percentage of mix, and I think that feels like a good place directionally. We are now up to 20%. We've seen a 1 point increase in the mix. So directionally heading that way and we have a good line of sight on it.","Evenings we have rolled out the Evenings program to stores across different parts of the country. We are still in the early phase. We will see the expansion of Evenings to hundreds of stores in the US over the next 12 months.","And that again gives another opportunity but only to introduce wine and beer, but to strengthen our food offering to be part of that Evenings software complemented by teas, coffees and a range of beverages.","We've also expanded many of those new food offerings, certainly breakfast sandwiches and lunch, and our pastries into our Canadian business and into many of our license store partners. And it is the first time we have had an aligned range across such a wide portfolio.","So that will also help us strengthen the relationship with our customers in terms of a consistent offer and also focus on delivering great quality food for our customers.","Kevin Johnson","I would just add and we commented on this last quarter, if you look at the ticket in the US business, the 4 points that you see there, there is a really healthy mix of ticket. There is a little bit of price in there, but by far the majority of that is a combination of premiumizations [ph] overseeing the customers trade up within categories or across categories and then attach. And so that 4% is as healthy as we have seen it over the past few years.","Sara Senatore","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from David Palmer with RBC.","David Palmer","Thank. Good evening. What are you learning in the rollouts of mobile order intake from an operational execution standpoint, particularly as you get into the thousands of stores? How are you finding the customer satisfaction, especially with regard to having that beverage perfectly ready when the customer wants?","And if your partners or consumers are suggesting tweaks or opportunities for the app or execution, can you share any of those? Thanks.","Howard Schultz","Adam, why don't you start and then Cliff can talk about the in-store expenses.","Adam Brotman","Okay, David, this is Adam. First of all, the thing that we're learning are that we can continue to refine. In fact, my guess is we will do this for a long time and making sure that our estimated pickup time algorithm is always based on what we're trying to improve.","We are very happy with how it's working in beta mode and so happy that we're going to continue to accelerate our rollout. But that's something that we're continuing to work on.","We're also learning that our customers are requesting things like the ability to have very specific store by store menus being turned on. That's something that we plan on turning on before the end of this year in fact. So we're working on that, so that you can have a - you can order things like Clover and Visio and Evolution Fresh smoothies.","So those are examples of the kinds of things that our customers are asking for that we are in the process of improving as we speak. And then, of course, putting those capabilities onto our Android app and then starting to roll out in the UK, Canada and elsewhere around the globe. So those are kinds of examples, the things that our customers are asking for. Cliff?","Cliff Burrows","Yes, I would say, David, the acceptance and enthusiasm from our partners across the country has been incredible. They feel well trained. They feel ready for the rollout and customer adoption, and usage of the new app has just been fantastic.","And we keep learning and we keep tweaking, but the ramp-up rates and the adoption rate that Adam talked about earlier has just got stronger with each rollout. We now have some high volume stores, which has allowed us to pressure test what happens in those stores. And in fact, those are the ones where we are seeing the strongest adoption, and it does bode well for the future.","So far, all the learning\u2019s are good. I think that piece Adam said about getting store-specific menus so that the customer can order just what they want in their store. And I think the other one is just the excitement and the pressure to get into all of our stores as a standard part of our offer.","Adam Brotman","And David, this is Adam again. Just to add on to what Cliff said, it's something that's worth noting that, if you look at our opportunity with Mobile Order & Pay and assumed delivery, we have an absolutely unique and differentiated capability because unlike any other consumer brand retail or restaurant company, we already have an industry leading integrated card loyalty and mobile assisted with massive momentum and usage of Stars that are relevant to our customers and fully integrated into the POS system into the operations of our stores.","So it gives us a unique and differentiated ability to roll something like this out in a seamless and elegant manner and one where our partners and our customers are adopting it. So we are very excited about our differentiation into Mobile Order & Pay.","David Palmer","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Karen Holthouse with Goldman Sachs.","Karen Holthouse","Hi. Thank you for taking the question. I actually have another question about food. And as you continue to see this platform grow across dayparts, is there anything you've noticed in terms of the mix of customers using it?","Is it something that seems to be skewing millennials, something that's skewing older, and then also usage patterns in urban versus suburban preferred the grab and go food?","And then in particular, is there any difference in how consumers are capitalizing on the drive thru for sort of Starbucks as a non-fast food drive thru option.","Cliff Burrows","Well, there's a lot there, Karen. I would say that we are seeing more similarities than differences across the country. Drive thru we focus primarily on a narrower range and opt in our bestsellers on new introductions or seasonal changes. But if somebody wants and is familiar with a wider range, they just order it.","We are seeing bestsellers the same across the country, and there's no particular SKU to millennials. I think the lunchtime offering tied with tea, ice-shaken teas is a new development for us. There is a strong drive towards the breakfast sandwich platform, and that really is across the country.","One of the things that has been extremely encouraging is our strongest food markets have gotten even stronger with this new food offering. And that is what is most encouraging. It's not everybody catching up the traditional markets for us.","We've had our biggest adoption, and people buying the food have gotten stronger. And we see that this will continue to grow. I think the other thing that we have with this frozen distribution model is our availability product has increased significantly. Mobile Order & Pay is helping us again to improve that availability by us knowing exactly what the customer wants.","So a lot of changes to the supply chain, a lot of refinements to the operational practices in stores. And at this stage, we are not tailoring to a particular group, but we are also taking the opportunity to bring in some locally relevant products.","BC with a diverse supplier there, and also in New York with an opportunity with a local supplier. And I see that plus the grab and go snacks as some of the curated offers that we can start to put in the stores to complement our base.","Karen Holthouse","Great. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from David Tarantino with Robert W Baird.","David Tarantino","Hi, good afternoon. I have a question about the China, Asia-Pacific segment and the strength that you're seeing and the traffic trends there. Just wondering if you could elaborate on we think is driving that strength and maybe comment in particular on China?","And we've heard a lot of macro concerns about China, but it seems like your business may be charging right through those. So perhaps could you elaborate on what's driving the strength in your mind?","John Culver","Yes. Hey, David, this is John. Clearly we continue to see very strong momentum across the region, and the 11% comp growth is indicative of that, 10% of that was transactions. We're tracking more customers now than ever before into our stores across all the markets we operate in.","And when you look at the comp growth in China, as our comp growth in China has outperformed the overall regional comp growth again this quarter, which is very encouraging.","A couple of things that are in play. First is the relevance of the brand and the fact that we are building this coffeehouse ritual and more and more customers are coming in. We're increasing the level of frequency of our existing customers, and then we're also attracting new customers into the brand each and every day.","In addition, what we're seeing is that as we've accelerated the store growth across the last several years is that our stores are more accessible. And with that, we're also seeing very strong performance from a financial standpoint in the first year stores, as well as in the second and third year age class stores as well.","Digital is becoming a bigger piece of our business across Asia to include China. We now account in several of our markets 40% of our transactions is done through the Starbucks card. And so digital is becoming a bigger piece of that.","And then the last piece I would say is, when you look at the store designs and the store environment that we're creating, we are truly creating a third place inviting environment for our customers to come with their family and friends, and this is resonating very strong.","Yesterday, I had the opportunity to hand out awards for the top store designs, and it just reminded me of the fact of both the beautiful stores and the beautiful spaces that we're creating across the region.","The big opportunity that we have going forward is this morning daypart and the development of the morning daypart. And increasingly we're seeing more and more relevance towards morning, but we do see this as an opportunity to continue to develop and grow that.","But we're highly encouraged by what we're seeing across the region and in particular in China. As Howard mentioned, 1700 stores now in over 90 cities, and we're well on our way to that 10,000 store goal across the region over the next five years.","David Tarantino","Great. Thank you.","John Culver","Yes.","Operator","The next question is from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.","John Ivankoe","Thank you. Howard, in your prepared remarks and I'm not going to call you exactly, but I'm going to try, but you said that Starbucks' opportunity was about serving existing demand as opposed to creating new demand. And that was just a very interesting comment just related to the latent demand that presumably exists within the United States.","And as you think about all the different things that you have that can bring additional customers, whether they are new customers or you are bringing in existing customers more often into existing Starbucks stores and into new Starbucks stores.","Can you compartmentalize really how big of a revenue opportunity that you see for Starbucks in the Americas that can be reached, or just to your existing store footprint, maybe how much is available over time through new store footprint and a bigger variety of different formats?","Howard Schultz","Let me try to answer that in a number of ways. First off, I think you would all agree that unequivocally we have proven and demonstrated that anyone who a year or two or even three thought that Starbucks might be achieving a level of saturation in the US or North America is clearly not the case.","I think the ability that we have from a design standpoint and real estate acquisition to create segmentation in our design and uniquely be able to position Starbucks has given us opportunities that perhaps very few people thought existed in terms of the size and scale of the market.","I can't give you the specific number, but I can tell you that we believe that we are a long way from the average unit volume of a Starbucks store achieving its ceiling. And I think one of the unique strengths that we've developed over the last couple of years is being able to identify need states and then to link that need state with the right product made for our customers in a customized fashion.","And so, you know, John, you've been covering the company for many, many years, and so you know perhaps better than anyone else that there was a time when Starbucks' entire business pretty much happened 70% to 80% of it before noon. Well, that's not the case today.","What's happening today is that we have identified, developed and executed against the strategy of leveraging the fixed asset we have throughout the daypart by creating need states products, and now we're going to extend that to evening.","So when you link the fact that we still think we're in the early stages of what the average unit volume could be, coupled with our ability, I think this is the third, maybe the fourth consecutive year of best-of-class new store performance, given our store base, its pretty unusual.","And what I was trying to say in my prepared remarks and don't take me literally is that, we are not in the business every single day of just trying to intercept traffic. We're in the business of creating demand through the experience, the trust in the brand, the social impact of what Starbucks is about, the trust the people have in who we are as a company, and obviously the value proposition and the unique experience that people are having.","I think it's over 20 years now that we have talked about the relevancy of the third place. We haven't talked about that in quite some time. The truth of the matter is that the third place that we have established all over the world has become as relevant as the product itself. And so when you couple all of these things together and you create the kind of position we now have in the marketplace and you can leverage that scale.","And I think the thing we have done really, really well and it's quite a challenge is, how do you get big and stay small? How do you maintain intimacy and trust with your customers and your brand when you are as ubiquitous as Starbucks has become?","And the way you do that is through local relevancy and the kind of product design and experience that we've now been able to create around the world.","Its one thing to talk about 23,000 stores in 67 countries, but the fact is if we transported ourselves to China or Spain or France or Malaysia or Singapore, today, you'd see and feel the kind of experience that you were enjoying in New York City.","Yet it's highly localized, highly relevant and most importantly the culture and values of the company continues to be the brand competitive difference of what we've been able to create around the world.","So I still believe these are early days for the company, not only in terms of the innovation that we've talked about digitally and through Mobile Order & Pay and other things that we have in the pipeline, but our core business. And our core business is reconfirming every single day our leadership position in all things coffee.","Kevin touched on the roastery, the roastery and Starbucks reserve is a big, big idea that is going to put a halo on the entire company, as we are not going to allow any small company or independent in any way to subordinate our position as a leader in all things coffee.","And the interesting thing about that and then I'll stop because it's pretty long winded, is not only are we able every single day to reaffirm our leadership position in all things coffee, but at the same time create the kind of beverages that are more impulsive like Frappuccino in ways that are accretive to the brand and not dilutive to the brand of coffee.","And so once again, I think we're doing things that are very difficult to do in terms of balancing scale, relevancy, the equity of the brand, product innovation and most importantly really taking the company from a typical bricks and mortar environment just 3 years ago to a new arena and kind of reinventing what it means to be a traditional bricks and mortar retailer whose relevancy has to be where people live, where they work and where they play and on every device that they are using in terms of the equity and the emotionality of the brand.","John Ivankoe","Thank you.","Operator","That was our last question at this time. I will now turn the call back over to JoAnn DeGrande.","JoAnn DeGrande","Thank you, Mike. Thank you all for joining us this afternoon. We appreciate your time.

[Operator Instructions]","I will now turn the call over to Durga Doraisamy, Vice President of Investor Relations.

Today's discussion will be led by Kevin Johnson, President and CEO; and Pat Grismer, CFO. And for Q&A, we'll be joined by Roz Brewer, Chief Operating Officer and Group President Americas; John Culver, Group President, International Channel Development and Global Coffee and Tea.","This conference call will include forward-looking statements which are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements. Any such statements should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements in our earnings release and risk factor discussions in our filings with the SEC, including our last annual report on Form 10-K.

This agenda is enabling more consistent, predictable results through focused and disciplined execution.","Q2 was another solid quarter where we executed well against our long-term strategic priorities. We sustained positive sales momentum in the U.S., delivering up 4% sales comp and a second consecutive quarter of slightly positive transaction growth. We drove a sequential improvement in China sales comp at 3% with a meaningful increase in transaction comp as well while continuing the rapid expansion of our store base.","We opened our 30,000 stores globally and maintained a pace of 7% worldwide net store growth over the past 12 months, which is industry-leading for a company of our scale. Through the Global Coffee Alliance with Nestl\u00e9, we expanded our CPG presence into six new markets, and launched Starbucks Coffee on the Nespresso and Dolce Gusto single-serve platforms. And we realized meaningful results from our continued focus on disciplined cost reduction, which helped to mitigate the margin dilutive impact of significant investments made over the past year. Now, these results are a testament to the strength of the Starbucks brand and the power of our customer partner connections, which are important sources of competitive advantage throughout the 78 markets where we collectively serve more than 100 million customer occasions each week.","We are managing the business for long-term growth and value creation by staying true to the mission and values that built this great company, while at the same time embracing new ideas and innovating in ways that are relevant to our customers, inspiring to our partners, and meaningful to our business. We believe this is what builds an enduring company. Our streamlined efforts over the past two years have enabled us to focus more of our resources and management attention on the core drivers of our business and then execute with discipline.","We are making meaningful progress against our three key strategic priorities, accelerating growth in our two target long-term growth markets, the U.S. and China; expanding the global reach of our brand through the Global Coffee Alliance with Nestl\u00e9; and increasing shareholder returns.","Streamline is all about simplifying our business while adopting new ways of working so that we can respond to customers\u2019 evolving needs with greater speed and agility, and deliver more sustainable and predictable financial outcomes. As evidenced by the past three quarters\u2019 results, our Streamline strategy is working. One way that we are streamlining our business is by consolidating our Company ownership positions, most recently focusing on Europe. In fact, I was in Europe last week, meeting with our licensed partners, including Alsea to whom we successfully transitioned our Company operated stores in France and the Netherlands, in Q2. Following this transaction, our EMEA segment is now almost 90% licensed. We will continue to evaluate our global store ownership footprint for opportunities to further optimize our portfolio, improve profitability and unlock shareholder value without sacrificing growth. Over the past nine months, our Streamline activities have also fundamentally transformed the way we work to drive a more rapid pace of innovation throughout the Company.","We started our journey in September, restructuring leadership to better support our retail stores, in line with our long-term priorities. We also started to change the way we work to accelerate innovation by embracing modern-day methodologies, including human-centered design that amplifies focus on the customer; smaller cross functional teams that go from idea to action in 100 days, and then learn and adapt; and new applications of machine learning that support various aspects of our business. We also consolidated and centralized our customer and partner research capabilities to provide a single source of quantitative and qualitative insights to inform decisions across the Company.","We clearly defined priorities informed by customer research, our teams are working on a number of innovation projects in our Tryer lab in Seattle, the Tryer lab is a new space that we created complete with all of the assets needed to ideate, prototype and benchmark new store design concepts, in-store equipment, store operations, and many other projects. This new lab enables cross-functional teams to develop a wide range of innovation that is enabling us to constantly improve the customer partner experience in our stores. Collectively, these actions are accelerating the pace of innovation and driving the improving business results that we\u2019ve reported in recent quarters while also building a pipeline of future ideas in the areas of store design, beverage platforms and customer experience.","I will now highlight the progress we're making against each of our strategic priorities, starting in U.S. where we focused on three key drivers of growth, enhancing the in-store experience, delivering beverage innovation, and driving digital relationships. Enhancing the in-store experience encompasses building customer connections and creating those best moments that keep customers coming back, time and time again. We saw continued improvement in our customer connection scores this quarter, driven by the actions we are taking to enable our store partners to better connect with customers. This reinforces our actions are working.","Our efforts in the area of beverage innovation also paid off in Q2 with continued momentum in cold beverage platforms across multiple dayparts. Supported only with the social media strategy that was the second most viral Starbucks campaign ever, Cloud Macchiato launched in March to great success, exceeding our expectations and driving incremental customer occasions. We also received a very strong customer response to our Matcha beverage platform. And finally during the second quarter, we crossed the 50% mark for the deployment of Nitro cold brew in the U.S. company operated stores and we remain on track to reach our goal of 100% deployment, by the end of fiscal 2019.","We are building on this momentum with a strong beverage innovation plan for the summer with product offerings that we believe will address customers\u2019 seasonal taste preferences and needs based. With respect to driving digital relationships, we are pleased with the continued momentum of our Starbucks rewards program.","In the second quarter, we expanded our active member base by 0.5 million customers, a 13% increase that takes active rewards membership to 16.8 million. This momentum has a positive impact on a results with Starbucks rewards members accounting for 41% of sales in U.S. stores in Q2. We are also very pleased with the smooth rollout of our enhanced Starbucks Rewards Loyalty program that provides customers greater choice and flexibility in redeeming rewards.","In addition, we expanded the Starbucks Delivers program in the second quarter to almost 1,600 stores across seven major markets in the U.S. It is still early days in our primary focus is to drive customer awareness that leads to trial and adoption of this new channel. This approach is enabling us to refine the program as it grows and ensure a quality customer experience. We remain excited about the potential of delivery and will continue to update you on our progress in coming quarters.","Finally, we announced a $100 million investment in Valor Siren Ventures to continue to accelerate the pace of innovation by providing Starbucks with early visibility and access to the most relevant technologies, products and solutions for the retail industry. The combination of measurable improvements and customer connection, market response to new beverage platforms and continued growth in active Rewards members provide evidence this strategy is working.","I will now move on to our second key growth markets, China, where a year ago, we were integrating our East China acquisition as we unify China mainland into a company operated market. With that integration largely complete, all stores opened for 13 months or longer in China mainland are now included in our comp base, starting in Q2.","China delivered 3% comp sales growth for the quarter, up from 1% in Q1 with meaningful improvement in traffic comp, relative to the prior three quarters. This performance is especially noteworthy when you consider the intensity of competition from discounting in China, as well as our aggressive pace of new store development.","On the development front, we opened 553 net new stores over the last 12 months, representing a 17% annual growth rate. Importantly, we continue to achieve best in class profitability and returns on these investments, which reinforces our conviction to sustain a pace of 600 net new stores annually with the goal of reaching 6,000 stores in fiscal \u201822.","This development program is fundamental to our strategy of building the category-leading concept in the world's fastest growing major economy. While the growth in long-term opportunity of China\u2019s specialty coffee category will continue to attract many competitors, our leadership position is underpinned by our brand strength and operating results, which are the key points of competitive advantage in China.","We win because of the premium quality of our coffee and handcrafted beverages, the exceptional third place experience we create in each store, and the emotional connection that our partners have built with our customers. Each of these points of differentiation is reflected in customer feedback from a recent brand equity survey that we performed annually, which reaffirmed that Starbucks continues to lead across key consumer metrics in the specialty coffee category and is the customers\u2019 first choice for away from home coffee.","We're building on that brand strength and have successfully rolled out Starbucks Delivers in partnership with Alibaba to more than 2,100 stores across 35 cities throughout China. Our team in China accomplished this in only four months, again demonstrating our operational agility. While still in the launch phase, performance to date is meeting our expectations with average delivery time under 20 minutes, higher average ticket and strong trial from existing Starbucks Rewards members. This gives us confidence that we are building a meaningful and sustainable delivery channel to complement our existing in-store experience as we plan to expand Starbucks Delivers to 3,000 stores across 50 cities in China, by the end of fiscal 2019.","We are very pleased with the performance of the new Starbucks Rewards program in China, Since the launch a mere four months ago, member acquisition has accelerated. And 90-day active Rewards members increased by 1 million during Q2 to total of 8.3 million. The phenomenal growth of the Starbucks Rewards program in China is a testament to the power of the brand. We are now building on this momentum with plans to bring mobile order and pay to China by the end of fiscal 2019. We are making this new feature available by leveraging our current digital infrastructure and the Starbucks app to enhance our ability to serve customers, both on our app and in our stores.","We are very pleased with our continued success in China. The strength and relevance of the brand, expansion and performance of our new stores, accelerating comp growth in existing stores, positive progress on Starbucks Delivers, and a phenomenal customer reception to the Starbucks Rewards program are all signs that we are well-positioned for long-term growth in China.","And moving on to our second strategic priority, expanding our global reach through the Global Coffee Alliance with Nestl\u00e9. The Global Coffee Alliance exceeded our expectations during the second quarter from a top-line perspective and continues to expand the reach of the Starbucks brand.","Late in fiscal Q2, Nestl\u00e9 launched the first 24 Starbucks SKUs across three platforms, Starbucks coffee by Nespresso, Starbucks coffee by Dolce Gusto, and Starbucks roasted brown and whole bean coffees through CPG channels. These products co-created by Starbucks and Nestl\u00e9 are now being deployed to 16 global markets as part of our Wave 1 rollout through September. The first six of these markets launched in March, extending our reach to major retailers. Retailers are supported by a full suite of marketing resources that are adaptable for each market across digital, social, and in-store channels, to drive greater awareness of the Starbucks brand globally.","The inaugural launch marks just the beginning for this Global Coffee Alliance with the robust pipeline of new products and markets for Starbucks at home and in foodservices lined up to support future growth, driving financial returns as well as the worldwide expansion of the brand.","And finally, I will share the progress we\u2019re making on our third strategic priority, increasing our focus on shareholder returns.","In March, we initiated a new $2 billion, accelerated share repurchase plan, which we expect to complete by the end of June. This puts us on a path to deliver over 80% of our $25 billion shareholder capital return commitment by the end of this fiscal year. With a significant operating cash that our business continues to generate and a unwatchful on investment returns, we are well on our way to delivering against our shareholder capital return commitment.","In summary, the strength of our performance in Q2 has further validated our Growth at Scale agenda and the strategies we are pursuing to create long-term shareholder value with more sustainable, predictable business results, driven by focused and disciplined execution. We're making solid progress on each of our key strategies. But strategy is ultimately about execution. So, the credit for our success goes to the Starbucks partners around the world who probably wear the green apron. Each of them relentlessly delivers an elevated Starbucks experience, and for that I am both proud and grateful.","With greater focus and discipline, we have positioned our Company for the next chapter of growth, growth that is anchored in our mission, our values and in our brand promise. We are playing the long game as we continue to look to the future and build an enduring company.","With that, I'd like to now turn the discussion over the Pat to walk through consolidated and segment results for Q2, and provide an update on our full-year outlook. Pat?","Pat Grismer","Thank you, Kevin, and good afternoon, everyone.","I too am pleased with the sustained positive business momentum that we demonstrated in the second quarter. On a reported basis, total revenue grew 5%. Excluding the impact of Streamline related activities, notably the Global Coffee Alliance as well as the impact of foreign currency translation, total revenue grew 9%. This increase in revenue was underpinned by the growth of our global retail business, including net new store growth of 7% over the past 12 months, and global comp sales growth of 3%. Non-GAAP EPS of $0.60 was up 13% versus prior year and included a favorable impact of $0.01 related to discreet income tax items. ","I will now take you through our Q2 operating performance by segment. Our America segment delivered 8% revenue growth in Q2, driven by net new store growth of 4% over the past 12 months and 4% comp sales growth with slightly positive comp transaction growth in the U.S. for a second consecutive quarter, as Kevin highlighted earlier. Key drivers of America\u2019s comp sales growth in the quarter were an improved in-store experience and a stronger beverage platform. Beverage, our highest margin category, contributed 3 points of comp sales growth in Q2, while food drove 1 point comp of sales growth. Within beverage, our cold platform continued to perform well, led by refreshment, iced espresso and ice coffee. Beverage innovation also contributed to comp sales growth in the quarter with the successful launch of Cloud Macchiato and the ongoing strength of our Cold Foam platform.","And while much of the beverage comp sales growth was driven by ticket, close to half of the ticket growth was from beverage mix and attach, demonstrating that our higher margin premium offerings resonate with customers, and customers bought more beverages per transaction. From a daypart perspective, we saw continued strong transaction growth at peak. Additionally, afternoon performance improved for a third consecutive quarter with the best performance in the past three years as our improved in-store experience is driving improvement across all dayparts.","In addition to strong revenue performance, America's non-GAAP operating margin expanded 120 basis points to 21.3% in Q2, primarily due to sales leverage, cost savings initiatives and new revenue recognition accounting on stored value card breakage, partially offset by partner and technology investments, which were largely funded by upside from U.S. tax reform.","Moving on to China Asia Pacific or CAP, our fastest growing business segment. CAP segment revenues grew 9% in Q2. Excluding the 4% impact of foreign currency translation, revenue grew 13% in the quarter. This was driven by 12% net new store growth over the past 12 months and 2% comp sales growth.","I would now like to highlight the second quarter performance of two key markets in our CAP segment, China and Japan. We continued to open new stores at a rapid pace in China, growing store count by 17% versus the prior year. Importantly, our new stores continued to deliver exceptionally high returns, even with higher market penetration. China also delivered comp sales growth of 3% in Q2 with just a 1% decline in comp transactions, a meaningful improvement relative to the prior three quarters, helped by delivery and other digital initiatives. 4% comp ticket growth was driven by pricing, merchandise and food. The momentum we saw in our Japan business at the start of the fiscal year, continues into Q2, driving 3% comp sales growth as well as comp transaction growth for the third consecutive quarter. These results were driven by successful LTO performance in blended and espresso beverages, as well as the continued growth of our Starbucks Rewards program in Japan.","CAP\u2019s non-GAAP operating margin increased by 60 basis points to 23.2%, primarily due to sales leverage and cost savings initiatives.","Onto our Channel Development segment, which recorded a revenue decline of 21% in Q2, including the impact of the Global Coffee Alliance, which reduced segment revenues by approximately $120 million in the quarter, as expected. Excluding the impact of the Global Coffee Alliance, segment revenues were flat. Non-GAAP operating margin declined by 730 basis points to 34.3% in Q2, largely due to the impact of Streamline. Absent the 640 basis-point Streamline impact, the segment\u2019s non-GAAP operating margin declined 90 basis points. While the profitability of the segment will continue to evolve, we are pleased with the growth in overall performance that the Global Coffee Alliance is driving, which is slightly ahead of our expectations to-date in fiscal \u201819 and is supporting the continued expansion of the Starbucks brand worldwide.","Consolidated operating margin totaled 15.8% on a non-GAAP basis, down 40 basis points year-over-year, largely due to the impact of licensing our Channel Development business. Excluding the 80 basis-point unfavorable impact of Streamline activities, non-GAAP operating margin expanded by approximately 40 basis points, reflecting the impact of cost savings initiatives, sales leverage, and new revenue recognition accounting for card breakage, partially offset by investments in our partners, technology and siren retail.","Moving on to our guidance for fiscal \u201819. Now, at the midpoint of our fiscal year, we have better visibility to anticipated full-year results. We now expect fiscal 2019 GAAP EPS in the range of $2.40 to $2.44, up from a range of $2.32 to $2.37. Our fiscal 2019 non-GAAP EPS is now expected to be in the range of $2.75 to $2.79, the midpoint of which implies approximately 14% year-over-year growth. Relative to our previous non-GAAP EPS range of $2.68 to $2.73 for fiscal 2019, two-thirds of the increase is attributable to tax benefits and one-third is driven by better than expected operating results to-date in fiscal \u201819.","At the consolidated level, we still expect operating margin for fiscal \u201819 to be down moderately relative to fiscal \u201818. Compared to previous expectations, this reflects an improvement in Americas operating margin, offset by a reduction in Channel Development operating margin and continued investments in siren retail. Driven by better than expected sales, we now expect Americas operating margin for fiscal \u201819 to improve slightly versus prior year. Conversely, Channel Development operating margin for fiscal \u201819 is now expected to land in the mid 30% range due to shifts and sales mix. That said, we continue to be pleased with the overall performance of the Global Coffee Alliance.","Additionally, for fiscal \u201819, we now expect our GAAP effective tax rate to be in the range of 20% to 22% and non-GAAP effective tax rate to be in the range of 19% to 21% with improvements attributable to discrete tax benefits.","All other full-year 2019 guidance metrics, including global comp growth and net new stores, are unchanged from what was previously communicated and reaffirmed on our first quarter fiscal \u201819 earnings call.","Although we don't provide annual G&A guidance, we would like to really affirm and clarify our previous commitment to reduce G&A by 100 basis points as a percentage of system sales over a three-year period ending in fiscal \u201821, net of investments. We are absolutely committed to delivering on this commitment and will do so by limiting non-GAAP G&A to approximately $1.7 billion for fiscal \u201821. This will equate to a three-year CAGR of approximately 1% in non-GAAP G&A with fiscal \u201818 as our base. Given our commitment to sustain high single digit revenue growth, this disciplined management of G&A will help to unlock operating leverage in our overall economic model. We will accomplish this through a combination of cost reductions and sales leverage, even as we continue to invest in areas that are essential to the growth and vibrancy of our business. A large portion of these investments will be made this year, primarily a carryover of investments initiated in fiscal \u201818, and largely funded by upside from U.S. tax reform. These investments also include the impact of our siren retail business, which is expected to dilute our overall operating margin by approximately 70 basis points this fiscal year. These investments are a key reason for our margin performance today in fiscal \u201819, despite the meaningful comp sales growth we\u2019ve delivered. Please note that all of this is consistent with our full-year guidance for 2019, as well as our ongoing growth algorithm.","To summarize, we are very pleased with our performance in the second quarter and fiscal \u201819 year-to-date. We are confident in our ability to deliver our fiscal \u201819 guidance while investing for the long-term to build an enduring brand. Of course, none of this would be possible without the significant efforts of all our partners in our 78 markets across the globe. It is their unwavering commitment to serving our customers that drives the financial results and the outlook that I\u2019ve shared today.","And with that, Kevin and I are happy to take your questions, joined by Roz Brewer and John Culver as Durga outlined at the top of our call. Thank you. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions] Our first question comes from the line of John Glass with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","John Glass","Hey. Thanks very much. I wondered if you could just talk a little bit about what unlocked the U.S. margin improvement this quarter. If you exclude the impairment or the restructuring charge, it was a meaningful improvement versus the prior quarter, and comps really didn't change. And, so maybe talk about what the components are that you got this quarter, you didn't see last quarter. And when you talk about modest or slight improvement in the year, it seems like with the back half being easier, you're lapping some of the investments you made a year ago, post tax reform that may actually be -- it would seem that that's a modest assumption, just a modest improvement in U.S. margins.","Pat Grismer","John, this is Pat. Thank you for the question. We are very pleased with Americas\u2019 overall margin performance. And just to highlight, non-GAAP operating margin was up 120 basis points versus prior year, which was a meaningful sequential improvement from the 60 basis-point contraction in Americas\u2019 non-GAAP operating margin in Q1. And there were really three key drivers of the improvement. First, sales leverage, which included the impact of pricing, as well as cost savings initiatives, primarily in supply chain. I would also highlight, however, contribution from an accounting change related to breakage, which benefited our non-GAAP operating margin. These were offset, as you mentioned, to some extent, by the investments that we made in our partners and in technology. Those investments were largely initiated starting in Q3 of last year and were predominantly funded by upside for U.S. tax reform.","So, you're absolutely right because we make our way into the back half of fiscal \u201819. We will face less pressure from those investments. However, I\u2019d highlight, we are making a meaningful investment in the fourth quarter in the Americas division, behind a leadership conference. And that is factored into our overall guidance for the year. But, it's on that basis that we have taken up our full-year guidance for Americas\u2019 non-GAAP operating margin to a slight improvement versus prior year versus last quarter when we had outlook a slight degradation in margin, year-over-year for the full year.","Operator","Our next question comes from line of Sharon Zackfia with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.","Sharon Zackfia","Hi. Good afternoon. I guess, I'd be curious to hear how the digital relationships are going that are not Starbucks Rewards. And if you could kind of quantify where that is now. I think, last quarter it was 13 million. And how much that's contributing to the acceleration you're seeing and the Starbucks rewards memberships itself, kind of in a conversion there?","Roz Brewer","Thanks, Sharon. Just a few numbers for you. We are seeing about 16.8 million active SR members, that\u2019s up 13%. We are still seeing our MOP continuing to grow just over 15%, and that's up 3% from prior year, flat quarter-to-quarter. Our registered, non-SR digital relationships grew to 15.3 million. And so, that's up just over 2%. This is the quarter that we did introduce the new multi-tier redemption plan, which includes also the redemption for all for our new members. And so, we are just in the beginning of that program. And this is part of the growth that we are expecting in the future.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matthew DiFrisco with Guggenheim Securities. Please proceed with your question.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi. This is Matt [ph] on for Matt. Just one question on the China traffic. I know it\u2019s roughly four quarters of negative traffic at this point. I was just wondering why you're not seeing better support from the Rewards program, and if you think the mobile order and pay is the key unlock to transaction growth in China.","John Culver","Yes. Matt, this is John. I would say that first off, as I shared at the investor conference in December, the key metric that we track as it relates to transaction is total transaction growth in the market, and we saw strong double-digit transaction growth across the entire store portfolio. As a reminder, over 80% of our total revenue growth is driven by our new stores, and the rest is driven by same-store sales. We did see sequential improvement in transactions in our comp stores in the quarter, and I think that\u2019s important to note. And obviously rewards continue to play a key role. From a rewards standpoint, our Rewards membership, we basically up leveled our current program from a frequency-based program to a spend-based program in December. Our 90-day active membership in the quarter, since that change, has increased over 25% on a year-over-year basis.","We now have 8.3 million active 90-day members, and that is a significant step change in terms of the growth rate from what we've seen previously in the program. And today, when you look at Rewards in our stores in China, they represent -- our Rewards members represent over 50% of transactions in our Starbucks stores. Now, clearly, as we continue to lay the rails for digital footprint in China, MOP is going to play an important piece of that. And we're excited about the opportunity to launch MOP in the stores in China by the end of this fiscal year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe with JP Morgan. Please proceed with the question.","John Ivankoe","I was hoping to get some insight on the labor market in the United States, and not just cost and availability, and I do want to address that for you as well. But, the turnover of labor that you're seeing at the store level, the quality that you're seeing at the store level, especially as it relates to processing peak hour transactions, and obviously we can see results broadly which do I think include a slightly positive, very slightly positive same store traffic. But, are there any issues that you're seeing even on a local market basis across the U.S., and what are you doing to be proactive to assume that the labor market is going to continue to tighten from here?","Roz Brewer","We\u2019ve not really seen really a change in our attrition rate or turnover rate in our labor in our stores. One of the things that I can tell you is that we are increasing our engagement with our partners in our stores. Right now, our customer connections scores are some of the highest in the history. We just experienced this quarter alone a 0.3% improvement over last year. So, we're moving in the right direction there. And lot of that work is coming from what we're doing in terms of making better jobs, easier work in the stores for our partners and actually adding training to the stores. I'll also mention too that we implemented team work this quarter, and team works with our labor scheduling initiatives and it allows our schedule accuracy to improve. And our partners really respond to that because they know their hours. And actually it makes the planning process much easier for the store manager and reduces the amount of work. So, we've got great engagement right now. We're not seeing a shift in our attrition right now.","Operator","Your next question comes from Andrew Charles with Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your question.","Andrew Charles","Great, thank you. Pat, just two separate model questions for you. Just, first on CAP. Can you quantify the impact of CAP margins from the Ele.me delivery commissions? And is there an elevated headwind the margins in the quarter that we should be thinking about as perhaps you subsidize consumer-facing fees to build awareness? And then, I know this could be in the Q, but can you also disclose how much of Americas\u2019 2Q gross margins improvement was attributable to the accounting change and gift card breakage, given 2Q is the seasonally heaviest timeframe for redemptions? And just on that, is there any net benefit that you're seeing from the gift card breakage change and accounting structure versus what was an interesting income before? Is there any net benefit, if you will, to EPS, or is that net neutral?","Pat Grismer","So, Andrew, I'll take the gift card breakage part of your question first, then we'll come back to the question on China. First, I want to clarify how the new accounting standard is impacting our P&L generally and then share some perspective on how this has impacted our operating margin specifically. We adopted the new revenue recognition accounting standard this fiscal year. And for the most part, the standard reclassifies stored value card breakage from the interest in other mine below operating income and outside of segment results to the revenue line at the segment level. The new standard also introduces some timing changes, but those are relatively minor. So, on an annual basis, it's mostly a matter of P&L geography that doesn't have a significant impact on EPS.","I also want to clarify that breakage is not accounted for in comp sales. It's simply another revenue driver after new stores and comp sales. On a full-year basis, this change in accounting does have a beneficial impact to non-GAAP operating margin of about 40 basis points with the greatest impact in Q2 due to seasonality. All of this is reflected in our full-year operating margin guidance for fiscal \u201819 at both the consolidated and segment levels.","With respect to the impact to the Americas and how prominent this was, I do want to highlight that the individual beneficial margin impacts of sales leverage and cost savings, primarily from supply chain, were greater than the positive impact that we realized from the accounting change. So, my view is that fundamental business performance was far and away the driver of our improved operating performance in the Americas. It was not driven by an accounting change.","The other thing I would say about the performance in the Americas is that we've seen much higher levels of customer partner engagement. And we believe that this is contributing strongly to our performance across all dayparts in the Americas. So, that's some perspective on the accounting change, and where that sits relative to other drivers of margin performance in the quarter.","With respect to the question you raised around the impact of Ele.me and whether there's a significant impact to our overall margin equation because of commissions and so forth, that is not the case. Really, what\u2019s the performance in China is fundamental business performance, where we're seeing sales leverage, which includes some measure of pricing but also very strong improvement in average spend along with continued discipline and cost management. And that\u2019s what\u2019s driving the margin performance, and we expect that that will sustain. We do not anticipate that because of Ele.me or other digital initiatives, that\u2019s going to have a meaningful impact to our margin equation in that market.","John Culver","And Andrew, this is John. I would just add on the margin question on CAP overall. In the quarter, we did see an 80 basis-point improvement in margin and that was driven by the sales leverage and cost savings initiatives that the teams have put in place over there, which we guided toward.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Tarantino with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.","David Tarantino","My question is on the U.S. business and specifically on the recent changes you made to the Rewards program. Wondering if you could comment on how those changes have been received initially by consumers. I think Kevin mentioned that the rollout was smooth. But maybe there's some media reports that suggest otherwise. So, if you could just comment on that? And then, secondly, if you could talk about your vision for how that will help to drive the business moving forward? Thanks.","Roz Brewer","Thank you, David. So, a couple of data points that I will share with you. So, the program is newly launched, just in the last couple of weeks. And so far ,we continue to closely monitor the member calls and the commentary versus our call centers. And today, the volume has been well below our forecast. And we've also been monitoring social media as well. And if you are comparing this to times in the past when we made these transitions, this has significantly lower our response from our customers and any transition they are experiencing. The program -- the vision for the program is to really provide more access to potential members. So if you think about it, the first part of it is allowing our new members to have rewards earlier. So, to give you an example, they earn rewards right away, the first rewards comes at 25 starts after two to three visits. In the past, your first free reward would have come after 30 to 40 free visits. And so, this is an opportunities for us to start our customers out and earning and redeeming stars right away.","The second part of it along the lines of the multi-tier redemption for our current members is an option for them to really redeem their stars when they reach 125 stars. Now members are able to redeem their stars at fivetier levels, ranging from 25 to 400 stars, and also to expand the number of items that they can redeem, like merchandise or at home coffee. So, it\u2019s a much broader expanded program for us. There is no star expiration for Starbucks Rewards credit cardholders. So, we think that this program is more accessible for us. We\u2019ve also launched behind this a new Starbucks rewards approximately, so that you can have the interface for the partner. So, when the partner sees your name come up, they are able to know how many starts you have available and begin to explain the program to you when you initially come to the store. So, that\u2019s different than what we\u2019ve had before. We think that that is keeping any of the dissension down just because our partners are now able to explain the program right from the POS system and tell them what's available to them.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sara Senatore with Bernstein. Pleased proceed with your question.","Sara Senatore","Great, thank you. I have a question about the MSR spend per member, just trying to sort of back of the envelope, it looks you might have seen a bit of improvement in either the non-MSR spend per member or the MSR spend, which it might be. So, I just wanted to know, first of all, is that the case, and what you might attribute it to in terms of is it this new loyalty program getting MSR numbers in, is it more of the happy hours that are getting the non-members in. So, just wanted to confirm our calculations and also the drivers. And I did have a point of clarification on the margins in the Channel Development. You said the issue was mix and is it geographic mix or product mix? Just trying to understand that.","Roz Brewer","Sara, this is Roz. I'll start with what we're seeing in terms of spend per member, and any other changes that could be happening. First of all, the new program is much too new to equate any dollars to it and understand the performance yet. I will tell you that we are seeing an improvement in our afternoon business. We have seen when we introduced more of our cold beverage innovations, it's improving afternoons and are non-SR members tend to chat with us in the afternoon. We're also seeing our drive-through performance increase, and we've added labor hours to our drive-through to accommodate that. So, we do think that we are getting a -- this is a first or actually the second quarter we've seen a slight uptick in our afternoon performance. We believe we will continue to see that based on the kind of beverage innovation that we are seeing. But our current spend per member stayed in line with what we've seen in the past.","Pat Grismer","And then, Sara, this is Pat, responding to your question regarding Channel Development margin. We did experience a higher mix of lower margin sales in our Channel Development segment, primarily Tazo sales to Unilever, and overall volume subject to our Global Coffee Alliance with Nestl\u00e9. ","Also contributing to the lower segment margin for the quarter was a non-recurring adjustment for intangible asset amortization, which is not material to our full-year segment or consolidated outlook. And I do want to reinforce that although the full-year segment margin for Channel Development will be lower than we had previously guided, we remained very pleased with the progress we're making with the Global Coffee Alliance with Nestl\u00e9, and how that's expanding the presence of our brand globally.","Operator","Your next question comes from Dennis Geiger with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Dennis Geiger","Great. Thank you. Roz, wondering if you could talk some more about the throughput and the operations opportunity in the U.S. Where are you now with that effort, what kind of benefits maybe have you seen in recent quarters, and I guess how significant can that be? And I guess, the last piece of that, is there any chance of the increased customer engagement is any kind of drag on that or no? Thanks.","Roz Brewer","So, actually, the work that we're seeing on in-store execution is going well for us. A lot of the work that we're doing is automating some of the processes in the stores. Team work\u2019s being the first part of that in terms of labor scheduling and taking hours away from our store managers. We are -- actually removed about 12 hours of work in the stores at this point. So, we'll continue to do that level of work -- administrative work. That's exactly right, administrative work, things like scheduling and work that needs to be done in the store. And it's actually creating more time for customer-facing opportunities. And so, that's where we're seeing customer connection scores increase and actually a chance for our baristas to do the best job that they can in terms of things like informing our customers of the new MTR program. So, we're really actually still moving in that direction. I will also mention too, in terms of do we see anything impact that in the feature, we\u2019ve got plans through the rest of the year to continue to improve the work in the stores, the administrative work in the stores. And you will continue to see that work really. And the way we're monitoring it is to really look at customer connection for us and also partner engagement.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Jeffrey Bernstein","I had a question on the store ownership structure. Kevin, I know you mentioned it in your prepared remarks and Pat I figured you have a fresh sort of eyes and have franchising experience in your past. So, just wondering, the U.S. business specifically, more than 50% of the stores are still company operated, and I know you talked how you made a big push recently around more of the European region and pushed that pretty significantly licensed. So, I\u2019m just wondering how you think about the right balance of ownership you would think and investors seem to believe it, an increase in the licensing mix with obviously easy operating volatility but also allow maybe for increase in leverage, great return of cash, perhaps better valuation. Just wondering how each of you think about the appropriate mix and maybe what factors might impact the decision, both positively and negatively.","Kevin Johnson","Yes. Jeffrey, this is Kevin. Let me begin and kind of share strategic perspective and I will let Pat jump in and add to this. But, over the last two years, as part of our Streamline efforts, we\u2019ve been focused -- one element of Streamline is retail market alignment. And much of that has been looking at our international markets and making the determination, are those markets best operated in a licensed structure or a company operated structure. So we\u2019ve transitioned to number of markets to licensed partners while at the same time acquiring 100% of the joint venture in East China and unifying China mainland as company operated. And so, we're going to continue to do that. In the markets that we have transitioned to license partners, we\u2019ve transitioned these markets to long-term license partners that oftentimes operate in other markets. Example, most recently in Europe, we transitioned France and the Netherlands to Alsea, who\u2019s a longtime partner who has managed and grown the Starbucks brand in many other markets around the world. And so, by doing that -- that is not only a better financial outcome but it\u2019s also -- they will grow that market faster than we would have. And so, we support those licensed partners in doing that. And we\u2019ve got great respect to the value that they can bring and the way they can bring the brand to life in those markets.","Now, your question, sort of touch upon the U.S. In the U.S. if you look at the returns that we get from operating the U.S as a company-operated market, our ability to bring the brand to life and operate, generates not only maximum financial outcomes for shareholders but it also allows us to ensure that we're establishing and setting the brand in the right way that we are able to then leverage with other markets around the world. Pat, I will let you add to that.","Pat Grismer","Thank you, Kevin. Jeff, the way we typically think about ownership with respect to any market is really guided by three dimensions, unit level profitability; investment returns; and long-term growth. And when you look at the shape of our U.S. business, what you see is a very high level of profitability, led by the fact that we are a average first concept which has very high gross margin. We have very strong investment returns in our new units, again, led by the fact that we're a beverage first concept that doesn't have a kitchen, it can tend to weigh on total investment and so our sales to investment ratio is very strong in the U.S. and then growth. Even for a concept with our level of penetration, we have significant runway remaining. And that's why as part of our total growth algorithm, we indicated that we saw the U.S. business to continue growing net units at a rate of 3% to 4% per year, which I think is industry-leading for a concept of our scale in a market like the U.S.","And the reality is, with our level of company ownership and our continued commitment to investing behind that growth, we are creating significant shareholder value for the long term by maintaining that ownership position, which is balanced very nicely with a very large and growing licensed business. So, the mix feels very good. And there's no doubt that we\u2019re creating significant shareholder value by maintaining and growing our ownership position in the U.S.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Gregory Francfort with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.","Gregory Francfort","Just a quick one on the accounting change. Can you quantify if there was an EBITDA dollar impact and what that was during the quarter? And then, my strategic question is just on -- store growth if I think in the U.S. is now 2 points lower than it was maybe a year or two ago. Have you seen changes in cannibalization as you slowed store growth, and how do you quantify that and kind of what are you seeing in the numbers that suggest that that strategy is played out and maybe supporting your per store business?","Pat Grismer","Gregory, this is Pat. I\u2019ll address the first part of your question in relation to the accounting and then Roz will take the question on U.S. store growth. The accounting change, I'm not going to put a dollar amount on it. But as I indicated earlier, the favorable impact to our consolidated operating margin, our non-GAAP operating margin in the quarter was about 60 basis points. And we do expect that that impact is going to be the highest in Q2 for reasons of seasonality.","And then, over to Ross.","Roz Brewer","Yes. So, Greg, on -- if we're seeing any cannibalization and what are we doing around store growth in the Americas. We continue to add new stores. As you're probably aware, we're still in the period of store closures, which is going to be always a chance for us to really prune our business and look at what units are performing and not performing. Just in this quarter alone, if you look at the Company operated stores plus the license stores, this quarter, we're up 20 units, and we continue to have a fairly aggressive new store plan. So, what that would look like is that we actually opened 84 stores in this quarter, we closed 97. So, we're in a good position to continue to look at our portfolio and we're adding strategically.","One of the things if you were engaged with us during our investors call, we talked about looking at new formats. And so we're actually adding new formats in addition to that, understanding that the needs data convenience continues to grow, so, things like smaller units, more drive-through stores, and also advancing our cafes to make sure that they are up to date with new technology and new equipment. So, we remain pretty smart about what we're doing with our store development portfolio. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Will Slabaugh with Stephens. Please proceed with your question. ","Will Slabaugh","I had a question on updated thoughts on competition in China, just given new entrants and general coffee store growth in the region, and along those same lines, major competitors in that region offer a different experience, often the less inviting fiscal space, there could be much smaller. So, I\u2019m curious how you\u2019re thinking about the consumer behavior in your stores versus how they\u2019re behaving in better stores and if that makes you want to evolve anything you're currently doing in the market?","John Culver","This is John. I would say that from a China prospective, we continue to stay focused on the third place experience and elevating the coffee experience and the customer connection that our partners have with our customers who come in the door. In addition, we continue to expand our business into channels, whether that be through delivery, through new concepts that we're creating as well as through eventually the global coffee alliance later this year.","Now, Kevin talked about, we are seeing accelerated competitive environment in China in discounting as part of that. And I would just say that we continue to take the long-term view and belief in our strategy and execute it in a way that continues to elevate the experience for our customers. As a company in China, we\u2019re not looking to buy short-term revenue. Rather, we are looking to continuing to build on the 20-year history and the success that we\u2019ve had in the market. Kevin talked in his comments about our brand strength. It\u2019s never been stronger and more relevant, and that\u2019s indicative through the brand survey that we just recently completed. ","Our total transactions continue to grow double digits; our new stores continue to perform best in class. This year, we will open 600 stores and continue to gain share in the marketplace. And the financial foundation that we've been able to build in China regardless of the competitive environment or the changing consumer environment, allows us to continue to make meaningful investment and adapt model to this changing consumer environment.","So, for us, these are the very early days for our business in China. We're very optimistic about the future growth opportunity that exists there. And we\u2019re going to stay focused on the strategy that we put in place on continuing to expand the reach and the availability of Starbucks coffee in the marketplace.","Kevin Johnson","Yes. I would just add to John's comment as well. Starbucks is in China for 20 years now. And throughout that 20-year period, we understand what differentiates Starbucks globally as well as in China, and we're going to stay true to those principles. We're playing the long game and we're very confident in the strategy.","Operator","Your next question comes from Andy Barish with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Andy Barish","Just dovetailing on China and digging in a little bit more. With East China now in the comp phase, can you give us some color on that contribution to the overall comp? And I think there was more impact in the business historically as there are lot of openings in that business. Is that impact starting to lessen as you move out to some of the lower tiers and spread out the unit growth a little bit?","John Culver","Yes. Andy, this is John. Obviously, this is the first quarter with which we had East China in the comp base. And when we look at it versus the rest of the old company owned businesses, the comp performance in both markets was relatively equal. And more importantly is when you look at the way in which we have the operation setup across the country in the regions or regions in China throughout China performed very strong. We obviously delivered comp growth of 3%, which was sequential improvement, quarter-to-quarter, top-line revenue grew 16%, total transactions low double-digits, new store performance continue to be best-in-class. We grew store count 17%, and we now operate nearly 3,800 stores across 161 cities. So, we feel that we are in a very good position to continue to win in the marketplace and to continue to lead the growth of the coffee market and capture more than our fair share.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that was our last question today.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions)","Thank you. Ms. DeGrande, you may begin your conference.","JoAnn DeGrande","Thanks, Mike. Good afternoon. This is JoAnn DeGrande, Vice President of Investor Relations for Starbucks Coffee Company. Joining me on the call to discuss our Q1 results are Howard Schultz, Chairman, President and CEO; and Troy Alstead, CFO. And also with us today are John Culver, Group President, China, Asia Pacific and Channel Development and Emerging Brands; Adam Brotman, Chief Digital Officer; and Curt Garner, Chief Information Officer.","This conference call will include forward-looking statements, which are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements.","Any such statements should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements in our earnings release and the risk factor discussions in our filings with the SEC, including our last annual report on Form 10-K. Starbucks assumes no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements or information.","This conference call is being webcast and an archive of the webcast will be available on our website at investor.starbucks.com.","Please also note that Starbucks 2014 Annual Meeting of Shareholders will be held in Seattle at 10 a.m. Pacific Time on Wednesday, March 19th, that meeting will also be available via webcast.","With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Howard Schultz. Howard?","Howard Schultz","Thank you, JoAnn, and welcome to everyone on today\u2019s call. I\u2019m very pleased to discuss the record Q1 results that Starbucks announced today. Strong operating and financial performance from all business segments around the world and increase operating leverage and store efficiency enables us to deliver record quarterly revenue of $4.2 billion, record quarterly operating margin of 19.2%, record quarterly operating income of $814 million and record quarterly EPS of $0.71 per share.","Strong customer response to food and beverage innovation contributed solid Q1 comp sales growth of 5%, consisting with our previous mid single-digit guidance representing our 16th consecutive quarter of 5% comps or greater.","Noteworthy is that the 5% comp growth driven by our important EMEA region with over 2,000 stores, was a strongest growth in more than three years, demonstrating the success of our strategy to transform our EMEA business based on the learnings from our U.S. transformation.","Also, noteworthy, is that our Q1 U.S. comps were approximately twice the national retail sales average during holiday shopping period this season. And that our Q1 results do not reflect the significant future sales benefit from the year-over-year increase of $230 million in deferred revenue over $1 billion resulting from extremely strong new Starbucks Gift Card activation and Starbucks Card reloads in Q1.","At the outset, I want to take a moment to comment on two pronounced shifts in consumer shopping behavior that retailers experienced, but that we unlike many retailers or any competitor were prepared for this past holiday season and explaining why and how Starbucks global business will increasingly benefit from the acceleration and convergence of these shifts going forward. Then I will provide an overview of segment performance in Q1 and Troy will take you though Q1 financial and operating results in detail.","Holiday 2013 was the first in which many traditional bricks and mortar retailers experienced in-store foot traffic give way to online shopping in a major way. Customers research, compare prices and then bought the brands and items they wanted online, frequently using a mobile device to do so.","This was also the first holiday in which consumers embraced the convenience and flexibility afforded by physical and digital gift cards with the passion. Instead of gifting a particular item, many consumers instead choose to give the gift of choice. Starbucks was prepared for both of these shifts having invested over many years in the creation and development of proprietary world class digital and mobile payment and card technology and expertise. This expertise and the assets that support it enabled us to seamlessly process more than 40 million new Starbucks card activation valued at over $610 million in the U.S. and Canada alone in Q1, including over 2 million new Starbucks card activations per day in the days immediately leading up to Christmas and $1.4 billion of Starbucks card loads globally. ","Each of these figures represented a significant increase over both last year and candidly our most optimistic projections for this year making Starbucks one of the very few small handful of retailers to benefit from the transfers of reward [ph] store sales to online sales and the gifting of choice. ","Even more, the sheer magnitude of the $1.4 billion loaded with deposit cards in Q1 is the opportunity presented by the millions of customers that will be visiting our stores to redeem these cards in the future. Experience tells us that many gift card recipients are new customers for Starbucks and their visits are providing us with the unique and power opportunity to introduce them to the Starbucks experience, invite them into my cover of rewards loyalty program and inspire them to become part of the Starbucks daily ritual. ","Today with only 10 million customers actively using our mobile payment app, over 7.3 million active my cover of reward [ph] in U.S. alone, over a half of them at home are gold status members and a figure approaching 5 million mobile transactions taking place in our stores each week. Some [ph] integrated mobile and world app technology is by far the undisputed leader in digital retail technology. ","Together mobile and Starbucks card payments represent over 30% of total U.S. payment. This powerful technological advantage combines with our robust pipeline of food and beverage innovations and Starbucks\u2019 recognition as one of the world\u2019s most respected and most trusted consumer brands will provide us with a winning hand as mobile, card and online sales trends continue to converge and accelerate around the world and into the future. ","Let me turn your attention to the Americas. Starbucks Americas segment now comprising over 13,000 stores had another strong quarter with revenues up 8% and comp sales up 5%, including a solid 4% increase in traffic. Contributing to Americas performance was the success of our holiday beverage offerings, including both Pumpkin Spice Latte and our holiday beverage frio [ph] and strong food sales, including increased customer acceptance and additional benefits from the ongoing rollout of La Boulange. ","As we entered 2014, Starbucks Americas segment is benefitting from new store development and existing store renovation programs that are driving increased store efficiency and throughput, enabling us to deliver both an enhanced customer experience and increased profitability. The success of these app efforts are apparent with our newest class of stores on track to average over $1.2 million in year one sales, exceeding our best in class investment ratio of 2 to 1.","For example, a new class of drive-in stores is providing Starbucks with the unique opportunity to connect with customers on the go and represent a tremendous growth opportunity for us both domestically and internationally. In the U.S., highly profitable drive [ph] account for 40% of our company operated store portfolio and remain a focal point of our store development efforts. And the more we broaden and expand our drive thru program, the more we see white space and opportunity for drive-thrus in the future. ","Licensed stores comprising 40% of our Americas store portfolio representing roughly half of the 600 net new stores and plan to open in the Americas in fiscal 2014, also present a compelling growth opportunity for us. We opened 50 licensed stores in Canada in Q1, including 30 in a single day. The net additions facilitating rapid growth licensed stores utilize less of our capital, provide strong insurance and floor access to otherwise unavailable high traffic retail venues such as hotels, airports, rail stations, grocery stores, big parks , and fast growing international markets such as Mexico, a market that delivered extremely strong comp growth inQ1.","Overall licensed store [ph] revenue increased 15% in Q1, the highest growth rate in six quarters. But because of the value of our global brand, we are receiving more [indiscernible] today from potential licensees than any other time in our history.","Let me turn your attention to new platforms and again with Teavana. A year after the acquisition of Teavana, we are more convinced than ever that we have the opportunities to transform the tea category to the way we have transformed coffee all around the world. Recent research confirms that Teavana now enjoys the highest level of awareness of any super premium tea brand and like Starbucks, Teavana had a solid Q1.","Now one year into the integration of Teavana, we are poised to begin the rollout of additional stores in the hills of the successful opening of our first two Teavana tea bars in New York City and Seattle. These two beautiful new stores are already providing us the key insights that will help us achieve our goal of combining and leveraging Teavana\u2019s strength and authority around loose-leaf tea and tea merchandising and Starbucks for entertaining its prudential consumer environment, innovative, handcrafted beverages and a retail store development to create a new retail platform and a unique international premium teahouse experience.","I would now look for Teavana to bring breakthrough innovation to the tea category in the U.S. and Canada this spring and summer and to the international markets in the years ahead. Now beyond tea, another important area of innovation and interest for us is premium handcrafted, cold carbonated beverages.","This category is by far the fastest growing segment of over $140 billion global carbonation industry and the results of the tests we conducted in stores in select U.S. and Asian market last summer exceeded our most optimistic expectations.","The excitement that was created as baristas carbonated, our customer\u2019s favorite drinks and the fantastic innovation and interaction that follow, cemented our interest in the category and the opportunity to elevate the cold carbonation category with a premium handcrafted offerings in our stores.","Look for handcrafted cold carbonated beverages in several stores that will drive full attachment, create an incremental leaf tea for our customers and create a new big pot for us in the months and quarters ahead.","Turning to China and Asia Pacific. If you want our important rapidly expanding China Asia-Pacific segment, currently comprising over 4000 stores in 14 countries, including 209 net new stores in Q1, delivered strong revenue growth of 25% and exceptional strong comp growth of 8%. These are best-in-class results for any retail or restaurant operating at our scale in Asia.","This month, Starbucks celebrated 15th anniversary in China, a market we open with one store in Beijing in 1999. We have more than 1000 stores today and China remains on track to become Starbucks\u2019 largest and most successful market outside the U.S.","Just in time for the lunar New Year, we reached a major milestone which they view of Starbucks gift cards in China. China customers responded to the Starbucks\u2019 card overwhelmingly in a positive way with initial sales once again far in excess of our plan and in many ways mirroring our U.S. experience.","We currently offer the Starbucks card in different aspects of our My Starbucks Rewards loyalty program in \u201812 to \u201814 China Asia-Pacific region markets in which we\u2019d operate. In Japan and Hong Kong, we recently made it even faster and more convenient to customers to give the gift of Starbucks\u2019 choice online with Starbucks eGift.","In India, momentum continues where in Q1, we opened a beautiful new flagship store in the Garden City of Bangalore and we continue to accelerate that growth. We now operate 34 stores in four cities and customer demand for Starbucks stores throughout India literally is at a fever pitch. We are delighted with the performance of our joint venture with Tata among the most respected companies in India and we are poised to grow sizable portfolio stores in India over the next two years.","Overall, we plan to -- overall we plan to get a total of 750 new stores across China Asia-Pac in 2014, including both our 100 stores in Singapore next month and continue to be driven by the exciting opportunity to introduce our elevated, differentiated and locally relevant Starbucks\u2019 experience to millions of new customers in this important part of the world in the years ahead.","Let me turn your attention to EMEA which in many ways has really had a wonderful performance and I think it is consistent with the guidance we gave you year ago in terms of our confidence that we would turn EMEA around. Starbucks\u2019 important EMEA segment now comprising more than 2000 stores had a particularly noteworthy Q1 with revenues increasing 11% and exceptionally strong comp sales growth of 5%.","We opened a total of 64 net new company operated and licensed stores in EMEA in Q1, including our first store in Monaco and [indiscernible] our first ever store aboard a train on the Swish rail line running between Geneva airport and St. John. We are on plan to open 12 of 150 net new stores in fiscal 2014.","EMEA\u2019s Q1 performance underscores continued execution against our transnational agenda in that region and the success of the strategy that includes enhancing our new store customer experience, showcasing innovative locally relevant food and beverage products and focusing on company operated licensed and franchise stores for our new growth \u2013 for our new server [ph].","Licensed store revenue in EMEA grew by 38% in Q1 due to the combination of new stores and strong performance in several key markets, including double digit comp growth in the Middle East and North Africa where we now have 335 stores. While we continue to be very encouraged by the progress we have made in EMEA, as I previously stated, we are determined to see these projects continue till the region reached its full potential.","Turning to channel development. Our channel development segment posted total revenues of $401 million in Q1, representing solid 7% growth in Q1 over last year and continues to grow market share and [indiscernible] channels outside of our retail stores.","The strong direct selling relationship we have built with retail is enabling us to elevate and differentiate our brand, increase our presence and enhance our product position and the deepening and strengthening of these retail relationships combined with new product offerings and initiatives currently underway gives us confidence that channel development growth will accelerate as the year progresses and at the same [ph] it will deliver both double digit top and bottom line growth in fiscal 2014 and beyond. ","Premium single cup is the fastest growing segment in at home coffee. We have grown our share to a current 18% of the segment over the last two years. Since launch, we have now sold way over 1 billion [indiscernible] and 200 million stick [ph] and we continue to build and expand both platforms. ","In January following strong customer demand we introduced a new innovative line of [indiscernible] offerings including \u2013 over the course of this year you will see a significant expansion of our line of key cup offerings including flavor [indiscernible] in the key --. We continue to innovate and add to our leading market share of the premium package compensating as well and now really a remarkable 26% share of that segment. And we continue to build, discover refreshed [ph] platform and are already seeing the early success of our Starbucks signature, our merchandise initiative just in time for the rollout of our new ready to drink packaging in the spring.","Some of those continues to offer the world\u2019s first and only cross-sale channel loyalty and rewards program with more 2.2 million rewards that was earned by customers in the first seven months since My Starbucks Rewards starts and [indiscernible]. Starbucks\u2019 unique amazing of value rewards and premium positioning will enable us to continue to aid to our leading position and market share in CPG channels.","A few final thoughts before I hand the call over to Troy. I think this part of my remarks are very important. Over the last month or so, I have heard many traditional brick and mortar retailers attribute the downturn in their core business during holiday. The factors such as a shortened holiday shopping season, a weekend consumer, the U.S. government shutdown and [indiscernible] but secondly, those explanations ignore a larger fundamental truth. That truth is that traditional brick and mortar retailing is an inflection point. No longer are many retailers only required to compete with stores on the other side of the street. They are now required to compete with stores on the other side of the country. Navigating the seismic shift will continue to be very, very difficult for me.","But I firmly believe and I admit Starbucks solid 4% increase in traffic in Q1 validates that we will be among the small group of retailers to gain from the macro transfers of brick and mortar retail sales to online sales underpinning this belief are free dynamic unique Starbucks it manages. ","First, Starbucks offers an experience that cannot be replicated or copy. The power of our brand, our heritage in coffee, beverage innovation, customization and the deep emotional connection we have with our customers rooted in longstanding trust and respect that our 200,000 Starbucks partner share with our customers provides us with an overwhelming competitive advantage, not only domestically but around the world.","Second, we invested and continue to invest well ahead of the curve and today have world-leading proprietary digital, social, mobile payment and card technologies and assets. These assets are enabling us to broaden and deepen our connection to customers, enhance overall Starbucks customer experience and further differentiating distance ourselves from competitors.","And we have a full pipeline of new technological innovations introducing in the quarters ahead that will fully leverage these assets and provide us with even greater benefits into the future. And we are just beginning to appreciate the full magnitude and possibilities of the Starbucks mobile payment platform opportunity. And third as our strong traffic in Q1 demonstrates the deep sense of community and human connection that our stores provide our customers as their preferred place. It is only going to become more reformed and more relevant around the world in the future.","Let me say in closing, I could not be more confident that Starbucks unique combination of physical and digital assets makes us one of the very few consumer brands with a national and global footprint to be in a position to build market share and benefit from the seismic retail and consumer shifts underway.","I will now turn the call over to Troy.","Troy Alstead","Thanks, Howard and good afternoon everyone. The strongest start to fiscal \u201914 across all of our operating segments led to consolidated results that eclipsed every meaningful record.","Revenues of $4.2 billion from a 12% increase over last Q1. Our 5% global comparable store sales growth was the largest driver and particularly encouraging is the strength of sales growth around the world. In fact, this was the first quarter since Q4 of 2010 that all regions posted comp growth of 5% or better.","And traffic continues to fuel that comp growth, growing 4% in the quarter with a 1% contribution from average ticket. The strong performance from our more than 1,500 net new startups stores opened over the past year also contributed to the revenue growth in Q1.","Consolidated operating income grew 29% to a record $814 million in the first quarter. This includes a $20 million credit as a result of paying our obligation in the Kraft settlement earlier than anticipated. Operating margin expanded 260 basis points to 19.2% in Q1, far above any quarter we\u2019ve ever had even when excluding litigation credit.","Operating margin expansion was due largely to the lasting of several non-routine expenses in the Americas segment in Q1 of last year. Commodity costs improvement and sales leverage also contributed towards the expansion.","Earnings per share grew 25% to $0.71 per share in the first quarter to a record even when excluding the $0.02 impact of the litigation credit. Our tax rate of 34% was up significantly over the last Q1, as we lost an $18 million benefit recorded at Q1 of last year, primarily from state income tax expense adjustments for returns filed in prior years.","Our performance this quarter clearly demonstrates the comp growth in the heart of our target range, resulting significant gains and profitability and margin expansion, a testament to the efficient use of capital and strong financial discipline that is competitive throughout the organization.","Now, let me take a few moments to briefly touch on the results from each of our operating segments. In the Americas, another solid holiday season and excellent operational executions drove revenue, operation margin and operating income to record levels.","Revenue grew by 8% in the first quarter as strong sales growth in existing stores and sales from 735 net new stores opened this past year, pushed Americas quarterly revenues to over $3 billion for the first time ever. Comp growth of 5% was driven by a 4% increase in transactions.","We did see some softening of traffic and comp growth in December. However, our Q1 comp growth was an extraordinarily strong delivery given the shifts in consumer behavior that we kind of faced during the holiday as Howard mentioned.","I will also mention food among our comp growth drivers in Q1. Food continues to be a disproportionate driver to our comp and product launches helping to propel those results. There have been very significant successes thus far, including for some sales that have doubled versus our prior offering.","Make no mistake, however, this is a very complex rollout. We are significantly up leveling our core food offering across more than 10,000 U.S. stores in two years time. The cost was that we are leveraging the learnings from the introduction in many markets in fiscal \u201913 to quickly optimize implementation of stores launched this year. This includes labor deployment strategies, product assortment choices and marketing and display optimization.","Overall, we are as optimistic as ever about this opportunity. In addition to the solid revenue growth in Q1, Americas operating income of $732 million was 24% higher than last Q1 and operating margin of 23.8% reflected in expansion of 300 basis points. Included in the expansion was the lapping of [indiscernible] from last Q1 including our leadership conference, gate in-charges [ph] and the impacts of superstorm Sandy. However even after backing those [ph], our largest and most mature business of the Americas continue to drive margin expansion, we are also making investments in labor and food [indiscernible].","Not only with our 23.8% operating margin, the big improvement from last Q1, it was a full 150 basis points higher than any other quarter we have ever had, and opportunity remains. Labor and store maintenance are all under the microscope and we are expecting this technology to enhance the [indiscernible] schedules and robust monetization program will all deliver improvements. ","As we continue to invest in our people, including maintaining world class benefits [ph] that go above and beyond requirements of the [indiscernible], we see greater stability of practically run stores. This means we can spend more time focusing our customers, ensuring they receive the one of kind personalized [indiscernible] experience that drove our solid floor balance result this quarter.","As we move now to Europe, the Middle East and Africa or EMEA, where the first one represented a continuation of the great stride we are making in the region. Revenues of $340 million in Q1 grew 11% over the prior year. This is truly a great start to the year. In fact, the $33 million in Q1 revenue growth was higher than what we delivered for the entirety of fiscal \u201913.","There were contributors to our top line coverage, certainly time to a slow but positive retaining economic recovery including declining unemployment in the UK have been helpful. Beyond that there are strong signals that our strategy emulate consisting of licensed store growth along with the heightened focus on the store experience is paying off.","Licensed stores are the largest contributors to the revenue growth with company operated cost growth following closely behind. The 5% comp growth in Q1 was generated by a 3% increase in transactions. Perhaps our most solid sign out of EMEA, the fact that the improvements we are seeing are broad based. All of our major markets are showing improved, the momentum is building for a great year. Our top line momentum and disciplined stores basing across EMEA translated into a strong bottom line as well.","Q1 operating income in the region grew 34 million, 50% higher than last Q1. And operating margin expanded 250 basis points to 9.9% as the portfolio shift to higher margin licensed stores drove our highest quarterly operating margin ever. We are encouraged with the progress we are making in EMEA and excited about what is to come.","Now for China and Asia Pacific continues to be our fastest growing and highest margin region. In the first quarter, Caf\u00e9 revenues grew 25% to $267 million. Our record number of store openings and a strong performance in Q1 were key driving force behind our revenue growth.","Additionally company operated comp growth which had 8% represented continuation of our strong consistent growth in the region [indiscernible] higher, 7 percentage points to the comp growth were due to higher transactions, the acceleration over Q4. Two year comp growth also accelerated to 19% in the first quarter. Strong brand awareness, relevant core promotional product offerings and the increased usage of the [indiscernible] loyalty program all contributed.","Caf\u00e9 operating income grew 12% in Q1 to $81 million. Operating margin of 30.4% represented a 330 basis point reduction over last Q1. Margins were negatively impacted by a decline in profit merger venture in Japan. This was driven primarily by the [indiscernible] again but also the timing the investments made in later for upgrade and [indiscernible] by the extended cyclic traffic we experienced. As both our bases expanded in the Japanese economy re-invigorated over the past several quarters. ","Excluding Japan, our caf\u00e9 operating margin expanded slightly overlapped Q1 despite continued margin pressure resulting from the ongoing strategic portfolio mix shift [indiscernible] stores. Our outstanding performance in mainland China is a major reason \u2013 offset that impact from that shift of the portfolio composition. As China\u2019s revenue and operating income growth easily outpaced in the region. Strong new store performance, -- leader management and sales leverage are driving our success there. ","In channel development, global sales of single serve products and continued growth in food service combining our revenues higher by 7% to $401 million. These revenue drivers were partially offset by the impact of the lower pricing on packaged coffee. All we are going to share this category until we lap the list price reduction initiated last May, we won\u2019t see full impact to our revenue growth. This is one of the reasons we anticipate higher channel development growth from the second half of fiscal \u201914 and in the first half. ","As far as single serve growth goes, Starbucks Teacup shared the premium single serve market in EMEA last is now over 15%, our highest point since the loss three years ago. Our new holiday Blend K-cups were extremely well-received, helping to propel sales in the U.S. food, drug, and mass channel higher by 65% in the final four weeks of the quarter, which significantly outpace the category over that same time period.","Additionally, we continue to gain traction on Verismo which delivered solid holiday sales. Unit sold grew over last few months as we nearly double the year-over-year door count with the addition of several keys special to retailers.","Verismo is an element of our strategy to capitalize on the highly competitive single cost base. We will continue to invest in the single-serve business which we believe will be an important driver of our long-term growth.","Operating income in channel also grew a very healthy 23% to $119 million in Q1. Operating margin expanded 370 basis points to 29.6% due largely the 340 basis points of favorability from more coffee cost.","Lower pricing on packaged coffee and strong promotions in the quarter partially offset our coffee cost favorability. However that was offset by favorability in other operating expenses as a result of decreased marketing due to the launch of Verismo in last Q1.","All other segments grew revenue to $159 million in Q1, up from $101 million over last Q1. And we delivered $14 million of operating income up from the $4 million loss a year ago.","The growth in both revenue and operating income was due to the addition of Teavana which was not in our prior year Q1 results. Please note that Q1 was the last quarter, we will not have Teavana in the prior period results as it was added at the beginning of Q2 of fiscal 2013.","Before I move on to our fiscal 2014 target, let me note that this quarter we corrected an immaterial error in our prior period financial statements to allow pretty more accurate comparison with current results.","Specific to Q1 the impact of last year that both revenues and other operating expenses were lowered in channel development by $5.5 million and in all other segments by $0.9 million. There was no impact to the operating income. More details including the full explanation can be found on our Investor Relations website.","On the balance sheet, we continue to maintain a conservative focus or ramping up leverage were appropriate. During the first quarter we paid in full our obligation to Kraft as a result of the other pricing outcome. This led to the issuance of $750 million of debt in December which when coupled with the $750 million we issued in September and prior issuances puts our total long-term debt at just over $2 billion. The two most recent issuances result in a meaningful increase for interest expense that is reflected in our Q1 results and that will continue.","The rapid pace of Starbucks card loads during the first quarter has pushed our quarter ending deferred revenue balance to over $1 billion for the first time ever and 29% higher than a year ago. These loads also boost our already strong cash flow which for the quarter saw unusual decline due to the cash payment.","The Starbucks Card strain proceeds from our recent debt issuance and strong quarterly results offset the Kraft payment however and we ended Q1 with $2.2 billion cash, cash equivalents that available for sale investment security. Our strong cash position and conservative balance sheet mean that we can continue to return cash to shareholders through dividend of share purchases.","In the first quarter we reinitiated our share repurchase program and we continue to target share repurchases to offset dilution of our broad based stock equity program that also include our first time store partners. With nearly 25 million shares currently authorized that available for repurchase. We\u2019ll also from time to time be active in the market repurchase additional shares based on market conditions.","It was a very strong start for our fiscal year on many levels. In the operating results we delivered in first quarter give us continued confidence in our full year outlook. With the over delivery on EPS in Q1, we\u2019re now targeting full year fiscal 2014 EPS in the range of $2.59 to $2.67, which includes $0.03 of additional interest expense as a result of recent debt issuances. That represent strong 18% to 22% growth over fiscal \u201913 when excluding last years non-recurring gain due to the sales of equity in Mexico, Chile and Argentina in the fourth quarter recording the Kraft litigation charge.","Specific to the second quarter, we continue to expect EPS in the range of $0.54 to $0.55. Remember that traditionally, the second quarter is our lowest in terms of earnings due largely of seasonality. That means the fixed cost like our interest expense on debt issue over the past six months had a more dilutive impact on Q2 than the other quarters. Additionally, last Q2 we had a $0.03 gain on sale of equity in our Mexico business.","With respect to the second half of the year, we\u2019re targeting Q3 EPS in the range of $0.64 to $0.66 and Q4 EPS in the range of $0.70 to $0.75. The second half of the year represents growth of approximately 20% when excluding non-routine gain and the Kraft litigation charge it reflects the strong earning momentum we\u2019ll continue to generate.","We continue to expect a $0.09 to $0.10 whole year EPS benefits from lower coffee costs in fiscal \u201914. This mandate is now pricing the interest saved in last year GPGD [ph] as well as investment tracking to our business. And with respect to fiscal \u201915, we now have more than a quarter of our company\u2019s loss that reach stable in the fiscal \u201914. Given where the markets is trading at today we expect the overall impact to coffee prices to be positive in fiscal \u201915 but lower than that of fiscal \u201914. ","All our previously announced guidance for fiscal \u201914 remains unchanged, including revenue growth of 10% or greater, global comparable store sales growth in the mid single digit, consolidated operating margin expansion targeted at roughly 150 to 200 basis points, including margin improvement in the Americas and channel development, high single digit margin in the EMEA and margins moving toward the lower 37% range in caf\u00e9, 1500 net new stores globally, capital expenditures totaling approximately $1.2 billion and a tax rate of 34.5%.","The balance first quarter strength of our global business set us up extremely well for another remarkable year. We have a another significant growth leverage to continue the outstanding Americas performance. We have considerable momentum brewing in caf\u00e9 in EMEA. Our channel development business is taking share from competitors and delivering more of the company profitability than ever before. And our fiscal discipline and conservative balance sheet continue to serve us well. ","What we have built over the past two years is paying dividends now. Our growth investment proposition is based on strong double digit revenue fuelled by consistent mid single digit comp growth and this is based on growing earnings that are at much faster than the top line. We achieved all of that in the first quarter and we are confident not only to continue that revenue growth, margin expansion and strong earnings growth in the quarters ahead. ","With that, I would like to turn the call back over to operator for Q&A. Mike?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","","(Operator Instructions) Your first question is from Joe Buckley with Bank of America. ","Joe Buckley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Troy, for the current quarter, for the second quarter, one of the guidance was stepped up marketing, I believe around both [indiscernible] and the Starbucks card. Are you still \u2013 is that service you\u2019re still executing that and could you give us an update on where [indiscernible] is used now in terms of store penetration?","Troy Alstead","Yes, we continue to expect the same guidance we\u2019ve given you previously which is something about higher marketing spend as a percent of sales in the second quarter and frankly in Q3 and Q4 also anticipating morally higher marketing spend as we really continue investing, driving our business, supporting level launch for food broadly and driving innovation throughout our stores. So that will continue and that is also a \u2013 progress guidance to the second quarter. ","Level launch, to be hot in terms of the lower new stores in the first quarter to largely to focus on the big holiday through the quarters. That will resume here beginning in the second quarter and we continue to expect to be fully rolled out with the first wave of this bakery program only across the U.S. by the end of fiscal year.","Joe Buckley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","You mentioned the complexity of the level line is rolled out and really it is a huge undertaking and a major change. But has there been more complex being expected or what are the intricacies of rolling out that you discovered from your experiences?","Troy Alstead","No, nothing anymore complex being anticipated, a big change like this across a huge system like Mihow [ph], with the decline of transaction volumes we have per store is a big change, the big operational change, the big supply chain change and all that is anticipated and then of course a goodwill we are providing at a better experience, new experience on as the product innovations we learn as we go, we continue to fine tune labor deployments and working routines and product assortments, fortunately customers want broader products, you will see us a respond and track back as we learn from last year\u2019s launches and proceed to the rest of this year. But that\u2019s a normal part of the process. Everything \u2013 part is right on technically we expect, we are extremely pleased with the results we are seeing in terms of the uplift, the fact that fruit continues to be an incremental comp driver in our business and we think this is big an opportunity we ever had just as we continue to roll out from here.","Operator","The next question is from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.","John Ivankoe \u2013 JPMorgan","Troy, you made a mention that there might have been some slowdown in comps in December and I was just hoping in the US \u2013 just hoping you could provide a little bit more color on that? Whether it was related to core food and beverage or perhaps other items that you saw in the store, whether you think you may see any implications of that as we enter 2014?","Troy Alstead","Thanks, John. Yes, we did see some slowing in December relative to previous quarters and relative to the early part of the quarter relative to October and November. And we really attribute that fundamentally to discussions Howard had early on in the call, which is fundamentally that significant shift in consumer behavior less retail traffic that we are all hearing about from other retailers that we are hearing about in Retail Traffic report that is published.","Now, all that\u2019s out there has some impact on our traffic roads in December particularly. Now, as I\u2019ve said it\u2019s important to note, we still serve record numbers of customers. We had record traffic coming to our stores in December, had record sales volumes in the month of December and for the quarter overall. We continue to drive traffic, however just at a slightly slower system we had coming into that bigger month.","Now, with that said, no comments about the particular quarter or implications beyond that other than just to point out and acknowledge what you already know is we\u2019re underscoring. The advantage we have, we expect that significant change in consumer behavior is the fact that we ended Q1 with more than a $1 billion of deferred revenue on our balance sheet. Dollars that customers have loaded on the card that will become revenue in our stores as we proceed from here, that\u2019s an important advantage that we have a leadership position and we will continue to further our leadership as we proceed from here.","John Ivankoe \u2013 JPMorgan","But maybe there is an evidence in the conference I made that 1% less than average tickets or just that maybe you sold less than some of the higher ticket, maybe gift related items outside of the card in the quarter. Is that a right comment because obviously composition of the comp is not just traffic it\u2019s also average ticket. You just had very low average ticket growth in this most recent December quarter and can you just give us a sense of what that may trend going forward especially with the addition of things like global launch and evolution and what have you?","Howard Schultz","","There is no message there. In fact, I think if you look at each quarter for the last two to three years you would see our typical average 1% mini quarters, two same quarters, but more often and not within that 1% to 2% range. So you saw the first quarter coming with ticket that was sold receipts from most of our trends. That will tend to be at point or two the either way. But again that\u2019s been evidenced by most of our countries like.","And the slowdown we saw -- the large slowdown we saw in the month of December in traffic was very broad based. It wasn\u2019t unique to any particular region. It was unique to any particular day part or product set or product line. It clearly demonstrates, improves stuffs and there was just a fewer people out there shopping and so fewer people for us to capture and provide some great experiences in our stores.","John Ivankoe \u2013 JPMorgan","Understood. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Sara Senatore with Sanford Bernstein.","Sara Senatore \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","Very much. I wanted to follow-up on that again and I guess I just have a couple of questions about the shift in the spending habits, kind of one big and one small. In terms of the small, other restaurants have pointed to weather. Can you disentangle when you look at your data, something that tells you when weather was good your comps were better or worst, I mean is there -- are there data that you can look at and say that definitively not the case, it\u2019s much more about the shopping habit?","And the second point is in bigger picture, can you just talk about why you think we\u2019re seeing this inflection point now in terms of how people are spending and does this have any implications for Starbucks going forward. I always think of Starbucks as kind of a destination as oppose to a convenience, but its sounds like there is some pieces of business that gets hurt if there are just fewer people shopping.","Howard Schultz","This is Howard. Let me try and answer your questions. It is sometimes easy to kind of bifurcate what happens specifically in the quarter. It was about weather and other things, but there is no gap. Throughout the quarter, there were unusual events and don\u2019t forget we had the government shutdown, which certainly had a adverse effect on consumer confidence and consumer behavior both before and after.","And then obviously, there was a lot of weather. But in my prepared comments I spoke specifically that I don\u2019t think that was the driving issue here. I strongly believe that the month of December and what Troy just described in terms of John\u2019s earlier question will go down as a turning point in the overall way in which people are shopping. I think, clearly, the month of December was the gift giving time and as a result of that people spent much more time on the web than ever before than you saw that in the online ecommerce sales. As a result of that on the margin, there were fairly less people out shopping and as a result of that, in certain day parts in the month of December, there weren\u2019t as many people captured. Now what Troy just said in terms of the follow up, your question in terms of going forward, I do believe that there will be a real seachange for many, many retailers who are going to have a hard time navigating through what I believe will not be December-ish problem, this is going to be an ongoing issue and it\u2019s going to have them faster than people think in terms of the way people are shopping and how they are spending their time, and the value that you can get on the web.","Now when I mentioned in my closing comments, I believe very strongly that we have the inherent benefit built in to be able not only to capture incremental traffic but to drive traffic into our stores as a result of the things that we will be doing and the combination of physical and digital assets that will get stronger over time, I do believe that although John mentioned in his comments that both traffic and average ticket, the 4% number in Q1 to me really is the number that we have looked at as really the sign of the strength and conviction that our customers have about Starbucks. I don\u2019t know any other retailer or restaurant that drove traffic into their stores at that time and if you look at how much money we spent on consumer advertising and trying to capture customers it\u2019s is very very de minimus compared to others. ","One thing, Troy, did leave out, that I will just mention in terms of the average ticket, we did \u2013 we were a little bit more promotional in-store during the most second half of December in terms of recognizing that there was a problem in that country with traffic and as a result of that, the average ticket problem we went down a bit as a result of promotional activities. But I would say with no defensiveness that we look at the 5% comp number and the 4% traffic number in Q1 literally a stunning success given our peer group and given the macro market conditions. I do believe that there will be challenges for many, many of the retailers in calendar \u201914 and Starbucks will be one of the companies that not only will be able to navigate through but will be market share as a result of the combination of assets that we have.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jeff Bernstein with Barclays. ","Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital","Just two questions. Just one to follow up on the La Boulange, wonder if you can give some incremental color in terms of what you are seeing in the store that already have it, whether it be mix, frequency, average check, or what can you talk about, what the contribution is to the comp or any update on the lunch rollout and then I had one follow up question. ","Troy Alstead","First, I would say, the role of the retailer we\u2019re probably hoping for, we\u2019re just very encouraged across all aspects of this food program. It still is a rolling in partner stores across the U.S. and it needed only the part of our new elevated food program which is basic category as you know. But all indications are we have found something that resonates service to customers, gets us a change to dramatically see their expectations around food, because it\u2019s a chance to continue to drive food as faster growing part of our business which we have been for some time and that continues to over time elevate food as a mix of the stores overall. One part that I should that, that is connected in food is that while all day parts food for us is a healthy cliff in the first quarter, mid day and afternoon outpaced growth of the other day parts and that\u2019s consistent with some recent trends and it\u2019s partially fueled by food, by people recognizing that there is a fantastic food opportunity now at Starbucks in most day than the afternoon snack items, bakery choices for all day along, they are not that it used to be.","So every indication for us continues to be very positive. We\u2019ve got a ways to go to continue this rollout around the US. The lunch program will continue to be fine tuned and which is really that stages right now and we are very excited as that will begin rolling out late in fiscal year or early next fiscal year more broadly, we are very excited about that next wave of food. And what we have seen from is a multi year elevation of food that we think give us a tailwind in comp growth and tailwind in volumes through the stores over that same service downtime. ","Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital","And just follow on the earlier question thing that you have \u2013 it\u2019s now 13,000 plus stores around the U.S. You talked about the shift from brick-and-mortar to perhaps online which obviously you guys seem that are positioned in most to deal with that. Would you say that at this kind of the holiday timeframe, where I guess that becomes pronounced. Do you think there has been a change in the underlying health of the consumer or they're really just around shopping in the holidays and therefore there hasn\u2019t really been a change in the health of the consumer per se just the matter of how they spend or how they spend their time shopping?","Howard Schultz","I think we have a lens on consumer behavior and consumer spending perhaps unlike any other retailer with the national footprint we have. I would say this is in quantitative. It\u2019s more qualitative and more personal. I think the health of the consumer today is better than it was a year ago. But I do think it\u2019s still a fragile issue and what we saw with the government shutdown on October, is any isolated events of that magnitude can have a very drastic and dramatic effect on behavior and I think that's speaks to the fragility.","","Now having said all that, I think one of the underlying benefits of Starbucks for many, many years is that we are an affordable luxury. We have been -- we continue to be that. And as a result of that the demography and broad-based diversification of our customer base and our store base insulates us from some of the underlying problems and may exist in one geography versus another.","I also think what Troy said is that our ability to take the fiscal asset of Starbucks and our fixed costs. If you look at store today versus even three years ago, the ability with La Boulange, carbonation coming and thing that we're going to do with tea are going to extend the date, leverage our fixed costs and give us incrementality, not only on the introduction of certain products. But many of these things are linked to the opportunity to increase food attachment not as a result only of La Boulange with the beverage and the innovation that we're bringing that are skewed towards that.","Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital","Helpful. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Kelter with Goldman Sachs.","Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs","I wanted to follow-up on La Boulange a bit further and there are two questions. The first are you able to rule out the possibility that any of the same-store sales slowdown may have been associated with reduce throughout during the peak sales quarter as a result of the complexities in the store associated with La Boulange?","And then the second is, can you talk to us about what you expect as it relates to hot breakfast and hot lunch that are coming next under the platform. And how far are you able to go with respect to product offerings, how it's going to be managed logistically at the stores et cetera?","Troy Alstead","Yeah let me speak to the first thing Michael and Howard may want to jump in here too. There is absolutely nothing -- nothing whatsoever to the idea that -- what\u2019s happening with our food programs and La Boulange rule out is impacting throughout or is impacting service in the stores or have any thing to do with comp growth, still down in the quarter, absolutely nothing. We can completely rule that out. We have an opportunity and analysis to look at stores with La Boulange and stores without La Boulange.","I appreciate you don't get to see that side-by-side set of analytics that I do. There is no change in our key transaction day part, there is no impact we think to discern from that. Now perhaps in -- we\u2019ll appreciate this. I think sometime there is a customer perception that things are different in stores, food is being warmed out, multiple order in food, the case looks different.","That change requires some adoption overtime. And I think that it may have created some case\u2019s perception, but you could find out in the rule out, if there is any meaningful impact on what\u2019s happening there. And at the same time, we\u2019ll continue to deploy more labor and revise the labor routines against food that grows in our stores. We'll make sure we\u2019re best in right parts of our business to both dry volumes, to meet the customer needs and to grow profitability on our stores as time goes on.","Howard Schultz","If you cry, one thing about that. Not only it's absolutely nothing to suggest that there is a throughput issue, but I would also remind you that because of the Starbucks card and the quick adoption of mobile payment that we are speeding up the level of service and our stores. And when you look at the amount of people that are now paying with the card and with the unbelievable rate of adoption and how accretive global payment is -- there is no issue whatsoever. This is a myth that absolutely has no legs and for all of you listing on the call, you should just eradicate that it does not exist.","Now Michael, with respect to your second question, I have only some surprises out there. I\u2019ll tell you we've got some great new innovations coming both in that morning category around the savory items and warm items, as well as in lunch. Everything we have seen so far encourages us that we just beginning to go after where is there big, big good opportunity, both in our busy day part to drive increase the cash.","But also as I said before, it continues food as we have (inaudible) into lunch program and mid-day as an attached as we rolled out the carbonated beverage platform later December, all these things work together. Of course, we know the food as an elevated quality in our stores not only drive our food sales but by the way it drives higher beverage sale as when people come in they buy food, they also buy beverage. So the whole shift rise the level of earnings in stores and that whole product pipeline tend to increase as we find ourselves all that include. So more to come, more details, but I think you really like the food we have coming out balance of the year.","Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs","Very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Matt DiFrisco with Buckingham Research.","Matt DiFrisco - Buckingham Research","Thank you. I just wanted a little clarification and then a question with respect to the promotion? You mentioned that for promotional side of the business, you may have impacted the average check in the most recent quarter reported. Should we read into that then in a environment where you have $1.4 billion worth of pent-up demand call it that we would probably not see as much promotional activity?","And then, just, I just want to clarify, when you keep referring to sort of the change in overall retail, doing more online sales in the brick and mortar guys softness, historically shopping happens on the weekend? So would we read into that then you anecdotal -- you literally saw then tangible evidence that the business that might have been correlated with brick and mortar traffic associate with weekend business was your weakness in December because you said pretty much that it wasn\u2019t day part position or timing of the day or timing of the week I run into that?","Howard Schultz","I think the latter which is no evidence with specificity that there was a weekness issue. So I think this was to spread across multiple days. One thing about the issue of weather that was brought up earlier, currently any weather problem in the city where people are living and enjoying the Christmas holiday season. The initial reaction was not wow and so the weather plays I think a positive roll for the online ecommerce opportunities because it was so convenient.","But we did not see a weekend issue and I think one thing I want to go back to is we anticipated this level of change. The investments we made in the car, the investments we made in mobile payment, all these things were in anticipation of what we saw in December. They probably came at us and everybody else that they faster clip. But we were in a position to take advantage of in the best evidence of that not only $1.4 billion but the $200 million, it\u2019s sitting in the reloads.","And that\u2019s just underscored product, however at this point, they are in holiday period in past years. We would see elevated holiday traffic always long, not finding, just isolated to the weekends. So I think that underscores the fact that because we didn\u2019t see it isolated to the weekend this time that does not message anything else other than that. It actually very closely matches, how we would anticipate that traffic around the holiday. And then perhaps you can help me understand your first question, were you saying that related to promotional discount that we increased a bit in the first quarter because we have Starbucks card balances, are you asking if that means it will be lesser going forward.","Matt DiFrisco - Buckingham Research","Correct. So I\u2019m assuming that you had, you addressed December slowdown with promotional activity that given the pent-up demand you probably would be correct to assume that you would not need to do as much promotional activity and its adverse effect of the check?","Howard Schultz","Let me speak specifically on this and whether we need to do promotions or not. We can see this throughout the year at various times at various offers, particularly around now striving to get the Starbucks card balances loaded and registered so that they become an integral part of our loyalty program.","So you will see us very active in what we do. It may not be as specific around merchandised promotions as we did in the holiday period that for us is true. But it should continue to very actively to engage customer and keep traffic coming into our stores at each quarters to go.","Matt DiFrisco - Buckingham Research","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Glass with Morgan Stanley.","John Glass - Morgan Stanley","Thanks. First a follow-up, Troy, what are the metrics around card usage in January, what portion of the cards are used in January and if you know this, what portion of those are actually used by first time customers, people that haven\u2019t registered before. That\u2019s the follow up.","I also just want to ask about EMEA. We haven\u2019t talked about any places around the world? What was the inflection point, what country or what was the piece that really changed the comp momentum. I think, for the first time in awhile that -- in that segment?","Howard Schultz","John, to the first question, in years past, most of that incremental new card load tends to come into the stores predominantly in second quarter but then also continuing into the third quarter.","So going into this quarter, I won\u2019t make any specific comments about what we are seeing in the current quarter right now, we are in the current month of January. We would anticipate that we would see that incremental load coming through the business as we progress through Q2 and even in the Q3 that would matched more of the typical historical pattern.","Now in EMEA, there has been a very meaningful steady progress. I would say, I think, the first quarter was perhaps a bit of an inflection point as a number of great things came together all at once for us. But to be clear, these are all the things we have been working in our team over in EMEA has been working on for two years now around dynamic -- achieve dynamically changing the stores experience around beverage preparation, execution within in-stores around the licensing activity, all of that, all of that, really starting to shift both in the topline now and in the middle of P&L driving that margin to the all time high that we reported in Q1.","So it\u2019s a bit of an inflection point but its one that comes after several quarters in a row preparation and a lot of hard work. We would absolutely anticipate that improvement continues, not always at the pace that we have experience in the first quarter, just to be clear. But everything we have been saying for the last two years, we believe we can continue to develop EMEA into the very, very health strong contributor in our business, I think Q1 is a fantastic validation of that.","John Glass - Morgan Stanley","Is it just suffice to say that is it U.K. largely U.K. driven or is it some stronger performance around the peripheral that market is not as strong as the average?","Howard Schultz","No. On contrary U.K. was very strong for us, but it also broad base, so all of our major markets in EMEA company-owned U.K., France, Germany, Switzerland, we saw nice improvement prospect portfolio of markets. But the U.K was perhaps leading, we have very good quarter in U.K.","John Glass - Morgan Stanley","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from David Palmer with RBC Capital Markets.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets","Thanks. Regarding channel development, you mentioned some coffee innovation in your remarks, but you build up a stable of brands outside of coffee, for instance I suspect internal you would have big dreams brands like Evolution Fresh and where that can go? I just wanted to get a sense of those dreams and maybe just a timing about, will there be a big push beyond coffee with channel development, one of these quarters will sort of wake and you will be pushing harder and marketing more than you ever had before? Thanks.","Howard Schultz","Thanks Dave. The answer is yes. We have big aspirations for what more we can do through our standalone\/ business. Particularly as we have acquired and driving our stores and really began to nurturing and integrate these new brands and businesses we have.","Now I won\u2019t have you expect any meaningful change in any immediate quarter right in front of us, but we are progressing with the rollout of Evolution Fresh across the country, sold within the Starbucks stores but as we go building up that distribution into the CPG channel that will continue.","We have big aspirations for what we can do with Teavana in this channel with all the business in time, first priority for Teavana though is our standalone Teavana business, as well as bringing those pieces into Starbucks business. But in time as we build equities of Teavana, as we develop the following around Evolution Fresh all of these products have great opportunity within the extended into the channel development business. And really leverage on top of the infrastructure we have, the relationships and trade we have, the distribution that we built, so you will actually see us build more overtime in that space.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jason West with Deutsche Bank.","Jason West - Deutsche Bank","Yeah. Just going back to the discussion around the shift in the consumer over the holidays? I am just wondering if you guys have past through the store base and if you have identified maybe a percentage of the store base that would be more exposed to that shift, if you could talk about what that number might be and are there different things that you are going to do in those stores that are little more retail oriented to kind of address this issue or is it really sort of the chain-wide effort that\u2019s going to be addressing this?","Howard Schultz","I would say that the any bricks and mortar company that is heavily skewed to malls will be more susceptible to this new change. I think we are in a unique position in that. Our mall based business is a very small component of our overall national footprint. So I don\u2019t think that you are going to see us be at a disadvantage because of our real estate portfolio. I think we introduced this subject to you, not to create fear and trepidation but willing to share with you what we believe to be a new dynamic change in consumer behavior. But linked to that once again, it\u2019s our strong belief that not only did we anticipate this but we have the resources, the capabilities and the assets unlike most traditional bricks-and-mortar retailers to be a beneficiary of this change.","And I think once again the Starbucks card platform and the Starbucks mobile card -- mobile transaction platform is still in its nascent stage. And we believe there is an opportunity to extend that value to our customers in ways that we have not yet shared with you. And we also think there is an opportunity overtime to take full advantage of what every other tech company is chasing with regard to mobile payments.","Jason West - Deutsche Bank","Just a quick follow-up on that, I mean the mobile ordering you guys alluded to in the past, is it something that would be sort of early stage or I guess, earlier in the pipeline to kind of be of pre-orders with your phone before you get to the store, just wondering that\u2019s something that\u2019s coming soon?","Howard Schultz","I\u2019m not going to explain with specificity of when that is coming. But I can tell you that we understand the value that that will create for our customer base and also we believe is significant incrementality as a result of it. And if you look at how quick we were and how early we were to adopt mobile payment in our stores, you can assume that over time we will meet in this area.","Jason West - Deutsche Bank","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Andy Barish with Jefferies.","Andy Barish - Jefferies","Hi guys. On a margin question in the Americas, obviously the performance in the first quarter was fantastic but regard to the rest of the year, it\u2019s sort of moderate increases which implies kind of flattening of margin, maybe even, some challenges in the two key to maintain margins with some of the investment marketing spend you spoke about, Troy. Can you give us a little help directionally there for the rest of the year on America\u2019s margins?","Troy Alstead","Yeah, Andy. No absolutely not. We would anticipate the balance of the year to be able to moderately expand the margin in Americas. Now the first quarter was more than -- actually more than I would say it\u2019s moderate. Remember that was fueled by some unusual events from a year ago, like the leadership conference as an example. Like Superstorm Sandy certainly had impact on us as it did all of the retailers. So the degree of expansion, life won\u2019t be as high but balance of the year has it -- wasn\u2019t that first quarter where we had every expectation to continue to roll the top line and improve possibility to our store system.","Andy Barish - Jefferies","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from Keith Siegner with UBS. Your line is open.","Keith Siegner - UBS","Thanks. I just want to follow-up on some of the comments related to the promotional activity in December. If you take it out, this is a uniquely Starbucks\u2019 capability to leverage the dramatic increases in the amount of customers in the social and mobile and digital. Has that usage picked up? How has this advantage may have picked up. In other words like how quickly can you respond to these things. How customizable or personalized can you take initiatives and that you have so many more customers on this program. Does the uptick change or uptick change from what you would have seen in years passed. Some color on that would very\u2026","Howard Schultz","Thanks Keith. Let me ask Adam Brotman, our Chief Digital Officer to respond to them.","Adam Brotman","Hi Keith. It\u2019s a great question. And the answer is absolutely, we\u2019ve never been more nimble in terms of our ability to respond using our digital assets. We saw that this -- I mean, the holiday period, where we\u2019re able to react. A very personalized level, even some geo-targeted aspects of what we\u2019re doing and it is significant improvement over where were in the same quarter last year. And it speaks to the number of customer participating not only in My Starbucks Rewards but on the mobile platforms. This puts in a great position to be even more nimble as we go forward.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Will Slabaugh with Stephens. Your line is open.","Will Slabaugh - Stephens","I think just a quick follow-up on Europe, a nice surprise there. I was wondering if you could break down sort of where you feel like you\u2019re winning right now, where you turned that inflection point where there still an opportunity. And then secondarily, are you seeing a difference in your company owned traditional stores versus performance in some of the license with a more captive audience.","Troy Alstead","Thanks. Well, our license business has been a healthier component of our business in EMEA for quite sometime. We frankly struggled more over the last handful of years in our company operated business. Now as I look at the first fiscal quarter and break it down price little bit, what\u2019s very encouraging to me is that the revenue growth we saw and the trajectory change we saw was almost evenly split between the licensed business and company operated comp growth driven.","The licensees have tipped a little bit stronger but not much. Both were very strong contributors to the increasing revenue and were built around profitability. And that\u2019s two messages there. One is the significant focus we\u2019ve had on store execution and operations, on management of the stores, on supply chain into the stores. All of that has been a heavy focus of ours as you\u2019ve been hearing us talk about for a couple years now and that\u2019s paying off. Absolutely, fundamentally, we are seeing topline response. We are seeing customers respond and bottom lines improving.","We also -- now, as we really being to mature and flush out our licensed strategy to the region, we understand much better today what component of that region should have the licensed execution as it would have accelerated that. And even over the last year and a half, we converted and sold off some former company operated stores to licensees as we made that transition that has contributed nicely and of course that has a higher margin execution. It gets us back towards the customers to your point that we couldn\u2019t have a lot easier.","And in some cases it positions the licensee to better able to operate in a particular geography of venue that we are in currently. So both of those things are progressing and I will have to say I think we are winning right now, both in company operated and in licensed part of our business there.","Will Slabaugh - Stephens","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Tarantino with Robert W. Baird.","David Tarantino - Robert W. Baird","Hi. Good afternoon. My question is on the new store development within the U.S. And it sounds like you are seeing some very good results from some of your, the newer class of openings and you mentioned there was opportunity or wide space related to drive through. So, I\u2019m just wondering if all of that is giving you more confidence and maybe stepping up the unit growth rate as you look out to maybe 2015 or \u201916 or beyond. Is this maybe a precursor for accelerating the growth?","Howard Schultz","Maybe I answered that. I spoke about drive throughs and I spoke about the $1.2 million for new stores. In addition to that, we\u2019ve had unusual success in very unique configurations and store types. Many of you probably got red that we\u2019ve opened up about four, five stores that are literally old containers and they are drive-through only and walk up.","So volumes on those stores against the cost to build them are -- it has given us great confidence than you have unusual opportunity in traditional stores, drive throughs and what I just previously described as unique configurations both in size and location. We\u2019ve also done a lot of work on verticals, for example hospitals, where we do not have a lot of penetration.","So, I would say that you probably will se us go after a significant build of additional market share in the future with an acceleration of U.S. stores that are highly targeted against the return on investment and the sales that we are currently achieving in the kind of stores that we have not opened before.","And in addition to that you will certainly see traditional several stores around the country. But I think that despite commentary on key change in customer behavior that we have underestimated for the last two, three years, the opportunity that we have across North America for additional stores and specifically additional store types meeting with directors.","There is no job to drive through, has surprised all of us in terms of its volume, return on investment and the opportunity to build stores that we didn\u2019t think existed in the past and you will see us do that in great numbers in the future, coupled with what I\u2019ve just described.","David Tarantino - Robert W. Baird","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Diane Geissler with CLSA.","Diane Geissler - CLSA","Good afternoon. Thanks for the question. I wanted to ask on the mobile payments in China. I think it is fair to say that smartphone technology has vastly improved from when you launched this program in the U.S. But even if we look at the U.S. as sort of examples, the early years where you saw card loads certainly in the 70%, 80%, 90% range and now they\u2019ve sort of stabilized in the 30%, 40% range? Can you talk a little bit about your expectations for China? I mean the China consumer have embraced smartphone technologies. So I think the market is bright for the launch of this type of platform? But maybe you could give a little bit of more detail about what you plan there, how it will differ from what we see in the U.S.? And then your expectation sort of how you are going to measure yourself in is it heading your goals or not? If you could give us some details around that, I would really appreciate it? Thank you.","Howard Schultz","I mean, I think, Adam, is going to answer that question. I will -- I\u2019m not saying that I\u2019m -- I think we\u2019re all sitting here in surprise that we haven\u2019t done one question with regard to the biggest opportunity in front of us in terms of geography about China and market that we have over thousand stores are best performing market outside of the U.S., you are talking about wide space, its uncharged with opportunity. Adam go ahead?","Adam Brotman","Yeah. Diane, it is a great question and the answer is, absolutely we believe the opportunity for mobile payments is something that we\u2019ll spend not limited China but frankly there are many markets around the globe. We have already bought it to all of ten markets and China we believe will be no exception, highly technologically savvy, consumer base, one where they were talk about MSR offering and growth and we believe that China will be a great opportunities to do the kinds of things there then we are trying here in terms of mobile payment, mobile royalty, innovation of the store. So, yes, I can\u2019t get any specific but that\u2019s coming soon.","Howard Schultz","John, go ahead.","John Culver","Yeah. Diane, this is John Culver. With regards to just add on to what Adam is saying. Two years ago we launched the Starbucks rewards program in China and in that short period of time we now have nearly 4 million members on the platform. And to Adam\u2019s point, we are laying the rails right now for a much more accelerated digital experience for our customers in China.","We just launched some in concert this Chinese New Year, the first ever store value gift card in our stores in China. And then, obviously, continue to rollout the opportunity as it relates to Starbucks app on both the iPhone, as well as the Android application. So a big opportunity for us to take what we\u2019ve done in U.S., transfer that knowledge and capability into China and look at a whole new way of reinventing the experience for our customers there.","JoAnn DeGrande","","Mike, we have the time for one last question today, please?","Operator","The last question comes from Karen Holthouse with Credit Suisse.","Karen Holthouse - Credit Suisse","Hi. Another quick question on the drive throughs. This is something that\u2019s been talked about more on the last couple of calls and I\u2019m just curious for units have already have them. Is there an opportunity to really go into those units and optimize throughput, find better ways to ensure order accuracy and if so, what\u2019s the opportunity for that and what\u2019s the timeline for addressing it? Thanks.","Howard Schultz","","Thanks, Karen. The answer to that is absolutely yes. One of the things that we fundamentally know is that in our drive throughs, not only do we have huge opportunities for more directors around U.S. The economics are strong, they have -- as we said in past quarters cost higher than our full portfolio including the non drive-through starts.","So we see every great indication of drive throughs and including by the way to improve throughput to up-level the experience for the customers as they come through, to change how our mix engages with the customer in that line, help move that deck of cards more quickly.","We have significant work underway to do exactly that. And part of that by the way includes enhanced technologies. Some of the same things you\u2019ve heard us talk about we would see it innovate around in terms of payment and ordering into cafe, inside the store will be very through and very beneficial in the drive through. So much more to come but we will go back to all of our existing drive through of this mix enhancements today. I\u2019m quite confident there will be incremental drivers to our business.","Karen Holthouse - Credit Suisse","Great. Thank you, guys.","JoAnn DeGrande","Thank you, Karen. That concludes our earnings call for today. Thank you all for joining us. We will talk to you again next quarter.

Kevin?","Kevin Johnson","Well, good afternoon and welcome. Q1 was an exceptional quarter for Starbucks. The positive business momentum we've created over the past fiscal year continues with a strong start to fiscal 2020. These results were fueled by a healthy balance of comparable sales growth and new store development, as well as continued expansion of our Global Coffee Alliance with Nestl\u00e9.","I'm especially pleased that we delivered meaningful margin expansion in the quarter, even as we continued to invest in the key areas to support sustainable growth, first and foremost in our partners, as well as in beverage innovation and digital customer relationships.","Given the strength of our Q1 results, we had intended to raise certain aspects of our full year financial outlook for fiscal 2020. However, due to the dynamic situation unfolding with the coronavirus, we are not revising guidance at this time. But as we get more clarity on the situation, we will transparently communicate with investors.","Our immediate focus is on two key priorities in China: first, caring for the health and well-being of our partners and customers in our stores; second, playing a constructive role in supporting local health officials and government leaders as they work to contain the coronavirus. That said, we remain optimistic and committed to the long-term growth potential in China, a market we have been in for more than 20 years.","Before I hand over to Pat, who will provide more detail on our Q1 financial performance, let me share some highlights for the quarter, which provide powerful evidence of the unique strength of our brand. I will also outline additional steps we are taking that continue to elevate Starbucks in ways that will inspire our partners and deepen our relationship with customers.","In the first quarter, Starbucks delivered global revenue growth of 9%, excluding the 2% impact to streamline activities. This was led by strong comp sales growth of 5% and net new store growth of 6% over the last 12 months. At the forefront of these results were our two lead growth markets, the U.S. and China, along with Channel Development.","The U.S. grew revenues by an impressive 9% in Q1, led by comp sales growth of 6%, including comp transaction growth of 3% for a third consecutive quarter. With a two-year sales comp of 10% for the past two consecutive quarters, it is clear that our focus on the customer experience, beverage innovation and digital customer relationship is working.","At the center of this are our Starbucks partners and the investments we continue to make in them. It is no coincidence that following last September's leadership experience, where we hosted 12,000 Starbucks field leaders and outlined a series of partner-focused initiatives and investments, our partners delivered one of the most successful U.S. holiday seasons in the history of the company.","Our partners in China also delivered a solid quarter, with revenues increasing by 15% in Q1, excluding a 2% impact of foreign exchange, fueled by a 16% increase in net new stores over the past 12 months and a 3% increase in comp. And for the fourth consecutive quarter, we grew total transactions at a double-digit percentage pace in this strategically important market.","On every market visit I make to China I experience firsthand the passion, innovation and commitment our partners demonstrate each and every day and I'm proud of them. Given the purposeful and highly differentiated partner investments, it is no surprise Starbucks was recently named China's best employer by Aon Hewitt for the fifth consecutive year.","Finally, on the strength of our channel partnerships with Nestl\u00e9 and Pepsi, our Channel Development revenue grew 5% in Q1 when normalized for the 7% impact of the Tazo and Global Coffee Alliance transitions, boosting our share of the coffee market outside of specialty retail. This is another example of the strength of the Starbucks brand that continues to expand globally, reaching more customers through more channels.","Collectively these results demonstrate that we are on the right track with our Growth at Scale agenda. I am especially grateful to all Starbucks partners around the world who celebrate coffee and human connection and whose passion and commitment to the Starbucks mission and our company values are creating long-term sustainable value for all stakeholders. ","As we approach the 50th anniversary of Starbucks in 2021, I am optimistic about the future. Why? Well when I step back and look at the quarter, I see multiple proof points of the unique strength of our brand, strength that is derived from targeted investments that bolster our competitive position in a high-growth category enabling us to unlock the full potential of one of the world's most admired and trusted brands.","In the U.S., customer connection scores reached another all-time high in Q1 as our dedicated store partners continue to elevate the Starbucks experience and deliver the very best moments with our customers each and every day. We realize this is a key differentiator for Starbucks and we continue to make investments in partner hours, benefits and training.","There's no doubt that our partners and the investments we make in them are at the core of creating the unique Starbucks Experience that fueled our Q1 performance. Additionally our brand equity research in the first quarter confirmed that Starbucks continues to lead consumer perceptions of specialty coffee retail concepts in the U.S., well ahead of other brands including so-called third wave independent and local coffee concepts.","This is aided in part by our proprietary beverage innovation and our unique ability to personalize handcrafted beverages at scale. We strengthened this competitive advantage in Q1 by extending our Cold Brew platform and Cold Foam options with two new seasonal beverages: Pumpkin Cream Cold Brew and Irish Cream Cold Brew which together contributed to our traffic growth for the quarter.","Notably for five consecutive quarters our comp growth has outperformed the external indexes and benchmarks we track in the restaurant and QSR space. Our brand strength was also evident on the digital front in Q1. In the U.S., we added a record 1.4 million customers to our 90-day active Starbucks Rewards member base ending the quarter with 18.9 million active members a 16% increase over prior year.","This is important because we know from experience that when customers join our rewards program their total spend with Starbucks increases meaningfully. We also know that Starbucks is increasingly valued for convenience as the mix of Mobile Order & Pay transactions in the U.S. grew to 17% in Q1.","And our industry-leading digital platform will further differentiate us from the competition over time. Our digital progress in China was equally compelling and is resonating with the digitally savvy Chinese consumer. Proprietary research in Q1 showed that Starbucks remains the country's most beloved coffee brand and customers' first choice for away-from-home coffee.","In the first quarter sales from China's mobile orders jumped to 15% of total revenue up from 10% the past quarter with 9% coming from delivery and 6% from mobile order and pickup.","Underpinning these results was the continued growth of China's 90-day active Starbucks Rewards members reaching 10.2 million customers in Q1. That's 40% growth over the prior year when the program was relaunched. Our first quarter digital strength in China was further evidenced by record sales on Alibaba's Singles' Day shopping festival, the number 1 card position on Tmall and the leading brand on WeChat social gifting platform.","Over our 20 years in China, we have established unparalleled brand stature by delivering a unique, premium experience to our customers. Outside of specialty coffee retail the power of our brand was demonstrated by the continued expansion of our Global Coffee Alliance with Nestl\u00e9, now in more than 40 markets including the additional five new markets we entered in Q1 with product sales significantly ahead of expectations.","Every customer interaction in our stores establishes customer affinity and brand loyalty with the Global Coffee Alliance then acting as a brand amplifier bringing Starbucks coffee to new channels and new markets.","Our Starbucks Reserve Roasteries are also important brand amplifiers. In November we opened our Roastery in Chicago our sixth Roastery globally to a phenomenal customer reception. Since the opening, the store continues to gain international attention attracting an average of 10,000 visitors a day with a peak of more than 21,000 visitors in a single day.","I want to thank our Starbucks partners who work in the Chicago Roastery as well as the City of Chicago for the warm welcome and spectacular response to the opening of the world's largest Starbucks. These proof points provide clear evidence that the Starbucks brand is not only strong, but is getting stronger through the focus and discipline of our Growth at Scale agenda. In fact just last week Starbucks was named one of Fortune's Most Admired Companies for the 18th consecutive year.","In summary I could not be more pleased with our Q1 results and how they reinforce the unique strength of Starbucks. But make no mistake, we do not take this for granted. We will continue to take clear and decisive steps to build our brand for the future, focusing on our competitive advantages, investing in our partners as they create those unique Starbucks experiences for our customers driving beverage innovation and enhancing digital relationships. And while we do this we are further amplifying our brand through the Global Coffee Alliance and committing to an even higher level of social responsibility with bolder aspirations for environmental sustainability.","As many of you have seen last week we disclosed an ambitious multi-decade aspiration for Starbucks to become a resource-positive company which means we as a company want to give more than we take from the planet.","We thought long and hard about this aspiration and are being deliberate in our approach. Over the past year, we conducted a rigorous environmental sustainability study in partnership with third-party advocacy groups. We embraced science-based targets and utilized industry experts to audit every aspect related to Starbucks' impact on climate, water and waste.","We have shared the sustainability baseline report and our aspirations transparently on our website knowing that this will not be easy. The journey will not be linear. It will require innovation, many industry partnerships, alignment with other like-minded companies, public policy support and engagement of Starbucks partners and customers.","This will challenge us in new and different ways and will require transformational change and measured risk-taking. We start this journey understanding our footprint, building upon our decade of experience in sustainability and committing to lead on something that is important to all of humanity: taking care of our planet. And we invite others to join us.","As announced last week, we will be transparent in reporting short- and long-term progress against our goals and we will start with preliminary targets for 2030. That will be the focus of our research and operational plans going forward. Then on Starbucks' 50th anniversary in 2021 we will formalize our 2030 environmental goals and our strategies based on what we have learned between now and then.","As we embark on this journey, we will prioritize, sequence and balance our investments as we do across every aspect of our business. We remain committed to our ongoing double-digit EPS growth model. We have momentum. Our brand is strong and we will continue to responsibly grow our business by staying true to our mission and values: doing the right things to care for and inspire our partners, creating great Starbucks experiences for our customers and pursuing a bold aspiration for the planet.","In closing, I would again like to thank my fellow Starbucks partners around the world. I have the privilege of sharing all your good work on these calls and it is an honor to serve you and all of our stakeholders. I would also like to reiterate our support for the ongoing work as we respond to the coronavirus in a thoughtful and responsible way to protect our partners and support health officials and the government as they work to contain this public health risk.","Starbucks has made a donation to the Red Cross to help support these efforts. We are making decisions real time to ensure the health and well-being of our partners and I am proud of how Starbucks, China is navigating a very dynamic situation.","Now I'll turn it over to Pat for a deeper dive into our Q1 financial results and an update on our FY 2020 outlook. Pat?","Pat Grismer","Thank you, Kevin, and good afternoon, everyone. I am pleased to report non-GAAP EPS of $0.79 for our first quarter of fiscal 2020, exceeding our expectations and reflecting meaningful margin expansion in each of our operating segments. This represents a 16% increase year-over-year when excluding an $0.08 headwind related to a lower income tax rate in fiscal 2019. These results underscore the strength of our brand globally and the outstanding underlying momentum across our business as we continue to execute our \u201cGrowth at Scale\u201d agenda.","I will first take you through our Q1 fiscal 2020 operating performance by segment followed by an analysis of our consolidated margin performance. I will then share some perspective on our outlook for the full fiscal year. Our Americas segment delivered revenue growth of 9% in Q1, primarily driven by 6% comp sales growth and net new store growth of 3% over the past 12 months.","Our U.S. business delivered an impressive 6% comp sales growth in Q1, driven equally by transactions and ticket. These results were driven by an improved partner-led in-store experience, a strong beverage lineup and increased digital customer engagement.","Beverage led on comp growth for a sixth consecutive quarter driving approximately five points of comp sales growth with strength across all beverage categories with food contributing the remaining point. Our cold platform continues to resonate with customers during all seasons and was our primary growth engine for the quarter led by cold coffee.","Importantly, the growth in cold beverages in Q1 occurred in all dayparts and all regions reflecting broad appeal across our customer base. Following the success of our fall seasonal offerings at the start of the quarter and building on the success of last year's season, our holiday platforms delivered strong performance that exceeded our expectations.","Returning favorites such as Peppermint Mocha and the new innovations like Irish Cream Cold Brew created momentum throughout the holiday period. And as Kevin mentioned, our Starbucks Rewards loyalty program continued to gain momentum building on the launch of multi-tier redemption last April.","Our reimagined Happy Hour resonated well with customers driving additional member growth. And Gift Card activations delivered their strongest year-over-year dollar growth in four years. Ticket growth of 3% for the quarter was led by pricing, beverage attach and food.","We saw transaction growth in both the morning and afternoon dayparts for a third consecutive quarter and our highest quarterly peak transaction growth in three years. These improvements would not have been possible without the dedication of our Green Apron partners, who continue to accommodate higher volumes while elevating the customer experience.","And finally, Americas non-GAAP operating margin expanded 50 basis points to 22.0% in Q1, driven by sales leverage and supply chain efficiencies, partially offset by growth in wages and benefits and to a lesser degree investments in labor hours and inflation and occupancy costs.","Moving on to International. The segment delivered revenue growth of 10% in Q1 excluding a 6% unfavorable impact of streamline-related activities. This was led by 11% net new store growth over the past 12 months. International's comp sales growth of 1% in Q1 was adversely impacted by two points due to a soft quarter in Japan, which was lapping 6% comp sales growth from last year.","China our lead international growth market delivered solid comp sales growth of 3% in Q1 including 1% comp transaction growth. Continued expansion and strong performance of mobile ordering as well as the up-leveled Starbucks Rewards program were primary drivers of these results.","At the end of the first quarter, mobile order and pickup have been rolled out to more than 100 cities, encompassing more than 90% of our store base just seven months following the launch of the program. And we expanded delivery to 130 cities, covering more than 80% of our portfolio.","International's non-GAAP operating margin increased by 170 basis points to 21.4%. When excluding the 70 basis point impact of streamline related activities, non-GAAP operating margin expanded by 100 basis points driven by sales leverage and supply chain efficiencies, partially offset by unfavorability in product mix and strategic investments notably in-store and digital initiatives.","On to Channel Development. Revenue declined 2% in Q1 as we lapped two items that benefited fiscal 2019; the sale of Tazo branded products to Unilever and transition activities related to the Global Coffee Alliance. When excluding the 7% adverse impact of these items, as well as Global Coffee Alliance transition activities in fiscal 2020, revenue increased by 5% in Q1 led by strong underlying growth in the Global Coffee Alliance.","This segment's non-GAAP operating margin improved by 70 basis points over the prior year. Normalizing for the 20 basis point impact of the transition activities I just mentioned, Channel Development's operating margin expanded 90 basis points in Q1 driven by favorable distribution efficiencies and business mix.","Finally, at the consolidated level, non-GAAP operating margin of 18.2% in Q1 increased by 80 basis points year-over-year, primarily driven by sales leverage and supply chain efficiencies. The favorability from these items was partially offset by growth in wages and benefits and to a lesser degree by rent inflation and investments in store labor hours.","I am particularly pleased that we delivered meaningful margin expansion while also continuing to invest in our partners, our stores and our digital capabilities to keep the Starbucks brand strong and relevant. To a great extent, this reflects our ability to drive improvements in margin from sales leverage as well as supply chain and G&A efficiencies and to reinvest a meaningful portion of that upside in our key brand differentiators, which strengthen our competitive position and fuel long-term sustainable growth.","Now moving on to our guidance for fiscal 2020. Given the strength of our first quarter results, we had intended to raise certain aspects of our guidance for the full fiscal year. However, as Kevin mentioned given the extraordinary circumstances that are rapidly developing in China, we are simply reaffirming our original guidance and we'll provide an update when we have better visibility to the impact of coronavirus. The magnitude of the impact will depend on the duration of store closures as we work with local authorities to manage the situation and protect our partners and customers.","At present, we are unable to reasonably estimate the impact to the business. Notwithstanding, the fact that our China business represented only 10% of our global revenues in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, we expect these events to have a material impact on our international segment and consolidated results for the second quarter and full year of fiscal 2020. In any event based on what we currently know, we expect the impact to our business will be temporary. Our brand is very strong in China and our confidence in the profitability and growth potential of this business is undiminished.","To summarize, we are very pleased with our first quarter performance and view these results as further validation of our strategy to grow Starbucks at scale with greater focus and discipline. We appreciate the hard work of our Starbucks partners who delivered these results in a manner that remains true to our company's mission and values, which is the core of our business.","And with that, Kevin and I are happy to take your questions, joined by Roz Brewer and John Culver as Durga outlined at the top of our call. Thank you. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from John Glass from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","John Glass","Thanks very much. Could you maybe just help us understand or dimensionalize the impact of China a little bit more, first just when the stores were closed? Those stores that aren't closed maybe a magnitude of what you think the sales declines are currently. And do you continue to pay employees? I assume you do, but just clarify that.","And then finally is delivery and offset. Is there a delivery business that can offset some of the closures, or has that also been curtailed by this outbreak?","Kevin Johnson","Thanks John. We'll have John Culver, kind of, give you a little bit of color on the day-to-day in China and then Pat will follow up on the second part of your question related to the implications. John?","John Culver","Yeah, John obviously Kevin reiterated the fact that we're focused on making sure we're taking care of our partners, their health and wellbeing as well as the customers.","In terms of the closures what we've seen is that over the last few weeks, I would say that as the situation has accelerated, we've taken action to close stores both working with the local government and the direction that they've given us but then also proactively closing stores in the country.","As we shared we currently have over half our stores closed in the market. We are assessing this each and every day. We do have delivery available to customers from stores that are remaining open. But again this is something that we continue to assess every day.","And let me just reiterate this is a very complex situation. And I'm working very closely with Belinda and the team in China to navigate this changing environment. And as a company, we've navigated complex situations before. And in China, we feel there's no other company that's better positioned to navigate this, given our relationship that we -- and trust we've been able to build with our partners and the relationship and trust that they've been able to build with their customers.","We will remain transparent as the events continue to unfold, but we do have complete confidence in the decisions that we're making and we will continue to provide complete support for our partners and for the people of China as they navigate this situation. We've been in the market for 20 years, and we have built an admired and trusted brand and we will continue to play the long game in China as we navigate in the coming weeks and months.","Pat Grismer","And John, this is Pat. Just to build on what John has said. It really is difficult to say at this juncture what the impact to our business will be and how it will show up in our financials given the fluidity of the situation. The business impact is largely a function of two things: the number of stores closed and the duration of closure. And with respect to the duration of closure, it's not entirely in our control.","I would say to a lesser extent the financial impact is a function of how we manage wage costs during the period of closure. So we're simply not able to provide a reasonable estimate at this point in time. We will need to move beyond the extended Chinese New Year holiday season to assess how the situation may be stabilizing and what the implications are for store closures.","We're probably looking at early March at the earliest to reasonably assess the implications for revenue, operating income, and EPS for our second quarter and for the full year. At the very latest, we'll provide an update in conjunction with our Q2 earnings release on April 28.","Our commitment is to maintaining transparency with investors. And as and when we have a reasonable basis for estimating the financial impacts for the quarter and year, we will communicate that information. But importantly, we do expect the impacts to be temporary. Our long-term double-digit growth model is fully intact. And of course, we will gain the benefit of lapping these temporary impacts next year.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Tarantino with Baird. Please proceed with your question.","David Tarantino","Hi. Good afternoon and Pat, maybe just following up on some of those questions around the guidance. Would you be willing to share where your guidance would be without this China issue so that we can understand where the baseline of the underlying business is, especially if you want to assume that it's temporary?","Pat Grismer","Yeah. I'm not going to provide details as to the magnitude of the guidance raise that we had planned or the specific line items, but I'm happy to share that we would have raised guidance for operating margin and for EPS on the strength of our Q1 results and visibility to some balance of year benefits. But given the uncertainty of the coronavirus situation in China and its impact to our near term results which we expect to be temporary, we felt it was best to defer any change to our guidance until we had better visibility to full year results including the impact of coronavirus.","And as I said before, we're committed to being responsibly transparent with our investors and we'll provide an update when we have reasonable confidence behind our numbers, because it would not be helpful to speculate at this time. But we could not be more pleased with our Q1 results across the board, the overall underlying momentum in our business and the confidence that that gives us behind our ability to deliver better than expected results setting aside this new issue that has emerged in China.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sharon Zackfia from William Blair. Please proceed with your question.","Sharon Zackfia","Hi. Good afternoon. I am not going to ask a China question. I actually wanted to talk about the Americas and the decline in G&A dollars year-over-year. I know it was modest, but if you could kind of talk about that whether that was just timing.","And then on Channel Development, I think you had expected revenue to go down somewhere between 7% and 9% this year. It was obviously a lot less than the first quarter in terms of the degree of decline. Is there something that's changed there? Is it a timing dynamic, more weighted to the back half of the declines? Any commentary would be helpful.","Pat Grismer","Sharon, this is Pat. I'm happy to take both questions. First of all with respect to the G&A, we are very pleased with the progress that we are making across the company in delivering our G&A efficiency commitment. As a reminder, we had committed to reduce by 100 basis points G&A as a percentage of system sales. That is not something that we routinely report, because we don't report system sales. But a good proxy for that is non-GAAP G&A as a percentage of revenue and we do report that.","We've added that to our supplementary schedules in our earnings release. And we have seen meaningful efficiencies emerge in the first quarter, and we expect that to continue balance of year. That's on the back of very significant work over the last 12 to 18 months to realize productivity in our G&A, not just in the Americas but really across all of our segments and certainly at corporate.","And then with respect to the Global Coffee Alliance, we did see better than expected results in the first quarter. We did anticipate a decline for the first quarter and for the full year, but our better than expected results in the first quarter resulted from outperformance, specifically in the Global Coffee Alliance. So we could not be more pleased with how our products are performing as we continue to partner with Nestl\u00e9 and we anticipate -- that was going to be one of the aspects of our improved guidance for the year is better than expected revenue growth from our Channel Development segment.","Kevin Johnson","John, you might want to comment on the new markets and...","John Culver","Yeah. And so Sharon, we couldn't be more pleased with the performance of the Channel Development business, in particular the Global Coffee Alliance. Through the quarter, we saw acceleration into 40 markets around the world where we have our products available through grocery as well as foodservice. We also are on path by the end of this quarter that we're in to be in over 50 markets. Our product sales continue to be significantly ahead of expectations both in terms of packaged coffee, Nespresso capsules, as well as Dolce Gusto.","When you look at our core business here in the U.S., Starbucks brand outgrew the total category for coffee. Roast and ground share grew 80 basis points, K-Cup share grew 40 basis points, and we've got some exciting new items that are coming up.","Later this spring, we previously announced that we're launching premium soluble coffee which will -- we're excited about and the big opportunity internationally with that. And then the launch that we had with our Creamers of four flavors, we're now expanding to an additional two new flavors given the recent success.","So, the Global Coffee Alliance itself is performing very well around the world and it's helping us continue to grow the Starbucks brand and amplify the brand as Kevin highlighted in his comments earlier.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Ivankoe from JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","John Ivankoe","Hi, thank you. I was hoping to get an update on Deep Brew, especially as we come into April. And I think we'll have some changes around the change in the AI machine that delivered some customized loyalty to customers as well as the change in the My Starbucks Rewards program.","Maybe as a slightly separate but related question, how much, I guess, confidence do you have as we do get in some of the strength that we saw in fiscal 2019 that we can lap some of those significant changes in the consumer offerings?","Kevin Johnson","John I'll let -- I'll have Roz give you a little perspective on Deep Brew and how it's influencing our performance.","Roz Brewer","Thanks John for the question. So, first of all, I wanted to ground everybody in what's happening in some of our equipment innovation. And one of the strongest pieces of innovation that we're seeing is combining our Mastrena II machine which is our espresso machine which we installed about 1,900 units last year. We've got 4,000 of those coming this year and those machines are AI-enabled. And so that is where we'll see the most significant deliverable around how we will integrate AI into understanding how to deliver the best coffee experience and also reducing the amount of time it takes to deliver and then giving us a chance to provide a variety of coffee to our customers. So, you'll see that come through.","There's also other innovation happening around Deep Brew, it will show up in various aspects of the business, but the equipment position is our strongest position right now. In addition to that when we talk about the things that have happened in our loyalty program, we did see some significant improvement in this quarter.","Right now we finished this quarter at about 18.9 million growth and that's a 16% improvement versus last year in our active Starbucks Rewards members. It's the strongest growth rate we've seen in three years. So, the work that we've done in our multi-tier redemption is also allowing us to grow our member base. We've got an increase of annual member growth of 2.7 million members and we're also seeing all-time records in that area as well.","It's enabling us to do really creative work with how we reimagine our Happy Hour performance making sure that we are understanding what the customer needs. There's a lot of customer insights that comes out of the work that we do as we grow our member base. We're also seeing the loyalty programs in the new membership behavior that we're seeing which contributed two points of the 6% comp for the quarter.","So, we are learning from what's happening as we align AI to our equipment and then the work that comes out of our loyalty programs in getting us closer to customers' expectations and it's making a difference.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein from Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Jeffrey Bernstein","Great. Thanks very much. Just a broader question on China learnings putting aside the coronavirus. Clearly, there's lots of competition in the market I think oftentimes coming in on the lower end in terms of experience and perhaps customer affluence. So, I'm just wondering what learnings would you say you've taken from this competition to better your positioning. It seems like you had a slowdown a year ago and now it seems like trends are moving in the upward direction.","Again I'm just wondering if you could provide some clarity in terms of which two or three initiatives would you say maybe you took some learnings from some of that competition to better yourself in the market. Thank you.","Kevin Johnson","John, why don't you take that one?","John Culver","Well, Jeffrey I think there's a couple of things around what we're doing in China. First and foremost, focusing on the premium quality of the coffee and our ability to handcraft the beverages for customers to the way they want it we feel that there is no other competitor in China that is able to do it and replicate it at the level that we are as signified by the more than seven million customers we serve a week across the 4,300 stores.","In addition you then have the opportunity of developing these relationships between our partners and our customers. And our partners are truly the differentiating factor in terms of bringing the Starbucks Experience to life for our customers. And when you go to China and you experience our people and their passion for coffee and their passion for service to customers that is a true differentiator that we have in the market.","You then put all that together in the third place. And the beauty of our stores, the inviting environment, the way in which we show up in the third place, we have an environment that customers come to and want to be with their family and friends.","Now, what we've done is we've also enhanced that with the digital experience. And we had a great quarter as it relates to digital. We now have 90-day actives grew 40% year-over-year to 10.2 million, that's nearly double from where it was a year ago.","We've also gone through and built out Mobile Order & Pay capabilities as well as delivery. So, mobile orders in total reached more than 15% of sales mix in the quarter compared to 10% in Q4, so 9% being deliveries, 6% being Mobile Order & Pay, and we're continuing to build out these digital relationships with customers. Then you couple all that with the Global Coffee Alliance in our RTD business in China. There is no other company brand in China that has the distribution points that we have. We have over 100,000 points of distribution of the Starbucks brand in China and our partners are bringing it to life every day. And it's their passion and their commitment that is making us successful and will continue to make us successful.","Kevin Johnson","Yeah. I mean, just add to John's comments and share a perspective, Jeffrey. I think look over \u2013 throughout history, we've had many, many, competitors enter the market. Look coffee is a large and growing addressable market. And we stay focused on the premium experience and the unique differentiators that we believe create Starbucks. And if you look throughout history there's a consistent pattern. In most all cases, our competitors shift to focusing more on the value play. And you see that time and time again. And I think we can continue to see that trend.","So the lesson for us is continue to amplify those unique differentiators that make us Starbucks. And that's why as you think about the Growth at Scale, we really as John said amplify the customer experience, we create in the store. We amplify the quality of our coffee and the beverage innovation that we provide, the fact those beverages are handcrafted and personalized for each and every customer. And then, we extended that in-store experience to a digital customer relationship. And those mix of ingredients are what differentiates us. And we feel confident that we understand them, we don't compromise those and we stay focused on playing our game. It's worked in the past, it's working today and it will work in the future.","Operator","Your next question comes from Matthew DiFrisco from Guggenheim Securities. Please proceed with your question.","Matthew DiFrisco","Thank you. I just had a couple of follow-ups. With respect to China \u2013 thank you for sharing that about the 10% of global revenue. Is it correct then I guess also to assume \u2013 in your past analyst days you've obviously shown how strong of a market and the opportunity on the returns there. That also would then by default have a higher contribution to the income I suspect. And then, if you could comment also is this \u2013 the travel restrictions are they having any sort of impact also on the ability to meet those growth targets? I know, you have 600 stores planned for that country. Is that something also that's sort of been halted during this time frame as well?","Pat Grismer","Yes. Matthew this is Pat. With respect to the first question China's operating income as a percentage of business unit operating income globally is slightly higher than the 10% that it represents of revenue and over to John for the second piece.","John Culver","Yeah. Matthew on the store side of it, I think it's too early to tell. We're committed to the numbers that we previously communicated around store growth in China, and we'll continue to build beautiful stores and accelerate the growth of the brand. Suffice it to say new stores contribute 80% of our revenue growth in the market. And it's an important component and one that we'll continue to focus on with the team there.","Operator","Your next question comes from Dennis Geiger from UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Dennis Geiger","Thank you. I just wanted to ask a bit more about the continued strength of U.S. traffic. Maybe Roz, could you talk a bit more about where that's coming from? How much of it is higher frequency from existing customers versus maybe some new customers and any other observations or insights that you can share? And then I think you've touched on the drivers, but if there's anything you can get into more on how much of it is experience versus digital versus the beverage innovation that you feel is driving that traffic piece if you can dive into that any more. Thank you.","Roz Brewer","Sure. Thank you, Dennis. So a couple of things. So, you heard Kevin in Kevin's remarks that we achieved a 6% comp in this quarter. Five of those six points came from beverage growth. So beverage innovation is a large part of the work that we're doing. That also is impacted by the work we're doing in in-store innovation also and the efficiencies that we're building there and then the digital relationships. If I could go a little bit further into the efficiencies that we're seeing in the store, we are actually doing a large amount of work around creating and improving productivity in the stores.","And in many cases, this is not productivity driving activity by taking hours out and really reducing our cost position in the stores, it's actually to allow our partners to spend more time with our customers. So we're seeing record scores at this time of customer connection scores in our stores. These are record numbers. We believe it's a multitude of things dealing with reducing the amount of task, the menial tasks that our store managers and our baristas have to do in our stores.","In addition to the equipment improvements that we're seeing, we have Nitro Cold Brew across all of our stores right now. When we put in a Mastrena two machine we're seeing operational efficiencies. It's a lower-profile machine. It allows our partners to see over the bar and interact with the customers. We're actually seeing a significant amount of work coming out of the work we have learned through our digital relationships, so we know more about who's coming in the morning.","Kevin's remarks also revealed that we are growing in every daypart. We're also seeing a significant growth pattern in our cold coffee. And so that includes all cold beverages meaning tea as well. And we're seeing cold beverages grow in the morning and the afternoon occasion. We're seeing also to the work \u2013 if you recall when we began to grow and change our program and loyalty around multi-tier redemption, we are seeing growth with the occasional customer. And there is some connection between cold coffee, afternoon occasion and the occasional customer. We are seeing growth after 11:00 in the afternoon with the occasional customer and with cold coffee.","So we think that it's that combination that's really happening for us, Dennis in terms of the beverage innovation so right beverage for our customer base, improving the work that our partners have to do in our stores so that they can interact with the customers and improve customer engagement and then learning from our digital relationships and understanding how to market to our customer base and bring them in the store and a great example of that is our reimagined happy hour. And so we're doing -- we're combining these three initiatives together and we are convinced that this work and the discipline around it is really driving our comp performance and we can see this in future quarters ahead of us.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sara Senatore with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.","Sara Senatore","Hi. Thank you. I have a question and then a quick follow-up. Just on the margins you had said that that was a place where you would have probably raised guidance. I think in general Pat you said you wanted to be conservative on guidance. But could you just talk a little bit about whether the beat versus expectations was in fact just how you position the guidance, or were there some surprises in there? Supply chain obviously the comps were a bit better than you would have I think expected or the long-term algorithm would suggest. So if you could just talk about where the margin upside with maybe some specific initiatives or sources would be.","And then just my follow-up is you had said that the wide-scale closures in China and the store closures to be the primary driver of the impact on the business. So does that suggest that for the stores that are remaining open you're not really seeing a change in trend in the China stores? I would have thought there'd be more of an impact on consumer confidence broadly.","Pat Grismer","Thank you, Sara. I'll take both questions and then pivot to John for additional color on China. First of all with respect to margin performance in the quarter, we were really delighted with our overall margin outcome in Q1. And what was better than expected was to your point higher-than-expected comp growth and with that strong sales leverage contributing positively to margin.","We also had stronger-than-expected benefits from our supply chain. Part of that was a function of the fact that in the U.S. we had such strong sell-through for our food, beverages and merchandise in holiday that we did not incur the level of inventory reserves that we've seen in the past. So a number of initiatives came together to deliver really strong margin performance in Q1 and that was the overriding contributor to what we had planned by way of a margin guidance raise for the full year.","With respect to China and the drivers of the business impact, I highlighted that the number of stores and duration of closure are the two primary drivers of the business impact. That's not to say that there aren't other drivers or other considerations here.","And certainly the reduced retail footfall that we're seeing across the country in the wake of the efforts taken to contain the virus and how customers generally are a bit reticent to perhaps visit commercial centers versus previously is another factor. So it is a contributing factor but the big factor really is the duration of closure. And I'll really pivot to John for additional color on that.","John Culver","Yes. So Sara obviously, we're tracking customers in transactions in our stores that we have opened. And we look at that each and every day. I would say that versus historical levels it definitely has slowed down from -- and Pat gave a little bit of color on that. We look at this each and every day. We've taken action in our open stores to adjust operating hours. We've also gone in and adjusted some of the product offerings based on supply chain availability.","And then we've also taken a look at specific trade areas where we can consolidate the stores into one store that's meaningful and reaches customers. So a lot of different actions are being taken. But as Pat shared the majority of the impact will come from the closed stores. But this is something we assess every day. As you're aware Chinese New Year has been extended and we're continuing to watch this very closely with the team in China.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Palmer with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.","David Palmer","Thanks. Just a follow-up on the U.S. and the beverage contribution of five points which is certainly much higher than it was a couple of years ago. If we look back that far it feels like the Frappuccino platform has stabilized and we've seen the benefit of some of the newer cold beverage platforms like Cold Brew and Nitro and perhaps with the help of Foam more recently. Could you talk about the biggest contributors to the improvement if we kind of look at this from a multi-year perspective? And if we're looking forward in a similar way could you talk about the biggest contributors to beverage growth going forward and how you feel about the pipeline of beverage news kind of keeping this energy going in the beverage side?","Roz Brewer","Yes. David thanks for the question. So a few things, if you recall last year this time we were probably issuing a lot of LTOs limited time offers. Some of that was Frappuccino-based. We were not penetrated with enough Nitro equipment technology in the stores. And Nitro, we knew was a growing category. So what you're seeing right now is our execution of putting Nitro in every one of our buildings in the U.S. And so that's a big transition that we've made.","In addition to that, playing into cold coffee and that process of creating and leaning into cold. And what you can see in the future from that is that we do have equipment improvements coming in our Cold Brew technology. Part of that is making sure that we are in stock at all times with this process and so we actually have equipment changes coming in the future for that.","I also mentioned too that you've seen us add alternative milks to our beverage line, which gives us a chance to customize. We know that there is a portion of our customer base that wants more of a healthy-for-you concept. And so you have seen some of the work that we have done to add oat milk regionally across the country. And as that becomes more available in the industry, we will acquire more of that capacity.","In addition to that, our whole -- our hot business is holding very nicely for us. Also from a holiday perspective, we introduced beverages that had high demand, if you think about the Irish Cream Cold Brew and then what we were able to do with the Pumpkin Spice category. What also gives us confidence as we go forward is the work that we're doing to make sure that we can deliver on what the customers are asking us for.","So you'll see more coming in the alternative milk category for us and then playing into the cold category. Also in terms of what helps us sell beverages is our food attach. We will be introducing a breakfast sandwich this year with a plant-based patty both in U.S. and Canada and the combination of those pairing is significant for us in terms of how we think about what the customer is asking for us to develop.","I'll also mention that we are seeing still growth in our morning daypart and with MOP. It's significant to also mention that in this quarter we opened our first convenience store, so we're seeing increased traffic when we create new formats. Our first introduction to this was -- is in Penn Plaza in New York. I had the chance to visit there in the last 10 days. Customer response is very favorable. It is showing just one more way that our brand is significant to our customer. Once you exit Penn Plaza station, you come right up to the store.","Customers are responding that it feels like a walk-through. It has our latest technology in there from the digital boards that really announce when your drink is ready. It's those kinds of things combined with beverage innovation that give us the confidence that we're listening to our customers and providing them access to our stores, access to our brand, the way they want to acquire their coffee and also listening to them in terms of how we should grow our beverage innovation. So we are committed to this category of cold coffee and also making sure that we're staying close to what the customer would like to see in what's next in their beverage preference.","Operator","Your next question comes from Eric Gonzalez with KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question.","Eric Gonzalez","Hey. Thanks for taking the question. I just have one question on China and then maybe a follow-up. So it seems like you're pushing more aggressively into lower-tier cities where coffee consumption is a little bit lower than it might be in the higher-tier cities. So if you can maybe talk about how the returns equation works in those lower-tier cities and maybe how the product mix differs in those types of locations.","And then as a follow-up to that with the delivery driving 9% sales mix this quarter, does that imply that the on-premise business is running negative if it's early days about this time last year in the delivery rollout? So can you maybe talk about why that might be the case? Is it competition potentially sales transfer, or is delivery itself cannibalizing your in-store business? Thanks.","John Culver","Yes. Eric, this is John. Just to answer your question, in the quarter we opened 167 stores. 46% of those were either in Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities. We do see very strong performance in lower-tier cities and we continue to make investments in those cities playing the long game. Clearly, when we open our first few stores, there is a lot of demand for Starbucks coming into those cities. As we continue to build out the footprint, what we've seen historically is that the total transactions obviously continue to grow and volumes show up as very similar to some of our outer tier one cities. So we feel good about our growth in these Tier 4, Tier 5 cities overall.","In terms of the delivery aspect of it at 9%, clearly we see a lot of benefit. It creates a whole new occasion for our existing customers and it's helping to drive transaction growth in our stores. We have over 3,500 stores in 130 cities, which is 80% of the store base having delivery available to them. We see it as an incremental for these existing customers as well as attracting new customers. In total, dollar profits continue to increase because of it. It's slightly margin-dilutive, but it does provide a higher ticket as well as a higher food attach. And we also see stronger demand in the mornings and during the lunch daypart.","Operator","The next question comes from Katherine Fogertey with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Katherine Fogertey","Great. Thank you. I have a couple of questions here. So first of all on International stripping out the strength that you saw in China, it looks like the rest of International was pretty weak on the traffic side. So I was wondering if you could walk through dynamics you're seeing in select markets there.","And then on the point that was made earlier about the supply chain and having some problem stocking stores in the region in China for the ones that are open, are you guys seeing difficulty transporting goods and services across the country at this point? And if that is the case, would there be any kind of ripple-through effect to maybe push out of new store opens and unit growth? Thank you.","John Culver","Yes. Katherine just real quick on the International side. As Pat highlighted we had two points of impact given the Japan market and what we saw in Japan. And when you look at Japan overall we had two major factors that influenced the comp performance in Japan. First was, early on in the quarter we had a devastating typhoon that went through the country which impacted two full days of sales in the market.","The second piece was the increase in consumption tax that took place in early October. The good news that we saw through the quarter is that comps accelerated through the quarter back to more normal levels. So we do feel good about the trends that we're currently seeing in Japan.","When you look more broadly across the International segment and you look at in specifics EMEA and Asia Pacific, we saw strong growth in both of those regions through our licensed partnerships. U.K. in particular did very well. We had Middle East and EMEA that also performed well. And then when you go over to Asia Pacific, Korea had another strong quarter which was great to see.","And then we have some smaller markets Philippines, Indonesia, Australia and New Zealand doing well as well. Switching to your question on China on goods and services, we're monitoring each and every day the supply chain challenges.","Clearly in Hubei province that area is impacted the most in terms of supply chain given the limited travel that's taking place in that city. We haven't seen that meaningful impact take hold in other cities. Although as I shared, we continue to adjust the menus in our stores and the offerings to accommodate any supply chain challenges we have.","Operator","Your next question comes from Greg Badishkanian with Citi. Please proceed with your question.","Fred Wightman","It's actually Fred Wightman on for Greg. Just one quick follow-up. In your response to an earlier question as far as the changes to the full year outlook you had alluded to some additional visibility. I think it was on operating margins or earnings for the balance of the year. What exactly were you referring to there?","Pat Grismer","Yes. So this is Pat. We see further upside in our Channel Development business specifically. So we have a stronger outlook for full year revenue and flow-through associated with that in Channel Development. There were a couple of other line items where we were anticipating making some adjustments as well.","But far and away the key driver of what we had planned by way of a guidance raise was the extraordinary strength of our Q1 results.","Operator","Your next question comes from Andrew Charles with Cowen & Company. Please proceed with your question.","Andrew Charles","Thanks. Roz one of the more impressive drivers of U.S. same-store sales has been growth in loyalty program with the 1.4 million members added during 1Q the seasonally highest it's been on record since you guys have been disclosing this.","And I was wondering with this growing base of users can you talk about changes in the tactics you're using to market more effectively to these customers to help increase the spend as well as the visitation?","Roz Brewer","So yes Andrew just a few things there. One is we have a very effective media spend. And so if you go back a year or so ago, we were -- either had very small investments in our media spend or not very directed. And so now we are better at understanding almost a one-to-one relationship with that consumer.","And so, if we have an e-mail address we can look at their past purchases and then suggest to them what they could enjoy in our stores and then also to alert them to Happy Hour and other events that are happening in the store. And we didn't have that in the past.","And in addition to that is when we introduce new items. And so what we're seeing from a Cold Brew perspective is also just speaking to them about the new cold beverages. So it's having that one-to-one relationship and access to them and can personalize the offerings that we have to our customer base.","In addition to that some of the other work that we're doing is to help our partners in the stores understand who's shopping in the stores. And so they know their customers just by the relationships that they've built over the years, but now they know a little bit more about who's shopping in their stores and who's visiting our caf\u00e9s.","And so we share that information with our partners in the stores and it makes them very effective at the work that they do.","And a lot of the insights that we're gathering we're using it to make our decisions, and also to what's fueling how we think about what innovation that we want to build and develop. And so we're using our insights effectively, learning from our new members that are growing and then watching the work that we need to do as we look at the multi-tier redemption program, which is still just approaching a year in terms of its full national rollout.","Operator","Your next question comes from Gregory Francfort with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.","Gregory Francfort","Thank you very much for the question. Just looking back at the U.S. business on, I guess 18 to 24 months of a slowdown in store growth. With that perspective, have you seen maybe less cannibalization from new stores, or is that something that you guys have seen maybe flow back in the comps and that's part of the reason why they've picked up a few points? Any perspective on that?","And then as we look forward, I think we're at the bottom of your 3% to 4% unit growth is this, kind of, how we should think about the longer term framework for what you envision store growth being in the U.S.? Thanks.","Roz Brewer","So a few things there in terms of our store growth in the U.S. And so we're seeing pretty much the same amount of cannibalization in our business. There is no change there. For us the best investment we can make is our new store growth. We appreciate the return on invested capital that we're seeing with our new store investments so you'll see that continue.","What we've been doing is really looking at our format and making sure that as we add delivery, add new stores, we're looking at coverage and how we cover our customer in the United States. One of the things I'll mention is the combination of delivery to our new store growth. We just added a total of 3,500 stores now across 49 markets in delivery. And so we have a broad amount of coverage in the U.S. combining with that. And we still have the estimated number of new stores coming in the U.S. and really advancing our format development anything from our new format in terms of the convenience stores, all the way to our Roastery plan. So we are still encouraged by our investments in new real estate and we're not seeing any shift in cannibalization in our business right now.","Patrick Grismer","And Greg this is Pat. To build on what Roz has said, we would reaffirm our net store growth guidance for the U.S. of 3% to 4%.","Operator","Your last question comes from R.J. Hottovy with Morningstar. You may ask your question.","R.J. Hottovy","Thanks and thanks for let me get the question in here. Just one follow-up question for Roz. You, kind of, hinted on this at the last answer, but one area we haven't heard a lot about is that delivery program. And obviously you've been working with some new restaurant formats and developing that. But just wanted to see if you could provide us an update in terms of where that initiative stands and what takeaways you've had. Obviously you share some takeaways from China in terms of attach rates and new customer growth, but just any takeaways you've seen at the delivery program so far in the U.S.?","Roz Brewer","Sure. So yes we are continuing to expand. Because we're now at 75% U.S. coverage of all Starbucks stores, we are now into a national marketing program, which if you remember this time last year we were roughly about 115 stores with no marketing against it. And so we are encouraged to continue to see what happens when we alert the customer that delivery is available at their favorite location.","Our stores are equipped from a technology standpoint. The partners are well-trained in terms of how to handle the tradeoff between the transition of the beverage to the pickup delivery person. So operationally it's working extremely well. We'll continue to watch it.","One thing I'll say about the U.S. business if you compare it to China in terms of delivery, the adoption rate is still pretty modest in the U.S. And so we're just moving right along with the customer and making it available to as much coffee coverage as we can in the U.S. but it's modestly being adopted in the U.S. if you compare it to China.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that was our last question today. I will now turn the call over to Kevin Johnson for closing remarks.","Kevin Johnson","Well, thank you all for joining us on today's call. I want to close by recognizing my Starbucks partners around the world for such a strong Q1 performance and the underlying business momentum that we are building as a company. I also want to recognize my Starbucks partners who are navigating the dynamic situation related to the coronavirus in China.","As we deal with these extraordinary circumstances, we will remain focused on caring for the health and wellbeing of our partners, supporting health officials as they work to contain the coronavirus and doing all of this staying true to the mission and values that built this great company.","To our investors, I appreciate your patience and understanding as we work through the temporary business impacts in China. We are as confident as ever in the strength and resilience of our double-digit earnings growth model for the long-term and we are committed to maintaining transparency as we gain a better understanding of the magnitude and duration of the near-term business impacts. I serve all stakeholders of this great company and I'm so optimistic about our future as we continue to build an enduring company.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Starbucks Coffee Company's First Quarter Fiscal Year 2018 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","I will now turn the call over to Tom Shaw, Vice President Investor Relations. Mr. Shaw, you may now begin your conference.","Tom Shaw","Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us today to discuss our first quarter results for fiscal 2018. Today's discussion will be led by Kevin Johnson, President and CEO; and Scott Maw, CFO. For Q&A, we'll be joined by Roz Brewer, Group President Americas and Chief Operating Officer; Cliff Burrows, Group President, Siren Retail; John Culver, Group President, International and Channels; Matt Ryan, Global Chief Strategy Officer; and dialing in from Milan, Howard Schultz, Executive Chairman.","This conference call will include forward-looking statements which are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements. Any such statements should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements in our earnings release and risk factors discussions in our filings with the SEC, including our last Annual Report on Form 10-K. Starbucks assumes no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements or information.","GAAP results in fiscal 2018 includes several items related to strategic actions, including restructuring and impairment charges, transaction and integration costs, gains related to changes in ownership of international markets, and other items. These items are excluded from our non-GAAP results.","Please refer to our website at investor.starbucks.com to find the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures referenced on today's call with their corresponding GAAP measures. This conference call is being webcast and an archive of the webcast will be available on our website as well.","I will now turn the call over to Kevin.","Kevin Johnson","Well, thank you, Tom, and welcome, everyone. Starbucks reported another quarter of record financial results in Q1 of fiscal 2018, highlighted by continued acceleration in our China\/Asia Pacific segment. On today's call, I will provide an overview of company-wide performance in Q1 with a particular emphasis on our two unique and powerful global growth engines: our retail businesses in the U.S. and China.","I'll then turn the call over to Scott, who will provide further detail on segment performance and an update on the impact of the new tax law.","For the quarter, Starbucks delivered record revenues of $6.1 billion, a non-GAAP operating income margin of 19.2% and a non-GAAP EPS of $0.65 per share. And we opened 700 net new stores globally, with our newest class of stores continuing to deliver industry-leading returns and higher AUVs than the immediate prior class.","China once again our fastest growing market in Q1, with 6% comp growth, driven entirely by increased transactions and 30% revenue growth. Customers' response to our Shanghai Roastery has been extraordinary and the Roastery is already performing well above expectation. I'll share more details around Starbucks' plans to maximize our opportunity in China in a moment. But let me start the call with an update on our U.S. business in Q1.","We ended Q1 with 6% revenue growth and 2% comp growth in the U.S. Continued strength in throughput at peak and strong digital performance were noteworthy highlights in the quarter. But we recognized that overall our U.S. operating performance fell short of expectation. We have isolated the drivers of our Q1 under performance and I want to take you through both the details and the corresponding actions we are taking.","Through the first half of the quarter, our U.S. comps were 3%, with strong performance at peak, more than offsetting some softness in the afternoon. But as we launched our holiday program in mid-November, we saw slowdown in transaction comps, bringing total comps for the back half of the quarter to roughly 1% with transaction comps slightly negative. Even though we grew operating income, these developments contributed to margin compression we experienced in the U.S. compared to Q1 a year ago.","The decline in transaction comp was primarily driven by two factors. First, while traditionally contributing to Q1 comp growth, our limited-time holiday beverages, holiday gift-cards and holiday merchandise available for purchase in our stores' lobby underperformed in Q1. Holiday LTOs and merchandise did not resonate with our customers as planned.","Let me be more specific. In Q1, our food comp was 2%. Our core beverage comp excluding holiday limited time offerings was 1%. And together, our holiday LTO and lobby items had a negative impact of over 1 point of comp. We are aggressively rationalizing our merchandise approach in conjunction with the transformation of our lobby strategy going forward.","Second, the challenge we have discussed with you over the past several quarters involving softness in visits by occasional non-Starbucks Rewards customers, a challenge likely exacerbated by the traditional changes in customer routines and traffic patterns during holiday continued with our afternoon and evening dayparts, typically catering to less frequent customers and second visits for more frequent customers, coming under increased pressure as the quarter progressed.","Another proof-point of changes in holiday routines was negative mall-store comp performance, several points below non-mall locations as we move through the quarter. As a reminder, mall stores comprise only 6% of our U.S. company-operated locations.","We have a clear understanding of the issue and are accountable to fix it just as we did with throughput at peak. The strength of our core customers, the performance of our business through the morning and lunch daypart, and upcoming food beverage and digital innovation gives us confidence that we will be successful in doing so.","Let me now share our plans for bringing the business to targeted levels of revenue growth, operating performance and profitability through the lens of the six operational priorities we set out for you last year. These priorities remain the drivers of our growth, and they will enable a turning of our U.S. business. Our commitment to these priorities is unwavering.","Let me start with our efforts to accelerate U.S. comps across all dayparts. We continue to reap the benefits of the success of our efforts to increase throughput at peak. Specifically, our highest peak volume stores continue to out-comp the average for our U.S. portfolio overhaul; with efforts around staffing, technology and lean principles all yielding measureable results.","We've now seen three successive quarters of sustained positive comp growth at peak. And believe that plan enhancements will continue this trend and are encouraged by our ability to have so quickly rallied our store partners, equip them with the tools technology and resources, to successfully improve operations.","We will apply the same disciplined approach to improve performance in the afternoon daypart, and have identified a number of key operational actions that are underway. We are focused on elevating the Starbucks experience in the afternoon daypart, as store-partners sharpen operational focus, and tune staffing and scheduling, simplification processes, and leverage improved routines and lean techniques.","We're also driving continued innovation in food and beverage. Our Mercato fresh food menu is continuing to perform well in Seattle and Chicago, the two markets we launched last year. And we are planning to deploy Mercato in at least six new markets in fiscal 2018.","We recently launched Blonde espresso roast. This is the first time we've offered a second espresso roast in our stores. We believe this roast is appealing to a broad audience, seeking a lighter, sweeter espresso experience.","We have a big opportunity to leverage our core beverage platforms, particularly in ice coffee, tea, Cold Brew and Draft beverages, all of which skewed toward the afternoon. In response to strong customer demand, we are accelerating the rollout of Nitro Cold Brew from 1,300 stores currently to 2,300 stores in the U.S. by the end of the year.","We have seen approximately 1 point of additional comp growth in stores offering Nitro Cold Brew during 2017. Nitro also provides the foundation for a broader platform of Draft beverages that expand beyond coffee to include alternative milks and tea-based Nitro-infused beverages.","Our plant based beverage platform continues to expand, leveraging almond, coconut and soymilk alternatives. Our refreshment platform including tea and Starbucks refreshers contributed comp growth again this quarter. These beverage platforms also aligned with our focus on the afternoon occasion.","In addition to food and beverage innovation, we continue to accelerate the power and momentum of our digital flywheel. An initiative that has taken on added significance as we look to materially expand our universe of digitally connected Starbucks customers beyond only Rewards members.","Let me touch on five developments that underscore the progress we made against this priority in Q1. We added over 1.4 million active Starbucks Rewards members in the U.S., up 11% year-over-year, and now have 14.2 million active members. Mobile payment in the U.S. has grown to over 30% of total tender. The ubiquity of mobile and credit card payment is enabling us to begin an exploration of cashless stores in the U.S.","We expect payment methods will continue to evolve with acceptance increasingly becoming the global currency of the future. Building on partnerships with companies like Chase, Tencent, Alibaba and others, enables us to explore new ideas that leverage our digital assets, global retail footprint and global customer base with the digital payment platforms of today, while also monitoring the landscape of potential payment platforms of the future. Through our Rewards program, we continue to drive increases in per member spend by leveraging personalized offerings and suggested selling to our customers.","By expanding capacity at peak, we have now the ability to offer Mobile Order and Pay to our non-Rewards customers and will begin accelerating the ramp up of Mobile Order and Pay to all customers beginning in March. We are accelerating our marketing engagement to expand digital customer relationships this quarter. Here are some examples of actions underway.","In partnership with Chase and Visa, we are launching a co-branded credit card in February. These customers will earn Stars at an accelerated rate at Starbucks as well as earn Stars everywhere else they shop.","In April also with Chase and Visa, we are launching a co-branded stored value card targeted to customers who don't want or can't qualify for credit cards. This card will also let customers earn Stars wherever Visa is accepted. In March, we are launching a significant marketing initiative to sign up customers for special offers outside of Starbucks Rewards, with only 14 million of the 75 million or so unique customers, who visit us each month signed up for Rewards, we have a tremendous opportunity to leverage our new digital technologies to initiate and advance additional direct digital relationships.","By the end of the fiscal year, we expect to establish millions of incremental digital customer relationships outside of Starbucks Rewards, giving us an entirely new direct marketing capability to a vast customer audience. We will update you on progress of our digital expansion initiatives as we move through the year.","To date our U.S. business is a key driver of Starbucks overall financial performance, and while we face challenges in Q1 with holiday merchandise and LTOs, we are making progress against clear and consistent priorities with total customer transactions across new and existing stores up 5% year-on-year. Last year, we successfully dealt with our morning daypart and peak throughput issues, and we are applying the same rigor to addressing the occasional customer and the afternoon daypart issues.","We look forward to updating you on our progress, as we tune our U.S. retail growth engine to continue delivering industry leading growth, profitability and return on investment long into the future. Enabling long term growth in China is a key priority, as it now represents our second largest and consistently our fastest growing market.","Starbucks has been operating outside of North America since the opening of our first store in Japan in 1996. Today, we operate half of our stores nearly 14,000, in 75 markets outside the U.S. The growing relevance and success of our international business and specifically our business in China has emerged as a growth driver that is rapidly moving us beyond our longstanding dependence on our U.S. business for needle moving growth.","Today, we have two powerful independent but complementary engines driving Starbucks global growth, with a long term opportunity clearly visible in China. Starbucks has cracked the code in China, and no Western consumer brand is better positioned than Starbucks in China. You have to experience our business in China for yourself to fully appreciate it, but we are much more than simply a coffee retail. As our world leading financial and operating performance attest.","Let me share a few metrics that underscore the size of Starbucks China opportunity. In 2014, China's GDP totaled $11 trillion, and many economists expected to exceed $15 trillion by 2021. Rapid GDP growth is fueling a massive increase in China's middle class expected to reach 600 million consumers by 2021, up 100% from three years ago and almost twice the size of the total U.S. population.","From an investment thesis, we have best-in-class unit economics, decades of whitespace to grow in both physical and digital retail, the most trusted brick and mortar brand in the market, and a world class management team. And we are in the nascent stages of building a business that will continue to deliver an increased portion of our revenue and operating income growth. The deep respect we have for our customers and partners in China, and that our customers and partners in China have for the Starbucks brand and each other have resulted in rapid sustained customer and market growth.","And the strong underlying revenue and profit trends of the past will drive the many decades of growth on the horizon. Leveraging our digital flywheel continues to represent a huge opportunity and unlocked for us in China. Since launching WeChat pay one year ago and adding Alipay in September, digital payments have increased over 60% of total tender. 90 day active Starbucks Rewards members now total over 6 million.","And our e-commerce and social gifting in China represented nearly $20 million in Q1, up threefold from a year ago. These are the reasons we feel comfortable doubling down on China through the East China acquisition, the transaction we closed in December.","East China is now being integrated into our company operated business enabling us the benefit and further leverage, Belinda Wong's world class China management team as well as the scale economics that come with it. As we complete the integration of East China, we will look to further accelerate our new store growth in China. I have no doubt that one day Starbucks will have more stores in China than we have in the U.S., and it's the reason we selected Shanghai for Starbucks' first international Roastery highlighting our fifth operating priority, elevating the Starbucks experience through Roasteries and Reserve.","Starbuck's Shanghai Roastery opened only last month providing further evidence of our future opportunity in China and is among the crowning achievements in the company's history. Customers in some cases are lined up for hours to enter the Roastery and be taken on an immersive multi-sensory coffee, food and tea journey. On its very first day of operation the Shanghai Roastery became the highest grossing Starbucks store in the world, averaging more than double the number of transactions of our highly successful Seattle Roastery, and with an average ticket of $29.","The unparalleled retail experience delivered by the Shanghai Roastery will enable us to serve well over a million customers every year. At the same time amplifies and elevates the Starbucks brand across China and CAP overall. Noteworthy is that our Starbucks Roastery in Seattle continues to delight customers and drive double-digit comps. In November, we opened the Princi bakery and cafe in the Seattle Roastery, and are already seeing significant lift to total food sales.","The Princi bakery and cafe in the Shanghai Roastery is also driving significant customer engagement and revenue. The artisan nature and high quality of Princi baked goods are resonating loudly with our customers. And we see a major opportunity to increase sales of Princi food beyond Roasteries. We are now venturing into building standalone Princi bakeries complete with Starbucks Reserve coffee and coffee bars. These stores will feature Reserve coffees, Princi food and design with the elements of the Roastery design and product experience for customers and markets across the globe.","Starbucks Roasteries, Starbucks Reserve brand and Princi, operations that we refer to collectively as Siren Retail remains central to our innovation capabilities and our strategy of maintaining our leadership position as the leading premium coffee retailer. We currently have four Roasteries under construction and the potential opportunity for Princi bakeries with Reserve coffee over the next decade. The opportunity is significant, as we are off to an excellent beginning to what we believe is an emerging food revenue and profit stream over time.","As we pursue our Starbucks Reserve strategy, we benefit from the decades of experience that Howard brings to this business. As Tom mentioned, Howard is joining the call today from Milan, where he's working on our next international Roastery, and he's available to share his thoughts during Q&A.","Our channels business is focused on our sixth operational priority of gaining share of at-home coffee, Scott will cover this in more detail. But in Q1, we grew share in the premium single-serve and packaged coffee categories to a record level, despite an increasingly competitive environment. We have built a powerful CPG business in the U.S. and are committed to leveraging that business to create additional shareholder value going forward, while we invest in the priorities I've outlined, we also continue to make progress against our efforts to streamline the company.","Besides completing the East China acquisition, in Q1, we also closed on the sale of Tazo to Unilever, transition Taiwan to a license market, and continue to close Teavana retail stores in Canada and the U.S. We plan to have all U.S. and Canada Teavana stores closed by the end of this month. Going forward you may expect this to take additional actions to further streamline the company and unlock value.","A few final points, while we recognize that our revenue, comp and EPS performance in Q1 fell short of both our current quarter and long term guidance, I want to make clear that our commitment to our long term growth targets and strategy, including our commitment to returning $15 billion to shareholders over the next three years in the form of dividends and buybacks is unwavering.","We have sight line on the areas that need to be addressed in our U.S. business, and Roz Brewer and her team are aggressively pursuing the improvement plans I shared with you today. And I assure you that we are just embarking on what will ultimately prove to be the most powerful and compelling growth opportunity in Starbucks history, China.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott. Scott?","Scott Maw","Thank you, Kevin, and good afternoon, everyone. Starbucks Q1 of fiscal 2018 reflected solid revenue growth of 6% or 7% after adjusting for a point of impact for the licensing of our business in Singapore, the sale of our Tazo tea business, the exit of our e-commerce business and the continued wind down of our Teavana stores, all streamline driven activities.","I will talk more about the makeup of these activities later. Q1 2018 represented the first $6 billion revenue quarter in our history. We earned $0.65 of non-GAAP EPS in Q1, including $0.07 of benefit from the U.S. tax law change and $0.02 of favorability below the operating income line from a true-up of our liability for unredeemed gift cards, principally from first time breakage recognition for market outside the U.S. and Canada.","Non-GAAP operating margin of 19.2% represented a decline of 80 basis points year-over-year, primarily driven by sales to leverage and food mix shift in the Americas. Despite delivering record results in Q1, we've recognized that we did not meet all of our expectations for the quarter, but as Kevin shared we are laser focused on executing against plans to drive improvement across the U.S. business, as we move into Q2 and through the back half of the year.","I'll now take you through our Q1 operating performance by segment. Our Americas segment grew revenue 7% in Q1, primarily driven by 979 net new store openings over the past 12 months and a 2% comp growth, principally ticket. Americas operating margin declined 100 basis points to 23% in the quarter, primarily due to lower than expected revenues and food related mix shift resulting from increased customer adoption and the increasing success of our food program.","Kevin covered the key operating metrics and actions for the Americas segment, so let's move on to China\/Asia Pacific. CAP segment revenues grew 9% in Q1 to a new quarterly record $844 million, once again delivering company leading top line growth. Comp growth of 6% in China was driven by strong performance of core food and beverage categories, including improved breakfast and bakery offerings and growth in espresso. We entered seven new cities and opened a Q1 record 188 stores in China, and now own and operate over 3,100 stores in 138 cities.","Our newest class of stores in China continues to outperform even the immediately prior class and deliver record revenues and profits, and our best returns anywhere in the world. CAP's non-GAAP operating margin increased by 210 basis points, driven primarily by strong performance in China and South Korea; CAP's non-GAAP operating income increased nearly 20% to $212 million, once again representing the majority of Starbucks operating income growth in the quarter.","Regarding Japan, while overall profitability, new store performance and total revenue remained in line with our expectations upon acquiring a 100% of the market. Our comp store performance continues to be impacted by softness in limited time offerings, Frappuccino LTOs, in particular. We remain committed to turning Japan back to positive comp growth, as we work through the mix shift issues. The new Japan Starbucks Rewards program launched only last quarter continues to resonate with our customers, we've already added over 600,000 new Rewards members up 45% in a few short months.","Turning to EMEA. EMEA delivered revenue growth of 8% to $284 million or up 3% after adjusting for five points of foreign exchange. Company operated store comp declined 1% driven by stock comps in the UK. Noteworthy is that today less than 20% of our EMEA total store portfolio is company owned, that's a better measure of the performance of the EMEA segment is system wide comps, which grew 3% in Q1, despite the difficult consumer, economic and geopolitical backdrop.","Operating margin of 13.8% declined 300 basis points over last year. Margin expansion in our licensed business was strong and in line with expectations driven by successful new store openings and strong system comps, but this was more than offset by under performance in our company owned markets. We remain committed to both growing Starbucks profitable and successful license business, and lowering our EMEA overhead structure.","On to channel development. Channel development revenues reached $560 million in Q1, up 1% year-over-year, but up 4% after adjusting for 3 points of impact from the Tazo sale this quarter, and a change in accounting treatment for certain receivables compared to 2017. On top of 8% growth and 16% growth in the first quarters' of fiscal 2017 and 2016 respectively, while we achieved record market share in both premium roast and ground and K-Cups, and our core U.S. CPG business in Q1, revenue has been impacted by increased competition down the aisle.","Our bottled coffee business with Pepsi delivered strong overall results again in Q1, also we now have sold over 1.9 million bottles of Teavana bottled tea through the partnership we have with Anheuser-Busch launched last year. And we still expect to launch Teavana packaged tea down the aisle before the end of 2018.","And in China, we have sold 30 million bottles of Frappuccino beverages, since launching our relationship with Tingyi five quarters ago. We now offer an expanding lineup of bottled coffee beverages for Chinese consumers to enjoy at home, at work or on the go. Each of these partnerships is a successful example of the power of combining the Starbucks brand with the product marketing and distribution capability of leading food and beverage companies.","Channel Development's operating margin remained strong at 43.4%, down slightly from last year given lower sales flow through. Before moving on to full year fiscal 2018 targets, I'd like to identify three events that will have a significant positive impact on our financial returns moving forward. Our ongoing efforts to streamline our operations, the projected impact of our recently completed East China acquisition, and the impact of the new U.S. tax law.","You can see specific financial impacts for each of these items in the schedules we have provided on our website, but I acknowledge the size and absolute number of these adjustments adds complexity to your analysis and modeling of our performance. Recognizing this our goal is to provide you with the insight and transparency you need to fully appreciate the meaningful lift and profitability we expect to see from each of the three areas over time.","During the quarter, we accelerated and advanced to our efforts to streamline our business that we began discussing with you last year. As a reminder streamline is a company-wide lens through which we are examining each of our businesses in order to focus our investments on those businesses that will meaningfully contribute to revenue and profit growth, while licensing or exciting those that won't.","During Q1, we've recognized large gains on the sale of Tazo, the acquisition of East China and the sale of Taiwan, while recording certain charges for exciting all Teavana stores among other actions. One specific example relates to product simplification, we are removing over 200 SKUs from our U.S. retail stores, primarily merchandise in the front lobbies of our stores, representing over 30% of total lobbied items. This simplification effort increases our focus and reduces operational complexity in our stores.","And we anticipate eliminating these SKUs will lower comps by 1.5 point over the course of 2018 that have a nominal impact on profit given the lower margin and higher write-offs associated with these products. Obviously, merchandise perform this holiday underscores the importance of this effort, but it is important to note that comps in our lobbies have been quite flat to slightly negative for several years, also our full your guidance set out for 2018 included the estimated impact of the streamlining activities including the U.S. comp impact of SKU rationalization.","Finally, we are well underway to returning the $15 billion of capital to shareholders, Kevin referenced earlier, with $2 billion returned via dividends and share repurchases this quarter, a new record for Starbucks.","On December 31, 2017, Starbucks paid $1.4 billion, and assume full ownership of over 1,400 stores previously operated by or formally 50% owned East China JV, doubling down on China, our highest returning and fastest growing market.","The East China business will fully be consolidated and reflected in our financial statements beginning with Q2. We expect the transaction to be neutral to slightly accretive to earnings in 2018, with a more positive impact in 2019, excluding the following estimated items: a gain on acquisition, amortization expense of acquired intangible assets, and transaction and integration expenses. These items will be removed for non-GAAP reporting and adjusted as we move through 2018.","The financial impact of consolidating East China includes a 4 percentage point lift to consolidated revenue and a slightly negative impact to consolidate operating margin. As you may recall from the acquisition of our business in Japan, the margin change is driven solely by the change in ownership, whereby we now have 100% of the revenue expense and profit, as opposed to a small portion of the revenue and roughly half the profit under the former ownership model.","The change is expected to drive CAP segment margin moderately lower in 2018, with strong growth returning once we fully lap the acquisition in 2019. We plan to discuss these impacts in greater detail during our China modeling call on January 31. Again, the impact of East China was included when we introduced our fiscal year 2018 guidance last quarter.","Let's move on to the change in U.S. tax law. Like most U.S. companies with international operations, we are still evaluating the impact of the U.S. tax law change on our income statement, balance sheet and capital distributions to shareholders. Future interpretation of significant aspects of the law by constituencies in Washington D.C. and related accounting guidance could have some impact on our ultimate effective tax rate for 2018, 2019 and beyond.","With that said, let me share with you our current estimates. We expect our 2018 GAAP tax rate will be 23%, with significant impacts from the gain on the East China acquisition and transition related items from the U.S. tax law change. The East China gain will impact our 2018 effective rate by 5 points.","Partially offsetting this is approximately 2 points or an estimated tax charge related to deemed repatriation of international earnings partially offset by an estimated tax benefit from revaluing our net deferred tax liability position at lower statutory rates. Excluding the net 3 points of favorability from these drivers, our non-GAAP effective tax rate is estimated to be 26% for 2018 and beyond or roughly 7 points below previous guidance.","This delta provides roughly $350 million of additional net earnings before reinvestment for 2018. The majority of the savings will go to the bottom line with more than 50%, but less than 60% accruing to earnings. The vast majority of the 40% plus remaining will be invested in our US partners via wages and benefits above our plans, with the balance funding accelerated digital investment.","Specifically, we anticipate increasing partner in digital investments by $180 million to $220 million on a run rate basis in 2018, with a little less than half of this impacting 2018 profits, given the timing of investments during this fiscal year. Also, we announced this week a onetime stock grant to our U.S. partners that we estimate will total $120 million and will impact 2018 and 2019 ratably.","The vast majority of this grant will go to our U.S. field partners and we will exclude the stock-grant related charge from our non-GAAP results. We expect a modest amount of incremental cash flows from the tax law change, net reinvestment. I want to reiterate that these allocations and estimates will likely change over the course of 2018, but they are reasonable approximations for now.","Let's move on to 2018 targets. We are updating the financial and operating targets we have previously provided for fiscal 2018 for the expected impacts of the U.S. tax law change and business performance in Q1. We still expect consolidated revenue growth in the high-single-digits, excluding approximately 4 points of favorability from the East China acquisition and a roughly 2 point reduction from other streamline activities.","We also still expect comps to grow 3% to 5% for the year, consistent with our long-term guidance. Given the challenges in Q1 and expectations for a somewhat softer Q2, we expect to be near the low-end of comp guidance range for the year.","Given the margin contraction in the first quarter and likely pressure on Q2, we now anticipate a slight operating margin decrease for both total company and the Americas for the full year before the additional partner and digital investments.","Including these investments, we expect total company in Americas operating margins to decline moderately versus 2017. The operational priorities focused on the U.S. business that Kevin discussed and the middle of the P&L savings targeted for the balance of the year are expected to contribute to improvement in the second half of the year. Roz and the team are laser-focused on ensuring we can deliver targeted savings for the year in cost of goods sold, waste, labor and beyond.","These savings started in Q1, but ramped as we move through the year. And we have specific action plans to ensure we obtain the savings we need by area. Excluding the ownership change impact from our purchase of East China, we still expect CAP operating margin to be moderately higher in fiscal 2018 relative to the prior year.","Given first quarter performance, we now expect moderate expansion of EMEA operating margin in 2018. And channel development is still expected to deliver slightly improved operating margin for 2018.","Given all these inputs, we expect fiscal 2018 GAAP EPS in the range of $3.32 to $3.36, and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $2.48 to $2.53. This is consistent with non-GAAP EPS of $2.30 to $2.33 provided on last quarter's earnings call with the impact of a lower federal statutory rate from the U.S. tax law change, net of reinvestment as the only difference.","Although our guidance is unchanged from last quarter, to summarize and be clear, adjusted for the impact of tax law changes, we remain within our full year 2018 guidance range, given last quarter related to the key items of EPS, comps and revenue growth, but below that guidance on global margin.","To achieve these targets we will remain disciplined with our investments and laser-focused on delivering an elevated experience to our customers while at the same time improving our comp revenue and profit in the back half of 2018. This discipline will be key to delivering our top and bottom line goals.","As Kevin stated, we have a clear set of actions underway to improve comp growth and profitability as we move through the year. As always credit for our success in Q1 belongs to Starbucks partners around the world, who proudly wear the green apron and work to deliver an elevated Starbucks experience to our customers through nearly 100 million individual occasions every week, but who do so with heart and passion one cup at a time.","With that, I'll turn the call back to the operator for Q&A. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Sara Senatore with Bernstein. Your line is open.","Sara Harkavy Senatore","Thank you. I was hoping to sort of just talk a little bit about the first quarter and implied rest of the year, which is to say you suggested that holiday and merchandising was an issue. But then also noted that 2Q will be softer, which means that maybe it wasn't just holiday. If January was also off to a soft start.","So I guess, first, are you confident that you have the right diagnosis. Is there any chance that you are either losing share or cannibalizing yourself? And then second, to what extent that can you preserve some of the earnings of the margin, if in fact, the low end of your guidance doesn't materialize through better expectations in the back-half, which is sort of what happened in 2017?","Scott Maw","Yeah, thanks, Sara. It's Scott. I'll start. I think what's important to understand and what we're saying about Q2 is given some of the things that happened specifically during holiday, we're seeing some impacts of that early in the second quarter. And specifically what we're seeing is we sell a lot of gift cards in the lobbies of our stores and through third parties. And those gift cards once again this year, went to about one in six Americans.","And the gift card lows were about flat year-over-year. But as you know over the last many years, those gift cards have actually contributed meaningfully to comps. Both as we closed out the first quarter, and then, importantly in January and February, and a little bit beyond as we went through the second quarter because those gift cards were roughly flat, still sold a lot of them.","We're just a little bit cautious on how the quarter is starting, so that's the first thing. The second thing is in the lobby category, what we see coming through into January is a little bit additional softness above what we'd expected. So Kevin talked about holiday LTOs and lobby down over a point. Lobby remains soft in January. So those two things are just a little bit of headwind.","And so, I think what we signaled for the year is we still have a high level of competence in being within our 3% to 5% range. We're just a little bit cautious for Q2. And really EPS and revenue growth and comp growth, still holds with what we guided last quarter.","Kevin Johnson","And, Sara, this is Kevin, let me take your second question about share or cannibalization. I mean the short answer is no. And let me share the data with you that leads us to that conclusion. Certainly, we look at many external data sources to inform us of macro trends in away-from-home coffee and certainly away-from-home food and beverage.","Those trends would suggest that overall daily customer occasions in food and beverage are relatively flat. Now, when we triangulate those data points with the fact that we grew total customer occasions across existing stores and new stores by 5% this quarter, that would imply that we are growing transactions faster than the market and taking some share.","Now, the better view that we have is when we look at the micro trading areas. Now, this is where we have our own analytics, where we look at a micro trading area that provides us data on traffic patterns. And whenever we build a new store in that trading area, we have predicted analytics to tell us what we think will happen and then we have post analytics to tell us what actually happened. The data suggest that when we build a new store in a trading area, we see increased customer occasions for Starbucks.","When a competitor builds a new store in the micro trading area, our data shows little to no impact on Starbucks' traffic in that micro trading area. Now, certainly a similar dynamic exists when a competitor runs a product or pricing promotion or schedule at a trading area. And we look at these micro trading areas very carefully. And so, that's a data driven analysis. So when you triangulate these data points, it's evidence that we're not losing share to competition. And it's evidence that we're not cannibalizing as we build new stores. And so, that's how we think about it.","Sara Harkavy Senatore","Okay, thanks. And then, just a question on can you preserve the P&L as the comp comes in and stays at 2?","Scott Maw","Yeah, I think what we said and we talked about this a little bit last quarter, Sara, is that, in order to hit the comp guidance and the revenue guidance and profit guidance, 3% to 5% high-single-digits and 12%-plus. We need that 3% in order to get to 12%-plus. With that said, given just a little bit of softness in the first-half of the year, we still think we're going to be to deliver a 3% per year and therefore deliver the full EPS and margin guidance.","I think the thing I was trying to say in my prepared comments is, the first half of the year is probably going to be a little bit softer, with the second half of the year accelerating. Yeah, when the things we are doing on streamline, the things we're doing in the middle of the P&L, and a little bit of benefit from buyback. So I think we'll get back to 3% and preserve the margin.","Kevin Johnson","Yeah, I agree with that. The only thing I would add is just to be careful not to over-rotate just looking at the U.S., China is becoming a bigger and bigger part of the growth agenda and contributing a larger and larger percentage of our operating income growth. The 30% growth that we saw in China this last quarter, we just closed on East China, the Shanghai Roastery. And so, I think you need to look at both of these growth engines when you consider the overall enterprise P&L.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Tarantino with Baird. Your line is open.","David Tarantino","Hi. Good afternoon. Just one clarification on the commentary on fiscal second quarter. Are you signaling you expect it to be weaker than what you just reported for Q1 or more the same? And then, I guess, my real question is about - as you diagnose the U.S. business and look at the consumer feedback metrics that you get, are you seeing anything in the consumer feedback that would suggest any issues related to brand or operational performance or anything of that nature? Thanks.","Scott Maw","Yeah, I'll start, David. And then, we will have Roz take the second half. So if you do math on at least the 3% for the full year, and we just did 2%, I think it gave you a pretty good idea of what we think by somewhat softer. We're not signaling that January had been off to a big negative breath. That is not what we're signaling. All we're signaling is a little bit softer estimate for Q2, so you can kind of do the math and figure out.","We didn't put a number on it. But I think it's pretty clear about where we think we'll land. Roz, you want to cover the customer piece?","Rosalind Brewer","Yeah, so concerning the customer piece, I will say that we've been really looking carefully at this afternoon daypart and the customer that visits our stores during that timeframe. And we're learning a lot about them. But I can tell you that, they're confident about our brand. They still are committed to Starbucks.","We are making sure that we are ready for the customer, the afternoon dayparts by looking at our routine efforts in the stores and to make sure that we've got the right partners in front of them. So we feel good about the customer and their connection to us. And we'll continue to make sure that they stay aligned with who we are as a company.","Howard Schultz","And, Kevin, can just add one thing about the equity of the brand? Could you hear me? This is Howard.","Kevin Johnson","Yes, yeah. Please, Howard, yeah, go ahead.","Howard Schultz","Just in terms of the equity of the brand, just in recent weeks two things came out that I think demonstrate and reaffirm the strength, the trust and the confidence in terms of Starbucks as a brand and a trusted company. Fortune survey came out and Starbucks was the fifth - fourth, I'm sorry, fourth most admired company in the world. And then we have a constant effort year in and year out to make sure that we are as relevant as possible with young people.","And what came out is that Starbucks relevancy among teams is number one in any food and beverage retail brand in America. So I think, in terms of the equity of the brand, there's no issue whatsoever. This is a daypart challenge in the afternoon. And just like we figured out and cracked the code in the morning daypart, we will do the same thing in the afternoon.","Operator","Your next question comes from Sharon Zackfia from William Blair. Your line is open.","Sharon Zackfia","Hi, good afternoon. I guess a question on the digital side. I think, last quarter you provided us with what the comps were for the Starbucks Rewards spend versus the more occasional customers. I was wondering if you might provide that again. And as it relates to kind of broaden in the digital ecosystem, I mean when can we kind of expect more information from you? And are there thoughts about enabling some sort of a Starbucks Rewards program, where you don't have to have a preloaded card?","Matthew Ryan","Thank you for the question. Matt Ryan here Sharon. First of all, as is obvious in the numbers, virtually all our comp this past quarter came from our digital customers. And we saw a significant growth in the number of members, up 11% or so year on year, as well as healthy growth in member spend. So we're very, very pleased with what we saw. We've leaned into customer acquisition results.","During this coming quarter, you're going to see some significant new initiatives added on, which have both short term and long-term potential benefits. We are going to be targeting, not just the Starbucks Rewards customers, but all customers with ways for them to sign up and engaged with us directly. That will create a new pool of customers that we can use our marketing capabilities to reach and talk to, and build a business from.","You'll see that emerge across the course of the quarter, especially in March. And you'll see us begin to then have a greater pool of people with whom - from whom we can recruit future Starbucks Rewards members as well too. There are a number of different things teed up, not just for this quarter, but across the next year, that includes some of what you've been alluding to. And you can expect us to continue to make digital the focus of all of our marketing efforts moving forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Glass with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","John Glass","Thanks very much. Two if I could. First, just I'm still struggling with why the non-Rewards customer, the occasional customer is not coming as often. If you see, the brand is still strong and relevant, particularly young people, but they're not coming back. Is it as simple as the Frappuccino platform for example is getting tired?","And if it is, what - how soon can you substitute products that really drive that afternoon business? Can you talk a little bit more about specific customer insight? I didn't think I heard that that in answer to a prior question.","And on the guidance, I just want to make sure I understand you. You've kept your guidance the same. But I think you said margins are going to be below and comps are going to be at the lower end. So in this excluding taxes, what's the plug that still get you there if comps are at the low-end and margins are below?","Kevin Johnson","Yeah, John. This is Kevin, I'll take your question and I'll let Scott take the second one. When you think about our patterns, it's first of important to note that our core customer and especially in that morning daypart is very strong. And that's just reflective of the increased throughput at peak that we've driven. And I would say that the digital growth that we've seen, so core customers, morning daypart, daily ritual, throughput at peak strong. And that's beverage, food attach, strong.","Number two, what we're calling the occasional customer, in some ways you could say are those non-Rewards customers or non-core, now the fact that we've grown active rewards by 11%, means we're attracting more and of the occasional customer into Rewards. So part of the reason you see that comp, you say, well, our occasional customers aren't growing. That's because a lot of them are joining rewards. And the more, we get them in that digital ecosystem, the best. Because now we can communicate directly with them, we can personalize offers that are contextually relevant to them. We can do so much more to create a great experience for those customers when we have digital combined with our brick and mortar experience.","So the number three, say, okay, those customers who haven't joined Rewards, what's happening with occasional customers, now a lot we have a higher volume of occasional customers in the afternoon. And in many ways, you think about the morning daypart and a lot of that is really driving the need state of convenience as customers are getting their beverages and food on their way to work or school or some activity, what we find the afternoon is a customer occasion that's more the third place.","And so in many ways, the opportunities we have to continue to enhance the experience in the third place drive innovation around food and beverage that resonates in the afternoon, and as Matt that the number one thing we can do is now connect with those occasional customers in a digital way. And so that's what we see happening and that is why the plans that we have are geared exactly to that. Roz, you want to touch upon sort of the plans that we have driving those three pillars.","Rosalind Brewer","Sure. So first of all, let me talk about in the first quarter, we added 1.4 million new active members and that really gives us an opportunity to do just what Matt mentioned is to bring them to the same level at our Starbucks Rewards customers that have been enjoying our business in the morning daypart. But second, we have very strong beverage innovation plan for the remaining part of the year. And I know, we've been talking to you about our beverage innovation for some time now, but we've been able to for the first time in a long time introduced a second espresso roast for the first time, our blonde introduction that just started in the month of January, we're excited about that.","But second, we have a number of cold offering that we're introducing and some of them are accelerating into the second half of the year and I just remind you cold beverages are nearly 40% of total beverage sales and 50% of the overall growth that we're seeing right now is from our cold lineup. And that's up 230 basis points for our company. So the accelerating I think like our Nitro rollout, our Teavana teas, and our premiumized beverages. This is going to help us in the second half of the year, and these are items that have not existed in our product lineup.","And when you align that with our food success, it really creates a package for us. And remember, our food represents right now 21% of our total revenues so we've got great moves in our beverage lineup, and the food attach that we've been seeing quarter-over-quarter will continue in the second half of the year.","Scott Maw","And then, John, your question on margin, I'll just quantify a little bit for you. We had slight margin expansion in our last guidance and now we're seeing a little bit of margin contractions we're not talking about it big dollars, but you're asking a fair question. There's two things. First of all, we did get a little bit more favorability than we had forecast below the line this quarter for some of the gift cart, unredeemed gift card true-ups that I talked about.","And then that all of the net of the streamline activities are coming in a little bit more favorable than we originally thought, again both of those are relatively small amounts, but don't have a big impact, obviously on operating margin but allow us to hold our EPS guidance.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Palmer with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","David Palmer","Thanks. I heard in some previous answers you highlight the digital initiatives and you mention cold beverage innovation, just then. Are those the major factors that give you confidence in a back half acceleration that, it sounds like, it could be significant in your thinking or at least your banking on that perhaps you can give some sort of a ranking of what is giving you confidence in the back half acceleration? Thanks.","Scott Maw","Yeah, maybe - David maybe I'll start financially and I'll ask Matt, Roz to weigh in operationally, because obviously what we're mainly focused on talking about the U.S. business. But if you talk about the global business back half acceleration from a margin standpoint. It's the things that we're doing in the middle of the P&L around cost of goods sold around waste and around labor, we talked about those, that's the first thing.","The second thing is acceleration of profitability as we bring East China into the fully wind down Teavana. We're a little bit more optimistic on how that's going to add to overall profitability. And then just to be specific, we expect the first half of the year in Americas comps to be a little bit below the average for the year, and the second half to be a little bit above. So I'm not [Technical Difficulty] in U.S. comps in our forecasting.","We see that as a potential opportunity depending on how things land, but that's not what we're saying in that comp guidance we're giving, just to be clear. But maybe I'll turn it over to Matt to talk a little bit about the digital opportunities, first, and then Roz can cover up beyond that.","Matthew Ryan","Absolutely. So one of the things we see is, we see continued growth in the core Starbucks Rewards program, we've seen healthy growth in recent quarters and we have every indication of the investments we're making in technology that are sort of behind the scenes and less visible to you will continue to drive both acquisition as well as per member spend, so we're very confident in that.","I think the more important it is, we're adding on a couple more major initiatives, so this quarter we will be launching with Chase and Visa, our first ever co-branded credit card and that will enhance the value of the program to many of our customers. The thing that I would like to highlight as well, is that we are also doing more to reach our non-Starbucks Rewards customer digitally and established digital relationships This includes making Mobile Order and Pay available at scale to all customers starting in March as well as deliberate initiatives, which you will see as the quarter unfolds, in which we actively sign up new customers with the special benefits and offers that will be meaningful and make a difference in our ability to market and personalized beyond just the core Starbucks Rewards members.","Rosalind Brewer","This is Roz. Let me just mention some of the things that we're doing from an operational improvement standpoint in the afternoon daypart, if you are recall about a year ago we introduced some labor deployment improvement at peak, and it's been successful for us. And for the first time, we're going to expand those through the full daypart and this includes some of the lessons that we've learned at peak from the routines and the labor deployment improvements that are really goes a little bit further than that.","We're specifically looking at tasks that are performed in the afternoon, and we're looking at the experience level of our partners in the afternoon. Typically, we've used our afternoons to train our new partners, and to do routine tasks. And we often have a lot of our newer partners on staff doing their training.","So over the coming weeks, we'll reevaluate how our staff will use these hours and use the stores and the partners against more customer facing initiatives, this will allow us to do really effective product introduction and then connect with the customer effectively. So we've learned a lot in that morning daypart and we're going to think it throughout the full day.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","John Ivankoe","Hi, two questions if I may. First for Roz, and the second for John, if I may. Roz, as you bring a broad perspective and focus now on the Americas business. Do you think some sort of a value strategy that fits within the overall lens as Starbucks becomes more important, as we can about 2018 and 2019 and maybe bring back some of that non-core customer. And how may you be thinking about communicating a price to the consumer? And a follow-up after this, if I may as well.","Rosalind Brewer","Actually I don't see a value position here, I actually think that our brand has the ability to speak even more at an up leveling. When we talk about product innovation, we talk about making our core coffee even better, when we talk about our Frappuccino business it's about making the very best Frappuccino. So a value position is not the direction we're looking at, we feel like our brand can go to the next level.","John Ivankoe","Okay. And thank you, John. I think, if you're on the phone. As we look at China, and you're obviously doubling down with the consolidation of East China, presumably margins of CAP become higher than that of the Americas, you know you have a lot of G&A and growth cost, unit inefficiencies, pre-opening, what have you in those numbers. But as you look out the next number of years, when might - firstly, will that happen? And when might that happen as we think about really the contribution from that division over the next couple of years?","Scott Maw","Maybe, John. This is Scott. I'll start, and then I'll turn it over to John to talk about why we think, we can drive outsized profit growth in CAP broadly in China specifically. So remember that our margin on that East China business today is probably in the triple-digit somewhere, because we have half of the profitability, but just a fraction of the revenue. So when you take that highly profitable business, and you do the new math with 100% ownership and that revenue denominator getting so much bigger, we'll see a little bit of impact at the CAP level on margins negatively, while we go through the first year.","And again, that's not because profitability goes down, this John, but that because of just the straight math of owning 100%. Then I think, you're going to see CAP once again grow margins faster than any of the other businesses. And I do think over a number of years, we should see CAP catch, the Americas and perhaps overtake. And the reason - the big reason that is, and I'll turn it over to John is, because of the inherent profitability of CAP broadly. So markets like Korea, Japan doing well from a profitability standpoint, and of course, first and foremost the profitability within China. John, do you want to build on that?","John Culver","Yeah, just to build on that. As we integrate East China into the operations, we really are focused in three critical areas to - number one, get the business integrated, but more importantly make sure that we're in a position to accelerate growth, and at the same time expand the margins. So really looking at the operational efficiencies that we can gain with the acquisition and with the integration, particularly around supply chain, development and design, R&D, IT and a lot of the back-end infrastructure that currently exists in two different places, as we operated a joint venture and then we operated a company-owned business.","And then, the last piece is around gaining synergy and leverage around scale. And in particular these areas are driving growth. Digital is a big opportunity, and if you look at digital and one voice to the customer across these markets, we see tremendous opportunity and runway for growth, just to put it into perspective. We now have six million active MSR members across China. We've introduced WeChat and Alibaba pay in our stores, and that is accounting to over 60% of the tender that's coming through the stores.","Beyond digital, we've got beverage innovative and continued focus on accelerating the growth of beverage innovation through R&D that we've got on the ground, food, and then clearly, a big synergy around operations, and creating great customer experience across the entire portfolio. So to Scott's point there will be a period during the integration, where you'll see a moderate decline on margin, but we will gain that back and very confident of that.","Scott Maw","I just want to add one\u2026","Howard Schultz","Hey, John, this is Howard - I'm sorry. This is Howard. Can I just want add a little bit of context to China, and some of things you said. As Kevin said, I'm in Milan, and I'm working on the Milan Roastery with our design team, but on the heels of the record setting opening of our Shanghai Roastery, I just like to put it into context for you. I don't know how many store openings, I've been to and how many countries we've opened.","But in my long, long history of Starbucks, I have never ever seen anything remotely like what happened, when we opened a Shanghai Roastery. I mean, we shattered every sales record in the history of the company, and I'm going to give you some numbers that we have not yet released, because I think it's very important as we look at the difference between 3% and 2% comps for the quarter. I think again, here's a number that I think you'll be very interested in.","Our U.S. Starbucks stores on average do about $32,000 a week. The Roastery in Shanghai after eight weeks of operations is doing on average, twice that not each week, but each day. So the volumes that we are now hosting at the Shanghai Roastery is a number that we have never quite seen before, reaffirming the equity of the brand, reaffirming the interest our customers have in Princi, an opportunity that we feel is not only a domestic opportunity for standalone stores, but also an opportunity to leverage infrastructure and build Princi stores in China as well.","But we just opened a store that is doing twice the amount per day that an average Starbucks is doing each week. That's the growth opportunity and that's the strength of the company in China. I think, we are at a disadvantage, because most of you have not seen our operations in China. I hope, you'll come to the event in May and you'll see something that there is no other Western brand, consumer brand that is accomplished with 3,100 plus stores, a store opening every day and numbers the likes of which we have never seen in our history.","The Roastery in Milan will open in the fall, the Roastery in New York will follow, and then Tokyo and Chicago and all of this being integrated into the Princi stores that we feel so positive about it. So I just feel like it's really important to once again just put into context that we are a global enterprise, of course, the U.S. currently dwarfs the other aspects of our business.","But what Kevin said is not a myth, it is true. China is going to be larger than Starbucks at the - in the U.S., China is going to have more impact and grow faster than anything we've done in our history. And what we have seen in Shanghai with the Roastery not only gives us confidence, but demonstrates the opportunity to be even larger than we once realized just a year ago.","David Palmer","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays. Your line is open.","Jeffrey Bernstein","Great. Thank you very much. Maybe just shifting gears for a second in terms of potential positive for the U.S. business or the Americas business. Just curious to get your theoretical thoughts on tax reform, and I know you guys and others have talked a lot about the corporate tax benefit, which seems significant. But in terms of the consumer benefit from tax reform, I was just hoping you maybe can give some insight in terms of historical or any kind of expectations you have, one, because the tailwind of a lower payroll tax, which is going to drive higher paychecks for the consumer and we're also seeing lots of corporates returning tax savings to employees by pay raises or the onetime stipends.","I'm just wondering, what would you even compare that to historically, maybe people talk about the gas price savings even and how that was kind of a onetime benefit. But how do you think about, but what could be a benefit for Starbucks or for restaurants maybe relative to broader retailer in terms of the prioritization of that consumer spending?","Kevin Johnson","Yeah, Jeffrey, this is Kevin. Look, we haven't gone into some deep study of how much did this increase consumers discretionary spend, and we haven't factored any of that into the future view. I mean, logically you could draw a conclusion that increased discretionary income would increase spending on consumer items, including food and beverage, and that could be good for us. But being candid, we haven't studied that and I don't have any models or insights to share with you other than just general intuition, if consumers have more money, then that must be good for consumer spending.","Operator","Your next question comes from Matthew DiFrisco with Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open.","Matthew DiFrisco","Thank you. I just had a one point of clarity I just want to see, and then also if you - just a question. Specifically to the $180 million to $220 million, Scott, I think you said that was - about half of that is going to come into 2018. So is that a - that's a run rate, so there will be a bigger weight on 2019?","And then also the 2019 tax rate, I think you said, it was going to be 300 basis points higher or at least beyond 2018, the tax rate is going to be 300 basis points higher, is that correct?","Scott Maw","The first part is correct, Matthew. So 2018 will see a little less than half of that $180 million to 220 million run rate, and 2019 will see a little bit more. And part of that is, just because of the timing of some of the investments we'll make over the remaining course of the year.","On the tax rate, the numbers I was quoting was trying to reconcile you from our GAAP tax rate to our non-GAAP tax rate. The thing to think about is, our non-GAAP tax rate will be about 26% in both years, so about 7 points lower than what we have guided at 33% before the change in the tax law. So that's a pretty consistent number as we look into the future.","Operator","Your next question comes from Karen Holthouse with Goldman Sachs. Karen, your line is open.","Karen Holthouse","Hi, another question on the tax reinvestments. The language in the press release indicated that these were accelerating investments and you're part of the conversation for some time now has been built - talking about a multi-year cycle of investments that you're in. And when we're trying to bridge 2018 to 2019, should we sort of be layering in on top of this incremental spend, another $150 million or $200 million in partner investments? Or how did these just fit into sort of the original plan?","Kevin Johnson","Yeah, Karen, this is Kevin. Let me start and then I'll hand it out to Scott to add to this. But, clearly, when we looked at the tax reform and thought about the principles around this, the first principle we had is this doesn't change our strategy. Our strategies are strategy. We're clear on what we're doing. We're clear on the priorities we have. And so, just because the tax law changed, it does not alter our strategy. That was principle number one.","Principle number two though was looking at the implications to Starbucks of that tax change and making a thoughtful decision around allocation of resources. The resource we could allocate to our existing strategy, that we thought would help us accelerate progress against it. And then how do we make sure - and so, and that principle was the second principle.","The third was how we make sure we do this in a balanced way. Are we investing in the things that are creating shareholder value? And for the majority of this, it's going to drop to the bottom line and go straight to EPS. So when we put that together, the number one area you look at over the last several years has been an ongoing multi-year strategy is our investment in partners and digital. And the bulk of that investment has gone into partners around things like wage and benefits just knowing that certainly ads. You know.","With unemployment low and with competing for the right kinds of talents, there's going to continue to be the need for us to invest in our partners. And we know in investing in our partners that we're able to attract the right people, and we're able to have a lower attrition and longer tenure than others in the industry, which helps us better connect with customers and help us drive sales. So we know that's a good investment to make.","In addition, we know and have wider sight to the return on investment on certain digital projects. And so, that is the work we went through to determine what in the opportunity to make some additional investments in our partners, and some of the benefits in wage and to accelerate the progress on some of these digital projects that lead directly to the way that we know we can connect with customers and drive comp and drive revenue and profit.","And so, that's kind of the principles and the construct that we came up with and I'll let Scott then take it from there in terms of the implications financially.","Scott Maw","I think, Karen, I think this is definitely\u2026","Kevin Johnson","Howard, go ahead.","Howard Schultz","Scott, I was just - I know it's difficult because I'm on a remote phone. But I'd like to just add something that I think is a strategic importance to the company long term if you don't mind.","I think if you look at the history of our public life, one of the I think real benefits of what we've been able to accomplish as a company has been the entrepreneurial D.N.A. of Starbucks and constantly having the curiosity to see around corners and make big bets. And I think there's probably no better example of that than over the last five six years what we've been able to do, and what Matt and his team has been able to do around digital mobile payment.","And our leadership position in what we've been able to accomplish as a brick-and-mortar digital mobile payment business. I'd like to just pose a question to all of you. And the question is, we all can probably remember 20 years ago or so, when someone tapped us on the shoulder and asked us anything about this thing called the Internet? And we probably all can remember that moment.","Well, 20 years later or so, the world has been completely transformed. And we're all connected in ways that no one could have possibly ever imagined. And in terms of business and value creation there have been some huge winners, we all know that. From Facebook to Google to Amazon and many others, and there's been some companies that have not done as well, the Myspace of the world, Yahoo and others.","Well, I think I have another question for you. 20 or so years later, and the question is, the issue of do you understand and are you anticipating what could happen with cryptocurrencies? And the reason I mention this is not because I'm talking about Bitcoin, because I don't believe that Bitcoin is going to be a currency today or in the future. I'm talking about the new technology of blockchain and the possibility of what could happen not in the near-term, but in a few years from now with a consumer application in which is trust and legitimacy with regard to a digital currency.","Now, I'm not bringing this up because Starbucks is announcing that we are forming a digital currency or we're investing in this. I'm bringing this up, because as we think about the future of our company and the future of consumer behavior, I personally believe that there is going to be a one or a few legitimate trusted digital currencies off of the blockchain technology. And that legitimacy and trust in terms of its consumer application will have to be legitimatized by a brand and a brick and mortar environment, where the consumer has trust and confidence in the company that is providing the transaction.","And then you have to ask yourself, well, if that's the case, if you believe that that proposition is possible, how many companies or what company has the national or global footprint as well as the digital mobile payment trust and confidence integrated into its existing business. And if you take it a step further, and you believe this is coming, given the fact that there are hundreds of millions of dollars domestically and globally being invested in this technology, in which there is an arms race as to who is going to win.","There's going to be lot of winners, a lot of losers. But we are in a very unique position to take advantage of what other tech companies and the blockchain technology will provide in terms of the rails to potentially be in the mix of this and benefit financially, benefit in terms of consumer behavior and incrementality and significantly create long-term shareholder value.","And I'm bringing this up, because three or four years ago I shared with you that I thought that we were heading into a seismic change of consumer behavior as a result of the Internet and e-commerce and the Amazon effect of things. And not that I was clairvoyant, and I wish I wasn't. But clearly, that has happened.","I believe that we are heading into a new age, in which blockchain technology is going to provide a significant level of a digital currency that is going to have a consumer application. And I believe that Starbucks is in a unique position to take advantage of that. Now, I don't want anyone to hang up on this call and assume that we have this all figured out, because we don't. Or that we're making a significant investment in this, because we're not.","But we are actively demonstrating the level of entrepreneurial curiosity and DNA of our company to do the things that we've done in the past to ensure the fact that we are at the cutting edge of this technology, of this consumer application. And we think we have something to offer the companies that are chasing this, because we are in a position to create the trusted legitimate place in which this could be accepted and possibly take advantage of the mobile payment digital platform that we have created.","The one thing I would ask you not to do is ask Scott lots of questions about this, because this is not something that's in our model. But I think it's important as we - as you think about Starbucks and you focus on our company, you understand that the growth of our company and everything we've been able to do for almost 50 years is not based on monthly comps or quarterly comps. It's about the long view about the entrepreneurial DNA of the company, and constantly, constantly rejecting the status quo and doing everything we can to push for self-renewal, reinvention and really do everything we can to create the kind of relevancy with our customers, not only on what we sell and the experience we provide, but ensuring the fact that we are at the cutting edge of technology as we were in the last five years with the digital payment platform and the Rewards program. I'll leave it there.","Kevin Johnson","Thanks, Howard. Scott, you want to - the second part of Karen's question was on the investments that we were making. Yeah.","Scott Maw","Yeah, I think, Karen, the way to think about that is, as Kevin says, these were all on our roadmap. But I wouldn't think that, that this place is a partner investment in 2019. Or said more clearly, we're doubling down a little bit this year with partner investments, because it's the right thing to do. As we get into 2019, I assume we'll make additional partner investments and we'll come back to you on the size and scale of that. But this wouldn't be in replacement of that, which I think is the nature of your question.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jason West with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Jason West","Yeah, thanks. Just two quick ones. I guess, one, in the past you guys have talked about how much of the spend or what the spend growth was for your MSR members, and if you could provide that for the quarter?","And then just to clarify the timing of the rollout of offering mobile ordering to the non-MSR, is that something that is going to be nationwide coming up here in the spring or is it going to be rolled out gradually, starting at that point? Thanks.","Kevin Johnson","I'll cover the first part, Jason, and I'll turn it over to Matt. So we saw mid-single-digit kind of growth in spend per member, so another really good quarter off the back of two big quarters. So we're pretty happy with what we've seen, particularly given the members, member growth we had in absolute numbers. Matt, you want to cover the second part?","Matthew Ryan","Sure, we're actually in pilot right now in the marketplace. So we are offering mobile order and pay to many customers. You can call it guess checkout if you will to many people who do not have a stored value card. What will happen by the time we reach the end of March is we'll be able to scale that nationwide and make that available to all customers who are using our app.","Operator","The last question comes from Nicole Miller with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","Nicole Miller Regan","Thank you. Good afternoon. Just two quick ones, both on China. As you look at the brand identity there and the unit growth, are you seeing achievements from landlords and stable rents in that regard?","And then the second part is around the CPG business, so when you look at I guess China, also look at Japan and places that - I think you're growing the international CPG product rollout. Is there a U.S. model, you want the stores first or not as a model or now it is a model switch, where you have enough stores and you have the Shanghai Roastery that can go full fetched forward with that and that's something that also aids in brand awareness? Thanks.","John Culver","Yeah, Nicole. This is John. Real quick on the China piece. We are seeing continued very strong growth as it relates to our stores and really the elevation of the Roastery and the opening of the Roastery, we have landlords coming from all over China to see that. And they are reaching out to us, asking us to bring beautifully designed stores into their development.","So we see tremendous opportunity to continue to accelerate the growth of new stores. Our new store performance is the strongest that is ever been. We opened up 188 new stores in the quarter. We now operate 3,100, over 3,100 stores across the Mainland. And we're going to continue to accelerate the growth. And we'll share more about that on our call next week with you.","And then in terms of the channel development business and how we're thinking about growing channel development in these developing markets and in particular in China, as Scott shared, we sold 30 million bottles of Frappuccino since we introduced our partnership with Tingyi. Clearly, we have a strong retail brand footprint. But that retail brand is now extending out into the channels business, and then to retailers as well as into the digital space as well.","And we're seeing that play out not only in China. We're seeing that in Japan, and then obviously, strong growth coming out of our channel development business in EMEA. So we're excited to grow that business in parallel with our retail footprint.","Scott Maw","So just - I'd add to John's point and maybe reflect back to a question that John Ivankoe asked about the growth of CAP.","And just remember, in 2017, we saw China\/Asia Pacific add nearly 50% of our overall operating income growth. As we think about this year, we'll probably be in that same range. Maybe not quite as much, because the Americas business is going to contribute a little bit more. But this is the twin engines of growth that Kevin talked about so specifically in his comments.","And as we look forward to 2019 and we get into the full ownership of East China, I think you're going to see that same kind of mix to the overall operating income growth. That's obviously driven by China, but within China\/Asia Pacific, the other pieces of Japan and Korea as well. So just make sure you remember this, that we're seeing a strong blend of profitability across those two businesses.","Operator","I will now turn the call over to Mr. Shaw for his closing remarks.","Tom Shaw","Great. Thanks. Before closing today's call, we wanted to provide an update on the timing of several upcoming events. As mentioned in our earnings release today, we will host a supplemental call to discuss our business in China, as well as implications from modeling standpoint next Wednesday, January 31 at 2:00 PM Pacific.","In addition, we want to provide the specific dates of our China investor tour that Howard mentioned. We plan to host management meetings, local store tours, and a visit to the Roastery in Shanghai on May 16, with plans to visit a second market the following day on May 17.","And finally, we are timidly planning our 2018 Investor Day in New York on Wednesday, December 12. Thanks again. And have a great evening.","Operator","This concludes Starbucks Coffee Company's First Quarter Fiscal Year 2018 Earnings Conference Call.

Starbucks delivered very strong operating results in Q3 and I\u2019m pleased with the progress we\u2019re making with our growth at scale agenda. Pat will review our performance in more detail in a moment, but first, I want to touch on a few key highlights from the quarter and then describe the actions we're taking to further differentiate and strengthen our brand with an increased focus on the customer experience and a more agile approach to innovation.","By any measure, Q3 was a very strong quarter for Starbucks. Excluding the impact of streamline activities and foreign exchange, total revenues grew by 11% underpinned by a 7% expansion of our global store base, and global retail comp sales growth of 6% including comp traffic growth of 3%.","Notably, our two key long-term growth markets, the U.S. and China, both performed extremely well. In the U.S. comp sales were up 7% including comp transaction growth of 3%. Importantly, we saw comp growth across all day parts, including the afternoon for the first time in three years. This strong performance was driven by three key factors; an enhanced customer experience, relevant new beverage innovation, and accelerated expansion of digital customer relationships. The initiatives we are driving in the U.S. to simplify work, allocate labor to better meet customer demand, and improve our customer connections all contributed to the strong performance in comp transaction growth.","In addition to the improved customer experience, we are delivering exciting new beverages that are resonating with customers, particularly our cold beverage platform, which was the catalyst for growth in the afternoon. A customer favorite Nitro Cold Brew remains on track to be deployed across all U.S. company operated stores and be supported by advertising by the end of the fiscal year.","Iced Espresso Beverages, including Cloud Macchiato and Starbucks Refreshers performed well. Continued focus on the customer experience and beverage innovation is paying off. And we are very encouraged by the fact that our customer connection scores reached another all time high in Q3. Later in the call, I'll talk more about the important role digital is playing to strengthen and amplify customer connections, and how this has also contributed to our results.","China also delivered a very strong quarter, and we remain bullish on the long-term market opportunity as we deploy capital to build new stores and expand our presence. Our total store count in China grew by 16% versus prior year, to more than 3900 stores at the end of Q3. Additionally, comp sales were up 6% including 2% growth in comp transactions. Much like the U.S. China's comp performance was driven by an enhanced customer experience and beverage innovation.","Digital programs, including loyalty and delivery, contributed meaningfully to the quarter's performance as well. We introduced exciting new beverages, including the launch of Modern Mixology, a unique range of cold beverages that originated at our Shanghai Rose Street with local taste preferences in mind.","Our China Digital partnership with Ali Baba was also an important driver, which I will highlight when reviewing China's digital progress in a moment. In our channel's business, the global coffee alliance with Nestl\u00e9 continued to extend the global reach of the Starbucks brand. In the third quarter, we expanded Starbucks at home coffee presence into six new markets, with the launch of roasting brown, whole bean and the Starbucks coffee by Nespresso and Dolce Gusto single serve platforms.","Starbucks at home coffee remains on track to be in 16 markets, including the U.S. and Canada by this September. Overall we are pleased with the performance of the global coffee alliance. The strategic priorities we outlined a year ago are unchanged, and collectively, our Q3 results demonstrate that our growth at scale agenda is not only working, but through focus and discipline it is firing on all cylinders.","The focused initiatives we are driving to enhance the customer experience and deliver beverage innovation are both complemented and amplified by our digital initiatives. Because of the long term strategic importance of digital, I want to provide some perspective on our strategy in this area and the underlying initiatives that are fueling our progress and supporting our growth at scale agenda.","Two years ago, I shared my view that the two transformative elements of modern day retail are experiential retail, and its extension to digital customer relationships. Modern day retailers must create a unique and meaningful customer experience that ultimately becomes a destination that customers seek out.","In addition, extending that in-store customer experience to a digital mobile customer relationship is critical. Ideally that relationship is personalized and enhances the customer experience.","With over 30,000 stores globally, Starbucks has created experiential retail around coffee, craft, comfort and care. Our 400,000 Starbucks partners bring an uplifting and elevated experience to life each and every day, as they handcraft beverages, personalized for each customer, and create a warm and welcoming environment for communities to gather, and connect. Without a doubt, Starbucks is a preferred destination for hundreds of millions of customers around the world.","At the same time, our research has validated the importance of digital relationships as customers are digitally savvy and expect higher levels of convenience and a more personalized experience.","And we know digital relationships drive significant long term value to Starbucks through more frequent occasions, increase spend, improve customer retention and marketing efficiency.","So over the past five years, we've invested significantly and systematically to build a powerful digital flywheel that today enables over one billion digital customer occasions a year. This digital customer engagement is anchored by the Starbucks Rewards program which enhances the customer experience through some very relevant features that provide our customers with a convenient way to place orders, and receive highly personalized offers.","With that as background, in Q3 we enhance the Starbucks Rewards program in the U.S. significantly increasing the flexibility with which customers can redeem stars or loyalty rewards. These changes have been very well received by customers as growth of our 90-day active rewards members accelerated to 14% year-over-year reaching 17.2 million active members.","Loyalty members accounted for 42% of U.S. tender, and we are seeing evidence of improved engagement across our Starbucks Rewards member base. More specifically, the growth of active rewards members, the enhancements to the Starbucks Rewards Program, adoption of mobile order and pay, and the personalized marketing efforts contributed nearly 2% of comp sales growth in the U.S. for the quarter, an improvement from recent quarters.","In the U.S. we also expanded Starbucks delivers, in partnership with Uber Eats, which today is now in over 2700 stores across 11 markets. We continue to learn as we expand and drive customer awareness of this new channel and are seeing higher ticket compared to in-store transactions, as well as sales incrementally.","We are pleased to see that Starbucks partners are effectively enabling delivery in our stores alongside retail operations, improving the customer experience. It is still early days for food and beverage delivery in the U.S. and why we are not yet seeing Starbucks delivers meaningfully contribute to our U.S. business results. We believe that delivery is an important long term growth opportunity given customers increasing demand for convenience.","To that end, earlier this week we announced plans to expand the availability of Starbucks delivers in partnership with Uber Eats across the U.S. in early 2020. As we expand, we will continue to refine the program and ensure a quality customer experience as demand for delivery builds.","Now on to our progress in China, where our digital ecosystem remains a core pillar in driving long term growth. In December of 2018, we enhanced the Starbucks Rewards program in China to include the ability to earn rewards based on spend, and then redeem those rewards in our stores. We now have 9.1 million active rewards members in China, an increase of 10% from last quarter and 36% from a year ago, which has doubled the pace of growth compared to pre-launch levels.","The China Digital partnership with Ali Baba has enabled us to expand Starbucks delivers to approximately 2900 stores across nearly 80 cities by the end of Q3. This puts us on track to exceed 3000 stores or roughly 75% of our total store base by the end of this fiscal year. We continue to see strong performance in key cities, including a meaningful, incremental transaction lift, increased ticket and strong operational performance.","In Q3, delivery sales represented approximately 6% of total sales volume and as I mentioned earlier, contributed to China's comp growth in Q3. Given these strong early results. We are confident that Starbucks delivers will be an important growth vehicle for our business in China. So we are integrating our delivery expansion strategy with our store development strategy to inform the location of new stores.","In addition to our China expansion of Starbucks delivers, we also launched mobile order and pay in Q3, and are seeing strong early results. Following the May launch in Beijing and Shanghai, we've expanded mobile order and pay to approximately 1300 stores across four major cities in China, with further expansion underway.","Our team in China is also making progress on a new store format to better serve customers on the go. Last week, I visited the first Starbucks Now store in Beijing, and experienced firsthand this innovative new store design focused on the Express customer experience, Mobile Order for pickup or delivery. I'm pleased with how quickly our China team was able to light up mobile ordering for pickup or delivery and create this entirely new retail format.","This is a testament to Starbucks commitment to leverage digital technology to rapidly address customer trends in the world's fastest growing major economy. Importantly, the digital strategy we are executing against ensures that we maintain a direct relationship with our customers and avoid getting disinter mediated by third party ordering apps.","It also enables us to deliver personalized marketing directly to our most loyal customers, in a very efficient manner. Earlier this week, we announced a strategic partnership with Brightloom a Seattle and Bay Area based retail Tech Company focused on the restaurant industry.","Starbucks has granted Brightloom a software license for elements of the Starbucks digital flywheel in return for an equity stake in the company. Brightloom will focus on software solutions that meet the needs of Starbucks license partners outside of the U.S. as well as other restaurant merchants that are looking for a commercially available cloud based solution.","This allows us to continue to focus our internal resources on proprietary software development for our company operated markets. Now before I turn the call over to Pat, I want to highlight that it was just over a year ago that we first outlined our growth at scale agenda. This quarter's performance further demonstrates that our strategy is enabling more consistent, predictable results through focus and disciplined execution.","We have made meaningful progress against the three key strategic priorities of that agenda. By accelerating growth in our two targets long term growth markets, the U.S. and China, expanding the global reach of our brand through the global coffee alliance with Nestl\u00e9 and increasing returns to our stakeholders. We're doing all this while staying true to our mission and values. The foundation of Starbucks is our brand rooted in a unique, elevated Starbucks experience, the finest quality coffee, and our longstanding commitment to leveraging our scale for good.","I am particularly grateful to our Starbucks partners, who proudly wear the green apron, and deliver an elevated Starbucks experience every day to millions of customers in our stores. As I've shared with many store partners on recent visits to Europe, Latin America, Canada and Asia as well as here in the U.S. Our success is a credit to them.","I look forward to joining over 12000 store managers and field leaders from the U.S. and Canada in Chicago, for an important leadership conference this September. Together with the executive team, we will focus on inspiring and empowering our store managers for this next chapter of our journey as we build an enduring company for generations to come.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Pat to walk you through consolidated and segment results for Q3 and to provide an update to our fiscal 2019 outlook. Thank you.","Pat Grismer","Thank you Kevin and good afternoon everyone. I too am very pleased with the sustained positive business momentum that we delivered for a fourth consecutive quarter. On a reported basis, total revenue grew 8% excluding the 2% impact of streamline related activities notably the global coffee Alliance and the sale of our ownership interest in Thailand, as well as the 1% impact of foreign currency translation, total revenue grew 11%.","This increase in revenue was led by the growth of our global retail business, including net new store growth of 7% over the past 12 months and global comp sales growth of 6%. Non-GAAP EPS of $0.78 which included a favorable impact of $0.03 related to discrete income tax items was up 26% versus prior year.","I will now take you through our Q3 operating performance by segment, followed by an analysis of our consolidated margin performance. Our Americas segment delivered 11% revenue growth in Q3, driven by 7% comp sales growth including 3% comp transaction growth and net new store growth of 4% over the past 12 months.","U.S. comp sales growth in the quarter was once again driven by improvements to our in-store experience, beverage innovation, and digital initiatives, and also benefited from the lap of weaker performance in Q3 last year.","The enhanced in-store experience as measured by customer partner connection scores, which Kevin mentioned was driven by location specific operational changes that improved throughput, as well as the continued rollout of new store level processes and systems to facilitate higher levels of customer engagement.","This drove stronger sales overall with beverage and food contributing six points and one point of comp sales growth in Q3 respectively. Most of the beverage growth for the quarter was driven by our cold platform, led by refreshment, iced coffee and iced espresso.","Additionally, the Nitro Cold Group Platform, which reached approximately 5800 stores by the end of Q3, continued to perform well. Of the 3% growth in average ticket in the quarter, 2% was driven by beverage attach and beverage mix, while pricing drove the remaining 1%.","As Kevin mentioned, we saw transaction growth across all day parts, including the afternoon day part, which benefited from the strength of our cold beverage platform, as well as the improved in-store experience that I mentioned earlier. This strong revenue performance contributed to America's Non-GAAP operating margin expansion of 130 basis points to 23.2% in Q3, driven primarily by sales leverage and cost savings initiatives, notably supply chain efficiencies, partially offset by wage growth and inventory reserves.","Americas operating margin in Q3 also benefited from lapping last year's anti-bias training, and this year's change in breakage revenue recognition, driving 60 and 40 basis points of margin improvement respectively.","Moving on to China Asia Pacific, or CAP our fastest growing business segment. CAP segment revenues grew 9% on a reported basis in Q3. Excluding the 5% impact of foreign currency translation, and 1% impact from the sale of our Thailand business, revenue grew 15% in the quarter. This was driven by 12% net new store growth over the past 12 months and 5% comp sales growth.","I would now like to highlight the third quarter performance of two key markets in our CAP segment, China and Japan. We continue to open new stores at a rapid pace in China, growing store count by 16% versus the prior year.","Importantly, our new stores continued to deliver exceptionally high returns even as our market penetration increased. China also delivered comp sales growth of 6% in Q3 with a 2% increase in comp transactions, helped by Modern Mixology a new beverage platform that was launched in April, as well as our Starbucks Rewards loyalty program and delivery.","China also benefited from lapping relatively weak results in Q3 last year. 4% comp ticket growth was driven by pricing as well as food attach and beverage innovation. As noted in our earnings release, we made some minor adjustments to China's comp ticket growth reported in four previous quarters, in each case amounting to no more than 1 percentage point to harmonize our comp calculations across our business units. These adjustments had no effect on a reported financial statements or China's comp transaction growth.","For Japan, the momentum we saw in our business at the start of the fiscal year continued into Q3 with comp sales growth of 5% and comp transaction growth of 1%. These strong results were driven by LTL performance and blended core Espresso beverages, and the growth of our Starbucks Rewards Program.","CAPs non-GAAP operating margin increased by 10 basis points to 25.3% in Q3. This included 30 basis points favorability from the change in breakage revenue recognition. Excluding this benefit, CAPs non-GAAP operating margin decreased by 20 basis points as sales leverage and cost savings initiatives were more than offset by product mix and technology investments.","Onto our channel development segment, which reported a revenue decline of 6% in Q3 to 533 million including the impact of the Global Coffee Alliance, which reduced segment revenues by approximately $30 million in the quarter. While the decline was expected, it was partially mitigated by higher than expected sales of inventory to Nestl\u00e9 as they prepared to directly fulfill customer orders under the Global Coffee Alliance.","Non-GAAP operating margin decline by 740 basis points to 34.4% in Q3 including an 850 basis point decline as a result of the Global Coffee Alliance. Excluding this, the segments non-GAAP operating margin expanded 110 basis points driven by the strength in our North American ready-to-drink business.","Consolidated operating margin totaled 18.3% on a non-GAAP basis down 20 basis points year-over-year largely due to the impact of licensing our channel development business. Excluding the 70 basis point unfavorable impact of streamline activities, non-GAAP operating margin expanded by approximately 50 basis points reflecting strong sales leverage and cost savings initiatives throughout our supply chain.","The favorability from these items was partially offset by investments in the business including our partners, technology, and siren retail along with an increase in cost of goods sold attributable to product mix and inventory reserves.","Moving on to our guidance for fiscal 2019, now in the final quarter of our fiscal year, we have much better visibility to full year results. We now expect fiscal 2019 GAAP EPS in a range of $2.86 to $2.88, from our prior range of $2.40 to $2.44 largely due to the gain on the licensing of our Thailand market.","Our fiscal 2019 non-GAAP EPS is now expected to be in the range of $2.80 to $2.82 including the onetime cost of our leadership conference this coming September, which is a headwind of about $0.03 of EPS and approximately 20 basis points of full year operating margin.","The midpoint of this non-GAAP EPS guidance range implies approximately 16% year-over-year growth. Relative to our previous non-GAAP EPS range of $2.75 to $2.79 for fiscal 2019, the increase is predominantly driven by better than expected operating results in the third quarter.","Globally, we are now expecting comp sales growth of approximately 4% in fiscal 2019 at the high end of our original guidance range of 3% to 4%. Similarly, we are now expecting revenue growth of approximately 7% this fiscal year at the top end of our 5% to 7% guidance range for fiscal 2019 even with 1% of foreign exchange headwinds.","This includes a slight downward revision to our net new store guidance moving from 2100 stores to 2000 stores due to a slower pace of unit development in the EMEA region. At the consolidated level, we still expect operating margin for fiscal 2019 to be down moderately relative to fiscal 2018.","Segment level margins are also unchanged from what was previously communicated and reaffirmed on our second quarter fiscal 2019 earnings call. Please note that our fourth quarter will still bear the year-over-year revenue headwind from the Global Coffee Alliance for most of the quarter as well as the impact of licensing our Thailand business. We expect these factors, combined, with a tougher comp sales growth lap to yield lower in Q4 compared to Q3. And we also expect our non-GAAP operating margin percentage to be lower in Q4 compared to Q3 due in part to the one-time cost of our leadership conference as discussed in prior calls.","Moving on to items below the operating income line starting with interest expense, as reminder with the increased leverage policy that we adopted last year including the most recent debt offering, $2 billion in May and $3 billion last August.","Interest expense in fiscal 2019 is expected to be considerably higher versus fiscal 2018 at approximately $330 million. Also these discrete items which have benefited EPS to-date in fiscal 2019 amounting to approximately $0.11 for the non-EPS have significantly reduced our effective tax rate this year.","As a result, we now expect both our GAAP and non-GAAP effective tax rate in fiscal 2019 to be in the range of 90% to 20%. Given the nonrecurring nature of discrete tax items generally we expect that are non-GAAP effective tax rate for fiscal 2020 will likely be much closer to our ongoing effective tax rate of approximately 25%.","Said differently, the discrete tax items which have benefited fiscal 2019 meaningfully contributing to our outperformance relative to our original EPS growth guidance of 8% to 10% will in effect the non-operating headwinds to our fiscal 2020 EPS growth rate.","Moving on shareholder capital returns; from the beginning of fiscal 2018 through Q3 of fiscal 2019 we have returned over $18 billion to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases.","We will remain committed to returning $25 billion of shareholder capital by the end of fiscal 2020 and expect to reach nearly $21 billion by the end of fiscal 2019. This includes pulling forward $2 billion of share repurchase activity into fiscal 2019 that we had originally planned for fiscal 2020.","As a result we now expect a more normalized volume of share repurchases in fiscal 2020 than previously anticipated. Note, our share repurchases this year were completed weighted average price of approximately $68 per share for the third quarter.","All other full year 2019 guidance metrics including capital expenditures are unchanged from what was previously communicated and reaffirmed on our second quarter fiscal 2019 earnings call. Consistent with past practice we will provide guidance for fiscal 2020 on our Q4 call in October.","To summarize, Q3 was a very strong quarter for Starbucks by any measure as Kevin said even as a global scale Starbucks long-term growth potential remains compelling underpinned by the strength of one of the world's most beloved consumer brands, our focus on innovation and our disciplined execution.","As always the ultimate credit for our success belongs to our passionate Starbucks partners in every corner of our business. They have our greatest respect and appreciation.","And with that, Kevin and I are happy to take your questions joined by Roz Brewer and John Culver as Derga outlined at the top of our call. Thank you. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Matthew DiFrisco with Guggenheim Securities. Please proceed with your question.","Matthew DiFrisco","Thank you. Kevin, I might have missed in your prepared remarks, but could you say how much in the U.S. digital made up of your overall sales in the quarter? I know you had a nice jump and acceleration in the My Starbucks Rewards Membership. I was wondering if that also was a contributor to comps. Did you see a better comp growth number among the My Starbucks Rewards members than the overall comp?","Kevin Johnson","Yes. Thanks. I did comment that our digital efforts contributed about two points of comp in the quarter. And our royalty program represented about 42% of tender. So the acceleration we saw in active rewards members is paying off for us.","Operator","Your next question comes from Dennis Geiger with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Dennis Geiger","Great. Thanks for the question. Just wanted to focus on that strong traffic number, and if there's any additional color you could add on kind of where that's coming from and even the step up in the two year as well. Are there other certain initiatives that are driving that traffic number more than others? I mean anything on the customers. Is that you're getting heavier customers coming more. Lighter customers coming more or are you actually attracting newer customers as you're converting them into that loyalty network, just any incremental detail on the traffic number? Thank you.","Kevin Johnson","Yes. Dennis, I have Roz to kind of share the specific details. But this was a very strong quarter where we saw transaction growth in all day part. So Roz you want to take Dennis through what you saw in the U.S.","Roz Brewer","Sure. Thanks Dennis for the question. Just a few things. The result we're seeing in U.S. business is really part of the long term program that we started about 12 months ago. And the biggest piece of the work is around the in-store efficiencies that we've done, and secondly, the work around the digital relationships. Those two things in addition to beverage innovation have really driven the transaction improvement in the stores. Specifically on the in-store execution piece, we have looked very carefully at the task that the partners were contributing to in their work inside the stores.","We've reduced the number of task in the stores roughly taking out about 12 hours of work in terms of task at the store level. In addition to that, we have also really been benefiting from afternoon traffic. Our drive through percentage of stores is roughly 50% of our stores in the U.S. We have seen that the occasional customer tends to shop with us in the afternoon and they enjoy the cold beverages.","So, the combination of the cold beverage improvements that we've seen, the work that we've done with reducing task and the afternoon -- after morning peak and then the work that we're doing to monetize the digital relationships and grow those relationships. We know a lot more about our customers now. And it's really fueling what we have in the pipeline for beverage innovation as well as when we need to be ready for those customers at store level.","Kevin Johnson","I just add that the 12 hours of time that we've freed up in the stores that Roz mentioned we've redeployed to customer facing activity. So that's partly what's driven the customer connection scores as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from Sara Senatore with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.","Sara Senatore","Thank you very much. My question on margins on both U.S. and China, obviously very strong comps in those markets, but if I strip out the breakage and then the lapping of the training, if the margins were didn't expand quite as much as I would have expected on just robust topline. So you talk about redeloying labor. If is there a couple of is adding to labor is there. Is it the delivery impact and the labor cost associated with that? Any of that mix in terms of either lowing margin feedback or any kind of sort of promotional activity? I'm just trying to get a sense because I think there was a view that when you guided at the Investor Day just sort of flattish EBITDA margin seem quite conservative, but maybe that's not the case? Thank you.","Kevin Johnson","Thanks. Let Pat walk you through the discussion on the margins in U.S. and China.","Pat Grismer","Thank you, Kevin and thanks Sara for the question. First, what I want to do is just reinforce how very pleased we are with our overall margin performance for the quarter led by very meaningful improvements in our retail business, when you exclude the impact of streamline related activities our consolidated non-GAAP operating margin expanded by about 50 basis points in Q3.","We did realize significant sales leverage and cost savings notably in our supply chain. But that was partially offset by investments that we continue to make across our business, investments in our partners, in technology, in product innovation and in our stores in the interests of strengthening our competitive position to sustain long term growth. Now admittedly as you say a 50 basis point ex Streamline margin improvement seems modest in the context of a 6% percent global sales comp for the quarter particularly in relation to other quarters.","So what I would really like to do is to highlight what was unique to Q3, as well as some segments specific margin drivers for the quarter. On a consolidated basis our stronger sales leverage and weaker headwind from tax reform funded investments in Q3 were partially offset by higher inventory reserves and less favor ability from breakage compared to previous quarters. In the Americas and specifically our U.S. business margin expansion was tempered due to higher inventory reserves and less leverage from occupancy and depreciation expense in the quarter.","As a general matter inventory reserves stemmed from our ongoing efforts to drive product innovation in both beverages and food and include inventory write-offs associated with both developing new offerings and transitioning out of existing offerings. In Q3 specifically the reserves related primarily to our Mercado food platform. With respect to occupancy and depreciation expense we're seeing some near-term margin pressure from three things. Number one, renewing leases on high volume profitable stores, number two, renovating more stores, and number three; deploying new store level equipment to support new product platforms like nitro cold brew and improve operating efficiency in long term.","Although these investments do limit the near-term flow through that we would otherwise expect on occupancy and depreciation expense in our P&L, these investments are essential to maintaining our strong competitive position, improving profitability and driving future growth. So moving to cap the dynamics there were slightly different. I'm going to focus specifically on our China business within the cap segment. Margin expansion was tempered by product mix technology investments and foreign exchange headwinds in the quarter. Modern mixology drove incremental business particularly in the evening day part and with less frequent customers, but at a slightly lower margin due to increased packaging costs and higher levels of product waste.","The technology investments in China relate to a number of key initiatives including delivery MLP and Starbucks Rewards. And as highlighted by Kevin these investments have contributed strongly to our top line results and are instrumental to the strength of our competitive position in China. So as you can see there were some things that were unique to Q3 compared to other quarters that limited the flow through you would expect and such a powerful comp that we experienced across our business and there were some differences in terms of the margin dynamics comparing the U.S. to China.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Jeffrey Bernstein","Great. Thank you very much. Roz, I was wondering if you could offer a little more insight into delivery. Clearly, I think investors are excited to see the national rollout coming in fiscal 2020. I'm wondering maybe if you can provide some color in terms of what led to the push. I know it was an I guess 11 markets led by Miami, I'm wonder if you can give any specifics in terms of what it ultimately culminated in terms of \u2013 I know you highlight mix of sales, average check, maybe the incremental how kind of specifics around what that led to \u2013 I was assuming it's quite wide range of variability by market. And if you compare that to China which would seem like that's much further along. I know you gave a couple of metrics specific to China but if you can compare and contrast the U.S. versus China in terms of the delivery opportunity that would be great?","Roz Brewer","Sure. Thank you, Jeffrey. First of all, let me start off by saying that the concept of beverage delivery is developing just slowly overall in the U.S. versus China. China is a sort of a native delivery market versus the U.S. However, we have seen enough encouragement for us to go through a national launch. And actually as you read earlier this week bring our relationship with Uber Eats to bear. So, first of all, you're right, our markets included Seattle, San Francisco and then we expanded across to Greater Bay Area, Boston, L.A., Chicago New York DC and Miami.","We launched three more markets in July; Dallas, Houston and Orange County. In this expansion we're pleased with what we're seeing in ticket. Our most important work that we could do during this timeframe was to make sure that we had very good software integration first and foremost. And second that we could execute at store level. And those two areas have given us encouragement to go national with the program. What you'll see coming forward is not only the relationship coming together between Uber and Starbucks but also to the additional marketing that we're adding towards the efforts. We have minimal marketing through the pilot period of this work. So in terms of ticket and expediting at store level we're pleased and we're moving forward.","Kevin Johnson","John, you want to add sort of your perspective on what you you're seeing a delivery in China. Sure.","John Culver","Yes. Jeff, in China you know we've rolled out to now 2900 stores across the 80 cities and that was since we began the implementation last September. And what we're seeing is that first and foremost is that the digitally connected consumer in China is very much very much understands delivery and using it to us to address their needs state of convenience. When you look at what delivery has done for us it is driven meaningful incremental transaction lift. It represents now 6% of sales which Kevin talked about. And what we're seeing underneath that is it's a slightly higher ticket than what we're seeing through our stores.","There is a higher food attach. It's stronger in the morning and lunch daypart and really the team in China has really focused on how do we continue to manage this each and every day in adjusting the store base and adjusting the delivery rates and making sure that we're meeting the customer needs and fulfilling the orders within the 18 minute delivery time that we're targeting. We've gone through and really set up our store operations to better effect delivery. We obviously have a very strong partnership with Alibaba and have dedicated drivers that are delivering Starbucks products. We've gone through and rationalize the menu. And we've also obviously introduced premium packaging as part of the delivery experience.","And then obviously delivery is not only available through the Starbucks app, but it's available through all the Alibaba platforms as well which has enabled customers to engage much more frequently with it. So we're very pleased overall with what we're doing in delivery. We're on track to get to 3000 stores by the end of fiscal 2019. And we're continuing to see this as a strategic channel that we're going to continue to invest in and grow.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Glass with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","John Glass","Thanks very much. First, if you could just clarify in the U.S. what you think lapping the issues last year, helped comps this year. In other words what the benefit was just so we can maybe more get a better baseline of where the U.S. businesses is running ex those items. My real question is in China mobile order and pay. I imagine that could be a significant driver just based on the consumer's willingness to use digital there. How is the early reception been? How do you make sure you don't run into some of the throughput issues maybe you had in the U.S. there and mitigate some of those that potential slowdown or bottleneck?","Kevin Johnson","Thanks John. Let Pat take the first question on U.S. comps relative to last year. And then John Culver will take you through the mobile order and pay in China. Pat?","Pat Grismer","So John, I think the best way to understand the impact of lapping last year weaker performance is to really look at the two-year comp. And when you consider that last year's sales comp was 1% in Q3 this year then with the 7% in the U.S. we achieved two year sales comp of 8%. This was the highest two year sales comp in eight quarters and it was a sequential improvement over the 6% two-year sales comp in Q2. So I think when you when you look at that step-up sequentially that demonstrates the Q3 comp performance didn't merely result from an admittedly easy lap, but it provided clear evidence that the actions we're taking to improve the business are delivering results.","So I would just encourage you to look at the trend of two year comps and I think that will highlight what we believe is a step change in our business that happened in this most recent quarter.","John Culver","Yes, John and picking up on your question on mobile order and pay we're very optimistic and bullish on the opportunity this presents in China particularly given the digitally savvy Chinese customers. You know for us we announced and rolled it out in late May in 300 stores we've quickly expanded to 1800 stores and now sit across state cities in the market. And basically what we see in our stores is that we've learned from the U.S. on how we operationalize it to make sure that we're mitigating any of the challenges that we had here in the U.S. last year when we first introduced it.","And for us we see tremendous opportunity to continue to use this to enhance the customer experience. Kevin and I were just there as he shared and we saw the new Starbucks in our store which is dedicated to mobile order and pay and fulfilling delivery orders. That is one unique concept that we're going to further expand. And then in our core stores we have dedicated space where customers can come in and pick up their mobile order. And so thus far we're very pleased with how things are going. We're continuing to monitor very closely and we see it being a big opportunity for us going forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from Andrew Charles with Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your question.","Andrew Charles","Great. Thank you. Digital relations are a key source you've identified the gross domestic same store sales and it looks like the active MSR members inflected in 3Q with the 4000 ads that was seasonally the highest on record. And after 1Q and 2Q additions that were largely in line with the seasonally historic conditions. Was the inflection in 3Q largely a function the changes in MSR programs award structure in April? Were there changes in the tactics convert non-MSR members over to MSR members that were different this quarter and in quarters past?","Kevin Johnson","Yes. Roz I'll let you take Andrew through the dynamics there.","Roz Brewer","Yes. So, Andrew a couple of things. Just to go into the details of the changes that we did make back in April. There are three components to understand about that program. First of all the first part of it is around redemption for all and this allows our reward members -- our new reward members to actually achieve stars within two to three visits. In the past that number had been 30 to 40 visits and then you would achieve stars. The second piece of this is around the multi-tier redemption. And when you think about the multi-tier aspect of the program previously members could only redeem once they reached 125 stars.","Now the members are able to redeem their stars at five tiers ranging from 25 to 400 stars and we've added new items such as merchandise and at home coffee that you can also redeem. And then the last part of it is no expiration for Starbucks Rewards for credit card holders. And so stars do not expire for card holders. So the program change has its early success for us. There's been minimal disruption to the business and positive sentiment overall from the customer base. I'll also mention that compared to changes in the past our partners will tell you that on day one they felt 100% ready to open the stores with a new program and we had zero interruption.","So the program is a success. We're seeing conversions from our non-SR. In addition I'll add to that, we're able to speak to our non-SR members and that's our occasional member that I talked about earlier. Joining us in the afternoon likely through drive through enjoying refreshment and cold beverages and so it's growing our category where we needed it the most in improving our afternoon day part as well. So we're encouraged by the early signs of the program.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of John Ivankoe with J.P. Morgan. Please proceed with your question.","John Ivankoe","A previous question or I guess theme. The two-year traffic in the United States, same-store traffic has been around zero the past couple of quarters. Do you think that's the right level as we kind of think about fiscal 2020 I guess is the other time frame that we should expect given the change of the comparisons based on what you think about the economic cycle, competition in your own store growth? That's the first question.","And then secondly the question is for Roz. I know you've mentioned labor deployment, but could you kind of tell us where we are in terms of lean principles at the store level. I mean at what ending are we? How much more is there to go? And obviously as we look at attracting and retaining labor which are so essential for brands like your own. Should we expect labor dollars per operating week to more or less be in line with total inflation or is there anything that you could do from the productivity side there?","Kevin Johnson","John let's have Pat take your first question and Roz can comment on lean principles and the labor dynamics in stores. So Pat.","Pat Grismer","John, you're absolutely right. Our two-year transaction comp in the U.S. for the third quarter was flat where it has been for the last couple of quarters. However that is an improvement over the two-year transaction comp that was negative across really all the fiscal 2018. So we do believe that we're making good progress. I would say that we remain confident in our ability to deliver positive traffic comp on a one in two-year basis going forward in the context of our long term growth model that calls for U.S. comp growth -- sales comp growth of 3% to 4% with at least 1% coming from traffic growth.","What gives us confidence in our ability to deliver that consistently is the playbook that Roz and her team have developed that is demonstrating results here in the U.S. with three key elements; the improved in-store experience, breakthrough beverage innovation and digital. And I think what you've seen over the last four quarters here is steady improvement with in this most recent quarter an inflection point that gives us even more confidence that we're on the right track and that playbook will yield results consistent with our long term growth model.","Roz Brewer","John, to your question about lean principles and what's left sort of in the pipeline in terms of what we're seeing for labor deployment. So, first of all, let me start off by saying that there is a longer term plan and there's still work yet to be done at our stores. But I'm encouraged by what we're seeing right now. First of all, we are constantly looking at how do we free up task in the stores. We talked about the twelve hours per week that we've accomplished so far, but we've done several things in addition to that.","First of all we've gone into some of our major markets that are high MLP areas and we have expanded the handoff plain. So when we have customers that are crowding in the handoff area right where MLP is exchanged and the drinks are exchange we have extended that physical space. We've added labor hours as the stores have earned the labor hours and so and reallocated from the work that they were doing turn those hours back into hours that they can spend customer facing.","And then the other part of the work that we've done is around training. And so we have freed up time through the labor scheduling tool that we put in place in Q2 and now we're able to train more in the stores. What's left in the pipeline for us, we have significant work in progress that will hit in fiscal year 2020. First and foremost we will be introducing the inventory excellence and routines which is going to help us actually with further store execution.","The second piece is what we do with our food. We have a process in our stores where we have to pull the food first, allow it to fall over a period of time and then -- and there are some improvements in that process, significant improvements. And then lastly, our automated centralized planning and replenishment will hit next year as well and second quarter of next year. So we have significant work in the pipeline that gives us encouragement that we're managing labor at store and we are reducing the work in the store and reallocating those hours back into what matters most.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sharon Zackfia with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.","Sharon Zackfia","Hi good afternoon. I had a question on China. So when you think about all of the efforts over the past year whether it's delivery or Mobile Order Pay most recently or the change to Starbucks Rewards in that market. When you look at the comp store how is that driving comps between new customer acquisition versus increasing frequency?","John Culver","Yes. Sharon, this is John. What I would say is that you know given the growth that we're seeing in the market and I'll go back to the two key metrics that we gave at Investor Day. Around total revenue growth for the market we delivered an 18% year-over-year growth in the total market and then transactions across the entire market to include new stores and non-comp store or comp stores with strong double digit growth. And so, as we dig into that we look at and we say, we continue to not only attract new customers into the Starbucks brand and into the Starbucks experience, but then also existing customers continue to increase frequency. And the way in which we see this frequency happening now on the existing customers is through the Starbucks Rewards program.","And when you look at the Starbucks Rewards program in December we moved from spend based program, I'm sorry we've moved to a spend based program and we enabled our customers to have an easier access into the program and enrolling into it. We now have 9.1 active Starbucks Rewards members which further accelerated over Q2 by 10% and year-over-year membership has grown 36%. And so more and more of our existing customers want to be a part of the rewards program. So we're driving meaningful repeat into our existing stores with existing customers, but then also attracting new customers and as we open stores in the areas where they work and where they live. So we feel very good about the strategy that we have around this and the acquisition that we're seeing on both new and existing customers and frequency.","Pat Grismer","Yes. Sure and I would just add to John's comments that just remind you that, China is predominantly a tea drinking culture and we're introducing the Chinese consumer to premium Arabica coffee. We sell teas in our store as well. And you think about the new store growth that we're investing in China. Many of those new stores we're expanding into new cities where it's the first time we've had Starbucks presence. So we're dramatically increasing the number of new Chinese consumers that are introduced to Starbucks. And as we do that we work to help establish that relationship and ultimately a digital relationship and keep them coming. But there is a significant long runway of opportunity for us to continue to attract new customers to Starbucks in China. And then we create a great customer experience for them and a relationship with them. And from there we'll create customers for life.","Operator","The next question comes from David Tarantino with Baird. Please proceed with your question.","David Tarantino","Hi, good afternoon. Just one clarification and then my question. The clarification, Pat, could you tell us what the inventory reserve impact was for the quarter and whether that was a onetime issue or something you expect to continue? And then I guess my other question is for Kevin. Kevin, how should we think about the strategic implications of this deal that you did with Brightloom. And should we start thinking about Starbucks wanting to monetize some of the engine behind what's made you successful on the digital side more widely? And if so, how do you protect some of the proprietary nature of that as you extend it to other brands? Thank you.","Pat Grismer","David, with respect to the inventory reserves the issue was primarily in the U.S. business and as I mentioned earlier primarily driven by our Mercado food platform where we're in the process of transitioning to a new fresh food platform over the next year or so. So there were some supplier obligations and other commitments that resulted in our taking some reserves in the third quarter. We do take inventory reserves on an ongoing basis as part of our business, but those reserves were more elevated in the third quarter. We're not anticipating reserves on that level in our fourth quarter.","Kevin Johnson","And David on your question about Brightloom I give a little context and sort of answer your question for it. We recognize certainly the important role that digital plays in our business and we're always looking for new ways to accelerate growth and drive innovation on digital. For example, it was a little less than a year ago that we entered into the China Digital partnership with Alibaba that has enabled us to increase the reach of the Starbucks mobile app experience, launched Starbucks delivers and build star kitchens embedded in homes stores. That relationship has accelerated our digital flywheel progress in China.","I say for the last year or so we've been working to find a way to provide digital flywheel services to our global license partners. Now keep in mind there are approximately 10 large companies that license and operate most of the Starbucks stores throughout EMEA, Latin America and Southeast Asia. Because each of those partners run different technology stacks and they also manage multiple restaurant brands, we had to find a creative way to deliver the consistent Starbucks digital experience to those different partners who run multiple brands and have diverse tech stacks.","That's why we partnered to create a new tech company called Brightloom. Brightloom is the merger of the restaurant tech company formerly called Eatsa and a software license of specific elements of the Starbucks digital flywheel. Now certainly those specific elements are the elements that are generally available for ordering and managing loyalty things like our personalization engine and other things are still proprietary to Starbucks. So with the license to those specific elements of the Starbucks digital flywheel we didn't invest cash in this new venture but rather we received an equity stake in return for that software license.","A board see an commitment from Brightloom that they're going to focus on our global license partners and as sort of the early stage customers that Brightloom serve. So Brightloom is going to be in a position to service those Starbucks license partners as well as the broader industry restaurant merchants who need the same cloud based software platform. So I think this now gives us a solid strategy to bring the digital flywheel to our license partners globally. It enables our Starbucks technology team in house to continue to focus on the R&D capabilities for our company operated markets outside of China and the proprietary aspects of our digital flywheel and allows us to continue in China to leverage the partnership that we established with Alibaba to supplement our China digital team.","So we think we think of this is really a strategic move to get a front row seat on next generation innovation around digital flywheel from Brightloom and to have a solution that services our international license partners.","Operator","Your next question comes from Andy Barish with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Andy Barish","Wondering on the delivery expansion in the U.S; if you haven't yet seen a meaningful impact in some of the large urban areas you started out. And are you willing to share whether or not you expect it to be a comp contributor in 2020? And what kind of levels of incrementality maybe you're seeing early on in some of the markets you you've been with Uber Eats? ","Kevin Johnson","Roz, you want to take that?","Roz Brewer","Sure. So, Andy a couple of things. One, we're encouraged by the incrementality that we're seeing. We are seeing expanded ticket. We're seeing food attach at a significant level per ticket. We're seeing quality of the beverage upon delivery. We've made some advancements in our packaging which has helped us tremendously. So, we're encouraged that what we've seen so far as we expand and get marketing dollars behind it. We're encouraged by what we think this could do for us in the long run.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer and Company. Please proceed with your question.","Brian Bittner","Thank you. Hi guys. A question about U.S. sales and the question about China sales. On the U.S. could you just talk a little bit more about Nitro rollout and what it's really doing to accelerate the beverage comp that's leading the comp for the U.S. we're just finding a lot of stores that are selling out this product. So really interested in any quantifiable comments you have related Nitro? And on China, last year was really -- you really talked up the competitive headwinds that you were seeing there. And from the outside looking in the competitive headwinds arguably have only accelerated yet, your trends have done much better. And the question is really idiosyncratic to what you've been doing? Or are we seeing a nice big acceleration in the overall coffee market for China? Thanks guys.","Kevin Johnson","Thanks Brian. Let Roz take the first one and then let me comment on the second one then I'll hand over to John as well.","Roz Brewer","Sure, Brian. It's unfortunate that you've been experiencing any outages on Nitro, but beverage growth did contribute to about 80% of our total sales growth for the quarter. So we've got good news here in terms of the receptivity in demand for Nitro. We are making advancements in our back rooms and behind the bar to accommodate what we need to have happen with Nitro. In most cases it requires us to install new equipment. And so we're making space for the attraction and growth that we've seen in Nitro. And as we get more and more of this rolled out right now by early August we should be probably in 80% of our stores and then by the end of the year a 100% of our stores and we're learning as we go. And execution is happening at stores and we're getting better and better every day and learning as we go full bore on this.","Kevin Johnson","And Brian when I think about the opportunity in China certainly try to represent a large and growing addressable market for coffee. And it's no surprise that at large and growing addressable market is going to attract more competitors. And because China's a tea drinking culture, more competitors focused on the addressable market of coffee actually accelerates the adoption of coffee by the Chinese consumer. That's certainly good for the industry, but I would also argue what's good for the industry is also very good for Starbucks.","You know as the market evolves, it's important for us to stay focused on the key elements that differentiate Starbucks from all others. You know Coffee, the premium Arabica coffee we serve, our craft, the fact that we can craft beverages personalized for each customer. Comfort, the third place experience where we create that warm welcoming environment and connection, the place where people connect over coffee and tea. It's also important in what you've seen over this last year, we've extended that third place customer experience really amplifying the digital customer relationship and enabling new capabilities around the needs state of convenience.","And it is that, it is that differentiation of Starbucks in the third place and craft and coffee and extending it to the needs state of convenience. You know, we feel like the steps we've taken have further differentiated our position in a large and growing market of China. And I think that's exactly the direct contributor to China's great performance results that we've seen. The strategy is working and we're going to -- we're going to continue to stay focused on that model. John, anything else you want to add?","John Culver","Yes, I would just you -- I think Kevin hit it all, but you know for us and the China team it\u2019s really focused on this on their purpose driven growth agenda and building out for the long term, a very successful and enduring company in China for China. And the only point I would just add to what Kevin made is, it centers around our people and our partners and for those of us that have the opportunity to travel there and to see the pride with which they interact with our customers and build that customer connection, that is a true differentiator versus our competition, whether that's in China or whether that's in the other 79 markets we operate in around the world.","`","So for us, if we can continue to elevate our partners who can continue to elevate the coffee and the experience for our customers, we feel that that is a significant point of differentiation for us versus any competitor in any market that we operate in.","Brian Bittner","Well said, John.","Operator","Your next question comes from Gregory Francfort with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.","Gregory Francfort","Hey guys. Thanks for the question. I'm looking at coffee prices and that's their lowest point in five years, and I know you guys can hedge that out pretty far. Can you -- can maybe help frame up when that rolls through your P&L I guess the way I'm framing it is, is there going to be a headwind or a tailwind from here as it rolls through margins? Thank you very much appreciate it.","Pat Grismer","Thank you, Gregory. This is Pat. First of all to put coffee prices in perspective, our green coffee purchases are expected to account for about 10% of our global cost of goods sold. So it's not a meaningful move or a mover for us. We are price locked fully on coffee for fiscal 2019 and we have the majority of our needs locked for fiscal 2020 as well. It is something that we pay close attention to, but we're not anticipating that you know what you've seen by way of volatility is going to have a big impact this year or next based on the positions we've taken.","Operator","Your next question comes from R.J. Hatovi [ph] with Morningstar. Please proceed with your question.","Unidentified Analyst","Thanks. I had a follow up question about the improved customer experience and discussed a lot of qualitative factors that went into that, whether re reallocating labor or other things, but I've wondered if you had any specific way to quantify that whether it be measuring peak hour throughput or satisfaction scores, so anything to help us put some context around how you're seeing that improvement in the stores and just any financials you might have around that?","Kevin Johnson","Yes. You know there is a set of things we look at. Partner engagement scores, which is sort of an indicator of how engaged our partners and they feel inspired, motivated and what they're doing and customer connection scores. And Roz, I'll let you comment on sort of the way that you think about those metrics and what you're driving.","Roz Brewer","Yes, we look directly at customer connection scores because we know when those are increasing. We know that we will see repeat visits from higher customer connection score. So this quarter, we did see record customer connection scores. The other thing to watch while it's not a metric, but when you see us growing our repeat customers around our SR members and bringing on our non-SR members that really growth customer connection for us and the work that we're doing to speak to them on a one-to-one basis.","So we've moved from one-to-one to many speaking to large groups to now personalizing how we talk, advertise, promote, understand and know what they drink. What time they will be in our stores, and so we're much more personal with our customer base not only from a digital perspective, but by freeing up these hours we are having much better eye contact, handoff question, you know just the whole relationship building between the partner and the customer. And I'll tell you our partners are much more excited about being a Starbucks partner right now. They're loving the work that they get to do in the stores. They love that we don't have you know limited time offer beverages that we're on a beverage innovation plan that they're brought into. They're able to do customization right at the point of purchase.","So it's an exciting time to be in our stores and you'll see that when you walk into stores and understand what it takes for our partners to do the best work that they can and we're working with them to alleviate the task and make sure that they're engaged everyday with the customer.","Kevin Johnson","Yes, I want to get Roz and her team a lot of credit for what they've done to really step back and be thoughtful about how we could simplify things in our stores for our partners, how we could automate some of those administrative tasks and through that our partners in the stores feel more supported that comes through in the partner engagement scores, and that gives them more time to connect with customers, that list the customer connection scores. And so, we could look at metrics and then actions that can move those metrics. But at the end of the day, it goes back to it. We take care of our partners who probably wear the green apron. They create that special Starbucks experience for the customers that come in our stores.","Operator","Your last question comes from Lauren Silberman with Credit Suisse. You may ask your question.","Lauren Silberman","Hi, thanks. Just going back to the U.S. loyalty program change, seems like it went well when successfully by and large. Did you see any pushback from the change among the longer term higher frequency Reward members? And then are you seeing any change in behavior among the newer cohorts and rolling in the Rewards program in terms of increased spend in frequency relative to what we've talked about historically. Thanks.","Roz Brewer","Sure, sure. Thanks for the question Lauren. So, first of all our long term customers what we've seen in this last quarter, they are shopping more with us. I would tell you that has to do a lot with the beverage innovation, that we've brought forward in the stores. So we're seeing growth with our long term as our members dedicated members.","And then with our new non-SR customers we're still learning about them, but we are doing some work on customer segmentation. And that's allowing us to look at you know time of visit and it is adjusting our schedule, schedule labor hours in the stores. So we're really grateful to have already installed the labor scheduling tool, because as we give these new customers we're learning more about them, and it is moving our business in the afternoon day part, and actually we're learning their preference for a cold beverage and the refreshers business, iced teas that we've just recently introduced in the past 60 days.","So we're still learning, and we'll continue to bring back those learnings to this group as we learn more and the program is fully in place.","Kevin Johnson","Thanks Roz. Thanks for the question. I wanted to take this opportunity to thank you all for joining us today. You know in reflecting on this past year at Starbucks, our Growth at Scale agenda is really about sharpening our focus and then executing with discipline. This is -- this is really enabling us to deliver consistent, predictable long-term growth in alignment with the growth algorithm we outlined at our Investor Conference in December.","As a leadership team, we do not take victory laps after a great quarter like Q3, but rather, we focus on staying true to our mission and values, taking care of our partners, serving our customers and delivering results. This is what it takes to build an enduring company and this is what you can expect from Starbucks.","And with that I'll turn the call over to Durga for a brief announcement. Durga?","Durga Doraisamy","Thank you, Kevin. Everyone for your planning purposes, please note our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2019 conference call has been tentatively scheduled for Wednesday, October 30th. Again, that would be Wednesday, October 30th. Thank you and have a great evening.","Operator","This concludes Starbucks coffee companies\u2019 third quarter fiscal year 2019 conference call.

Schultz - Starbucks Corp.","Thank you, Tom, and welcome to everyone on today's call. Before I start the call, I want to acknowledge the recent passing of Joe Buckley. Joe had followed Starbucks from the start, from our IPO days in 1992. Over the years, Joe has been on countless calls just like this one, and for that reason, I felt it was the right forum to send my personal condolences to Joe's family and his colleagues. Joe was a really good man.","I'm pleased to comment on the record financial and operating results Starbucks announced today. I'll start with a few highlights. Record revenues, record operating income, and record EPS, another quarter of strong comp growth in China, accelerating comps in Japan, record quarterly revenues, margins, and operating income from Channel Development, record Starbucks Rewards membership growth, and a record holiday, including record Starbucks new Card activations and reloads. I'm particularly pleased that we delivered these results, despite a very challenging period for restaurants and retailers overall, and despite the significant investments we continue to make in our people and in beverage, food, and technology innovation.","Today Starbucks is serving more than 90 million customer occasions through over 258,000 stores in 75 countries each week. The trust and confidence our customers have in the Starbucks brand is driving our business and fueling our flywheel in markets and channels around the world as never before. Three years ago, I brought to your attention what I anticipated would be a seismic evolving shift in consumer behavior resulting from the rapid acceleration of digital and online consumer retail purchase activity.","Today that shift is a foregone conclusion, increasingly challenging brick and mortar retailers of all descriptions and being particularly hard on retailers that are not destinations, do not reward loyalty or offer relative digital and online capabilities, or have not built deep authentic experiential connections to their customers.","I think it's important to understand that the 3% comp figure we reported reflects the continued relevance and appeal of the Starbucks experience and how Starbucks continues to outperform by significant margins anyone else of scale in the retail and restaurant sectors. The fact is, Starbucks is engaging more deeply and more frequently and expanding our base of loyal customers everywhere in the world more effectively and reliably than ever before.","We added a record 1.8 million Starbucks reward members in the U.S. year-over-year, and now have approximately 13 million active members on top of a growing 7.5 million active members in China and Asia-Pacific.","We saw nothing short of a surge in new Starbucks Card activations and reloads in Q1 to $2.1 billion, almost $300 million over last year, with over $80 million being incremental to even our most optimistic internal expectations for the quarter, and we ended the quarter with over $1.5 billion of customer loaded funds on our balance sheet, roughly 10% above last year. This $1.5 billion represents future revenues in the bank for us that are not reflected in Q1 revenues or comps, since as you know we do not recognize new Card loads and reloads until the funds are redeemed. But unlike traditional retailers whose online and digital or omni-channel activity often times comes at a price discount or cannibalizes in-store or both, further pressuring business models, Starbucks do not. Digital or online Starbucks Card loads are never cannibalistic and are very often incremental because the funds can only be redeemed at face value in a Starbucks store. We're already seeing Q1 loads being redeemed in our stores and we'll continue to see further redemptions in the quarters ahead.","We delivered record shattering Mobile Order & Pay performance metrics in Q1. Rapidly accelerating customer adoption of MOP, particularly over the last three months contributed to a growing number of stores being challenged to keep up with the increased volume demands and introduced an operational challenge that Kevin will speak to in his remarks. We are now laser focused on fixing this problem, but the nature of it, too much demand, is an operational challenge we have solved before, and I can assure you we will solve again.","Beyond these factors, we have consistently said in achieving mid-single digit comps for the full fiscal 2017, our target we repeated at our Investor Day last month. Our expectation has been that comps in the back half of the year would reflect an acceleration from the front half. This remains our expectation as recently introduced new in-store business drivers, including true one to one personalization and real time suggested selling increasingly drive incrementality and revenues, and position us to extend the trend of our newest class of new and remodeled stores, defying current retail and consumer trends, and delivering record breaking revenues, profits and returns on investment both in the U.S. and around the world.","With the benefit of these insights you can see that the momentum of our flywheel is enabling us to engage with our customers, and drive our business holistically, and more effectively, and profitably than ever before. Going forward, Starbucks values and guiding principles, the engaging third place sense of community we create, and the innovation and increasingly premiumized coffee experience we deliver will further deepen the connection among our partners, customers, and the Starbucks brand, and enable us to continue driving growth and increase profitability over both the short and long terms around the world. In our view, no brick and mortar retailer of any description is better positioned to navigate and profit from the ongoing consumer shifts under way than Starbucks.","In a few minutes, Kevin will provide details around segment operating performance in Q1 and provide further detail around the new innovations and initiatives that will drive revenues, comps, and EPS in the quarters ahead, and Scott will take you through our Q1 financial results, provide Q2 targets, and our targets for the full fiscal year, and we'll move on to Q&A.","Global leadership around all things coffee and tea remains at Starbucks' core. Our Seattle Roastery continues to deliver company leading comp growth, including 18% in Q1, on top of 24% in Q4 of 2016. Due in large part to a ticket that continues to be approximately four times the ticket of traditional Starbucks store, and serve as a learning lab for retail beverage and food innovation, and the launch pad of our ultra-premium Starbucks Reserve brand. We're on plan to open our Shanghai Roastery later this year, and our New York Roastery in 2018 and our Tokyo Roastery will be right behind.","And in Q1 we made great strides against our plans to further premiumize the coffee industry through the addition of what will ultimately be 1,000 or more coffee forward ultra-premium Starbucks Reserve stores in key global markets, with the first Reserve store opening in Chicago this summer. We're already leveraging elements of the Roastery and the new Reserve store format by integrating Reserve bars into existing Starbucks stores. The overwhelmingly positive customer response we're having to the Reserve bars already opened, and the incremental revenues and profits Reserve bars are driving, is prompting us to accelerate plans to add Reserve bars into thousands of existing Starbucks stores as part of planned renovation cycles in the quarters and years ahead. Reserve stores and Reserve bars in existing Starbucks stores will enable us to provide customers with a unique ultra-premium coffee experience and showcase the finest assortments of exclusive Starbucks Reserve micro-lot single varietal coffees, and create new coffee brewing methods through an intimate one-to-one partner customer experience that takes place as the barista crafts and explains the custom handcrafted beverage.","In addition, Reserve stores will offer customers artisanal foods specially created by our partners at Italian artisanal baker Princi, as well as craft beer, wine, and alcoholic beverages that will be incremental to our evening daypart informed by the learning from our evening's program tests. And both Reserve and traditional Starbucks stores will also offer handcrafted Teavana branded beverages and an expanded assortment of Teavana teas in order to increase customer awareness of Teavana super premium loose leaf and packaged teas.","Perhaps nowhere in the world is the power of the Starbucks brand and the size of opportunity that lies ahead for us more evident than in China, a country we first entered 18 years ago, and where our business has never been stronger or more robust. We now have over 2,600 stores in 125 cities in China, and continue to open a new store every 15 hours, a rate of new store growth that will continue for years to come. I'm more convinced than ever that Starbucks is just getting started in China, and that our Shanghai Roastery will drive both deeper and broader customer engagement and increase profitability across both our retail and CPG businesses, and it will advance Starbucks' reputation, being among the most, if not the most successful and well respected western brands in the key China market.","The Starbucks brand and business have never been stronger or more universally relevant and accepted as both are today, and our world class senior leadership team with Kevin at the helm as CEO effective in April, has never been stronger. We will continue playing the long game with strict adherence to the five-year strategic plan for growing our business we updated and outlined at our Investor Day in order to continue delivering the world-leading financial and operating performance, including mid-single digit global comps and long-term sustainable profitable growth, and that unmatched ground breaking innovation that our customers and our people expect from us.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Kevin. Kevin?","Kevin R. Johnson - Starbucks Corp.","Thank you, Howard, and good afternoon, everyone. I will provide an overview of business segment performance and highlight some of the key initiatives that are under way. I will then turn the call over to Scott to take us through the financials and our targets for Q2.","At our Investor Day in December, we outlined a multiyear plan to further elevate the Starbucks brand, elevate our customer experience, and ultimately amplify Starbucks as a consumer destination around the world. We also reaffirmed our strategic priorities over the next five years and provided more clarity around our ongoing investments in retail, beverage, and digital innovation, as well as in our partners. Looking ahead, we believe that our clear, long range planning, combined with ongoing innovation and a heightened commitment to excellence and execution will enable the creation of meaningful shareholder value.","Despite the challenging macro retail environment, Starbucks delivered record revenues, operating margins, and profits in Q1. Each of our business segments contributed to our overall global results, and I'd like to take a few minutes to walk you through our performance by geography and segment. Let's begin with the Americas.","Our Americas segment had a solid quarter, posting 3% comp growth with 3% comp in the U.S., and 7% revenue growth. Americas added about 250 net new stores in the quarter, and now operates almost 16,000 stores. When analyzing the 3% comp growth in the U.S., there are four major points to capture both the strength of the brand and the opportunities to further accelerate comp store growth.","First, our beverage category performance was strong. We delivered great hot and cold beverage innovation to our customers, contributing to a total beverage sales increase of 7%. Core beverage contributed one point of comp, and tea grew by nearly 10% in the U.S. and 15% globally. Iced espresso, iced coffee, and handcrafted Teavana shake and iced teas each posted strong double-digit growth. We continue to introduce new Cold Brew varietals and expand our store deployment of Nitro Cold Brew.","Second, our food sales were also strong, growing 8% year-on-year, contributing one point of comp, driven mainly by improved attach across all dayparts with continued strength in the morning. Food represents 20% of our total sales, with breakfast sandwich revenues growing 16%, bringing the two-year growth rate to 69%. Sales of premium breakfast sandwiches increased 52%.","A third point I'd like to make is the surge in Starbucks gift cards and reloads, both digitally and online. The $2.1 billion of card sales and reloads is a reflection of the strength of our brand, as well as the power of our digital flywheel, which leads to the fourth point. Digital flywheel adoption continues to grow, with almost 13 million active Starbucks Rewards members in the U.S., up 16% from the same period a year ago. Starbucks Rewards as a percentage of tender is up 4 points from a year ago to 34%, and mobile payment increased to 20% of total transactions. This is up 2 points from last quarter and represents an accelerating trend, driven by the success of Mobile Order & Pay.","Total member spend increased 21% year-on-year, driven in part by the strong early success of our recently launched personalization capabilities. Mobile Order & Pay had a banner quarter, representing more than 7% of total transactions, double the figure from Q1 last year, and we now have nearly 1200 stores with 20% or more Mobile Order & Pay transactions at peak, compared to only 13 stores one year ago. The overwhelming success of Mobile Order & Pay has increased Rewards engagement and created efficiencies at point of sale.","But as Howard mentioned, the success of Mobile Order & Pay has also created a new operational challenge that has been building in lock step with volume growth, and it's most pronounced in our highest volume stores at peak, significant congestion at the handoff plane. This congestion resulted in some number of customers who either entered the store or considered visiting a Starbucks store and then did not complete a transaction. Adam Brotman is already driving action in our top 1,000 highest volume Mobile Order & Pay stores to address this issue, including introducing new in-store procedures and tools, adding new roles and resources to specifically support Mobile Order & Pay, and the testing of new digital enhancements, including text message notifications when a mobile order is ready for pickup.","Our in-store operational approach continues to evolve as we handle larger volumes of transactions. I will point out that we have been confronted with and solved complexities like this that have been introduced by rapid volume and traffic growth many times over the past several years, and we will solve the challenges presented by Mobile Order & Pay driven traffic increases now.","I want to highlight additional plans we have in place to drive comps to mid-single digits for the full year. These actions align with the five-year strategic plan and are focused on near-term comp growth. First, product innovation. In beverage, we are building a broader beverage platform around Nitro and other Cold Brew offerings complemented by innovation around Frappuccino and Teavana iced teas.","Regarding food innovation, we introduced delicious, healthy, high-protein, Sous Vide Egg Bites this month that have been extremely well received and are driving both incremental revenue and increased attach. We are expanding production capacity to meet incremental demand for these egg bites. We're also launching the highly-anticipated gluten free breakfast sandwich soon.","As we discussed at Investor Day, we have a growth opportunity in the lunch daypart with innovation around a fresh, healthy lunch concept that will be tested in the Chicago market this summer in Starbucks stores. Digital flywheel innovation is a critical part of the plan. In addition to ongoing improvements in personalization, including increasing triggered offers based on customers' recent Rewards activity, we are also rolling out suggestive selling that will recommend items to a customer during the order process. The voice enabled ordering capability we demonstrated at Investor Day will begin deployment in the coming months.","To accelerate our progress implementing this plan, John Culver, who leads Starbucks Global Retail, made a leadership change in the U.S. with Kris Engskov, a 14-year partner, who most recently led EMEA, assuming leadership of our U.S. retail business reporting to John. Kris was an operator in the U.S. retail business prior to his assignment leading EMEA, and it's great to have him back in the U.S. retail. In addition, I've asked Howard to act as a coach to Kris as we focus on energizing and galvanizing our store managers and field leadership around the many growth initiatives rolling out now and in the quarters ahead.","Tony Matta, who currently leads our U.S. CPG business will succeed Kris leading global channel development. Tony brings 20 years of experience in the CPG industry and has done a fantastic job leading the Starbucks U.S. CPG business.","Let's move on to China Asia-Pacific. In Q1, CAP once again Starbucks fastest growing segment with revenues up 18% and comp sales up 5%. We added approximately 300 net new stores in CAP in the quarter, and now operate 6,700 stores across 15 countries. Our newest class of company operated stores in China continues the trend of outperforming even the most recent prior class, reflecting both the increasing strength of the Starbucks brand in the region and improved operating leverage. And we celebrated a milestone in Q1 by opening our 1,000th store in Korea. Korea now joins China and Japan as countries in CAP with over 1,000 Starbucks stores. We remain on plan to have roughly 11,000 locations in CAP by 2021. We opened over 160 new Starbucks stores in China in the quarter. We now operate over 2,600 stores in China and remain on plan to have over 5,000 stores by 2021.","Comps in China grew 6% in the quarter, with 4% increase in traffic. We continue to build the China digital flywheel with active members growing over 25% year-on-year and the new partnership with Tencent showing phenomenal results. WeChat Pay already represents 20% of total transactions in China and the soft launch of WeChat social gifting to 4 million Starbucks customers in China has generated overwhelming attention. Social gifting is the next frontier of our digital flywheel.","In addition, Teavana continued to perform well throughout CAP with tea revenues growing over 40% in both Japan and China following the launch of custom handcrafted Teavana beverages sold at Starbucks. The passion and commitment of our partners in CAP is enabling a great Starbucks experience that is deepening our connection with customers and driving our business throughout the region.","Let's move on to EMEA. EMEA continues to see success from the repositioning of its store portfolio, with system comps growing 3%. We opened approximately 100 net new stores in the quarter and now operate over 2,700 EMEA stores, only 18% of which are company operated. Non-equity stores are driving our performance, despite an increasingly challenging operating environment. Reported total revenues in Q1 decreased 16% year-on-year to $262 million in EMEA. However, when adjusted for the 21% impact of foreign exchange, the sale of 35 stores to franchisees and local licensees in the UK, and the transfer of 144 stores in Germany to AmRest, an existing EMEA license partner, revenue growth was 5%. We remain confident in our strategy and long-term prospects for EMEA.","On to Channel Development. Channel Development delivered record revenue, up 8% year-on- year, on top of a very strong 16% increase in Q1 a year ago. We continued our strong track record of growth as measured by total U.S. coffee consumption in Q1. Starbucks K-Cups posted sales growth of 10.3%, six times the total K-Cup category growth of only 1.7%. We are the market share leader in this category at 17.7%.","Starbucks is also the number-one premium Roast and Ground packaged coffee brand. Our Roast and Ground sales grew 6% in the quarter, compared to total packaged coffee category decline of 1.6%. This contributed a point of share, taking us to a 14% share position. As we mentioned at Investor Day, while we expect to see continued deceleration in the category and increased competition for both Roast and Ground and K-Cup, we will continue to innovative, gain share, and drive growth.","Turning to our Ready-to-Drink business. Our NACP partnership delivered excellent results with system sales, as measured by IRI, up 8%. Share of the total liquid coffee and energy segment grew to 14%, fueled by strength in bottled Frappuccino, Doubleshot energy drink and new chilled multi-serve products. We continue to expand our CPG footprint. In EMEA, Starbucks Nespresso compatible capsules have already become the number three brand in the Nespresso compatible capsule category in the UK. In China, Starbucks Frappuccino is now available for purchase at over 21,000 points of distribution, enabled by our partner, Tingyi. And in the U.S., our partner, Anheuser-Busch Inbev begins the rollout of new Teavana ready-to-drink teas in February.","In our 25 years as a public company, our aspirations have never been higher and our opportunities never greater. As we pursue our multi-year plan, we will remain true to our mission and core values and a commitment of serving others and sharing success.","In closing, I want to personally thank the more than 300,000 partners around the world who proudly wear the green apron for the work they do every single day in our stores. Ultimately, it is our partners who delivered the record results we announced today.","With that, I'll hand over the call to Scott to take you through our Q1 financials in detail. Scott?","Scott Harlan Maw - Starbucks Corp.","Thank you, Kevin, and good afternoon, everyone. Starbucks record first quarter fiscal 2017 results once again demonstrate strong financial and operating performance in the face of a challenging environment. We delivered solid top line and bottom line growth in the quarter, despite investing meaningfully in innovation and in our partners to support and strengthen our brand and business going forward.","Consolidated operating margin came in at 19.8% on a GAAP basis, and 20% on a non-GAAP basis. The 10 basis point improvement in operating margin over Q1 last year was driven primarily by sales leverage and favorability in commodity costs, principally coffee, that more than offset increased partner investments, largely in our Americas segment. We saw strong leverage on cost of goods sold, once again in Q1, giving us great confidence that our long-term goal of $1.4 billion in COG savings is achievable. Q1 GAAP EPS grew 11% to $0.51, which is a record when the large one time gain associated with the Starbucks Japan acquisition is excluded from our Q1 results two years ago. Q1 non-GAAP EPS grew 13% to $0.52, also a Q1 record. I'll now take you through our Q1 operating performance by segment starting with the Americas.","Our Americas segment delivered operating income of $959 million in Q1, a 3% increase over last year. Operating margin declined 110 basis points to 24%, largely due to increased store operating expenses attributable to increased U.S. store partner investments. As mentioned last quarter, we are investing an incremental $250 million globally this year in overall partner and digital investments, with the bulk occurring in partner wages and benefits in the U.S.","The full impact of our partner investments in Q1 was partially offset by increased sales leverage. As Kevin mentioned, Starbucks digital flywheel continues to gain momentum and drive our business. We are now approaching the spend and profitability for Starbucks rewards member levels we had forecast when we switched from a frequency based to a spend based loyalty model last April. We expect further improvement in these critical metrics over the course of the year. We now expect Americas operating margin to be roughly flat to 2016 levels for fiscal 2017.","Let's move on to China Asia-Pacific. CAP once again delivered the strongest top line growth of any of our operating segments 18% over last year, while delivering record quarterly GAAP operating income of $163 million, up 29% over Q1 of last year. CAP's operating margin expanded 180 basis points to 21.2%. On a non-GAAP basis, CAP's operating income increased by 27% to $177 million, and its operating margin expanded 170 basis points to 23%.","Contributing to CAP's margin expansion was the transition to a value-added tax structure in China and outstanding performance from our joint venture operations in the region, partially offset by 110 basis points of negative impact related to FX. For the full year, we continue to expect moderate operating margin expansion in CAP, and are optimistic that we will exceed our initial operating margin plans despite the increasingly negative impact of foreign exchange. Also, CAP revenue growth adjusted for foreign exchange will remain in the mid-teens all year. Reported revenue growth in this segment will be meaningfully impacted by foreign exchange as we move through the year, with an estimated 3 full points of negative impact on revenue growth for the year.","Let's move on to EMEA. Despite continuing economic, geopolitical, retail and FX headwinds, EMEA delivered among the strongest operating margins in its history in Q1, 16.8%, up 140 basis points over last year, once again validating the correctness of our strategy to optimize our EMEA store profitability by shifting to a predominantly licensed model. As Kevin mentioned, systems sales, systems revenue, and overall profitability are running much higher in EMEA today under the largely licensed store portfolio approach when compared to the prior company owned market model. It's important to note that EMEA operating income grew by 6% after adjusting for the nearly $7 million impact of negative foreign exchange in the quarter. With such a strong start to the year, we continue to expect EMEA operating margins to reach nearly 15% for the full fiscal year.","Starbucks Channel Development segment continues to lead the premium coffee category in both Roast and Ground and on the K-Cup platform, gaining share in all U.S. categories in at-home and Ready-to-Drink, while at the same time, delivering record quarterly operating margin and profit. And despite an increasingly competitive operating environment, Channel Development's operating income reached $243 million, up 26% year-over-year, on a 620 basis point increase in operating margin to 43.9%. Margin improvement was driven primarily by favorability in coffee costs, higher income for our North American coffee partnership with Pepsi, and sales leverage on cost of goods sold, and operating expenses. For the full fiscal year 2017, we continue to expect Channel Development to post full year revenue growth in the high single-digits, though Q2 growth is likely to be at a slightly slower rate, given the timing and impact of the Easter holiday, which occurred in Q2 last year, but falls in Q3 this year, and we continue to expect Channel Development to drive strong operating margin improvement in fiscal 2017 over last year with expected very strong expansion in the first half of the year, but moderating a bit over the last two quarters.","I want to make one last point on the quarter related to capital deployment. Cash returned to shareholders increased 42% from Q1 of last year to nearly $800 million, a Q1 record.","Let's move to 2017 targets. We are reiterating the financial and operating targets we previously provided for fiscal 2017 with a slight modification to our total revenue growth goal. To achieve these targets, we are committed to remaining disciplined with our investments and laser focused on delivering an elevated experience to our customers, while at the same time, meaningfully improving our comps, revenue, and profit in the second half of 2017. This discipline will be key to delivering our top and bottom line goals. Specifically, on a 52-week basis we now expect foreign exchange adjusted revenue to grow at 8% to 10% compared to fiscal 2016. We believe broadening this range is prudent, given the 7% revenue growth we posted this holiday quarter. This includes global comp growth in the mid-single digit range, with the first half of the year lower and some improvement in the second half of the year.","We plan to add 2,100 net new stores globally, including approximately 1,000 in China Asia-Pacific, 800 in the Americas, and 300 in EMEA. On a 52-week basis, we continue to expect slight improvement in consolidated operating margin compared to fiscal 2016. This margin expansion is the strong result, given the twin pressures of foreign exchange and increased partner and digital investments.","With our coffee needs for 2017 approximately 80% price locked, we do not expect commodities to materially impact our year-over-year profit growth. Commodities, in total, will be slightly favorable in the first half of the year and slightly unfavorable in the back half. Also, given recent movement in currency exchange rates, we now expect an increased negative impact from foreign exchange for the year, with revenue growth now impacted by roughly 1 point, and earnings per share negatively impacted by 1 point to 2 points. The impact of FX will accelerate as we move into the last half of 2017. You will note that this is a meaningful increase from our last guidance relative to the impact of FX.","Given all these points, we continue to expect fiscal 2017 GAAP EPS in the range of $2.09 to $2.11, and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $2.12 to $2.14. Specifically looking at Q2 2017, we are targeting GAAP EPS in the range of $0.43 to $0.44 and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.44 to $0.45. All other guidance is unchanged from last quarter.","We are pleased with the record operating and financial results we announced today, particularly given that the results were delivered in conjunction with a significant increase in investments in our people and innovation. More importantly, as you heard from Kevin, we have a clear set of actions that we believe will improve comp growth and profitability as we move through the year. As always, credit for our success in Q1 belongs to Starbucks partners around the world who proudly wear the green apron and work to deliver an elevated Starbucks Experience to our customers through 90 million individual occasions every week, but who do so with heart and passion, one cup at a time.","With that, I'll turn the call back to the operator for Q&A. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And our first question comes from the line of John Glass from Morgan Stanley. John, your line is now open.","John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks very much. I wonder if I could just maybe ask two guidance related questions, Scott or Howard. First is just with the context of the lower revenue growth, can you just break out between the foreign currency and what your expectations are comps at the beginning of the year versus now? Is that evenly split or how do you break those down? And then there was discussion at the Analyst Day of growing G&A at half the rate of revenue, and I wonder if that's in play this year and how that plays out, because G&A growth was substantially more than that in the first quarter, and I know that's probably the investment timing, but just is the half of revenue rate still in play this year?","Scott Harlan Maw - Starbucks Corp.","Yeah, I'll take those in order, John. So, as far as revenue growth goes, we're really still on that double-digit track that we talked about. It's just, given the performance in the first quarter which, as you know, was 7%, both adjusted for FX and as reported. We just see the math averaging out to perhaps a little bit below that rate, depending on how we finish. But we still expect comps to accelerate in the back half of the year, which means revenue will accelerate in the back half of the year and the number I'm giving, that 8% to 10% growth rate, that excludes the impact of FX, which we think, based upon where rates are today, will be about one point negative. So, hopefully that answers that modeling question.","On G&A growth, what we talked about was G&A growth excluding the investments we had in innovation, which is primarily things around the digital flywheel and things we're doing with Siren Retail. That will grow at half the rate of G&A, or half the rate of revenue. And when you strip out one-time items, some of those investments that we're talking about, we were really close to that this quarter. So, we're still on track for G&A \u2013 core G&A growing at half the rate of revenue for the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Palmer from RBC Capital. David, your line is now open.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks, good evening. You mentioned the issue with the congestion at the handoff for those mobile orders. How much of a drag do you think that represented during the quarter? And any color about the nature of the friction, where was it greatest and how quickly could you solve the issue would be helpful. Thanks.","Kevin R. Johnson - Starbucks Corp.","Yeah, David, this is Kevin. I'll give you a little bit of more perspective on this. If you look at stores that had more than 20% of their transaction volume coming from Mobile Order & Pay at peak, this quarter we had 1,200 stores in the U.S. that fit that profile. Last quarter, it was 600 stores, so it's doubled in this last quarter. So, there's significant uptick in the usage of Mobile Order & Pay, and we've now \u2013 to the point where we doubled the number of stores that had more than 20% of their transaction volume coming in at peak. Now, what that creates is, when those orders come in at that volume, it's creating congestion at the handoff plane. And so, when a customer \u2013 a potential customer might walk in the store, it used to be they would look at the line at the point of sale, and if that line looked too long, they might decide not to do a transaction at that time and come back later. Now when customers walk into the store, we've alleviated the congestion at the point of sale line and now we have congestion at the handoff plane. So, they might look at the number of customers around the handoff plane and the number of beverages on the handoff plane, and that might create the signal to them that they are going to wait to do their transaction.","We can't specifically quantify the number. We do think that was the most significant contributing factor to our 3% comp. So, it is something that over the last five years or six years we've had to continuously solve problems of the increased scaling of transactions in our store. This is no different. And so we are focused on a set of solutions. Adam Brotman is on point for those solutions, and maybe I'll hand over to Adam to walk through the set of things that you have in motion now and kind of where you're going with the action plan. So, Adam?","Adam B. Brotman - Starbucks Corp.","Thanks, Kevin. David, to answer your second question, we're getting after this right now. So, as this surge occurred in MOP, Mobile Order & Pay adoption, at those 1,200 stores that Kevin just mentioned, we studied right away which of those stores developed practices and systems for alleviating that congestion, and alleviating the balk and improving the throughput and making a smoother customer experience. And so, we took those practices right away, we rolled them together and we started rolling them out this week to those 1,200 stores and they include everything from two new barista roles that help simplify and clarify exactly how to organize and connect with customers and smooth out the congestion at the handoff plane. We are redeploying, and at times surgically adding labor into those stores to accommodate those roles, but really, it's just about getting after a better deployment method for those barista roles in those stores. And we've added new station \u2013 ticket station, layout guides and other tools that make the experience easier and better for our partners, and we know these work in the stores that we've studied and we're putting that into action right now.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sara Senatore from Bernstein. Sara, your line is now open.","Sara Harkavy Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you very much. I wanted to ask about the record Starbucks Card activations and reloads, and just ask if you could talk about what you think that means in the context of slightly softer comps this quarter. So specifically, is this sort of just a timing shift when you think about traffic, fewer people out doing holiday shopping maybe, but in the end, the traffic patterns will come back in the March quarter? Or is this something else that's going on? And, I guess, on a related note, in light of the traffic shift, how are you thinking about delivery, which is an area that so many restaurants now are talking about, focusing intently on as a way to maybe counteract what looks like just less footfall out there?","Scott Harlan Maw - Starbucks Corp.","Hey, Sara, it's Scott. I'll start and I'll ask Matt Ryan to help a bit. Look, as far as the Card loads, that record level of activity, that will come through, sitting on the balance sheet will absolutely come through as we move into January and beyond this quarter. In fact, we're already seeing that happen. I think the important thing to understand is the challenges that Kevin talked about and the opportunity we have with throughput. Adam is working on that. That solve will take a little bit of time. We'll get started on it this quarter, but my guess is, turning that around takes a bit of time. So, while all that Card load activity is going to come through, and that's going to be positive, we still have to address that throughput opportunity we have in our stores.","Matt, do you want to add?","Matthew Ryan - Starbucks Corp.","Yeah, I think the good news in all of that is the terrific results we're seeing related to reloads in particular. That's testament to the digital flywheel working on all fronts right now, as you heard from Howard and Kevin, there is record performance, and it's coming from both the number of members we have and the acquisition activities that have taken place, as well as from spend per member, which is a function of three basic things. The transition that we successfully made to a spend-based model, which encourages higher spending; personalization, part and parcel with that and our ability to incentivize, purchases that may not have otherwise happened; as well as the impact of Mobile Order & Pay. So, we feel good about all of that. I just want to address the one last question about delivery that you also raised as well, too.","Where we see the greatest opportunity for delivery as we outlined at investment day is in China, where the cost of delivery has come in at a price point that customers are willing to pay, and we will be looking to engage and make that happen. So, you'll see more of that in months to come, as we get results from our pilots back. We're also exploring other opportunities in the U.S., but we don't have anything specific to announce at this time.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe from JPMorgan. John, your line is now open.","John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Thank you. Two questions, if I may. Firstly, listening to some of the prepared remarks, I mean, there's obviously a lot of I think rightful optimism around the $2.1 billion loaded on the Starbucks Card as a balance ending the quarter. Some of the food doing very well, specifically around the egg bites.","But I guess the one piece that maybe hasn't been fully developed yet is one to one marketing, and customized offers being made immediately to the customer. So, I guess it's on that last point, and Matt, maybe the question is for you. When do you think that begins to have an impact? Especially for the 80% of stores, presumably that don't have the capacity constraint at the handoff, in other words, driving additional spend at the stores that aren't constrained? And I have a follow-up.","Matthew Ryan - Starbucks Corp.","Sure, thanks for the question. I think the result you saw in spend per member going up so dramatically in the past quarter and so on as a result of the first wave of personalization kicking in. Remember that it was about at the beginning of last quarter that we started personalization, not just in email, but also in the app itself, so that there were mobile offers being featured to the customer, and we saw tremendous response rates there versus what we had done previously in email, which already had been higher than what we had done without one-to-one, so that ramp was already taking place. We're optimistic that we're also layering what we call recommendations right now that is rolling out this month, and what that means is as customers are in the process of ordering we will be doing suggestive selling, so that was not in past results, but should be in this quarter, and future quarters to come. There's a long roadmap in front of us with personalization. We've only just begun that journey, and we're very, very optimistic about the contribution it's already making to the spend per member that we're seeing.","Operator","Your next question.","Matthew Ryan - Starbucks Corp.","John, you had a follow-up? No?","Operator","Pardon me. Your next question comes from the line of Sharon Zackfia from William Blair. Sharon, your line is now open.","Sharon Zackfia - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hi, good afternoon. I guess the question is, given the success of Mobile Order & Pay, can you talk about how that's informing your new store design? And as you think about that, structurally, is there anything that you would go back and want to retrofit throughout the system, particularly in the U.S.?","Howard S. Schultz - Starbucks Corp.","This is Howard. I'll start with that. It's interesting you asked that question, because we have many of our designers and architects in Seattle this week from the U.S. and around the world speaking about Reserve stores, Reserve bars, and the hot topic of the day, obviously, which is the unbelievable surprised success of Mobile Order & Pay and the impact it's had on the morning ritual. So, a few things.","One, in existing stores, we, as Adam said, we have discovered that managers on their own have created best practices in order to solve the problem, and are creating, in a sense, a mobile kiosk that they can move around to try and establish a handoff plane, but we're going to redesign new stores and existing remodels to reflect the fact that Mobile Order & Pay, although it's in its nascent stage, is obviously going to be a significant part of the morning business. So, I want to bring some color to it also in my own way.","When we introduced this, I don't think we had any idea that we would get the kind of response that we have gotten so fast, and as Kevin said, the ramp-up that we are now seeing has significantly affected the morning ritual, and at times, created anxiety among existing customers. And \u2013 but at the same time, this is a great problem to have, and a problem that we know how to solve. This is not rocket science. This is what we do every day, as retailers, as merchants, and we are in this thing right now, deeply trying to understand specifically what we can do on an interim basis, and what we can do over the long term.","But the Mobile Order & Pay activity and the nascent stage of personalization and one-to-one marketing bode so well for the growth and development of the company, especially in light of the macro issue of traffic. And I think as I said in my prepared remarks, there's such evidence for us that we are going to be one of the true winners, regardless of what happens with those retailers, and especially those retailers that are going to suffer significantly from the downturn of traffic, as a result of e-commerce and mobile purchasing online. But I think we're in a unique position. Obviously, it affected comps this quarter. But it's a very good problem to solve, and then when you look at the $2 billion loaded on Cards that are sitting on the balance sheet for Starbucks, I mean, is there a company \u2013 is there a retail company, a retail brand, that is in this kind of position? And I said in my remarks, if you just look at the fact that we could not book that revenue in terms of traffic and comps, it's a much different story for Q1 than what we reported.","John Winchester Culver - Starbucks Corp.","Howard, can I just add one other thing? This is John. Sharon, beyond the Mobile Order & Pay and the future design of the stores, we're looking at other areas as well for improvement, such as the cold beverage station, as we add in more cold beverages, iced tea, Nitro improvements to include infusion. We're also looking at enhanced food offering, and building out a more robust food capability within our stores. And then we continually look at and we shared with you at the investor conference the beverage innovation and the equipment innovation that we have coming on beverage, as well.","So, Mobile Order & Pay is a piece of that and the deployment of that clearly, but then also we have other things that we're working on in terms of future design of the stores. And all this is designed around the principle of creating a higher and better partner-customer connection, and building that customer service aspect at a much higher level into our stores.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe from JPMorgan. John, your line is now open.","John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you so much for the follow-up. I do appreciate it very much. So, the question is for you, Scott. It's a little bit of a model question. Cost of goods sold leverage in the U.S. has obviously been a pretty important piece of the model over the past couple of years, especially as labor costs have risen, and in this quarter, it looks like it was relatively flat in the Americas year-over-year. So, I just wanted to get some color on that result, and if you expect future leverage in that obviously very important line going forward, even with commodities beginning to tick up?","Scott Harlan Maw - Starbucks Corp.","Yeah, we do expect future leverage. One thing to remember, John, and I know you know this that includes COGS and occupancy, so there's a little bit of offsetting direction in those two-line items within cost of goods sold and occupancy, but we had nice leverage really across the globe and in the U.S. as well on cost of goods sold.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andy Barish from Jefferies. Andy, your line is now open.","Andrew Marc Barish - Jefferies LLC","Yeah, a question for Howard, please, on Reserve. I guess, I'm wondering if it works with the core brand given the pricing, the menu pricing is going to be higher in Reserve stores. Do you think eventually that gives you some room to move the umbrella up on your core brand pricing?","Howard S. Schultz - Starbucks Corp.","I don't think so. I think that our objective is to create a ultra-premium experience with Reserve in traditional Starbucks stores with Reserve bars, Reserve stores only, and obviously, the Roastery. But I don't think it's going to be a opportunity to raise prices in our core stores or core brand. But I think the differential between the ultra-premium experience of Reserve, we like the position that we're currently in, and our customers are responding very positively, as many people saw before the Investor Day at Brookfield Place. And I think I'm very encouraged, because outside of New York City, where we're opening stores, we're seeing a lot of traction with the number of Reserve beverages that are being sold, and the frequency of visits of customers coming back for a hand-crafted experience.","Andrew Marc Barish - Jefferies LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jason West from Credit Suisse. Jason, your line is now open.","Jason West - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Yeah, thanks. Just want to circle back on your comment, Scott, about the guidance for the year. When you said still sticking with mid-single digits, but you said below that, or I guess somewhat softer in the first half, are you saying that not mid-single digits in the first half, and then recovering to that level in the second half? Or are you saying more something a little different, if you could explain things?","Scott Harlan Maw - Starbucks Corp.","I think something a little different. I think, what we're sticking to is full year guidance of mid-single digits, and that the first half will be a bit lower than the second half. I want to try to stay away from giving comp guidance for each quarter, as you can imagine. Part of the first half is obviously impacted by the three that we just reported, but I think the thing to focus on is accelerating comps, revenue, and profitability in the back half of the year. That's really important for our guidance. And I would just add, all the things that Kevin talked about in his prepared remarks is what gives us line of sight to that, all the things around product innovation, many things that we're really just starting on the digital flywheel, and in the operational improvements, which will pick up over time and over the course of the year, and impact overall comps.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Tarantino from Robert W. Baird. David, your line is now open.","David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hi, good afternoon. My question is coming back on the comps performance in the quarter, and in the holiday season, in particular. I appreciate the commentary around the bottlenecks on throughput being an issue, but, Howard, as you mentioned, the retail and restaurant environment looked very challenged in December, perhaps for a number of reasons, including the seismic shift that you've called out repeatedly. So, I was wondering if you thought that was also part of the issue. Or was it truly only related to the bottleneck? So, I guess asked differently, was there an issue in December that was more macro, that might not carry forward into the rest of the year?","Howard S. Schultz - Starbucks Corp.","I want to be very thoughtful about how I answer this. I think clearly, if you look at the results post-Black Friday, when there were headlines across the country that this was the first time I think in the history of U.S. retail that we saw more money being spent online than in traditional bricks and mortar retail. So, that unto itself was a signal that the holiday season for the first time was going to be bifurcated in a broader way.","Having said that, we still believe that the holiday season, for us, was not significantly affected by the downturn in traffic. It was more the things that we've already discussed that are in our control, and in a sense, the self-induced issue of the success of Mobile Order & Pay. If that did not exist, I think we'd have a different story here today. And for us, as retailers, we want to be in a position where we are in control of the things that we can control, and we can't control weather, we can't control the downturn in traffic, but we can control the experience we create, the relationship we have with our customers and our partners. And if you look at the thing \u2013 you know what, the thing that I think I'm trying all the time to ask myself, and that is the ongoing reservoir of trust and relevancy of the Starbucks brand and experience, I think the primary data point is, look how many customers and how many dollars were bought with regard to reloads on existing people's accounts on phones and in gift cards. And it's a record number, especially when you look at the backdrop of the retail restaurant sector and the fact that most people had a very poor holiday. That, to me, is the primary indicator of the health of the brand, the health of the experience and the ongoing relevancy of the company and the confidence we have in what we've stated to-date.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Karen Holthouse from Goldman Sachs. Karen, your line is now open.","Karen Holthouse - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi, thanks for taking the question. So, another one on G&A and maybe approaching it a little bit differently. If you look at the trailing 12 months of G&A, we've seen sort of the year-over-year increase in that number ramp really significantly in the last really two quarters or three quarters. Carrying any version of that sort of run rate going forward, I don't know how you would get \u2013 just the math doesn't work on your operating margin guidance versus your revenue guidance. So, just trying to understand. I know there's some one-time stuff in there. Do absolute dollars of G&A come down from where we are right now? Or when does that trajectory start to bend down a little bit?","Scott Harlan Maw - Starbucks Corp.","Yeah, thanks, Karen. You'll see the G&A growth rate come down, in general, as we move to the back half of the year, but I think, the thing \u2013 it's really important that I reiterate how we've talked about G&A growth. Because of the fact that our digital investments go through G&A because we're a retailer, our digital investments, all the things around flywheel, all the things we're doing with Reserve and Roastery, a lot of that cost, particularly as we get it up and running under Cliff Burrows, those head count costs all go through G&A. We're splitting our G&A into the core G&A that we all know, in finance and HR and legal and all those costs, and we're managing that bucket to half of revenue.","The other dollars, which by the way, the total isn't that big of a piece of G&A, but it is growing much faster, well over double-digits. That's the piece that we're looking at as an investment. And so, that's why I want to bifurcate that. And if you take out the one timers in that significant investment that runs through G&A for us, we're below revenue growth rate in G&A, and I think that number will get better as we get throughout the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Bernstein from Barclays Capital. Jeff, your line is now open.","Jeff Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thank you very much. Just maybe two questions. One, I was just wondering if you could talk about the Americas, specifically around the U.S., in terms of dayparts. I mean, it seems like when you break down the components, you were pleased with the results. And then I'm just wondering if you could break down maybe the strongest and the weakest, or maybe how you respond to the weakest. I thought I saw some article about \u2013 I know you mentioned the evening daypart, maybe that's on the softer side, perhaps, I know there were some reference to the alcohol testing pulled back, so maybe the evening is more the biggest opportunity.","And my other question was just on the MSR. I mean, I think you now said you're up to 13 million members. I'm just wondering, I think at the Analyst Day, you told us you have 75 million total customers. So, I'm just wondering how do we get that 13 million, which I think you said already grew 16% this quarter. And I'm wondering if that's where you expected it to be at this point or how we get that number to even ramp up more quickly from here?","John Winchester Culver - Starbucks Corp.","Okay. Jeff, this is John, just real quick. The growth on the dayparts was pretty evenly distributed across all dayparts. And so we saw good growth in the morning. We saw good growth at lunch and then in the afternoon and into the early evening. And when I say good growth, each of those dayparts grew year-over-year over 5%, approximately.","When you look at the individual categories within that, which Kevin highlighted in his comments, beverage was a 7% year-over-year increase, which contributed a full point to our comp performance. We saw tea grow over 10% across the Americas. And we had huge success as it relates to iced beverages, in general, to include tea, as well as coffee, Cold Brew, Nitro, et cetera.","Food, on a year-over-year basis grew 8%, and that contributed a full point of comp, as well. And, in particular, from a food standpoint, we saw strong growth in the morning daypart, particularly up against beverage, sandwiches, and that grew about 16%. And then the premium sandwiches that we offered as the LTOs during the holiday season grew over 52% on a year-over-year basis. So, for us, when you look at the dayparts, the daypart growth was strong, and was evenly distributed and contributed to the overall performance of the business. And Matt, do you want to take the MSR question?","Matthew Ryan - Starbucks Corp.","Sure. Just a reminder of what we did in the quarter. We started the quarter with 12 million actives and we went to 12.9 million as we exited. And, as you can imagine, we are continuing to accelerate.","I think it's important to talk about where we were and where we are now. When we started the quarter at 12 million, we were behind where we wanted to be. And when we exited the quarter at 12.9 million, we were slightly ahead of where we wanted to be. So, we made up the gap and then some as we went through the quarter. This was a result of leaning in on two different fronts. To get to an active, you have to acquire and then you have to activate them. And we have done both in the quarter. So, we continue to lean in with acquisition, largely through our stores. And then importantly, because we know there are, as we said at Investor Day, millions of people who start the process, register but don't get all the way through to becoming active. We focused very strongly on that through digital communication, in app, and through other means with our customers. And because we're able to put those improvements to the digital flywheel in place, we were able to dramatically increase the number of actives as a result of activation.","We continue to see promise in doing more. We have a lot of things in the pipeline to address that issue, and you're going to continue to see us lean in to acquire more members. So, we feel very good that there's a lot of upside out there. As you mentioned, there are 75 million customers and we only have 13 million or so right now. So, we see that as a great way of growing our business, because we know that every single time we acquire a new member, we see a large amount of incrementality on a customer-by-customer basis. And with the new Spend Rewards program in place, it's looking better and better.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matthew DiFrisco from Guggenheim. Matthew, your line is now open.","Matthew DiFrisco - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Thank you so much. I had a question, just a follow-up. So, on the redeploying of labor, I think, it was mentioned, and adding some people also and adding some new stations as far as solving the bottleneck, I was curious, is that going to be something that we should maybe be a little bit \u2013 is that another level of investment maybe on the partnership line that is incremental to the margins in Americas in the coming quarters? Or is this a benign effect on the margins and it's going to be shifting labor?","And then, just so I don't get cut off, my follow-up question was with respect to the guidance, the $0.44, $0.45, I guess, just to \u2013 you're not giving quarterly comps, but you're saying mid-single digit and they will get better in the back half. Is that then devoid of needing to do a mid-single digit in the second quarter, i.e., if you did a 2% comp you could still \u2013 the EPS is separated from that and you could still do the $0.44 to $0.45?","Scott Harlan Maw - Starbucks Corp.","I think Adam will take the first part, and I'll take the second.","Adam B. Brotman - Starbucks Corp.","Matthew, this is Adam. So, with regard to your first question, it is not about adding labor, per se. It's more about redeploying and aligning labor. So, it's something our stores do every day, by having these new tools in place, they can better work through the bottleneck at the handoff plane in a way that we know works. And at times, if it's necessary to add labor in a store, we do that for a number of reasons. This would just be one of them. And we always do that thoughtfully, surgically, and on an accretive basis. So, that's no different in this case, but now we have better tools and better processes to allow these, particularly these high volume Mobile Order & Pay stores to get after that quickly.","Scott Harlan Maw - Starbucks Corp.","And, Matt, what I would say on second quarter is I'd look back at the first quarter. We delivered a 3% comp and we met our guidance, and I would say over a quarter or a short period, we can continue to do that. Over the longer term, which includes the long-term guidance for this year, we need to get back up into the mid-single digits.","Matthew DiFrisco - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Charles \u2013 sorry, Andrew Charles from Cowen.

You talked at the Investor Day about 23% less attachment in mobile orders relative to traditional orders. So, I just wanted to talk about the check lift you've seen so far suggestive selling efforts have been implemented, and if this is meeting or exceeding your expectations.","Howard S. Schultz - Starbucks Corp.","Yeah, we are just at the beginning right now, so we don't have any numbers to report at this point in time, but we're highly encouraged by what we're seeing, because for the first time in the context of Mobile Order & Pay, we have what our baristas normally do, which is to suggest something that's relevant to the customer at that point in time. Early indications are quite positive, but it literally is weeks old so we don't have any numbers that we wanted to share at this point.","Scott Harlan Maw - Starbucks Corp.","There's definitely reason for optimism. We've talked about this before. The total check on Mobile Order & Pay transactions is basically equal to other Starbucks Rewards transactions before suggestive selling. And when Matt and I set the business case, we expected it to be significantly below, because we thought attach would be soft until we could get into this capability, so I think it portends well for as we get suggestive selling going, given the fact that the ticket is almost equal, we think there's some upside there.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Greg Francfort from Bank of America. Greg, your line is now open.","Gregory Paul Francfort - Bank of America","Hey, guys and Howard, I have tremendous respect for you, and I know you'd appreciated the comments. Just my question, on the food comments that you've done with the 1% component to comp, I think it's been that way for three quarters now, and it had been running maybe a year ago, closer to 2 to 3 points. Is there an opportunity to get back there, and I guess does it have to come from gaining some traction at lunch? Or can breakfast sales reaccelerate? I guess, how do you get back to a larger component from the food comp?","Kevin R. Johnson - Starbucks Corp.","Yeah, Greg, this is Kevin. I think consistent with, sort of, what we shared at Investor Day, the big opportunity for us to accelerate the contribution of food comp to their total comp is at lunch, and we continue to perform very well on the breakfast in the morning daypart with breakfast sandwiches in our bakery case, and the opportunity we see to reaccelerate comp contribution from food is at lunch. And I mentioned, we will \u2013 you will be seeing some new food items at lunch, and a new concept around a fresh, healthy culinary experience that we're going to be able to implement in our Starbucks stores in Chicago by this summer. And that is where we see the opportunity.","Operator","And that was our last question at this time. I now turn the call back over to Mr. Shaw.","Thomas Shaw - Starbucks Corp.","All right.

Good afternoon. This is JoAnn DeGrande, vice president of investor relations for Starbucks Coffee Company. Joining me on the call today from New York is Howard Schultz, chairman, president, and CEO, and with me here in Seattle are Jeff Hansberry, president of our channel development and emerging brands business and Troy Alstead, CFO.","Also available for the Q&A session are Cliff Burrows, president of Americas here in Seattle with us, and joining us from London is Michelle Gass, president of EMEA; and from Tokyo, John Culver, president of China\/Asia Pacific.  ","This conference will include forward-looking statements, which are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements. Any such statements should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements in our earnings release and the risk factor discussions in our filings with the SEC, including our last annual report on Form 10-K.","Starbucks assumes no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements or information. This conference call is being webcast and an archive of the webcast will also be available on our website.","Before I turn the call over to Howard, let me cover a few housekeeping matters. Today we filed an 8-K that outlined a few reporting changes, including the shift of certain G&A expenses from \u201cother\u201d to our four reporting segments. The results we\u2019ve reported today reflect these changes. ","We have also recapped full year results for fiscal 2010 through 2012, and have posted the recapped financials on our website. They should be there shortly.","Additionally, Starbucks\u2019 2013 annual meeting of shareholders will be held in Seattle at 10 am Pacific time on Wednesday, March 20. That meeting will be available via webcast as well. With that, let me turn the call over to Howard Schultz. Howard?","Howard Schultz","JoAnn, thank you, and good afternoon to everyone on today\u2019s call. I am very pleased to report the record first quarter fiscal 2013 results Starbucks announced today: strong global comp store sales growth with comps of 7% in the U.S. and in the Americas, record quarterly revenues of $3.8 billion, and increase in our total company operating margin to 16.6% and a record earnings of $0.57 per share, the highest quarterly EPS in Starbucks history. ","Noteworthy is that Starbucks\u2019 record Q1 results were delivered against a backdrop of weak consumer confidence and an overall weak global economy. With nearly 70 million customers visiting our more than 18,000 stores on seven continents in 61 countries each week, Starbucks\u2019 Q1 results demonstrate the strength, unique resilience, and increasing relevance of our global business and brand. ","And the momentum we have built coming into Q2 ideally positions us to kick our growth plans into high gear and to deliver increased profits to our shareholders in 2013 and beyond, as we continue to execute against our blueprint for profitable growth and plans for adding thousands of net new stores over the next five years. ","Not evident from record operating results alone are the facts that in Q1 we also drove significant, relevant product and beverage innovation and provided an enhanced in-store experience to customers around the world and implemented strategic operating improvements throughout the organization to streamline the business and deliver increased operating efficiencies into the future, all while delivering the strongest holiday performance in Starbucks\u2019 42-year history.","I\u2019ll touch on a few of these developments and then turn the call over to Jeff Hansberry, President of Channel Development and Emerging Brands, and then on to Troy.","As I\u2019ve said many times over the years, core to Starbucks\u2019 success are our store partners, our ability to attract, develop, and retain the very best people in our industry, and our ability to create inspired moments for our customers. I\u2019m delighted to report that our U.S. partners achieved record levels of productivity in Q1, an extraordinary accomplishment given the high volume of customer traffic and thousands of Verismo demonstrations in our stores during the holiday season.","To my partners around the world, I say thank you for all you do to bring the Starbucks experience to life in our stores and for our customers every day, and particularly for your hard work and effort that enabled us to deliver the results we announced today. On a personal note, I also could not be more proud of the fact that last week Starbucks was recognized for the 15th year by Fortune Magazine as one of the 100 best companies to work for. ","Despite what for many retailers was a lackluster holiday season, Starbucks\u2019 holiday exceeded our own expectations with successful promotions including the \u201c12 Days of Gifting\u201d the return of Christmas Blend, and a fresh take on gifting with our well-received lines of limited edition holiday merchandise.","This season, and for the first time, a Starbucks card was perhaps the nation\u2019s single most frequently given holiday gift, with one in 10 U.S. adults receiving a Starbucks card and $2 million worth of our exclusive first-ever steel Starbucks card selling out on Internet luxury goods retailer Gilt.com in only, believe it or not, six minutes.","The Americas segment comp store sales increased 7%, driven by a 4% increase in traffic. Within the American segment, our U.S. business delivered revenue growth of 9% and and outstanding comp growth of 7%, driven largely by increased food and beverage sales and robust holiday activity, driven by significant robust traffic.","The U.S. remains a market rife with growth opportunity for Starbucks, and we will profitability capitalize on this opportunity by adding 1,500 new stores in the U.S. market and renovating thousands of existing stores in a locally relevant, energy efficient, and environmentally responsible way over the next five years. ","Roughly 60% of our new U.S. stores will be drive-through locations. Drive-throughs create incremental revenues and profits compared to traditional stores, and represent a fast-growing, highly profitable format for Starbucks, comprising just over one-third of our U.S. company-operated stores, but contributing nearly 45% of our U.S. retail profit. And we are investing in this high-margin store format with innovations that will further elevate the customer experience, our brand, by enhancing drive-through efficiency and consistency of service. ","Since our acquisition of La Boulange, we\u2019ve been testing in the San Francisco Bay Area, and we continue to see an opportunity to exceed plan and drive incremental food sales and attachment. With the 40 Starbucks test stores currently carrying the La Boulange bakery assortment, we\u2019re experiencing a lift in both pastry and total food sales, and we are on plan to introduce the La Boulange bakery assortment to the Starbucks stores throughout the Bay Area and in Seattle, Los Angeles, Chicago, and New York City in fiscal 2013.","Starbucks\u2019 China and Asia-Pacific segment now spans 12 countries that by the end of fiscal 2013 will grow to nearly 4,000 stores, including 1,000 stores in Japan and 500 in Korea. China-Asia Pacific continued to deliver in Q1, with a strong 11% increase in comp store sales marking our 12th consecutive quarter of double digit comps in that region.","We started our journey in China with our first store in Beijing in 1999, and in Q1 we celebrated the opening of our 100th store in that extraordinary city. China remains Starbucks\u2019 most significant market opportunity in this region, and is well on its way to becoming our second-largest global market in 2014. Today we are proud to operate over 700 stores in mainland China, and we are on plan to have 1,500 Starbucks stores in over 70 cities across China in 2015. ","In India, we continue to be awed by the overwhelming customer response to our first four stores in Mumbai, and are eagerly anticipating the opening of our first store in Delhi next month. And in early February, we will open our first Vietnam store in Ho Chi Minh City.","I was in the region last week, and saw firsthand the execution against the turnaround of our EMEA segment, and it\u2019s well underway. We are driving increased customer and brand relevancy and at the same time, we are updating our growth model for this segment, and we\u2019re beginning to see tangible benefits of these initiatives. ","In fact, despite the worst economic retail climate in decades, and one that has been disproportionately impacting high-end retailers, I\u2019m proud to share with you that Starbucks\u2019 retail transactions in the EMEA region increased in Q1 compared to Q1 of fiscal 2012. ","Building connections and providing our customers with a meaningful value proposition also continued to be among our top priorities across this region. Towards those ends, in Q1 we successfully launched the Starbucks card and the Starbucks Rewards loyalty program in Germany, and introduced promotions including our holiday beverage lineup and \u201c12 Days of Gifting\u201d throughout the region, all of which were well-received and contributed to our success in the quarter.","Licensing will be the centerpiece of our approach to growth and long term profitability in EMEA, and in Q1 we continued to see the strategy play out successfully. At quarter\u2019s end, we had over 1,000 licensed stores in the region, up 12% from a year ago, and we are seeing fantastic customer response and increasing customer demand and acceptance as we extend our retail footprint beyond the high street.","Starbucks\u2019 business outside of the U.K. and Continental Europe, where we currently operate nearly 500 stores, continued to thrive in Q1, with strong comp growth in key markets including the Middle East, Turkey, and Russia, with our long term, 15-year partner, Alsea. ","We opened a stunning new 45,000 square foot flagship store in the Kuwait Avenues mall that celebrates local design culture and offers a truly unique premium coffee experience in the region\u2019s first Clover and Starbucks Reserve coffee selections.","In Russia, we entered St. Petersburg, our first city outside of Moscow, and the stores are performing ahead of plan, demonstrating once again the strength, the relevancy, and unique appeal of the Starbucks brand across the region. We remain committed to creating a long term, sustainable and profitable business across EMEA and our solid performance in Q1 gives us confidence that we are very much on track to fulfilling that commitment.","Our channel development and our emerging brands team is bringing significant innovation to the coffee, tea, and health and wellness categories. Jeff will be joining us later in the call to discuss several exciting developments in this segment in detail, so I\u2019ll just touch on a few highlights.","In September, as you well know, we launched the revolutionary Verismo system by Starbucks online, and in October we extended distribution to include nearly 2,000 specialty retailers and over 4,000 Starbucks stores in the U.S. We intentionally limited distribution to a select subset of specialty retailers to establish the brand at the high end in the marketplace. ","Going forward, we will drive adoption through a combination of pod and machine innovation and selective retail expansion throughout 2013. To date, well over 1 million customers have had the opportunity to sample a high-quality Starbucks latte or brewed coffee made with the Verismo machine at one of our many product demonstrations at either a specialty retailer or a Starbucks store.","With more than 150,000 Verismo machines sold since launch, Verismo is off to an exceptional start as we build, enhance, and expand what we are confident will be a multi-billion dollar premium single-serve platform in the months and years ahead.","At the same time, single-serve and VIA sales in Q1 were fueled by a number of popular new introductions, including Starbucks Peppermint Mocha VIA, Pumpkin Spice VIA, and VIA Refreshers, as well as Anniversary Blend K-cups and Christmas Blend K-cups. Jeff will speak more about momentum and opportunities in our single-serve business in a moment. ","On December 31, we closed our highly strategic acquisition of premium tea brand Teavana, making Teavana, a wholly owned subsidiary of Starbucks and the newest addition to our emerging brand portfolio. Together with our new partner at Teavana, Starbucks will apply and leverage our deep knowledge of retail operations, beverage development and preparation, and our social and digital media loyalty card and mobile expertise to attract more customers to Teavana stores. ","And we will expand Teavana\u2019s current 300-store footprint from largely mall-based stores to urban street locations, where Starbucks obviously has very strong capabilities and ultimately we will reinvent the tea category, just as we did the coffee category 40 years ago. ","Teavana is the perfect complement to Starbucks\u2019 current billion dollar plus Tazo brand, and will enable us to further extend our leadership position in the $40-billion global tea market. Earlier this quarter, we opened our first Tazo retail store in Seattle to serve as a learning laboratory and help us understand everything from what types of hand-crafted tea beverages customers wanted to see from us, to help us to create a meaningful and differentiated retail tea experience for customers. Our plans are to apply all of these learnings to our Teavana rollout in terms of the success and enduring opportunities we have for that company. ","In the health and wellness space, Evolution Fresh is leading innovation and development of the cold crafted juice category. Since our acquisition of Evolution Fresh, we\u2019ve redesigned the packaging, strengthened the brand positioning, and created four retail conceptual stores. And today, we\u2019re seeing growth in our Evolution Fresh business across the board.","Coffee will always be at the very core of Starbucks\u2019 business, and our commitment to innovating and growing our share of the global coffee market is unwavering. Starbucks\u2019 Blonde Roast is an example of this commitment. In response to customer demand for super-premium coffee with a lighter note, we introduced Blonde Roast one year ago, and today Blonde is driving growth across all channels and Starbucks has emerged as a leader in the $1 billion light coffee segment.","Sales of packaged Blonde Roast were 70% incremental at Starbucks retail stores, and 79% incremental in grocery channels in the last year. And we are continuing to find new ways to reach customers who prefer a lighter roast, with Vanilla Blonde, our first hand-crafted brewed coffee offering in our retail stores, as we speak today.  ","In response to strong customer demand, we are also continuing to expand availability of our rare and exotic Starbucks Reserve coffees, and are on track to increase the number of stores offering Starbucks Reserve by approximately 200 in fiscal 2013. Our customers love our reserve Starbucks offerings, as demonstrated by the fact that a very rare Costa Rica Geisha Reserve coffee offered online in early December at $40 per half pound sold completely out in 24 hours. ","We look forward to adding more rare and exotic coffees to our unique Starbucks Reserve lineup for our customers to savor in the months ahead as we reaffirm, day in and day out, our leadership position in all things coffee.","Another very significant Q1 highlight was the continued growth and success of our digital business and mobile initiatives. Starbucks digital strategy is, and will remain, a key driver of our increasingly global business as we leverage all of our proprietary capabilities and connect with more customers all around the world in the future. ","Our Starbucks card is more popular than ever today, accounting for 25% of U.S. tender, and an increasing portion of Starbucks card transactions and sales are being paid by using our mobile payment apps, with mobile payments now accounting for nearly 20% of overall card transactions. Over 7 million customers now use one of our mobile payment apps, translating into 2.1 million mobile payment transactions each week, with hundreds of thousands of additional Starbucks mobile app downloads each week.","In terms of what happened in holiday in Starbucks card, I must say it was stunning and almost unbelievable. Our Starbucks card had its best holiday season in history, as measured by any metric, with more than $1 billion loaded during Q1, the most ever loaded onto any kind of Starbucks card. Mobile e-gifting also delivered record holiday results, with the most popular days for e-gifting being Christmas Eve and Christmas Day.","With performance enhanced by the integration of our mobile strategies and our unique ability to send messages directly to our customers\u2019 mobile in-boxes. And our ecommerce sales also broke holiday records, as revenues doubled and we offered online sales in Canada, the U.K., Germany, and France for the first time.","We\u2019re very excited about the strong customer response and tremendous future opportunities presented by the integration of our mobile, web, card, and loyalty program strategies. The combination of these capabilities enabled us to accelerate growth in our My Starbucks Rewards program. And this is another unique fact, in which we added 1.4 million members in Q1 of 2013, an 86% increase over the 778,000 new members we had in Q1 of last year.","I\u2019m very pleased that our My Starbucks Rewards program was recently named the \u201cMobile Program of the Year\u201d by Mobile Marketer, an award that reflects Starbucks\u2019 focus on innovation and driving customer engagement.","As our Q1 results demonstrate, the momentum we\u2019ve built throughout 2012 carried through holiday and into Q1 in 2013, but we are just getting started, and only beginning to see the benefits of the convergence of our retail, CPG, and social and digital media initiatives.","Think about this. We had 86% more customers sign up for a My Starbucks Rewards card in the first quarter of 2013 than in the first quarter of 2012. And it\u2019s not that these new card customers didn\u2019t know where to find us last year. It\u2019s that we are more deeply connected, and even more relevant, to them than any other time in our history. And we can very accurately anticipate the increased traffic and revenue that will flow from the accelerating card acceptance and activity, which we\u2019ve already seen in calendar Q1.","We remain committed to attaining leadership in the single-serve category, and I can tell you today that with Verismo we are in the nascent stage of building a multi-billion dollar platform for Starbucks over the long term. And we are in it for the long term. We will achieve our goals around single serve by leveraging the full power of the Starbucks brand and our unique partner, digital, and global store footprint assets in continuing to expand our distribution channels.","But more importantly, we will continue to innovate and to transform the premium single serve category while continuing to surprise and delight our customers along the way. Look for some very exciting innovations to come this very year.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Jeff Hansberry, who will take you through the Q1 results of our channel development segment, and share additional detail around what\u2019s to come in this dynamic growth area for our company. Jeff? ","Jeff Hansberry","Thank you, Howard, and good afternoon everyone. I\u2019m pleased to join you on the call today to discuss Q1 results for channel development in emerging brands, as well as give you some additional insight into what\u2019s coming in the quarters and years ahead.","Channel development revenue in our first fiscal quarter grew 13% to $380 million. It was the highest revenue quarter we\u2019ve ever had, led by continued growth of K-cups, the first stages of launching our Verismo platform, and continued growth in roast and ground coffee.","Our top to bottom line translation was also very good in Q1. We grew profit twice as fast as sales in the quarter, even after a significant investment in Verismo. Operating margin expanded by 230 basis points in Q1, up to 25.5%. Favorable coffee-related costs, along with continued strength in our North American coffee partnership, helped to fuel the growth. ","Our partnership with Pepsi is thriving, and we plan to grow Starbucks\u2019 share of the massive ready-to-drink category with the expansion of Starbucks Refreshers beverages, the introduction of our new line of Starbucks iced coffee in a new, iconic single-serve glass bottle, which is rolling out as we speak in select U.S. markets.","We will have national presence by April, just in time for the warmer months. But know that nearly 50% of iced coffee drinkers actually enjoy iced coffee year round. We will now be very well-positioned to serve the rapidly expanding demand for iced coffee in the U.S. In fact, now, one in five beverages sold in Starbucks retail stores is a cold coffee beverage.","Turning our attention to other coffee formats, I want to discuss the premium single cup category and the recent milestones achieved across our product lines. VIA Ready Brew continues its solid performance, growing 16% in the food, drug, and mass space in the quarter. VIA Refreshers has been available and very popular in retail stores over the past six months, and we\u2019re excited to make them available at CPG beginning this quarter.","K-cups were the largest contributor to channel development revenue in Q1, as we sold more than 175 million cups across the company in the quarter. And then there is Verismo, which saw strong retail support and customer interest, with more than 150,000 machines sold across all channels since launch.","Q1 marked the beginning of what we expect will be a significant and sustained expansion of Verismo in the quarters and years to come. We will expand distribution, adding both new doors and new countries to the platform. We will add new products, including many Starbucks favorite beverages across coffee, tea, and more to the platform. And we will add new machines, with additional functionality and style elements that will help us to drive adoption of the platform.","Rolling all of this up, in the U.S. food, drug, and mass channels in the past 13 weeks, we have grown our total premium coffee business by 28% versus prior year. That\u2019s 11% faster than total U.S. premium coffee category, and nearly four times faster than the entire U.S. coffee category.","As a result, we have grown our share of the total U.S. coffee category to 12.6%, 220 basis points higher than a year ago. And encouragingly, as our internal analytics and these numbers suggest, we are seeing little cannibalization of our roast and ground coffee from our success in premium single cup.","The expansion of Starbucks Blonde Roast, now in its second year, will be one of the growth drivers of packaged coffee going forward. This growth will be supported by marketing in our retail stores, through our social and digital channels, and through our biggest-ever multichannel marketing and demonstration campaign in CPG, starting this month. It is truly our blueprint for growth in action, and will introduce millions of potential new Starbucks customers to Blonde Roast.","Beyond Blonde Roast, we will introduce new varieties of K-cups later this year, and as mentioned earlier, new varieties of Verismo pods as well.","Now I\u2019d like to talk about the new organization that we have just finished building, branded solutions. This organization combines the capabilities of food service with our expertise in licensed stores, allowing us for the first time to create a single one-voice solution to reach our customers across a number of channels, from hotels to offices to colleges to hospitals. ","Now, each development manager can present an account or prospective account with a full portfolio of offerings, including Starbucks, Seattle\u2019s Best, Tazo, and Evolution Fresh, and provide a complete solution, from a food service and licensed store perspective, all supported by one relationship management, all supported by a high-quality Starbucks experience for the customer. It is a breakthrough that will come to life in 2013.","The next significant growth engine in the emerging brand portfolio is tea, which is fueled by both Tazo and Teavana. The Teavana acquisition closed on December 31, and we are embarking on the next chapter of a journey that we believe will reinvent the way the world enjoys tea, just as Starbucks did decades ago for coffee.","By the end of the year, we expect to add over 30 new Teavana stores, including the opening of our first neighborhood store, which will combine both an expanded hand-crafted tea experience with merchandise and loose tea. Down the road, we intend to offer an enhanced range of hand-crafted beverages into our mall-based stores as well.","In the near term, our priorities are integrating the company and employees, now our partners, sharing and learning about each company\u2019s respective culture and importantly, maintaining our focus on delivering our plan for the balance of the year.","While it has been less than four weeks since the acquisition closed, our integration work makes us as excited as ever about the opportunity, and we\u2019ll share more details as we move along.","Tazo continues to perform in the super premium packaged tea space, growing by over 30% across all forms in the quarter. The brand continues to be the share leader in the super premium filter bag space, with a 28.6 share in the most recent 13 weeks ended December 30, up 160 basis points from prior year.","Now, from tea to juice, where Evolution Fresh is leading the development of the $3.4 billion premium cold-crafted juice category. We continue to build the brand through a new distribution and are now in nearly 4,000 Starbucks and natural and grocery stores in the western U.S. We are on track to open our new state of the art juicery in late spring, which will further allow us to grow our plan to be in approximately 8,000 stores by the end of the year.","In closing, 2013 is off to a strong start, with much more on the horizon. We plan to continue demonstrating strong revenue growth while expanding margin. We will do it through innovation, both around new platforms and new SKUs. We\u2019ll do it through growth of a best-in-class portfolio of existing products. We will leverage unmatched cross-channel marketing and promotional capabilities, and we will rely on the expertise and passionate commitment of the more than 500 channel development partners around the world who continually exceed expectations.","With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Troy Alstead. Troy? ","Troy Alstead","Thank you, Jeff. As Howard indicated in his opening remarks, this holiday season was Starbucks best-ever, and the proficiency with which our store partners delivered daily world-class experiences again drove record results in the Americas.","First quarter Americas revenues totaled $2.8 billion, growing 10% over last year. The largest driver of our revenue growth continues to be strong comparable store sales, which reached 7% in Q1, with a 4% lift in transactions and a 2% increase in average ticket.","In the U.S., comps mirrored those of the Americas region. Our U.S. productivity continues to climb, as we saw more transactions per labor hour this quarter than in any other quarter in our company\u2019s history. That allowed us to [lift] [ph] daily transactions per store to over 700 for the first time, as we continue to expand capacity and grow transactions across all day parts.","Also fueling our strong comp growth were our fall promotional beverages, headlined by pumpkin spice latte, combined with our always popular holiday beverage offerings. Combined, these added more than a percentage point of comp growth. ","A significant increase in food sales, and a favorable shift in food mix, as breakfast sandwiches and our improved lunch offerings continues to resonate with our customers, also added more than 1 percentage point of comp.","Verismo contributed approximately a half point of comp in Q1, leveraging the successful demonstration and sampling efforts of our store partners.","The first quarter in the U.S. started strong and ended strong, with comp growth in December mirroring the full-quarter result. As we exited the first quarter, the momentum in the business, combined with the record volume of Starbucks cards loaded during the holiday period, is fueling early Q2 sales trends. ","Comp growth in the first few weeks of January is trending consistent with the first quarter. Operating income in the Americas segment reached a record $590 million in the first quarter, while operating margin contracted 50 basis points to 20.8%. ","There were a few anomalies that led to the margin contraction, including our October global leadership conference, which impacted margin by 90 basis points, increased litigation charges, which had a 70 basis point impact, and 30 basis points due to the impact of Superstorm Sandy. The phenomenal execution by departments across the region largely offset these unusual cost pressures in the quarter.","Now, in China and Asia-Pacific, a combination of solid performance from our existing store base, and rapid new store development, led to record revenue on profit. Revenue growth was 28%, an increase over last quarter\u2019s 23% growth. A portion of this was due to comparable store sales, which grew 11%, with 8% growth in transactions and a 3% increase in average ticket. Two-year comps remained above 30%, an exceptional accomplishment considering the uncertainty that has entered parts of the region over the past year. ","We saw very successful holiday promotions in many of our CAP markets, with seasonal beverages driving sales growth over the same period last year. In addition, the Starbucks card was an extremely popular item in CAP in Q1, which bodes well for the future.","Howard spoke in his comments about the success of the Starbucks card and our loyalty program globally, and in CAP these are meaningful drivers of strong comps. In fact, 29% of transactions in Thailand, and 27% of transactions in Singapore, are paid for with a Starbucks card, levels that exceed those in the U.S., where Starbucks card has been available for much longer.","And as our loyalty program expands globally, it is apparent that is relevancy is universal. In China, for instance, we already have 1.3 million My Starbucks Rewards members. Loyalty to the Starbucks brand continues to grow in this part of the world, directly contributing to our rapid top line growth.","The largest contributor to our CAP Q1 revenue growth was the addition of 125 net new stores in the quarter, and 452 net new stores over the past year. Half of these new stores are in China, where we continue to aggressively pursue high-quality, profitable real estate. ","As I discussed last quarter, this [unintelligible] does have a temporary detrimental impact to operating margin, and, combined with the mix shift toward a more company operated store portfolio, accounted for more than the 50 basis point Q1 decline in CAP margin.  ","Partially offsetting this was lower performance-based compensation. While performance is still very strong in the region, we are lapping the first quarter of 2012, when the CAP region performed significantly better than the operating plan for that period. Profitability remains robust and continues to accelerate quickly in the region, as the $72 million of CAP operating income in the first quarter was a record, and represented 26% growth over last Q1.","In EMEA, revenue, operating income, and operating margin all expanded in the first quarter, as the team coupled solid traffic growth with continued focus on cost discipline. Record revenues of $306 million represented growth of 1% over last Q1, driven by 41% growth in licensed store revenue and 27% growth in our food service business.","As Howard stated, we continue to see strong strong growth in many of our other licensed markets, as our partnerships continue to thrive and provide a meaningful contribution to our success. ","The strong growth in licensed and food service was largely offset by a decline in company-operated revenue of 4%. That reduction was due to the loss of revenue resulting from the sale of the Ireland store portfolio and U.K. airport stores to a licensed partner, and closures of unprofitable stores as part of our Q4 store portfolio optimization.","A decline in comparable store sales of 1%, driven by a 3% reduction in average ticket, also contributed.","The lower average ticket was driven by beverage mix shifts and reductions in add-on purchases such as food, suggesting a trade-down impact of consumer spending, driven by the economic challenges in the region. ","Encouragingly, traffic grew by 2% in the quarter, the highest rate of traffic growth EMEA has delivered in a year, as we are seeing traction on our efforts to demonstrate that Starbucks serves the best latte on the high street. ","I our largest market, the U.K., we offered pumpkin spice latte for the first time, with tremendous success. Holiday beverages had a record year across the region, and the launch of the Starbucks card, and in this past year My Starbucks Rewards, in the U.K., Germany, and other markets in this region, as well as targeted value offers, played a key role in maintaining the loyalty of our core customers.","EMEA operating income of $22 million grew by 18% over the last Q1. Operating margin expanded 110 basis points to 7.3%, the second-highest quarterly operating margin ever for EMEA, as a result of continued defocus on cost efficiencies, which drove strong leverage on our licensed stores revenue growth.","The strong first quarter results in each of our operating segments contributed toward a record-setting performance on a consolidated basis. Revenue growth of 11% led to record total net revenues of $3.8 billion in the first quarter. The growth was driven by a 6% increase in global comparable store sales, including an increase in transactions of 4% and an increase in average ticket at 2%.","This was a truly outstanding holiday season around the globe. Consolidated operating income grew 13% to a record $631 million in the first quarter. As I mentioned during the Americas discussion, there were a few unusual items impacting the quarter\u2019s results, which had an unfavorable 140-basis point impact on consolidated operating margin.","However, strong sales leverage, and to a lesser extent the expected 50-basis point impact of favorable commodity costs, more than offset the unusual cost pressures, driving consolidated operating margin higher by 40 basis points to 16.6%.","We also set a record for earnings per share in the first quarter, growing 14% to $0.57. Our earnings include two additional unusual items of note. We reported a lower than usual tax rate in Q1 of 30.4%. As we expected, and was factored into our tax rate guidance for fiscal \u201913, we recognized an $18 million benefit primarily from state income tax expense adjustments for returns filed in prior years.","Conversely, this quarter we reported a $26 million reduction over last Q1, in interest income [and other], which includes mark-to-market adjustments related to commodity hedges, unfavorable foreign currency, and decreased unrealized gains in the trading securities portfolio of our management deferred compensation plan. The impact of movement in the trading securities portfolio is offset in general and administrative expenses as the compensation plan liability fluctuates with investment performance. ","Also of note, Starbucks repurchased 8 million shares of stock during the first quarter. This leaves approximately 29 million shares authorized as available for repurchase. The combination of these repurchases, along with a $0.21 per share dividend, resulted in more than  $500 million returned to shareholders in the first quarter, which is more than the first three quarters of last year combined.","It was a fantastic first quarter by nearly every measure. We exited the quarter with everything squarely on track, which is why we are reaffirming our financial targets for fiscal 2013, which I announced on our Q4 FY12 earnings call in early November.","These include strong EPS growth of 15-20%, revenue growth in the range of 10-13%, global comparable store strong growth in the mid-single digits, consolidated operating margin targeted at approximately 100 basis points, 1,300 net new stores globally, capital expenditures totaling approximately $1.2 billion, and a tax rate of 33%.","One item not factored into our targets, but worthy of mention, is the pending [craft] arbitration ruling. While there has been no ruling or resolution yet, and no change for expectations, we do anticipate resolution later in the second quarter. ","This was the best holiday season and first quarter in the history of Starbucks, setting the stage for another strong year. The record results of the first quarter once again demonstrate our ability to drive growth in revenue and earnings in the current quarter while planting the seeds for growth into the future.","Our store partners are delivering great coffee and great experiences to our customers every day, and doing it with higher levels of productivity than ever before. We have a deep pipeline of innovative products, diverse channels and geographies for growth, and strong execution and financial discipline. We enter the second quarter with great momentum, and are well-positioned to deliver our growth targets for the year. ","With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to the operator for Q&A. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions.] Your first question comes from the line of John Ivankoe from JPMorgan. Your line is open. ","John Ivankoe \u2013 JPMorgan","First, if we could review what your remodel strategy is for fiscal \u201913, how significant that could be and what you\u2019ve been seeing in the control sample in terms of what the performance of those stores are versus the stores that you haven\u2019t done. And secondly, and I think it\u2019s short, when might you have an opportunity to put Evolution products or Teavana products as part of the hand-crafted beverage line within Starbucks? I think that might be a very big opportunity for innovation around your product line. If you could discuss when that could possibly be. ","Troy Alstead","I\u2019m going to ask Cliff Burrows to speak first, to the remodel strategy, and then he\u2019ll start the discussion about Evolution and Teavana in Starbucks stores. And then Jeff Hansberry here will be part of that discussion as well. Cliff?","Cliff Burrows","With regard to refurbishments this year, and I\u2019ll talk specifically to the largest market of the U.S., we\u2019ll do the same number of refurbishments plus or minus as we did last year, as I shared in December when we met in New York. Where we have done major refurbishments, we have seen significant improvement in the capacity we\u2019ve built in that store, and the additional opportunities to introduce Clover, for example, have all seen significant lifts. And our strategy around minor refurbishments carries on as it always has been. That\u2019s about putting the store back in a good state. So really no changes there, and if I hand it to Jeff around development of hand-crafted beverages\u2026  ","Howard Schultz","Cliff, why don\u2019t you be specific about how many stores we plan on touching in the balance of the fiscal year? ","Cliff Burrows","It will be about 1,400 stores that we will cover this year, and that will be a mixture, 60-40, of minor to major. That sort of magnitude. About 500 major refurbishments this year. Jeff? ","Jeff Hansberry","Thank you. So in terms of Evolution Fresh and Teavana entering Starbucks stores, as we\u2019ve talked before, this is a critical element to our blueprint for growth strategy. And so from an Evolution Fresh standpoint, we have already started moving the Evolution Fresh brand into Starbucks stores, and in fact now we\u2019re in over 2,400 Starbucks stores, primarily in the western U.S. ","And as our new juicery comes online, that will give us additional capacity to begin to move east in this year. So we\u2019ll continue to expand Evolution into Starbucks stores, and also into the natural and premium grocery segment as that brand continues to expand. We\u2019ve had great results so far.","With regard to Teavana, we\u2019re less than four weeks into the integration, but we have said all along that Teavana beverages will play a role in Starbucks stores. We\u2019ll come back with more details in the coming quarter, as we develop that plan. But Teavana will play in Starbucks over time. ","John Ivankoe \u2013 JPMorgan","And the question was really not just on ready to drink, but also the hand-crafted beverages potentially, that you could do with those sub-brands. ","Cliff Burrows","I would say yes, the potential is there. Our priority is to roll out the Evolution bottled juices across the U.S. and let Jeff do his work on the integration of Teavana. More to follow on that. Nothing to show at this time. ","Troy Alstead","I think the one last thing I\u2019d add, John, is the key theme here is that these acquisitions and both product platforms absolutely offer us opportunity to raise drink across multiple channels and hand-crafted, and is something that in the right sequence of brand development and integration and roll out of these products, you will see us pursue those opportunities, and it\u2019s part of what gives us confidence in our ability over multiple quarters and multiple years to continue to drive strong same-store sales growth for our system.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Palmer from UBS. Your line is open. ","David Palmer \u2013 UBS","First question on China. It seems like your same-store sales is remarkably stable. How would you characterize the consumer environment there? And secondly, with regard to the Starbucks card loads, Howard mentioned a statistic there. I didn\u2019t quite catch that. How much do the dollar loads grow year over year in that quarter? ","Howard Schultz","John, are you on the line from Japan? Can you answer the question about China? ","John Culver","Sure. First off, we\u2019re extremely pleased with the continued momentum of our business in China, both in terms of the performance of the existing stores as well as the new store growth that we\u2019re seeing. And as I said, more and more of our growth is coming from the new store base, and less so from comp sales. ","Our comp sales have remained strong, and when you look at it on a two-year basis, comps are in the mid-30s. And on a three-year basis, comp sales are up into the 60s. So we feel very good about what\u2019s happening with the consumer as it relates to the Starbucks brand. There\u2019s no doubt that you\u2019ve seen some shift with other businesses and other companies in China. ","But for us, our traffic in our stores remains very strong, our transaction growth continues to grow. The card, in terms of the adaptation of the Starbucks card, we\u2019re now at 1.4 million customers. And that continues to accelerate, and that\u2019s just over a year old. And we continue to be very encouraged about the innovation that we\u2019re bringing into our stores, the way that the customers are reacting to that, and how they\u2019re embracing the Starbucks experience. ","Troy Alstead","And Dave, to your question about the Starbucks card, there was a 25% increase in Starbucks card value loaded in the first quarter over the prior year. What\u2019s critical about that is that clearly is a very strong level by itself, significantly outpaces the growth in the overall business, and is exactly a harbinger for that future growth as those values loaded not only introduce new customers onto the platform but deepen the loyalty, create that frequency opportunity as we move through the balance of this year and into the future.","Howard Schultz","I would just add that I believe that we are in the nascent stage of being able to leverage and integrate social, digital, mobile, our investment with Square, and the loyalty program into a very significant and robust opportunity going forward. And the question that was asked about Teavana in terms of products, you know, at some point there\u2019s a natural opportunity as part of the integration to take those assets, drive incremental traffic into Teavana, benefitting from the ubiquity of Starbucks and the trust and loyalty in that program.","Operator","[Operator instructions.] Your next question comes from the line of Sharon Zackfia from William Blair. Your line is open.","Sharon Zackfia - William Blair","I had a follow up question on China. It looks like the rate of investment in the stores continues to accelerate beyond the revenue growth in the company on units. I was just wondering, what are you doing in the stores that\u2019s obviously facilitating great same-store sales. But if you can give us some sort of insight into the investment you\u2019re putting in those four walls, as that store operating expense continues to ramp. ","Howard Schultz","John, would you speak to the investment trend? ","John Culver","Sure. Sharon, I think it\u2019s important that the investments that we\u2019re making are going to set the foundation for the future in terms of the success of the stores, and of the market overall. So when you look at the investments we\u2019re making it\u2019s obviously in the stores themselves, but more so from a people standpoint, in terms of ramping up the people, capability, that we\u2019re going to need to staff the new stores. And so with that, we\u2019re bringing on people, we\u2019re bringing them into existing stores, and we\u2019re training them to take over and run the new stores that we\u2019re opening.","In addition, the investments that you\u2019re also seeing in the stores have to do with the investments we\u2019re making around the design and how they are adapting into the local architecture, and making sure that we\u2019re differentiating ourselves in the marketplace in terms of the third place environment that we\u2019re creating for our customers.","So when you look at this, we are making the investments that we need to sustain the growth for the long term. I think what we\u2019re seeing is that the investments we\u2019re making in our people is paying off in terms of the experience that we\u2019re able to provide our customers, the speed that we\u2019re able to put them through the stores, and just the connection that we\u2019re able to build with them.","And then the investment that we\u2019re making from a physical store perspective is creating that third place environment that our customers want to come to, be a part of, and to experience overall.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Buckley from Bank of America. Your line is open.","Joe Buckley - Bank of America ","Can you comment on coffee costs year over year? Just what that cost looked like year over year this quarter, and what it might look like in coming quarters? And also could you fill out a little more on the 13% growth in the channel\u2019s development category? Food service obviously less, CPG more. And just talk about the components of that growth, and whether the lower coffee costs play a role in maybe restraining that revenue growth a bit. ","Troy Alstead","Sure. I\u2019ll speak to coffee costs and then I\u2019ll hand it to Jeff to talk about channel development growth. First, with regard to coffee, as we expected, we had approximately a net $0.02 per share benefit from commodities this quarter. That includes favorability in coffee, and then moderate unfavorability in dairy and a couple of other smaller commodities in our portfolio. So about $0.02 a share. Again, that\u2019s expected. That is 50 basis points to the total operating margin improvement in the first quarter. ","And I expect about that same $0.02 per share benefit from net commodity each quarter over the balance of the year. And again, that\u2019s all consistent with our previous targets. As we have discussed in the last few months, that amounts to about a net $100 million benefit to this fiscal year and given what we have lost in terms of pricing in fiscal \u201914 and also what we see in the coffee markets right now, we expect a similar level of $100 million benefit as we approach fiscal \u201914. So at least a couple of years of commodity tailwinds ahead of us.","Jeff, can you speak to channel development growth? ","Jeff Hansberry","With regard to channel development, as you noted, we grew at 13% in the first quarter. We continue to see positive growth ahead of retail average in channel development. Our packaged coffee business overall, when you look at premium single cup, as well as roast and ground, we\u2019re seeing significant growth in the quarter from an IRI standpoint. From a food service standpoint, less so. We\u2019re still growing faster than the food service segment, which is a material piece of our business. But that segment continues to grow more slowly than the balance of the category. ","Joe Buckley - Bank of America ","And Jeff, do all the coffee costs play into that revenue growth in one way or another? ","Jeff Hansberry","Well, we\u2019re continuing to see a lot of competition in the marketplace, but we think we are well-positioned to continue to grow our share and our business.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Tarantino from Robert W. Baird. Your line is open. ","David Tarantino - Robert W. Baird ","Troy, I have a question on the guidance for 2013, with respect to the margins. Up 100 basis points. Relative to what you reported in Q1, which was up 40, but you had quite a bit of unusual cost items in there. So I guess why wouldn\u2019t the 100 basis points be on the conservative side as you look at not having some of those unusual cost items in the coming quarters, or are there some potential offsets that maybe I\u2019m not thinking about? ","Troy Alstead","David, I appreciate your confidence in our ability to drive profit as we go forward. I would say that 40 basis points of improvement in the first quarter, and yes, that was net of some unusual pressures in this quarter. We believe that the guidance we have, which that 100 basis point improvement for the full year corresponds to the 15-20% earnings growth that we\u2019ve targeted, and that I believe we\u2019re right on track for. ","So I think with the investments we\u2019re making to drive the business, continued investments across our new growth platforms of La Boulange, of Verismo, of Evolution Fresh, while we are delivering quarterly earnings just as we did in Q1, we continue to lay that foundation for growth next year and the year after. ","And it\u2019s been that equation that this works so well for us and that we intend to navigate as we go through the rest of the year. So I think the guidance we have is remarkable in this environment and feel very confident in our ability to deliver against it as we approach Q2 and onward. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Keith Siegner from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. ","Keith Siegner \u2013 Credit Suisse","Troy, could you possibly remind us about the planned marketing spend, maybe as a percentage of sales for the year, how that compares year over year? And then maybe the quarterly cadence? Was 1Q with the Verismo launch above the annual spend, and Q2 with Blonde is that above 1Q and above the full year? Any details on that would be very helpful. Thanks. ","Troy Alstead","Sure. The marketing spend in this first quarter was a little higher than 4% of sales, which for Starbucks and our history is extremely high, perhaps among the highest we\u2019ve ever recorded in any one particular quarter. And as we talked about, I think, dating all the way back to July when we first [announced] our initial guidance, that\u2019s really primarily driven in this quarter by the launch of the Verismo platform and our investment against that, knowing that\u2019s a multiyear platform and proposition for us, and we wanted to set it off on the right foot.","As we progress through the balance of the year, I don\u2019t expect marketing spend as a percentage in any quarters to be at that same level as higher than 4%. So I expect it will be in the 3.5% to 4% range as we progress through the second quarter, third quarter, fourth quarter. Fairly consistent throughout the year as we approach introducing the customer and providing those messages to first Blonde and then other product platforms as we go throughout the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Glass from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. ","John Glass \u2013 Morgan Stanley","First, if I could just clarify, is channel development, the 13% growth we\u2019re seeing this quarter, is that representative roughly of the growth we should expect throughout the balance of the year? Or is there something you think materially changes that trajectory? I just wanted to clarify that from a previous question.","And in EMEA, you talked about the average check declining. What reverses that? I think you explained it has something to do with trade-down. Is this the first quarter you\u2019ve actually seen declines in average check there? Or has that been going on subtly, and it\u2019s just more exaggerated this quarter?  ","Troy Alstead","Thanks, John. This will be a good opportunity for us to ask Michelle Gass, our president of EMEA, to jump in. She\u2019s calling in from London. Michelle, can you speak to average ticket in the region? ","Michelle Gass","Absolutely. You know, I would say first off that we were really pleased and proud with our results for the quarter, seeing the kind of both revenue growth, especially in our licensed channel, which is our key focus and strategy going forward. Importantly, the margin expansion that Troy spoke to, despite the significant headwinds that continue to face the European customer. And then further, actually seeing transactions plus customer count growth of 2% for the quarter, and seeing that across our market. So again, given the headwinds, we\u2019re very, very pleased with that result. ","We did see a deeper erosion of ticket than we have been experiencing, so your question is relevant. And we saw it especially with everything happening on the retail high street, the downturn there, particularly acute pressure with consumers in our European markets. We\u2019re not, by the way, seeing that same pressure play out outside of Europe. It really is focused on the U.K. and Europe.","And we have continued focus, both in keeping our customers coming through loyalty programs, through relevant value, and then also working on increasing our food attach through food innovation programs and of course that beverage trade-down, focusing customers on our great assortment of beverages. We saw great response, as Troy mentioned, on pumpkin spice. Right now we\u2019re experiencing great customer demand on our innovation vanilla spice. And those initiatives will help us prop up our ticket. ","So it is a focus, but job number one is to keep our loyal customers, and keep that customer count growing. Thank you. ","Troy Alstead","I think Jeff can speak to the follow up on CPG growth? ","Jeff Hansberry","With regard to channel development growth of 13% in Q1, while we don\u2019t offer specific guidance on individual businesses, we expect that channel development will continue to grow at a rate faster than our average retail growth. Importantly, we have a number of initiatives that we\u2019re working against, and building. Everything from Evolution Fresh to our continued expansion of K-cups, to new flavors and SKUs in the VIA lineup. And importantly, we will continue to invest and grow and build over time the business that\u2019s in its very nascent stage that is Verismo.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein from Barclays. Your line is open. ","Jeffrey Bernstein \u2013 Barclays","Just two quick questions, the first one just on the Verismo, I guess as a follow up. And you talk about the launch in the holidays going well. I think you said 150,000. Just wondering if you can talk a little bit about how that tracked versus your expectation. Obviously it was a heavy investment quarter for it. But do you think there\u2019s obviously some time for this to build with the replacement cycle around Keurig? I\u2019m just wondering kind of the early feedback on Verismo and your outlook for growth over the next number of quarters.","And then separately, Troy, if you could just comment, I think the share repurchase I think you mentioned was 8 million shares, which would be roughly $400 million for the quarter. I\u2019m just wondering if you could frame that in terms of your thoughts on cash usage for fiscal \u201913, whether it be between [repo] and maintaining the dividend, versus capex, and whether we should assume that first quarter share purchase was an anomaly, or that type of run rate would be sustained.  ","Howard Schultz","Can I just start with an overall strategy about single-serve and Verismo, and Jeff, you can take it from there if it\u2019s okay with you. I think it\u2019s very important that you all understand that we are deeply, deeply committed to becoming the leader in this space domestically and internationally. We have plotted out a multiyear strategy about Verismo and an overall single-serve platform that will include multiple layers of innovation in the years to come. ","We feel very strongly that what Verismo demonstrated this holiday season was a great success for us. It met our expectations. We learned a great deal. We also saw a fair amount of discounting from our competitors in the market as a result of our entry, and the fact that we disrupted the market in the middle of the holiday season. ","The leverage and the asset that we have in our stores to both demonstrate, inform, and ultimately sell single-serve platform machines is an asset that is proprietary and nobody has, and we will continue to utilize that to our advantage. ","The other thing that I think is worth saying is that we already are seeing customers come back with the opportunity to merchandise and sell them pods as a result of Verismo being in 150,000 households. So we\u2019re already seeing an opportunity for incrementality there and we\u2019ll be adding more SKUs that are proprietary to Starbucks coffee. ","And so our commitment, our interest, our motivation to build on single-serve and build on Verismo is 100% and we are going to maintain a high level of commitment and investment in this, where we are going to be the global leader. Jeff? ","Jeff Hansberry","Exactly. In that first, our sales during our very first holiday, with a brand new to the world platform, were well in line with our expectations. And importantly, we started with a very curated small set of stores. So a select set of specialty retailers and a select set of Starbucks retail stores. ","And for us, we are not only encouraged by the customer response, but also the trade traction that has been created by a number of retailers who want to play on the platform, which we have not made available to them as yet.","So there are really three things that are going to be growth drivers for Verismo as we step forward. First, and importantly, the innovation itself. It\u2019s the first and only machine that does brewed coffee, espresso, and lattes. And that message got through to customers during the holiday.","And secondly, as we add innovation to the system, whether it\u2019s through additional coffees, additional espressos, additional Starbucks latte and seasonal favorite beverages, as well as tea, that will add to increase the interest in the platform.","And then finally, from a machine standpoint, we have a pipeline, to Howard\u2019s point, multi years of machine innovation, that adds new features, new styles, new functionality, to a whole series of machines that we will be introducing. ","So again, and importantly, this is just the very first step in what will be a multiyear growth driver, significant growth driver, in the channel business and for Starbucks overall. ","Troy Alstead","To your question about share repurchases, we\u2019re fortunate that the very strong cash flow of our business enables us to have the dividend, and we\u2019ve accelerated that dividend, as you know, each year since we\u2019ve initiated it. ","And also, share repurchases. We repurchased 8 million shares in the quarter. Our repurchase program is very valuation and conservatively valuation based. So our repurchases in any particular quarter are very opportunistic, based both on, again, what we see in the market and the valuation. ","And also, from time to time, where and when we as a company might be blacked out of the market, and that is frequent given various activities going on. So in any particular quarter, our share repurchase activity will be somewhat lumpy, again just based on those factors.  ","I would say our priority spend of cash for the balance of the year, and really every year, continues to be first and foremost investing back into the business. That\u2019s in our partners, in capital expenditures, in new stores and remodels. Of course, funding the dividend over time. And then based on those metrics and principles I outlined, share repurchases. ","So I don\u2019t have a prediction for you of whether that Q1 8 million shares is something that we\u2019d repeat each quarter or not. That, again, will tend to vary quarter to quarter. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sara Senatore from Sanford Bernstein. Your line is open. ","Sara Senatore \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","I have a two-part question on the Americas. The first is just in terms of comps, I know you highlighted a couple of things that were drivers, some of which were new, so Verismo, some of which have been around for a while, so food and some of your holiday beverages which are always very popular. So I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about to what extent the loyalty, or the Starbucks card, may have added to comps. If you can measure that. ","And then the other piece of this, was there anything about your mix or about any of the promotions you did that might have affected your margins? I ask only because you had some nice margin expansion on the cost of sales line, but maybe not quite as much as I would have expected given 50 basis points of commodities plus such healthy comps on which you would have seen occupancy leverage.","Troy Alstead","Let me hand it over to Cliff to speak about the comp drivers, and I think he\u2019ll also be able to speak to cost of goods and leverage a bit. In advance of that, I would just make the one comment that the large majority of those unusual expenses that I spoke about in the quarter, the leadership conference which we are known about, and then a couple of events that we had not know about until we got into the quarter, things like Superstorm Sandy and some of the unusual litigation expenses I mentioned, were predominantly focused in the Americas P&L. ","Absent those anomalies and those unusual cost pressures in the quarter, we would have been on more of our common pace of very significant and meaningful margin expansion in the quarter. ","Sara Senatore \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","Understood. I was just talking about the cost of sales line in particular.  ","Clifford Burrows","The quarter, we really saw a very healthy mix of our core beverages as well as our seasonal beverages. Very, very encouraged throughout the quarter how they performed. Our food continues to go from strength to strength, and I\u2019m really excited about what lies ahead of us with La Boulange. The holiday season, and that is both core coffee, with our Christmas Blend, and also our gifts this year, performed exceptionally well.","If I look at day parts, we have seen growth in all day parts. The early morning growing fastest, in terms of percentage, but we continue to add more transactions at our peak time, which again is a really healthy situation to be in.","And this is a mixture. It\u2019s coming from a mixture not only on product, but we continue to work on the operational effectiveness in stores and work we\u2019ve shared with you before around [Lean] [ph]. So building that capacity at peak remains a priority for us.","And bringing that all together, I have to say it\u2019s been the focus and dedication from our partners in the stores, who across the whole of the U.S. and the Americas have done an amazing job in this quarter dealing with our busiest holiday season ever. ","And the card, I wouldn\u2019t call out what percentage that\u2019s contributing to it, but it is certainly with more people joining My Starbucks Rewards, by an increasing tender, there is definitely a much richer dialog coming along. ","There is a much greater recognition between the customer and our barista, and we\u2019re adding, as you know, this quarter, we\u2019re adding to the customer experience through introducing names on aprons, which will be in stores by the end of January, and then phasing in names on cups in the coming months. So all of it focused on the relationship between the customer and our barista, and making it a great personal Starbucks experience. ","Troy Alstead","And then Sarah, back to, specifically, your question about cost of goods, the largest impact of commodity favorability as you know comes in our channel development business. So within the Americas segment, that commodity benefit in the quarter was about 30 basis points or so to OI, perhaps a little bit higher. And so just roughly 30 basis points of benefit from commodities, total cost of goods and I can see leverage improve by about 50 basis points. I hope that gives you some context. We actually did see exactly the kind of leverage we would expect, both from commodity benefits on that cost of goods line, and then also leverage on the fixed costs from growing sales.","JoAnn DeGrande","And we will have time for one last question. And I apologize to those of you left in the queue. We will try and get back to you as soon as we can this afternoon. ","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of Nicole Miller Regan from Piper Jaffray. You may ask your question.","Nicole Miller Regan - Piper Jaffray","I think you had mentioned at the analyst day something about the future of a brand-agnostic loyalty card. Can you give us an update on that? And given that you are talking about the different ways, shapes, and forms that a customer can access Starbucks today, would this require them to get a new card? ","Howard Schultz","I don\u2019t think I understood the question. Can you repeat that please? ","Nicole Miller Regan - Piper Jaffray","Sure. I think there was talk at the analyst day about a channel agnostic loyalty card, so that it doesn\u2019t matter if I get a cup of coffee this morning at a retail store or buy a pound of coffee at the grocery store is the way I originally understood the intent. That idea incentifies as a loyal, frequent Starbucks user. When you do roll that out down the road, do I have to consolidate the other cards that I might have? And I\u2019m just wondering, since you are talking so much about gift cards and different forms of Starbucks cards and the way of processing payments and gifts and all of that, is this all going to eventually roll into one?  ","Howard Schultz","Well, I think you\u2019ve asked us a question that, with respect, we don\u2019t want to get into too deeply today. But let me try and answer without being coy in any way. Over the next few months or so, we\u2019ll be coming back to you and sharing with you the plans that we have to take advantage of Starbucks products within CPG, and specifically grocery, and leveraging the technology and the advancement of providing value to our customers that are buying Starbucks products in grocery, and leveraging the card.","I don\u2019t want to get into too much specificity today, only to tell you that we strongly believe that this will provide an incentive for our customers to not only buy Starbucks coffee, but integrate them even further in the Starbucks ecosystem with the card loyalty and mobile. And we are very excited about this, and we will be sharing this with you in the months and quarters ahead. This is something we believe in, and something that we are deeply committed to.","JoAnn DeGrande","That concludes our Q1 fiscal 2013 earnings conference call. We thank you all for joining us today.

Ms. DeGrande, you may begin your conference.","JoAnn DeGrande","Thank you, Mike. Good afternoon. This is JoAnn DeGrande, Vice President of Investor Relations for Starbucks Coffee Company. Thank you for joining us today to discuss our second quarter fiscal 2015 results, which will be led by Howard Schultz, Chairman, President and CEO; Kevin Johnson, President and COO, and Scott Maw, CFO.

Howard?","Howard Schultz","Thank you, JoAnn, and welcome to everyone on today\u2019s call. Q2 of fiscal 2015 was a stunning quarter for Starbucks on almost every level. Record Q2 revenues of $4.6 billion, record Q2 operating income of $778 million and record split adjusted Q2 EPS of $0.33 per share, all clearly demonstrated a continuation of the strength, momentum and robustness we saw in our business during holiday Q1. Equally impressive is that Q2 results were delivered despite foreign exchange headwinds and soft consumer environments in several key markets. ","Our global comp store sales increased a strong 7% in Q2 with 3% coming from increased traffic, our 21st consecutive quarter of comp sales growth of 5% or greater and a spectacular result given that our comps are now calculated off of the US store base of over 7000 stores and a global store base of over 10,000 stores. No other global retailer approaching our size or store base comes remotely close to posting such consistently strong comp performance. ","Our Americas segment delivered another outstanding quarter with performance driven by the successful introduction of several innovative new coffee beverages, including Starbucks Flat White, our new tiramisu and caramel flan beverage, an expanded selection of Teavana branded tea beverages and very positive customer response to our new breakfast sandwich lineup, all of which contributed to increased food attach across virtually all regions and day parts. ","Turning to China and Asia Pacific. Now with over 5000 stores, our China Asia-Pacific segment delivered a company leading 12% comp increase in Q2, almost entirely coming from increased traffic and a strong increase in operating income as well. ","We also completed the acquisition of Starbucks Japan in Q2 and are in a position to aggressively go after business across all channels in Japan both in and outside of our stores in ways never before possible. And we are already seeing an acceleration of our business in that key highly opportunistic market. ","CAP remains a focal point of our future growth and we are on track to meet our goal of doubling our CAP store count to roughly 10,000 locations tripling our revenue to over $3 billion and tripling our operating income over $1 million over the next five years. In addition, I am proud to say that EMEA delivered the strongest Q2 performance in its history, reporting both record operating margins and record operating income. ","Our channel development segment also delivered a banner quarter with a 16% increase in sales and strong increases in both operating margin and operating income while at the same time further increasing Starbucks\u2019 already industry-leading share of premium single serve, premium packaged coffee and premium packaged tea. Starbucks by a wide margin is the number one premium coffee brand in the K-Cup category and we now have shipped over 2.5 million K-Cup packs since launch. ","Starbucks\u2019 stellar performance in Q2 was multi-segment, multichannel and multi-geographical, driven by our people in distinct markets all of the world, yet woven together by a common thread, industry-leading partner-centric and customer facing innovation and the ongoing strength and global relevancy of the Starbucks brand and retail experience. Our history and experience demonstrate and our research unequivocally confirms that the investments we make in deepening our connection to our people links directly back to value creation for our shareholders. By offering every eligible partner the ability to profit alongside our shareholders through big [ph, stock providing pay healthcare coverage, providing contended [ph] wages and incentive compensation opportunities, reimbursing college tuition costs through Starbucks college achievement plan, sharing and advancing our common values and investing in the communities in which our people live and work, we are and will continue to make significant investments in our people around the world. And these investments are bearing fruit for our shareholders. You will hear more about that and about our additional partner investments that we're making in a few moments. ","On today\u2019s call I am going to provide you with an overview of some of the innovations and strategic initiatives that we announced or that we begin to shape in the quarter. Innovations and initiatives that will enable us to further extend Starbucks global coffee authority and leadership around all things retail and mobile and position us to continue to lead and to win around the world into the future. ","And I will turn the call over to Kevin who will share highlights of individual segment and market performance in Q2 and finally Scott will take you through our Q2 financial and operating results and we\u2019ll finish up with Q&A.","Leadership around all things coffee remains at our core and we continue to innovate and invest in order to meaningfully elevate the premium highly differentiated locally relevant coffee experience we deliver to over 75 million customers from over 22,000 stores in 66 countries around the world each week. ","Starbucks Flat White, an espresso-forward handcrafted beverage that combines premium espresso quality with creative artistry to a delicious hot beverage that we introduced into the Americas segment early in Q2 has already generated the strong customer following and is driving a food attach exceeding our original expectations. On the heels of the success of Flat White, we also introduced both Starbucks Cold Brew and in certain markets yogurt-based fruit smoothies incorporating and leveraging branded Evolution Fresh juices. While in the early days, each of these beverages is receiving a highly favorable customer response and we will be rolling out a fantastic line-up of innovative new Frappuccino beverages and granted branded Teavana iced teas for our customers during the hot summer months ahead.","You may recall that in our holiday Q1 we recorded record setting card sales and loads of $1.6 billion that we expected to drive traffic and positively impact our business in Q2 and that is precisely what occurred. More important is that we are now seeing large numbers of last holiday\u2019s first time gift receivers become loyal, engaged, repeat Starbucks customers, supporting and contributing to the growth we\u2019re seeing across our global customer base. And with the increasing customer acceptance of our mobile app, we now have over 16 million active users. ","Dollars loaded on Starbucks card continues to rise. This is a really important number, at 19% year-over-year increase in Q2 alone in which $1.1 billion in Q2 was loaded, a trend and a figure that bodes very well for our business in coming quarters. ","We know that increased Starbucks card sales drives increased My Starbucks Rewards membership and in turn increased traffic and sales in our stores. We added 1.3 million new My Starbucks Rewards members alone in Q2. More additional members in one quarter than most loyalty programs have in total and now have over 10 million active members with almost $6 million members being active Gold members. My Starbucks Rewards will continue to be among our most important business drivers as new members contribute not only to short term increases in revenue and profit but also to long term loyalty for many years to come. ","In December, we introduced Mobile Order & Pay to our 150 stores in Portland, Oregon. Since then we\u2019ve expanded mobile order and pay to over 600 stores in the Pacific Northwest and we are now on track to roll out mobile order and pay nationwide this calendar year. Mobile order and pay has been extremely well received by our customers enabling them to order ahead, avoid lines, avoid waiting for orders to be filled resulting in shorter lines, faster service, improved more efficient in-store operations and execution and an elevated Starbucks experience, and mobile order and pay is driving incrementality as we\u2019re seeing an increase in both attach and daily transactions in those stores and markets where mobile order and pay has been launched. ","In addition, as we shared with you before, we are on plan to launch delivery in Seattle and in the Empire State building in New York City during the second half of 2015. There is no doubt in our mind that delivery like mobile order and pay would drive further incrementality and profitability for the company. ","Many of you have the opportunity to experience the world's most premium coffee experience for yourselves when you were in Seattle for our investor day last December and visited the one-of-a-kind 15,000 square foot Starbucks Reserve Roastery and Tasting Room, what many have called the Willy Wonka of coffee. We fully anticipated that the Roastery would be a success and that we would build additional roasteries in select US and international cities in the years ahead. But no one could have recently have anticipated the overwhelming customer and visitor response that roaster is generating in only the first four months of its operations. Look for our second Starbucks Reserve Roastery and Tasting Room in calendar 2016 and the city to be announced later this year. ","And while the roastery is an immersive, experiential venue, it\u2019s actually so much more. Our intent with the roastery from day one was to create and build a new ultra-premium coffee brand and business unit. The additional small batch coffee roasting capacity provided by the roasteries enabling us to source roast blend and market spectacular limited availability, microlot coffees from around the world and to meaningfully elevate the super-premium coffee experience we deliver to our customers. We are already expanding availability of Starbucks reserve coffees to over 1000 Starbucks locations as we begin to build the Starbucks reserve brand. ","And the roastery is enabling the launch of 500 Starbucks reserve stores worldwide, a new class of stores that will showcase the most premium of all superpremium coffees in the world and the newest coffee brewing methods such as pour-over side and Starbucks proprietary brewing technology Clover. Starbucks reserve stores will also incorporate an integrated Teavana kiosk to leverage traffic and growing consumer interest in super-premium loose leaf and packaged Teavana teas. Starbucks reserve stores and Starbucks reserve brand provide us with an exciting innovative highly differentiated new global growth opportunity that leverages all of Starbucks\u2019 strengths around the world in terms of coffee sourcing and roasting, premiumization, coffee beverage development, retail site selection and design, merchandising and customer digital. [indiscernible] with the opening of our new Starbucks reserve selection store towards the end of calendar 2015 and the opening of Starbucks reserve coffee bars within select existing Starbucks locations across the US as part of normal Starbucks store renovation cycles. ","The addition of Starbucks reserve coffee bars will both drive incrementality in existing Starbucks stores and quickly build consumer awareness of our new Starbucks reserve brand domestically and around the world. ","In closing, before I turn the call over to Kevin, I want to share with you what many within Starbucks and I already knew that Kevin Johnson is a passionate servant leader, a world-class businessman and expansive thinker and a wise counsel. The partnership and insights that Kevin brings to the senior management leadership team as a highly engaged six-year member in the Starbucks Board of Directors and now as President and COO of our company, are providing to be invaluable and are already having a tremendous positive impact across all business segments and regions [ph] and he\u2019s just getting started. So I welcome Kevin to the call and I now turn the call over to Kevin. ","Kevin Johnson","Thank you, Howard and good afternoon everyone. Q2 was an excellent quarter for Starbucks across the board. Before providing operating highlights for each of our segments, I thought I would share a very brief update on my transition into day to day management. ","Since January, I have been working closely with Howard and Starbucks senior leadership team to ensure a smooth transition and ramp up beginning on March 1. I am now almost four months into a deep immersion across all key business functions as well as deal business to stores and facilities throughout North America and Europe, engaging with our partners, customers and suppliers. Next week my immersion takes me to Asia where I will have the opportunity to visit Starbucks stores and partners in the region with our group president, John Culver. ","This immersion process is providing me with a more comprehensive understanding of Starbucks business and operations. But more than that, the immersion is providing with an even greater appreciation of the enormous global opportunity that lies ahead with this fantastic company and the remarkably talented management team. I am committed to doing everything I can to create value for our Starbucks partners and shareholders, always through the lens of humanity around the world and into the future. ","Thanks to Howard and all the Starbucks partners for their warm welcome, for their help in making my transition into this role so seamless. ","Now I would like to tell you about Q2. Our Americas business continued to deliver strong consistent profitable growth, with the 7% increase in comp sales in Q2 and record revenue up 11% over last year, record operating margin and record operating income. ","Our US food program continues to be a key focus and the tremendous opportunity for us. I am pleased to report that in Q2 US food sales grew 16% year on year and contributed 2 points of comp growth with every day-part platform and region contributing to the increase. Noteworthy is that the sales of our innovative new breakfast sandwich which has contributed to a 35% year over year growth in our breakfast sandwich program. Our lunch platform also delivered double digit year over year gains as well. ","As Howard mentioned, we introduced the Starbucks Flat White beverage that was enthusiastically embraced by our customers. Flat White held elevated the entire core espresso category and drove food attach. We launched another coffee forward beverage, Starbucks Cold Brew in select North American markets with the plan to offer Starbucks Cold Brew in many more US stores this summer. While still early in this innings, customer response to Starbucks Cold Brew has been very strong. ","Hand-crafted branded Teavana tea beverages sold in Starbucks retail stores continued to drive both food attach and strong growth in the tea category in Q2 with tea revenue up 15% year on year, driven in large part by a very strong customer response to the launch of Teavana branded Shaken Iced Teas and Teavana Tea Lattes. Teavana represents a very compelling strategic opportunity for Starbucks and we plan to expand availability of the branded Teavana tea beverages throughout Starbucks retail stores in multiple new geographic markets in the quarters ahead. ","Based on our success in the United States with La Boulange bakery platform we\u2019ve now begun to point it to throughout Canada. Already nearly 70% of Starbucks Canada caf\u00e9s have transformed pastry cases with the balance to be converted by summer. And our core Frappuccino platform introduced 20 years ago remains very strong and continues to attract both new and repeat customers. Birthday Cake Frappuccino available only by mid-March was a huge success and as Howard mentioned earlier, we had some very exciting Frappuccino and branded Teavana Iced tea beverages planned for this summer. ","Starbucks China Asia Pacific region, our fastest growing region, delivered another very strong quarter with comp sales rising 12%, the strongest comp sales increase since 2012. With revenues increasing 124%, or 24% when excluding the $270 million incremental revenue from the acquisition of Starbucks Japan, operating income rose 29% from Q2 last year. We\u2019ve more than doubled our CAP store count to over 5000 stores in the past five years. We\u2019ve added 769 net new stores in the last 12 months. We will open our 1600th store in China later this month where we now operate in 87 cities and are on our plan to increase our store count to over 10,000 stores in count over the next five years. ","Passion for coffee and partner customer engagement in CAP are among the highest of any market in the world. In response to customer and partner demand, we expanded availability of Starbucks reserve packaged coffee. We now offer Starbucks reserve in 136 stores across 10 CAP markets. ","In Q2, we assumed full ownership of the strategically important Japanese market. Japan is a market we first entered nearly 20 years ago and now with the full ownership we have the ability to further accelerate store growth, expand the Starbucks brand across multiple other channels and cross-sell products into other CAP regions. As an example, we recently introduced Origami, our premium single serve pour-over packaged coffee formerly only available in Japan, into Taiwan, Hong Kong, Korea and Mainland China to a strong positive customer response. Our China Asia Pacific business continues to perform extremely well, reinforcing our confidence in the long term growth potential of the market. ","The evolution of our EMEA business continues with the business reporting a 2% comp sales increase in the quarter, with 2% driven by traffic growth and 1% increase in tickets. We are building our EMEA business by introducing new food and beverage offerings and innovative new store designs while at the same time increasing the sales across all dayparts and successfully building capacity is key. And we continue to enter high customer traffic locations by adding additional channel licensees at venues such as train stations, airports and supermarkets. ","Equally important, the EMEA team\u2019s laser focus on operations and the ongoing mix shift towards licensed stores enabled that segment to significantly increase both operating margin and operating income despite formidable foreign exchange headwinds, a subject Scott will discuss in a few moments. ","Channel development, now operating in 41 markets around the world, in Q2 our channel development segment, already our profitable business segment, increased revenue 16% and operating income 23% year on year. At the same time the channel development team increased share of every product within its portfolio, including Roastery, Ground, K-Cup, [indiscernible] teas, our channel development segment remains on track to grow its top line by 60% and its operating income by nearly 100% by the year 2019. Since launch, Starbucks has built its leading position on the K-Cup platform through ongoing product innovation, including the introduction of single Origami coffees and seasonal and LTO offerings including holiday blends and by expanding our channel through distribution. We will continue to innovate around our K-Cup portfolio, including new offerings for summer refreshment, including iced Starbucks coffee and Tazo iced tea K-Cups to brew over ice. ","And in Q2, our growing food services business, which increased sales of 11% year over year, began serving millions of customers traveling on Delta and Delta connection flights around the world. The global ready to drink coffee market, a market we are uniquely well positioned to lead, is large and growing rapidly. Our plan is to double our international ready to drink coffee business over the next five years. We have taken an important step forward with the strategic partnership we announced last month with Tingyi among China\u2019s largest and most respected beverage companies, combining the Starbucks brand and our 1600 retail store footprint in China with Tingyi\u2019s local manufacturing capabilities, its grocery sales expertise and its broad distribution capabilities positions us to unlock the huge opportunity that exists for Starbucks ready to drink coffees in China. ","Among the things that impressed me most throughout my immersion has been the pace of innovation that\u2019s taking place at Starbucks. Highlighting all the innovation currently underway across the company in beverage, food, store design, marketing, merchandising, would require many more hours than we have available today. But I would like to share a few highlights of what I believe to be game changing innovation taking place on the customer digital experience. ","We are delighted with the initial results of mobile order and pay. Our mobile ordering capability now available in over 600 stores across the Pacific Northwest. Starbucks mobile order and pay experience is the proprietary fully integrated technology that allows customers to order their food and beverage selections through their mobile device ahead of time and go to their participating store to pick up the completed order. Our experience to date gives us confidence that once fully deployed, mobile order and pay will drive a significant increase in mobile payment transactions in stores across the US.","Enhancing our in-store experience with customer focused digital experiences like mobile order and pay creates a positive flywheel effect on our business and attracts more My Starbucks Rewards members. Each new MSR member represents a deeper more personalized customer relationship and more personalized customer relationships allow us to better serve customers and grow our business as evidenced by the significant increase in the number of active MSR members we are serving. For the first time ever, we now have over 10 million active MSR members in the US, up 27% over last year having added 1.3 million new MSR members in Q2. We are now processing over 8 million mobile payment transactions per week, equalling nearly 19% of our US store tender and in Q2 we not only experienced record card redemptions following the record holiday card sales and loads but we also recorded Q2 record card loads of over $1.1 billion for North America, a 19% increase year over year. ","While mobile order and pay is exceeding every internal goal we set, we are even proud of the difference the technology is making in our customers\u2019 lives. We are receiving positive feedback from many customers. Students who now have time to visit Starbucks between classes, parents who are able to easily order their favorite Starbucks food and beverages while running errands with their children, and busy people from all walks of life who are leveraging this new capability to enable their own personal Starbucks experience. ","We also received overwhelming appreciation from deaf customers who are now able to easily order and receive their customized beverage just the way they want it. Customer connection has always been core to who we are as a company and we are leveraging the digital assets to expand and enhance that customer connection to what is now more than 16 million active users of our mobile apps in the US alone. We remain on track to fully deploy mobile order and pay to all US company-owned locations before this holiday season. At the same time we will begin testing delivery. In March, we announced that through a collaboration with Postmates, a leading on-demand delivery service, we will enable customers to order food and beverage items using Starbucks mobile app and receive on-demand delivery within defined areas. ","We are also launching green apron delivery test with our partners delivering orders within specific office buildings. As Howard mentioned, our first green apron delivery test will begin at the New York\u2019s Empire State Building in the second half of 2015. ","Creating a genuine and Starbucks experience for our customers and an authentic and personal connection between our customers and our partners is core to everything we do. Earlier this fiscal year, we began rolling out a series of investments in support of our in-store partners who deliver the Starbucks experience. Conceived, carefully developed and honed over the past year, the changes we have implemented are already touching 135,000 partners across our US store base. Changes include increased barista and shift supervisor pay rates, additional performance based recognition programs, updates to a dress code, a new food benefit as well as our industry leading college achievement program. ","We are also investing in digital solutions to automate store tasks, freeing up our partners to focus more of their time and attention on customer engagement. We are beginning deployment of hand-held devices connected with the scanner to simplify things like order \u2013 inventory management. This is just one example of many where we intend to leverage technology to empower in-store partners in support of our mission. This is a journey and we are commanded [ph] to listening to our partners and to deliver further enhancements to the partner experience. We are making similar investments in locally relevant ways to improve our partner experience elsewhere around the world. ","In closing, and as Howard mentioned, if there is one word to describe Starbucks record performance in the quarter, I think it would be innovation. Innovation around new locally relevant food and beverage offerings, innovation around stunning new store designs, innovation through the creation of new global growth platforms all centered around coffee, innovation around how we serve and engage with our customers and build customer loyalty, innovation around our breakthrough mobile and digital technologies and innovation around how we invest in and connect with our most important asset \u2013 our people. ","Innovation will continue to drive our business in the future and provide us with the confidence and ability to continue growing our business in markets and channels on a global basis. And while we are pleased with our Q2 performance, we know that we have much more work to do to achieve our aspiration of becoming the world\u2019s most respected and enduring customer brand. ","With that, I will turn the call over to our CFO Scott Maw. Scott?","Scott Maw","Thanks Kevin and good afternoon everyone. I am very pleased to comment on the strong Q2 financial results that Starbucks announced today, especially in light of the fact that each of our segments contributed meaningfully to the results. ","Strong global comp growth of 7% in the quarter demonstrates once again the increase in strength and relevancy of the Starbucks brand. Transaction comps of 3% driven in large part by excellent execution in our key fast growing CAP region exceeded transaction comps in the Americas, reflecting the increasingly global nature of our brand.","Revenues grew to $4.6 billion, an 18% increase over prior year, despite nearly 2 percentage points of headwind through foreign currency translation. GAAP EPS came in at $0.33 and our non-GAAP EPS also at $0.33 came in ahead of the pre-split consensus. We raised our guidance modestly at our annual shareholders meeting in March and the results we announced today were at the top end of that revised range. ","Excluding non-GAAP items, operating income increased 23% over Q2 last year to $789 million while non-GAAP operating margin expanded 70 basis points to 17.3% in the quarter. Importantly we saw a meaningful increase in COGS leverage this quarter as supply chain initiatives we\u2019ve previously discussed increasingly benefit our operations. Our year-over-year operating performance improvement becomes even more meaningful in light of the ongoing investments we continue to make around building new stores and renovating existing stores, the partner investments we are making and unfavorable foreign currency translation. ","I will now tell you about each of our segments and how they performed in Q2. Our Americas segment revenues grew 11% in Q2 primarily driven by a strong 7% comp growth and another quarter of 2% transaction growth. Of the 7% comp growth, food sales drove 2 points of the increase, while beverage innovation and tea drove 1 point each. Noteworthy is that the contribution to comp growth from tea has roughly doubled since we introduced Teavana teas into our Starbucks stores last summer, adding 1 point to comp in each of the last two quarters. ","In Q2, Americas operating margin expanded 110 basis points over Q2 last year to 22.7%, an excellent result as the bulk of our US store partner investments began in earnest during the quarter. The largest components of the new partner investments were wage adjustments and the introduction of a new food and shift benefit. Altogether these investments impacted Q2 operating income by $34 million and operating margin by 100 basis points. ","For fiscal 2015, we expect partner investments to total approximately $140 million and this outlook [ph] was fully included in our initial and current guidance. Looking forward we expect modest further expansion of the Americas margin during the second half of the year. ","Our EMEA segment increased operating income 65% over Q2 of last year to a Q2 record of $29 million. Our licensed store portfolio in the region continues to perform exceedingly well with high single digit comps once again this quarter reflecting the strength and resiliency of the Starbucks brand. At the same time EMEA\u2019s operating margin expanded 470 basis points to a Q2 record of 10.4%, reflecting the continued progress that the EMEA team is making against our plan to improve operations and achieve mid-teens operating margins over the near term.","EMEA saw a decline in revenues largely due to unfavorable foreign exchange translation and the ongoing shift from company owned to licensed stores in several markets. These factors coupled with continued consumer weakness in several countries within the EMEA region make this segment\u2019s Q2 performance that much more impressive. We remain confident that EMEA\u2019s operating margins will reach the upper end of our 10% to 12% guidance during fiscal 2015. ","Our China Asia Pacific segment delivered a 29% increase in operating income to $112 million in Q2. GAAP operating margin declined from 32.8% to 18.9% reflecting the impact of our acquisition of Starbucks Japan. As I have mentioned previously, our Japan stores remain among our most profitable in the world. Excluding the nearly 15 point financial impact of the ownership change in Starbucks Japan, CAP\u2019s operating margin increased by 80 basis points, driven primarily by sales leverage throughout the region, including very strong sales leverage in China. We continue to drive an increase in store unit economics in China and our newest class of stores is delivering excellent first year operating profitability. ","The CAP team remains laser focused on continuing to deliver substantial disciplined profitable growth. And we are increasing our CAP operating margin guidance slightly as we now expect operating margin to approach 20% for all of 2015. ","Channel development had an excellent Q2 with operating income increasing 23% to a record $156 million. Operating margin for the second quarter expanded 210 basis points to 36.5% primarily driven by efficiencies in cost of goods sold, strong results from our North American coffee partnerships that delivered its highest quarterly year over year profit growth since 2009 and sales leverage. We now expect approximately 150 basis points of operating margin improvement in channel development in fiscal 2015. ","Strong results during the first half of 2015 enabled us to generate earnings per share at the upper end of our 16% to 18% non-GAAP target EPS growth range. Accordingly, in March we increased our guidance range and today reaffirm that range with GAAP EPS targeted between $1.77 and $1.79 and non-GAAP EPS targeted between $1.55 and $1.57. For Q3, we are targeting GAAP EPS of between $0.39 and $0.40 and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.40 to $0.41. For Q4, we expect GAAP EPS in the range of $0.40 to $0.41 and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.42 to $0.43. ","One further note about our guidance for Q3 and Q4. While we fully expect margin expansion from Q3 to Q4, our earnings growth for Q4 will be slightly below our average earnings growth for the year due to the impact of the partner investments, higher negative foreign currency translation and lapping a particularly strong Q4 of 2014. ","Revenue growth for fiscal 2015 remains targeted at 16% to 18% despite 2 points of headwind from foreign currency translation. We continue to expect commodities to be roughly neutral in 2015 as compared to 2014. Our coffee team\u2019s passions around coffee pricing paid off, resulting in our costs for fiscal 2015 being below average market prices. ","Moving on to margin, we now expect a modest increase in fiscal 2015 non-GAAP operating margin over last year, representing a slight increase over our prior guidance. We still anticipate 1650 net new stores in fiscal 2015 but we now expect Americas to have approximately 600 net new stores, slightly lower than previous guidance due to the impact of the closing of the 132 licensed stores \u2013 licensed target stores in Canada. ","Our EMEA net new store target moves up slightly to 200 and net new stores in CAP remains the same at 850. All other guidance remains consistent with last quarter. ","A quick note on 2016 coffee pricing. Due to the recent drop in coffee prices, we have been locking in supply for 2016 and are now close to 70% priced for 2016. Our price is somewhat favorable to 2015. We will update you on the impact of coffee prices on 2016 performance as the year progresses. ","Finally, a few words of caution about extrapolating our current quarter performance into results above the upper end of our guidance. While we are comfortable with the range that we affirmed today, several factors need to be understood on considering the upper end of our range. First, the US store partner investments that both Howard and Kevin spoke about will be fully ramped up during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2015, impacting margins for the Americas segment during the back half of the year. We have fully planned for these investments. However the future benefits that will follow from these investments are significant and we will not hesitate to take advantage of opportunities to make additional targeted partner investments that build in strength in the business as we move through the balance of 2015.","Second, both CAP and channel development had banner second quarters and we fully expect each segment to finish the year very strong. But we do not anticipate a repeat of second quarter performance for either segment. For example, in the back half of 2015, our internal projections call for channel development revenue growth to be closer to 10%, consistent with the growth that we\u2019ve seen over the past several years. ","Finally, foreign exchange is becoming an increasingly challenging headwind with over 2 percentage points of negative impact on both revenue and earnings growth planned into the back half of 2015. This was not contemplated in our plan or our initial guidance for the year and we are still planning to deliver earnings growth of 17% to 18% despite over 2 points of currency impact. In fact, we modestly increased both the top and bottom ranges of our full year EPS guidance last month. We believe that this level of growth will represent best in class performance, the right level of investment in our partners and an industry leading return for shareholders. ","One final subject before turning the call to Q&A. In the past we\u2019ve given guidance for the upcoming fiscal year during our third quarter earnings call, even though our annual operating plan is typically not finalized until September. Kevin and I have been discussing this and given the size and scale of our increasingly complex and global business, have decided that going forward we will move future guidance to our Q4 earnings call, enabling us to complete and fully [ph] our plan prior to providing guidance. We assure that this change is not related to Q3 performance to date. In fact, we are quite pleased with how the quarter has started. Nor does it signal any coming change in long term targets. It does not and our long term targets remain unchanged. Instead, we are making this adjustment for the sole and simple reason that doing so will result in a more complete and informed forward guidance conversation. ","Q2 represented another quarter of strong growth and excellent financial and operating performance for Starbucks, all around the world. As we enter the second half of 2015 and look to the future, we are ideally positioned to continue benefitting from the investments we are making in our people, in our stores and in innovation and to continue providing world class returns for our shareholders. We will continue to update you on our progress as we move throughout the year. ","Now I will turn the call back to the operator for Q&A. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Sara Senatore with Bernstein.","Sara Senatore ","I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about mobile order and pay. Couple of questions related, one of them is you are about halfway through the year, and you have 650 stores and you are looking to accelerate I think quite nicely in the back half. If you could talk a little bit about what you\u2019ve learned that will allow you to accelerate that pace. And the other piece we are curious about is are you seeing that only people who already used mobile pay are using the order and pay or are you actually attracting new customers to the use of the app now that you have the ordering capability?","Adam Brotman","This is Adam Brotman. I will take the second question first. The answer is yes, we are seeing new customers coming in and use \u2013 joining us are using mobile app and also use mobile order and pay. So this is not just leveraging the strong base and you already have in our mobile commerce platform. In terms of the rollout plans and what we are learning, we are very pleased with how this has started. We will actually see a significantly ramped up accelerated pace of rollout in the second half of the year, as you mentioned, we have a big wave of stores coming on this summer and while we continue to learn and optimize couple of areas, for example, the estimated wait time pickup, we are dialing in store level menu and inventory management. These are all things that we are going to continue to improve on but frankly we are ecstatic about the fact that out of the gate our customer and our partners are really pleased with how this is going. In fact, Seattle started out even quicker than Portland and as we roll it into more urban environment that bodes really well and how this is going to continue to drive transactions and be a great thing for our customers. And operationally our partners are telling us there is no impact and are very happy with this as well. So we are excited to accelerate that rollout as you mentioned in the second half of the year. We are also going to be adding for Android app and launching this in the UK and in Canada, all before the end of the year. So we are truly just getting started. ","Operator","Your next question is from Keith Siegner with UBS.","Keith Siegner ","I want to ask a question about the Americas with the check growth. Very impressive, the highest to your ticket growth we\u2019ve seen in many years. And with some of these new premium products like Flat White, like Reserve, like Cold Brew, with them all rolling throughout this year, with the food attach increasing as you talked about, lots of tailwinds here. Could this be the beginning of a run of closer to mid single digit ticket growth in the US?","Cliff Burrows","Keith, thank you for your comments about our ticket growth. Perhaps if you like, ticket growth in the quarter we have seen 2% come from food, we have seen 1% from tea, we have seen strength from our base business whether it\u2019s Frappuccino in the Sunbelt, or as you say Flat White all of which helped our ticket in the quarter, plus our routine and disciplined approach to price in the quarter all have helped. Starting the future, I will pass it over to -- ","Kevin Johnson","The only thing I would add, Keith, is that ticket mix was blended nicely across the three drivers that Cliff is talking about. So little bit of price, a little bit of above level of premiumization with Flat White and some of the things that we are doing with food and a nice increase in attach. So the mix of that is really helping and so as I said in my comments, I think we are quite excited about how the rest of the year looks but we are still holding to our mid single digit comp guidance as we look forward. ","Operator","The next question is from David Palmer with RBC Capital Markets.","David Palmer ","A couple of P&L oriented ones, perhaps for Scott. The COGS leverage was really strong in the quarter as you mentioned and you mentioned in the release, supply chain efficiencies were driving a good bit of this particularly in the channel development segment. But as we look forward how should we think about that COGS line that plus coffee, will that kind of leverage continue? And then separately with regard to G&A, you had a significant increase in the quarter, I think it was 27%. What investments are driving and how should we think about that line as well?","Scott Maw","On the COGS point, the short answer is yes. We expect continued leverage. I don\u2019t expect it to be as high as it was this quarter, this was a really good quarter with some of the initiatives that we talked about kicking in and also in crisp business significant continued traction around wage. But we see that leverage continuing in the quarter and we\u2019ve got a number of things stacked up against making sure that happens. And then on G&A, the biggest driver of that at the corporate level is some true-ups that we had around total compensation. ","Operator","The next question is from Joe Buckley with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Joe Buckley ","Just couple of clarification questions, even if I missed it, but could you give the Mainland China same store sales increase for the quarter within that strong CAP number.","Scott Maw","We didn\u2019t break it out, Joe but as always China is obviously the biggest contributor to that growth. So we were really happy with what we saw in China this quarter. ","John Culver","Joe, this is John. I would just add that, I mean the main driver for the comp growth has been transactions. And the experience that we are providing across the region has never been stronger and in particular what we are seeing is that Starbucks is becoming part of the daily ritual of our customers in China and Japan or in the other markets that we operate in and then the level of frequency of our existing customers and the new customers that we are attracting continues to grow. We are now serving well over 5 million customers a week across the region and extremely proud of the job our team is doing over there. ","Joe Buckley ","And then just a question on the Tingyi, if I pronounced that correctly, agreement, how quickly will that ramp up and the bullet in the release mentioned, it\u2019s ready to drink coffee category, will that cover tea products as well?","Mike Conway","Yes, Joe, this is Mike Conway. So we currently distribute the Frappuccino product and China today although is in a more limited geographical presence than we would have. From a timing perspective we\u2019re going to be transitioning in 2016 to Tingyi and we expect that with strength of their distribution and their knowledge of the marketplace combined with our strong brand that we will significantly a lot of the growth for China. ","Howard Schultz","Mike, you want to just spend a little bit more time on channel development since we haven\u2019t had an opportunity. And also with regard to tea being talked about how many points of distribution it has.","Mike Conway","Yes, absolutely. So you also \u2013 Joe mentioned about tea, and yes we will over time be launching tea as well with the Tingyi distribution. We will from a channel to distribution perspective points of distribution they have well over 100,000 points of distribution within China, and for channel development for this quarter, actually very pleased with our results, our 16% growth was quite exceptional and was driven by a number of factors for us. First of all, very very strong programming in-store execution as well as the success of \u2013 and launch of innovations like our new iced K-Cup platform and as we think about the remainder of the year we have other innovations coming on as well including the launch of iced or rather our Coco K-Cups as well and so we expect very strong performance in the back half although expect it\u2019d be more in line with our historical growth of around 10%. ","Operator","The next question is from Karen Holthouse with Goldman Sachs.","Karen Holthouse ","Actually another question on the channel development side of the business. So we\u2019ve seen in the last probably few months of on IRI data that pricing has actually come in for Starbucks both on an absolute basis and relative to the market. Just curious so with just the logic behind that if that was seen as an opportunity, even that profit accretion, is it defending off potential entrants into the market with Dunkin moving into more points of distribution, just on the logic behind that and of course congratulations for a fantastic quarter?","Howard Schultz","Thank you. From a pricing perspective we actually are quite pleased with the way we were able to balance our base with promotional pricing, you combine that with the strong in-store merchandising that we had, we were able to achieve significant share growth across all of our businesses during the quarter. And so we will continue to monitor the market, continue to monitor pricing and make appropriate shifts but at the moment we are quite pleased with how our pricing is lining up in the marketplace and then in particular how we are driving share in the market. ","Operator","The next question is from John Glass with Morgan Stanley.","John Glass ","A few quarters ago there was a notion of maybe greater partnerships in the tech side either using some of their technology, maybe white labelling some of Starbucks payment platform et cetera. So where does that stand now, what\u2019s your current thinking on that and Kevin, as you come to this full time, maybe are there specific areas that you think are even greater opportunities that you bring your outside experience into Starbucks?","Matt Ryan","Sure. We continue to be in a number of active dialogues right now, about a number of different partnerships leveraging mobile. We see the continued growth as being our permission to do more and more in that space. We are not prepared to announce anything specific today and what I can tell you is in the months and year to come there will be more on that front. ","Kevin Johnson","Yes, in terms of opportunities for us to better leverage technology, early observation I think we are ahead of the industry in thought leadership around the digital customer experience and we\u2019re going to keep pushing the envelope on that. I think we\u2019ve outlined that for you and there is more ideas even behind that. The area that I think we have opportunity certainly is with our in-store partners on leveraging technology to help our in-store partners with the tasks they have to do that are more about the administrative side of things like inventory management, making it easier for them to do scheduling of our store partners, communicating with our store partners the way we reach in-store partners with training and communications. We\u2019ve got tremendous opportunity to step up our game in that particular area and we\u2019re going to do more there. And then certainly if you look at how we are utilizing information across the enterprise to make more informed and better decisions, whether it\u2019s using data, big data kinds of analytics to help us with store location or big data analytics to help us understand how to do a better job of promoting to our customers at different times of the year. I think those are the big opportunities that we see and we\u2019re going to continue to drive forward with those.","Operator","The next question is from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.","John Ivankoe ","Howard and Kevin, you are very very clear that mobile order and pay exceeded every goal that you set. So I wanted to get just a little bit more into the details of this. I guess one would think that mobile order we broke the best the constraint or the pinch point I think in your words, would be at the register and not at the barista, and so as that rollout has continued, I mean what you\u2019ve actually learned about increasing barista capacity, I mean is it just an issue of adding more baristas, adding more equipment? And as you think about mobile order, mobile pay over time, how much more latent capacity is just within the existing Starbucks unit because of this technology?","Howard Schultz","John, this is Howard. Cliff is going to take that in terms of the details of the question. I think it\u2019s fair to say that we did not intend nor do we foresee adding equipment as a result of mobile order and pay. The incrementality that we are seeing in the early stages strongly suggests that we are going to be able to integrate this well within the engine of Starbucks, with regard to labor, and how we are deploying, I will let Cliff take it. But I would say as Adam shared with you that these early signs of mobile order and pay, this is going to be a much more seamless integration than we really anticipated both in terms of customer response and level of convenience and also I wouldn\u2019t underestimate one other thing which we learned with Flat White and then as our people are so excited and so proud of this initiative and this technology, they\u2019ve embraced it, they are enthused about it, and as a result of that, it\u2019s one of the primary reasons why it\u2019s working so well. ","Cliff Burrows","Let me just talk about this. I think one of the things that we are seeing is convenience, improved relationship between the customer and their store where they order, they feel much more in control of it. Food attach is strong in it, and the repeat nature of these transactions is really really helping. It is convenient for the customer, they have no queue time, they come in and go straight to that handout pan and collecting that in turn is bringing up space and taking stress away from the register transaction and we are seeing really encouraging signs of growth peak in our busier stores, which is what is most exciting here. Of those busier stores, we cannot really talk about the Seattle, but where we have put in mobile order and pay we are seeing really strong growth at peak and there has been no additional equipment over and above putting in a printer and receive orders from customers, and it\u2019s really encouraging that we will be able to get more capacity at peak at our existing stores with the addition of mobile order and pay. ","Howard Schultz","And could you or Kevin, just talk about how this has been integrated into the ecosystem with regard \u2013 this is not a bolt-on.","Kevin Johnson","First of all, the ecosystem you are referring to is the mobile commerce platform which includes loyalty, the mobile app, our card program, our POSs in our store, we\u2019ve integrated all of those together, and it\u2019s actually that entire mobile commerce platform or ecosystem as you heard earlier is accelerating. We are seeing unbelievable numbers of active MSR members, mobile user, will keep the transactions. So it\u2019s into that momentum that we\u2019ve launched mobile order and pay. So this is not a bolt-on, this gets to leverage that existing ecosystem. And I think that\u2019s why frankly our customers are loving it. They don\u2019t have to download a new app, they don\u2019t have to learn something new, this is just seamless for the customers just like additional department. ","Operator","The next question is from David Tarantino with Robert W. Baird.","David Tarantino ","Just a follow up on the mobile order and pay initiative. It sounds like you might be starting to see some increases in My Starbucks Rewards members also as a result of rolling this out. So just wondering if you maybe comment on the though process or how you sort of think about the increase you are seeing in the loyalty program members and how you want to utilize that as you get this rollout, maybe more one to one offers and what you are doing currently or maybe that\u2019s not part of the plan but any thoughts there would be helpful.","Matt Ryan ","Sure. This is Matt Ryan and thanks for the question. There are two ways looking at \u2013 there are lots of ways that we\u2019re actually growing our membership and mobile order and pay is one of them. We are actually increasing the strength of our value proposition over time with more offers through one to one, people are recognizing that. People see the convenience within the stores. And because it is a overall initiative to recruit more and more people, we are seeing the growth in the platform. That begets a virtuous cycle, provides and do more things with that platform. Certainly the ability to become more and more targeted and send more offers to the right person at the right time in the way that they want it, is the capability we have been growing here. But the growth of that platform is in fact the permission that we have to do more over time in the digital space because as we grow that engaged space of customers, the adjacent things we can do with them, starting with mobile order and pay, moving on to delivery, and on to other opportunities, it\u2019s going to be an enormous long run play for us. ","David Tarantino ","And have you seen in fact that the membership levels in the Northwest has increased since you\u2019ve rolled the mobile order and pay out?","Kevin Johnson ","Well, I think as Adam commented earlier, we have seen increase in MSR, with new MSR customers coming to use mobile order and pay. And granted, we're just in the Pacific Northwest right now, so it's still early days. But I think that's a fantastic example of a feature that is a customer-focused feature. It's all about that benefit to the customer, and the consumer. And we think offering those types of benefits and those types of features is part of our mobile app, it will bring more people into the MSR program.","Operator","The next question is from Jeff Bernstein with Barclays Capital.","Jeff Bernstein ","Just two questions, one on the Americas comp. I don't know if you mentioned this, but in terms of the traffic growth across all dayparts, I was wondering whether you were seeing again stability across all those dayparts, and whether or not that would imply that at this point there are still no real signs of throughput constraints despite obviously the outside comp growth. And then my other question was just on the Americas units. I know that in fiscal \u201815, I guess half of your opening is going to be licensed. Just wondering whether there's any underlying strategy in coming years to move towards more licensed over time, not unlike I guess many of your international markets. ","Cliff Burrows ","Thanks, Jeff, and I'll take both the questions. This is Cliff. As we said earlier in the script, we have seen growth in the Americas in all dayparts, all geographies, and across all platforms. It really was a very balanced portfolio. And we are seeing growth at peak times in our busiest stores, which really gives us the encouragement that we are -- we still have room for capacity. And mobile order and pay will only help that in the coming months.","Secondly, around store growth, this quarter, as we said, was a bit of an anomaly with the closure of the 132 licensed stores in Canada. So that will distort the number a little bit this year. But I think over the coming years, you will see us continue a balance between company-operated and licensed stores. There may be times where it goes up or down, one way or the other. But in terms of strategy, we continue to look for opportunities to grow both our company-operated, and even here in the US, we still see a very healthy pipeline of new opportunities. And we open very soon our first small footprint store in New York, which gives us another opportunity for growth. And as Howard said earlier, with the premium nature of the -- building off the Roastery, we have again another opportunity for growth. So, we see the pipeline out into the future being very healthy, balanced between company-operated and licensed.","Howard Schultz ","Let me just add a few things to that. For those of you who have followed the company for many years, it wasn't that long ago that our stores closed early in the evening, 7, 8 o'clock at night. And most of our business, 15% or so was driven before 10, 11 AM. In the last few years, I think Cliff and his team have done a wonderful job of two primary things. One, dealing with peaks times and being able to drive throughput in a way that would not create a transaction driven environment but really honor the customer and now with mobile order and pay that\u2019s going to leverage it more but the big news in the last couple of years is identifying dayparts and need states through unique products in which we could leverage the fixed asset of the store. So lunch, as an example, is driving a significant level of visits and incrementality both in traffic and in ticket. The new opportunity with smoothies in terms of health and wellness, identifying that need state and leveraging that daypart opportunity, which is mostly refreshment in the afternoon in health and wellness.","And the one thing we have not talked about, either in the script or the Q&A, is the advancement of evenings, which we're very excited about. And so all these things have given us the ability to integrate new product, new levels of innovation, and identify need states and dayparts that five years ago, candidly, were not part of the unit average volume. If you looked at the average volume of Starbucks both in terms of mature stores and probably most importantly, new stores, we are experiencing the best performing new store class in our history. And one of the primary reasons is what I've just described. Then you leverage MSR and mobile order and pay on that, and your imagination can really -- I can't begin to think about how much volume we can put through these stores. And I think we're just getting started with a level of innovation we think that food team can create. And so that's why we're so excited about the future in terms of the opportunity to drive incrementality in existing and new stores.","Operator","Next question is from Nicole Miller with Piper Jaffray.","Nicole Miller ","Whoever put the coffee in Delta, thank you so much. And on that note, can you talk a little bit or just walk us through, I think it's 100% of coffee blocks for this year. We know it's favorable. Can you give us any color on how much? We were also supposed to see a benefit of lower on dairy and diesel, I think, in the back half of the year. Are you seeing that? And then also, thank you for the color on \u201816 and the lock there. Price is lower again -- by how much? Just wondering, can we flow that through, or do you want us to assume you'll make investments against that? Thanks.","Scott Maw ","Thanks, Nicole. So as it relates to \u201815, what you have to remember is that coffee prices throughout 2014 were quite low. So for a long time, they were in the $1.20 and $1.30 range. And so 2015 coffee prices, despite the fact that we were patient and waited out all the spikes above $1.90 and bought it far below average market prices, our coffee is actually a little bit unfavorable year over year. But that's much more about how low 2014 was and -- than it is around 2015. We actually did a really good job buying below the market. So a little bit of unfavorability, and a very little bit, offset by favorability in dairy and diesel. That's kind of how the year is shaping up.","When we gave guidance all the way back in the summer, we expected coffee prices to come down, just given what we saw in the market. We didn't know they were going to come down, but we expected that. We waited, and we were patient; and when they came into our target range, we filled up our needs for the year. So that's how to think about \u201915, roughly flat, a little bit unfavorable on coffee, a little bit favorable on dairy. On \u201816, because we did so well in \u201815, despite the fact that we've locked at slightly lower prices, again, that favorability while meaningful it is probably not as high as you might calculate based upon average market prices. So we'll give you more update. We still have a full third of our coffee to price. We will give you a bit more update as we move into \u201816 and become more specific.","Operator","The next question is from Diane Geissler with CLSA.","Diane Geissler ","I wanted to ask on the CPG business. I think Danone announced on its earnings call that it was co-branding an Evolution Fresh product with you, yogurt product. Obviously the Tingyi deal, I think, is a big deal in the CPG space in China for 2016. So, just kind of going back two analyst days ago, which would've been, I appreciate, quite a while ago, where you talked about the CPG space, and how you thought it could rival the size of the US retail business at some point in the future. Could you talk about your growth plans within CPG which I think you've obviously crystallized around the K-Cup business. But there's lots of opportunities in a lot of different aisles in not only the Americas, but also in China. So could you talk a little bit, maybe add a little bit more detail around that? ","John Culver ","Yes, Diane, this is John Culver, and I am going to take that. Clearly the CPG business, first off, had a very strong quarter and it continues to grow. Our expectation is that it will continue to grow at that double-digit rate in the foreseeable future. Now as we look at the growth, that growth is being driven by our core coffee, and really K-Cups is a big piece of that. As we look at other areas of growth, though, we see tremendous opportunity to grow outside of coffee. The biggest is the tea opportunity, and in particular with the Tazo Tea, and then as we introduce Teavana tea down the aisle and through ready-to-drink as well.","And then we've also worked very closely on Evolution Fresh. And Evolution Fresh today stands in over 11,000 doors across the country. The CPG share that we have both in natural as well as in traditional FDM is very strong, and it continues to grow. We just repackaged the product. And we now have new packaging, an 11-ounce and a 15.2 ounce. And then we've also launched Evolution Fresh smoothies in our stores. And we anticipate launching Evolution Fresh yogurt, with fruit on the bottom, in our stores with our Danone partnership. So, for us, these are all investments that we continue to make in our channel business given the relevance and the strength of the business. And also we are very optimistic about the future growth of the business going forward.","Operator","The next question is from Will Slabaugh with Stephens Inc.","Will Slabaugh ","One more question on channel development, but more on the international front. I don't know if you had an update that you could give us there on some key markets internationally, sort of where you stand now versus what type of growth you might expect in those key markets in the next couple of years as you might hit your goals.","Mike Conway ","Well, thank you. This is Mike Conway. We see channel A specific as being one of our most important markets going forward. Certainly with the partnership we have with Tingyi, China will be a big market for us, particularly driven by the size of the ready-to-drink energy and coffee business. And we also -- Japan is one of our longest-standing ready-to-drink markets. While it is somewhat mature, at the same time there's a lot of growth for us there, particularly with the move that we made now fully owning the Japan market.","Beyond that, there are a number of the emerging markets that we're really focused on. We still have fairly emerging business within our Latin America region. And we're looking at markets like Brazil to establish a presence there, another big market for us. And then we have an established relationship in Arla but we have probably the largest number of markets \u2013 I am sorry, in Europe -- we have the largest number of markets in the EMEA, and we are going to continue to drive our business there as well. But the UK, France -- those are some of our largest markets. So as I think about the significant growth that we have for ready-to-drink coffee, we are really looking at the CAP region as well as Latin America.","Operator","The last question is from Andrew Charles with Cowen and Company.","Andrew Charles ","Just wanted to touch base with Adam on the mobile payment just jumping to roughly 19%; had been stuck for a while around 15%. Just wanted to know what you attributed the increase in mix to.","Adam Brotman ","Thanks, Andrew. This is Adam. It's a great question. I would say the core ecosystem that Howard and I were talking about earlier is an interconnected set of parts that all have momentum. So the fact that MSRs -- you've seen the momentum in MSR. You've seen the momentum in mobile active users in general. You\u2019re seeing the momentum in card loads and card redemptions. And those things are all tied together, so like the flywheel, they all power one another. And so it's not a surprise that we're seeing that kind of acceleration happen when it comes to mobile payments as well, over 8 million per week, approaching 19%-plus in the US in terms of percentage of tender. And it just speaks to the momentum and the overall mobile commerce platform in general.","End of Q&A","JoAnn DeGrande ","Thanks, Mike. This concludes Starbucks' Q2 fiscal 2015 earnings call.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Starbucks Coffee Company's Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2017 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session.","We'll now turn the call over to Tom Shaw, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Shaw, you may now begin your conference.","Tom Shaw - Starbucks Corp.","Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us today to discuss our fourth quarter and full year results for fiscal 2017. Today's discussion will be led by Kevin Johnson, President and CEO; and Scott Maw, CFO. For Q&A, we'll be joined by Roz Brewer, Group President Americas and Chief Operating Officer; John Culver, Group President, International and Channels; Matt Ryan, Global Chief Strategy Officer; and dialing in from New York, Howard Schultz, Executive Chairman.","This conference call will include forward-looking statements which are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements. Any such statements should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements in our earnings release and risk factors discussions in our filings with the SEC, including our last Annual Report on Form 10-K. Starbucks assumes no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements or information.","Before handing the call over to Kevin, I'll take a moment to clarify that all references on today's call will be on a non-GAAP basis. GAAP results in fiscal 2017 includes several items related to strategic actions the company is taking as it focuses on accelerating growth in high-returning businesses and streamlining its operations. These items include restructuring and impairment charges, transaction and integration costs, gains related to changes in ownership of international markets, and other items. These items are excluded from our non-GAAP results.","Additionally, please note that fiscal 2016 contained an extra week in the fourth quarter, which resulted in incremental revenue and income for both Q4 of fiscal 2016 and full year fiscal 2016. Our comparisons to fiscal 2016 results exclude the effect of this extra week. Please refer to our website at investor.starbucks.com to find the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures referenced in today's call with our corresponding GAAP measures. This conference call is being webcast and an archive of the webcast will be available on our website as well.","I will now turn the call over to Kevin.","Kevin Johnson - Starbucks Corp.","Well, thank you, Tom, and welcome, everyone. Today, Starbucks Coffee Company reported another quarter and year of strong performance, with each of our business segments around the world contributing to record results. On today's call, I will provide highlights of Q4 and fiscal 2017, and share our view of Starbucks' longer term growth opportunity. Scott will then take you through details of our operating and financial performance and updated guidance.","In fiscal 2017, Starbucks delivered record revenues of $22.4 billion, a record 19.7% non-GAAP operating income margin, and non-GAAP earnings per share growth of 11% over prior year. At the same time, we made significant investments to support the growth of our business and added over 2,200 net new stores, to a total of now over 27,000 stores globally.","China was a stand out in fiscal 2017, posting 7% comp growth, strong revenue growth, and another year of record AUVs and strong profitability. We added over 550 net new stores in China in fiscal 2017 and now have nearly 3,000 stores in 135 cities. We capped fiscal 2017 with a solid Q4, delivering 3% comp growth in the Americas, and 3% globally, and in the U.S., after adjusting for nearly one point of impact from Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. Millions of people, hundreds of communities and thousands of our Starbucks partners were impacted or displaced by devastating storms in Q4. Over 1,100 Starbucks stores were closed for extended periods. But the hurricane story is a human story, and I'm proud and appreciative of how our Starbucks partners responded to our customers and communities in distress.","Starbucks posted record, in many cases industry-leading, financial and operating results in both fiscal 2016 and 2017, but a balanced conversation of our performance over the past two years acknowledges that we have not consistently delivered against our long-term financial targets, prompting a review to ensure that our targets are aligned with our strategic plan and the current operating environment. By way of background, we last revised our long-term targets in 2010, and we are very proud of our performance since then, more than doubling revenues, tripling earnings, quadrupling market cap, and increasing store count by over 10,000 locations globally.","Our strategic planning process serves as the basis of our long-term financial outlook and is informed by three guiding principles. First, Starbucks is committed to remaining a growth company and delivering well above industry average comp, revenue, and profit growth. Second, Starbucks is committed to streamlining our business, sharpening our focus, and making thoughtful investments that position us to play the long game. And third, Starbucks is committed to a value creation strategy that includes both consistent, long-term profitable growth and rewards shareholders by returning cash in the form of dividend increases and share buybacks. With those principles in sharp focus, we challenged ourselves to balance the growth opportunity ahead with the headwinds confronting all retailers, particularly brick-and-mortar and restaurant retailers.","Our results over the past two years and the need to continue investing for growth, taking each of these factors into consideration, today, we introduced new long-term financial targets. Comp growth of 3% to 5%, revenue growth in the high single digits, and EPS growth of 12% or better. Now Scott will provide additional details, but we believe that these new targets represent performance that we can meet or beat in the years ahead, while continuing to deliver best in class growth for a global business of our scope and scale.","We are driving three important actions in support of our long-term guidance. First, we are committed to investing in our future, specifically as it relates to partners, food and beverage innovation, digital innovation and Starbucks Reserve. Second, we are adapting our cost structure to align with this new long-term guidance with focus on G&A and the middle of the P&L. Third, we are streamlining our business and directing our investments toward businesses and operations where our growth prospects and returns are the greatest, while transitioning, whether by licensing, divestiture, or otherwise, businesses and operations where returns and long-term growth prospects are less attractive.","Examples of recent streamlining activity include almost doubling our company-owned operations in Mainland China, through the pending purchase of the remaining 50% of our East China operations, moving our businesses in Singapore, Germany, and Taiwan, approximately 700 stores in aggregate to a 100% licensed market model, initiating the closure of all Teavana retail stores, selling TAZO in order to focus on Teavana as our premium tea brand and eliminating our Starbucks e-commerce operation in order to better leverage our channel partners. Starbucks future returns will increasingly benefit from our ongoing initiatives to further streamline our business.","In addition to our streamlining activities, we remain focused on executing against our six operational priorities. Progress against our priorities form the foundation and will be the proof points of our new guidance. And in Q4, we made significant progress against each priority. Scott will walk you through the details, but here are a few highlights. Let me start with our efforts to accelerate U.S. comp. Increased customer adoption of Mobile Order & Pay has resulted in a sustained increase in demand, particularly in our highest volume stores at peak.","We continue to leverage lean principles to further improve our in-store production engine, further increase throughput and deliver an improved customer experience. This work, combined with labor deployment, digital order management and channel focused production have enabled us to unlock capacity, particularly in our busiest mobile order stores at peak. In fact, transaction comp in the U.S., net of hurricane related impact, was the strongest performance in six quarters. At the same time, customer experience scores for both Mobile Order & Pay and non- Mobile Order & Pay customers reached record levels in Q4.","Our next operational priority is driving innovation in food and beverage, and naturally links to our efforts to accelerate U.S. comp. Innovation across our coffee and tea beverage platforms, with emphasis on cold, including our Cold Brew platform, Iced Espresso beverages, and Teavana Infusion Shaken Iced Teas, all contributed to our growth in Q4. In addition, we are leaning into our fast growing categories around Cold Brew, Draft Nitro beverages, and plant-based modifiers, including almond, coconut, and soy milk alternatives. Not only are these fast growing platforms highly relevant to our customers, our research demonstrates that they also provide a significant opportunity to drive food attach outside of our core morning daypart. Our food program continues to grow and expand with food mix now over 21% for the first time ever in Q4, giving us confidence that we will reach our target of 25% food mix by 2021.","Our priority to accelerate the power and momentum of our digital flywheel reflects the fact that digital relationships are among our most powerful demand generation levers. In fiscal 2017, Starbucks Rewards membership in the U.S. rose 11% year-over-year. Per member spend increased 8% in Q4 alone. The cumulative effect is that today 36% of tender comes from Starbucks Rewards, the vast majority, via our mobile app. Having made measurable progress increasing throughput and customer experience at peak, we can soon begin offering Mobile Order & Pay capabilities and features to all customers, Starbucks Rewards member or not. In quarters ahead, all customers will be able to download our app, set up a digital relationship with Starbucks, select a payment vehicle of their choice, and use Mobile Order & Pay. This is the first of many initiatives that will combine direct digital relationships with new value propositions in order to expand the total universe of customers with whom we engage and communicate.","The digital flywheel platform continues to evolve with new features and support new geographies. We recently launched Starbucks Rewards in Japan on the digital flywheel platform and already have nearly 2 million members, well ahead of our most optimistic projections, with stored value as a percent of tender doubling in just a few short weeks. Japan also represents the first instance of our new global cloud based customer digital technology platform that will enable new capabilities and features in markets around the world, including North America. The platform launched with near perfect performance.","The next major application of this new technology platform will enable the launch of financial services products in the U.S. in conjunction with Chase. We are pleased to announce that our first product with Chase to be launched this winter will be a co-branded Visa credit card, enabling customers to receive Starbucks Rewards with their purchases both in and out of Starbucks stores. The second product, the prepaid Visa card we have discussed on prior earnings calls will be introduced shortly thereafter. Both products will afford options, a very rich rewards proposition for people who spend on credit, and the unique stored-value product offering rewards for customers who prefer debit.","Our fourth operational priority is enabling long-term growth in China. Our China growth strategy will be amplified as we transition our East China JV to a company-operated market and begin leveraging our local leadership teams and economies of scale to maximize the growth and profit opportunity ahead. The opening of the Shanghai Roastery next month will further elevate the Starbucks brand in China, while at the same time adding to our momentum across the business and market, underscoring, once again the significant growth opportunity that China represents for Starbucks.","Our fifth operational initiative is elevating the Starbucks Experience through Roasteries and Reserve. Since 1971, the Starbucks brand has been built through leadership around all things coffee and tea. And through the consistent delivery of a premium retail customer experience, the Starbucks Experience, our Starbucks Roasteries and our Starbucks Reserve brand built on that long heritage and are central to our innovation strategy around branded, experiential retail customer destinations. Our Starbucks Roastery continues to attract and delight local customers and visitors from around the world, while delivering double-digit comp growth and an average ticket approaching four times that of a typical Starbucks store. And our Seattle Roastery will further benefit when our first Princi store opens inside it next week.","We have great plans for the high-end artisanal Italian bakery, Princi. Princi will be embedded in every Starbucks Reserve Roastery, including our extraordinary 30,000 square foot Shanghai Roastery opening next month, further elevating the culinary experience we offer customers. We also plan to add a number of stand-alone Princi stores, featuring Starbucks Reserve coffees in the years ahead. Our Roasteries and Reserve brand continue Starbucks tradition of delivering premium quality and groundbreaking innovation. And both reaffirm our coffee and tea leadership, and create further separation from the industry with Roasteries in New York, Tokyo, Milan, and Chicago under construction or development, fiscal 2018 will be a year of significant investment. I invite you to join us on December 6 for opening day of our Shanghai Roastery.","Our sixth operational priority is gaining share of at-home coffee. Scott will take you through the details in a moment, but let me just say that we continue to innovate and win channel share in premium coffee, recording a very strong quarter of 8% revenue growth.","As you can see, we remain laser focused on successful execution against our six operational priorities. The Starbucks has always sought to be a different kind of company, a company that consistently delivers industry-leading financial performance, while at the same time, using our scale for good. In addition to delivering record results in fiscal 2017 against a difficult industry backdrop, we are proud of the many important social impact initiatives we advanced, all of which support our brand.","We have created opportunities for many. In the past year alone, we hired more than 40,000 Opportunity Youth and aspire to hire 100,000 by 2020. Earlier this year, we surpassed our goal of hiring 10,000 veterans and military spouses, and have now increased our goal to hiring 25,000 by 2025. In addition, we now have over 8,000 Starbucks partners enrolled in the Starbucks College Achievement Plan in partnership with ASU. I'm particularly proud of how our partners responded to the powerful hurricanes that devastated South Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico. They responded with resilience, compassion, strength and unity, supporting their partners, customers, and communities.","Before handing the call over to Scott, I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge our Starbucks leadership team, a talented, experienced, committed and diverse group of servant leaders. We are a team committed to Starbucks future, and I'm honored to officially introduce Roz Brewer, our newly appointed Group President, Americas and Chief Operating Officer. With John Culver as Group President, International and Channels; Cliff Burrows, as Group President, Siren Retail; and Roz in her new role, we have three very strong and seasoned operators leading these businesses. Our entire leadership team is aligned around the strategies I have outlined for you today, and I have the utmost confidence in our future.","With that, I'd like to hand the call over to Scott. Scott?","Scott Maw - Starbucks Corp.","Thank you, Kevin, and good afternoon, everyone. As Kevin shared, fiscal 2017 was another year of strong performance for Starbucks. We reported solid top and bottom-line growth and in Q4, our best increase in U.S. traffic since early calendar 2016, despite a challenging retail operating environment overall. On today's call, I will provide an overview of our Q4 and 2017 results, expand on Kevin's comments regarding our long-term financial targets, and introduce guidance for fiscal 2018.","Q4 non-GAAP EPS of $0.55 was up 10% over last year, and includes a $0.01 benefit from higher income on unredeemed Starbucks cards, offset by an estimated $0.01 of negative impact resulting from the hurricanes, primarily from lost sales. Our Q4 non-GAAP operating margin came in at 20%, down 90 basis points from last year, the result of a 130-basis-point increase in partner and digital investments, 70 basis points from mix shift, principally increased food sales in the U.S., and an estimated 40 basis points of hurricane-related impact, partially offset by strong sales leverage, particularly in CAP.","I'll now take you through our Q4 operating performance by segment. Americas revenues grew 7% in Q4 to nearly $4 billion, primarily driven by 952 net new store openings over the past 12 months, and 3% comp growth. Americas 23% Q4 non-GAAP operating margin was down 390 basis points from last year, the result of 180 basis points of incremental U.S. store partner investment, 90 basis points from food sales driven mix shift, and 40 basis points attributable to the hurricanes. For the year, Americas grew revenues by 8%, and delivered an operating margin of 23.4% compared to 25% in 2016, primarily due to increased partner investments.","In Q4, our core espresso, tea, and refreshment beverage platforms delivered a combined 2 points of U.S. comp growth, partially offset by blended Frappuccino beverages, primarily in the afternoon daypart. Food also contributed 2 points of comp, now for the third consecutive quarter, driven principally by increased attach. Mercato continues to perform very well in both Seattle and Chicago, with a fresh food focus that is driving customer delight and incrementality. Also, disciplined price adjustments continued to help us offset rising labor and other input costs. As holiday approaches, we have a full pipeline of innovative food and beverage offerings, and returning seasonal favorites to surprise and delight our customers, and we're fully prepared for increased holiday traffic in our stores, with the throughput initiatives Kevin discussed, positioning us to continue delivering improved transaction comps at peak.","Moving on to China\/Asia-Pacific, CAP once again delivered company-leading growth in Q4, with revenues increasing to $860 million, up 14% after adjusting for 4 points of FX. CAP's growth was largely driven by the over 1,000 net new stores opened during the past 12 months, and 2% comp growth. China continued its outperformance with 8% comp growth, its strongest in nine quarters, driven by food and core beverage performance, momentum in Starbucks Rewards, and increasing sales of Teavana branded handcrafted tea beverages. Teavana has now contributed 2 points or more to China comp every quarter since we introduced the brand into the China market last year.","Comp growth in Japan improved sequentially from Q3, overall store and market profitability in Japan remain very strong, with comp growth in core food, tea, and espresso categories offset by negative comp in blended. For perspective, sales of blended beverages in Japan, represented over 40% of sales mix in the spring and summer months, compared to less than 15% in the U.S. Thus, shifts in blended sales in Japan have a disproportionate impact on both Japan and CAP comps overall. For that reason, it is important not to over index on Japan comps as we shift away from blended towards a broader mix of core products.","CAP operating income increased 16% to $219 million in Q4, while operating margin expanded 140 basis points driven by strong performance from both our company-owned stores in China, and our JV partnerships in East China and South Korea. South Korea, now our fifth largest global market, with system sales exceeding $1 billion, deserves special mention, boasting double-digit comp growth in fiscal 2017, and further underscoring the broad success we are having across CAP. For the year, CAP revenues grew 14%, excluding two points of negative FX and operating income a stunning 24%, driven by strong operating performance across the segment, and the benefit of value-added tax changes in China.","I'd like to take a moment to highlight the significant profit growth engine we have built in CAP, where together, our CAP markets delivered nearly 50% of total Starbucks' total non-GAAP operating income growth in 2017. We see another year of strong operating income growth in 2018, with CAP once again contributing a material portion of our absolute growth. And the acquisition of our East China business will be further accretive to our CAP growth rate, particularly as we move through this year and into 2019. Starbucks now has two significant profit engines driving our global returns, our North America business and the broader CAP market. Going forward, we'll be allocating more time to CAP in our prepared remarks, given the increasing importance of the segment.","Turning to EMEA, in Q4, EMEA delivered revenue growth of 7% to $270 million, the segment's strongest quarterly revenue growth in three years. Company operated store comp was 1% in the quarter while system-wide comps increased a strong 5%. EMEA margin in Q4 was 12.9% compared to 16.2% last year, reflecting softer performance in our company-owned markets and a 210-basis-point impact from a tax settlement in Q4 2017, offset by the benefit of store mix shift towards the licensed model. For the year, EMEA revenue declined 8% relative to 2016. However, adjusting for FX and the impact of mix shift to licensed stores, EMEA revenue grew 7%, a strong result given the challenging economic and geopolitical backdrop.","Non-GAAP operating margin of 13.2% was roughly flat to 2016 that included 140 basis points of negative FX impact. Today, of EMEA's nearly 3,000 stores, 83% are licensed. Our continued focus on improving operations and shifting the mix to more licensed stores has resulted in consistent mid-single digit system-wide comp growth in EMEA and 13 consecutive quarters of double-digit operating margin.","In Q4, our Channel Development segment grew revenues by 8% to $515 million, and operating income by 7% to $247 million. We gained share in both K-Cup and roasting ground categories, and increased our share of total coffee by twice the category growth overall, performance that is particularly noteworthy given increased composition and discounting in the face of slowing category growth. Growing Teavana in CPG channels is a major opportunity for us. In our pilot markets, Teavana ready to drink tea, captured the leading position in the super premium tea category during the quarter, and given the enthusiastic response to-date, we have accelerated our national rollout to this coming January. We also remain on track to launch Teavana-based packaged teas in grocery channels by the end of fiscal 2018.","Channel Development operating margin was roughly flat at 47.9%, the net of improved sales leverage offset by promotional activities. For the year, Channel's revenues exceeded $2 billion for the first time ever, up 6% year-over-year, increasing to 8% year-over-year after adjusting for the two-point impact of revenue adjustments in Q2. Starbucks' total coffee share grew by one point compared to an essentially flat market, and our dollar share expanded by over 5%. Operating income grew 13% and margin expanded by 260 basis points driven by COGS, including coffee favorability, strong performance from our North American Coffee Partnership and sales leverage.","Let's now shift to our consolidated full fiscal year 2017 results. For the full fiscal year 2017, Starbucks posted consolidated revenue of $22.4 billion, representing 7% growth year-over-year, driven by new stores and 3% comp growth. Non-GAAP operating income increased by 8% to $4.4 billion, and operating margin increased by 10 basis points to 19.7%, as strong sales leverage was offset by 110 basis points of increased partner investments. Growth rates in both operating income and non-GAAP EPS were impacted by one point of negative FX. In addition, investments in Reserve Roastery and Princi brands, operations that we collectively refer to as Siren Retail, were up significantly from 2016, and higher than we expected at the outset of 2017 as we shared during our Q3 call. We expect the impact of these investments to increase at a similar rate in fiscal 2018, and at a reduced rate as we move into fiscal 2019. Finally, we returned a record $3.5 billion to shareholders in fiscal 2017 through dividends and share repurchases.","Let's now spend a few minutes on our revised long-term guidance. Going forward, we see revenue growth in the high single digits, and comp growth in the 3% to 5% range, performance that should enable us to deliver non-GAAP EPS growth of 12% or greater, and ROIC of 25% or greater. As discussed at Investor Day, we see ongoing opportunities in COGS savings and core G&A growing at half the rate of revenue growth. This change in our growth targets requires us to look at all financial aspects of our business including capital return to shareholders. For perspective, in the three years ending in 2014, we returned $3.8 billion in capital to shareholders, a figure that more than doubled to $9.1 billion in the three fiscal years ending in 2017, as prudent leveraging of our balance sheet, combined with strong operating performance enabled us to significantly increase dividends and share repurchases.","Dividends over the six-year period increased an average of 24% annually and our earnings payout ratio is now nearly 50%. Today, we announced another 20% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.30 per share, and we also announced a new commitment to returning $15 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases over the next three years. As part of this action, we will increase our leverage to support debt ratings that are one notch lower than our current rating agency results. This reflects our confidence in the strength of the business and our commitment to increasing cash return to shareholders.","Let's now turn our attention to our financial targets for fiscal 2018. We expect global comp growth in fiscal 2018 to be in the 3% to 5% range. Complementing this comp growth will be the addition of approximately 2,300 net new (sic)[Starbucks] stores globally. Our China\/Asia-Pacific segment will drive roughly half of our global store growth in fiscal 2018, with 1,100 net new stores, nearly 600 in China. Our Americas segment plans to add 900 net new stores, split roughly evenly between company owned and licensed, and EMEA is targeting approximately 300 net new stores, virtually all licensed. While on the topic of store growth, I'd like to take a moment to specifically address questions concerning whether our U.S. sales are simply being transferred from existing stores to new stores as we grow our U.S. store portfolio.","And let me be clear, the effect of sales transfer on our U.S. store comp is small and stable, and the overall effect of new stores on comp and profit growth remains very positive. Net new store portfolio growth rates in the U.S. have been roughly 5% for the past few years and company-owned portfolio growth rates have been even lower at 4%. Our new store formats, including a strong mix of drive-through locations, improved real estate analytics, and the ability to use new stores to drive improved throughput in existing stores are all important factors in keeping the net impact on our financial returns from new stores in the U.S. a strong positive. The topic of new store sales transfer remains a non-issue for Starbucks.","It is important to note that our effects to streamline our business will have an impact on reported 2018 revenue growth. Specifically revenue will be impacted by the recent shifts in our retail store portfolio, including the pending acquisition of East China, and licensing of Taiwan and Singapore, and the strategic actions we are taking to exit our non-core activities including closing Teavana stores and the Starbucks e-commerce platform, selling TAZO and aggressively rationalizing merchandise available for sale in our U.S. retail sales. We estimate these changes will add two to three points to targeted revenue growth in the high single digits.","As it relates to GAAP EPS, the impact of these actions will be very positive given the large expected gains on East China and on TAZO. For non-GAAP EPS, the net impact will be relatively modest in 2018, flat to slightly accretive as the benefit from closing the Teavana mall stores and adding the East China business are offset by the Taiwan, TAZO, and Singapore transactions. Again, the cumulative impact of these moves will begin to become more meaningfully accretive to earnings growth as we move into the back half of fiscal 2018, and into 2019.","As a reminder, we will hold a detailed modeling call in January to take you through the specific impacts of the East China acquisition on CAP and total company results. Also we recognize that the cumulative effect of the strategic transaction and activities will have a meaningful impact on reported results, and we'll be sure you have a full reconciliation and a clear view on core revenue and earnings growth rates as we move through 2018.","Finally, it's important to note that the both the East China and TAZO transactions require regulatory approval prior to closing. Fiscal 2018 consolidated operating margin is expected to be up slightly relative to fiscal 2017, excluding the impact that the change in ownership structure in East China has on operating margin. We expect leverage on cost of goods sold as we continue to make progress against our savings target through 2021. We will grow core G&A at half of the rate of revenue growth, a goal we met in 2017 after adjusting both 2016 and 2017 for items affecting comparability. Notably, the incremental dollar impact from partner and digital investments is expected to be lower in 2018.","Looking at our segments, we expect our operating margin in the Americas to be up slightly relative to 2017, reflecting sales leverage, optimized labor deployment, and COGS and waste efficiencies. We expect moderate margin expansion from our CAP segment in 2018, excluding the impact from the change in the ownership structure for East China, driven by strong operating results throughout the region. We expect solid margin expansion from our EMEA segment in fiscal 2018. Channel Development will continue to grow share and deliver best in class performance in fiscal 2018 with slight margin expansion over the prior year.","As mentioned earlier, a significant portion of the 2017 favorability in channels was driven by commodities and COGS favorability that we don't see continuing at the same levels in 2018. Also we expect to see margin improvement from our NACP partnership, but again, at lower levels than 2017. With competitive pressures on the rise, we remain laser focused on driving profitable share growth as we head into calendar 2018.","Neither FX nor commodities are expected to have a major impact on year-over-year profit growth, and our coffee needs are roughly 75% price locked for fiscal 2018. We expect our effective tax rate for 2018 to be approximately 27%, including approximately 6 points of favorable impact from the planned acquisition of East China.","Capital expenditures in fiscal 2018 are expected to total roughly $2 billion, up from $1.5 billion in 2017. The increase is split evenly among investments in Siren Retail, store related capital, and our supply chain and corporate facilities. This last category includes the addition of roasting capacity to handle increased demand globally for Starbucks coffee.","Our GAAP EPS growth rate in fiscal 2018 is likely to be above 40%, given the large gains likely contributing over $0.50 of incremental EPS we expect from the East China and TAZO transactions. Given these inputs, we expect non-GAAP EPS growth of 12% to 13%, or $2.30 to $2.33 per share in fiscal 2018 with growth in the front half of the year, likely a bit below the full-year average, and growth in the back half somewhat above it. Three factors will drive this improved profitability over the course of 2018: The timing impact of the strategic actions we discussed earlier, with the impact increasing as we move into the back half of the year, operational savings in the U.S. business will ramp up over the course of the year, and buybacks will be more accretive to EPS each quarter in 2018.","As we entered fiscal 2017, the company was shaped to support a 5% or greater comp profile. Our investments, G&A expense and overall shape in the middle of the P&L required that level of growth to deliver on our 2017 commitments. Going forward we will complement our laser focus on delivering profitable growth with a renewed focus on driving operational efficiency, and to streamlining and reshaping the company in order to deliver or exceed the new financial targets we introduced today, while funding our investments, increasing our operating margins, driving further returns on invested capital and providing outsized returns to our shareholders. As always, credit for our ability to deliver another year and quarter of record performance belongs to our store partners who proudly wear the green apron, and deliver an elevated Starbucks experience to our customers all around the world every day.","With that, I'll turn the call back to the operator. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of John Ivankoe, JPMorgan.","John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, thank you, obviously a lot to get through on this call, but I'll limit my question to the cost side of the equation. Kevin, in your prepared marks, it seemed like you were opening the door to what may actually be a significant kind of rethink or redo from the cost structure of the business. I think you mentioned both G&A in the middle of the P&L, but in Scott's remarks we're still talking about G&A growing at half the amount of revenue, and at least I didn't pick up anything discrete that was happening at the store level from a cost perspective. So I just wanted to kind of juxtapose those two different themes of conversation, because I heard different things, and to the extent that revenue isn't quite what we want, how much of an opportunity is there at the store-level P&L and G&A relative to the initial guidance that you've given for fiscal 2018? Thanks.","Scott Maw - Starbucks Corp.","Thanks, John, I'll start and then I'll turn it over to John Culver. The first thing I would say is in the core G&A of the business, there is still significant opportunity to drive leverage. We have a target of growing core G&A at half the rate of leverage, but that's \u2013 or half the rate of revenue, but that's just the target. We will try to beat that. And what's important as we move through these streamlining opportunities, selling TAZO, licensing more markets, we'll be able to lean in on corporate and business unit G&A further because the simplified operations give us that opportunity. And then what is a little bit new this time, and where we're really digging in, is really around labor and waste in particular in the U.S. business, and there's significant opportunity there, and I think we should give you some specifics on that. And I'll have John do that.","John Culver - Starbucks Corp.","Yeah, John, just real quick, clearly the biggest driver of the growth is going to be transaction growth, and how do we continue to accelerate transactions, both in terms of driving more product innovation in the stores, driving more throughput through our existing stores, and then continuing to enhance these digital relationships. That will allow us to drive leverage into the P&L. Last quarter was our best growth quarter in terms of transactions in six quarters. So we're starting to get traction there.","Secondly, this work around labor and deployment is critical. We're doing a lot of work around how we're deploying labor in our stores, looking at both ends in terms of where we want to invest to drive more throughput and productivity, as well as where we need to pull back if we need to.","We are looking at this through the lens of what labor investments are going to be revenue and margin accretive, and really, given the work that Matt and his team have done with the analytics they now provide us on a per-store basis, we're able to go in and look at it on a per-store basis and a much more detailed view in terms of sales mix, in terms of the channels that are operating in those stores, and then also just the overall format of the store.","And then the other piece that we're looking at and doing a lot of work on, beyond the labor and deployment, is around COGS and the COGS savings. And last, at the analyst conference, we made a big commitment in terms of COGS savings over the course of now, between 20 and 21, and we're committed to delivering those savings, and we're on track to do so. That will continue to drive more leverage in the P&L.","And then the last piece is around waste in the stores, and how do we manage more effectively waste, and then while at the same time increasing overall availability of our products in our stores, so that we can sell more product. So that's another big piece.","And then this last area, I would just say is around, how do we continue to rationalize SKUs, and look at the number of SKUs that we have in our stores. We feel that this is an area of big opportunity for us, and creates a big unlock for our stores and our partners, and this falls into the work that we're doing around the streamline activity in the stores.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sharon Zackfia from William Blair.","Sharon Zackfia - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hi, good afternoon. Hi. I guess a question on kind of the algorithm going forward, Scott. So I appreciate the guidance specifically for 2018. I guess longer term with that comp range being 3% to 5%, could you give us an idea of what that 5% would equate to for earnings growth? And I'm assuming all of these investments or things that are going on in 2018 make that relationship not hold, and if I'm wrong, if you could correct me?","Scott Maw - Starbucks Corp.","Yeah, thanks, Sharon, what I would say is, as we exit 2018, we'll be growing earnings per share higher than the range that we gave for 2018. So we gave 12% to 13%, we'll have accelerating profitability, as we move throughout the year and there's two big drivers of that. The first is the things that John talks about around store operations, that will layer in over time.","And the second big driver is all the things that we're doing around project streamline, what we call project streamline, the streamlining and focus of the operations. The big increment in those activities is around East China, and the exit of our Teavana stores, which as you know are a drag on earnings, and so all of that will help shape our profile.","To get to your specific question, and the way I think about the upper end of the EPS algorithm, if you want to call it that, is if you look at what we did with revenue guidance and comp guidance, as we brought it down a bit, and we brought the lower end of our EPS guidance down to 12%. Our old guidance was 15% to 20%. I would say a similar move down at the high end is probably the way to think about the upper end of that guidance. So as we accelerate all the savings we'll get through streamlining our operations, we bring in East China, and if we get additional comp growth, then that would be upside even to the guidance we gave this year.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Tarantino, Robert W. Baird.","David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hi, good afternoon. My question is on the comp trends, and first, just a clarification. The check trends or the ticket contribution this quarter was less than what it has been in the past, so could you talk about the factors that drove that, I guess smaller benefit from the ticket. And then secondly, as you think about the outlook for this year, in the 3% to 5% range you provided, I guess what are the factors that are giving you the most confidence in being able to guide that way, given the most recent quarter was at the low end of that?","Scott Maw - Starbucks Corp.","Okay. David, I'll start and then I'll hand it over to Kevin for the second part. So some of the mechanics on ticket, it's important to remember that the order consolidation impact of the change that we had in the Starbucks Reward program has two equal and offsetting impacts you'll recall. It brought transactions down, but it also brought ticket up, as the sort of incentive to split orders went away. And so transactions, as you know, have been depressed over the last five quarters because of that and ticket has been higher over the last five quarters because of that, and this is the first quarter that we fully lap that impact. So that's the first thing.","The second thing is, we've had for the last few years one point to two points of pricing that we've taken pretty much every quarter. We were on the lower end of that range this quarter. That's pretty much related to timing. There's nothing that we're signaling there. Our pricing moves are still taking hold the way that we expect, and we'll continue to lean in where we see opportunities there.","And then the third thing that we talked about a little bit in the prepared remarks is the afternoon day-part, and what's important to understand about the afternoon day-part is it does have a higher ticket. You get more attach, more multiple beverage ticket, and obviously Frappuccino has a little bit higher ticket.","So those are the three big pieces.","Kevin Johnson - Starbucks Corp.","Yeah, David, this is Kevin. I would just add what gives us confidence in terms of that guide for the 3% to 5% comp in FY18, I think, first of all, as we look at data and have analyzed the overall U.S. retail restaurant industry, certainly that has shown very flat comparables \u2013 even a little bit negative traffic, and we've consistently outperformed that. Over the last two years, we have consistently sort of been in that range of 3% to 5%. But then I would just comment, as we go into Q1, we have a very solid holiday plan in place, and the start to this quarter gives me added confidence that the guidance we've given you for FY18 is not only achievable, but we feel like we've got line of sight to what we've got to execute against and we're executing against the right priorities and see evidence in every one of those areas that our work is paying off.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Glass, Morgan Stanley.","John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks very much. Regarding the investments you are making \u2013 you have made over time. We've talked about investment, but it has never been clear. Are these just required increases in compensation, for example at the partner level, how much of this is sort of related to growth? So Scott, can you just talk about what that investment, however you want to break it down, was in 2017 and maybe how you can relate that to what the incremental is going to be in 2018? Just so we can sort of frame that. And I think you talked about your cost structure is built historically on a 5% comp, and obviously that made this year more challenging. What comp did you build your cost structure off of in 2018? Thanks.","Scott Maw - Starbucks Corp.","It's a good question. Thanks, John. So the first part of the question, what I would say is, you'll recall we have $250 million of partner and digital investments in 2017. That's right where we landed. The biggest portion of that was related to partner investments, and the biggest portion of that is wage, but the vast majority of that wage investment we're making is not mandated. It's not minimum-wage driven or mandated by cities or states. It's really what we're trying to do to make sure we're investing in our partners in the right way. And as you know, we have turnover rates that are significantly below everyone else in the industry. We have seen turnover in the last year come down across every category within our stores. So we know when we get that part right. We see customer service scores at the highest they have ever been. Partner experience scores at the highest that we would \u2013 that they've ever been. So we know when we get that right, it pays off for us. So the biggest piece is voluntary wage investments, and that will continue.","As we roll into 2018, what I will tell you is there will be a little bit lower dollar amount investment in wage. It's still significant, but it's a little bit lower, so there's a bit more flow through in the U.S. P&L as a result of a little bit lower wage investment.","And then to your specific question, we built that 12% to 13% EPS growth assuming the lower end of the range, and so we should be able to deliver that at a 3%-plus comp, and that's the way we wanted to be shaped, and the goal is obviously, with all of the things that Kevin talked about on the topline is to try to beat that.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein from Barclays.","Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thank you very much. Just following up on that kind of comp driving earnings type question, as I look at the fiscal 2018 and the long-term global comp guidance, and you're talking about 3% to 5%, and you're talking about EPS long term of 12% plus. I just wanted to get kind of the thought process around how you arrived at those specifically? Especially from a comp perspective, you just did a 3% in fiscal 2017, and it seems like it was a 3% in fiscal fourth quarter, and that's down from kind of mid to high-single digits over the past five plus years. So I'm wondering what gives you confidence to view that as a conservative bar rather than having to deal with kind of questioning it every quarter, because you're running on the lower end of that. And I guess, it will be the same thing for earnings. Just because you're guiding to 12% plus, but the year just ended, you did 11%, so it doesn't seem as if those are necessarily conservative targets. So I'm just wondering kind of bigger-picture thought process, how you arrive at that, versus perhaps setting the bar lower, and therefore making it easier to exceed.","Kevin Johnson - Starbucks Corp.","Well, let me start, Jeffrey. On the question. First of all, thanks for that. I think we go through an entire process. We build a five-year strategic plan, and we build a bottoms up five-year financial plan from that strategic plan, looking at every geography and understanding the dynamics in each of those markets. And it's that financial plan that informs us on the growth in terms of new stores. It informs us on the same-store comparable growth that we expect in these markets.","And I think that \u2013 coming out of that strat plan is what drove many of the streamlining activities that you are seeing. Certainly where we look at markets that are slower growth, or don't have the opportunity for as much new store growth, clearly those are markets that are better transitioned to licensed markets, and that's why we've been executing down that path.","You know, the contrast to that then, is China, where we see the growth opportunity that we have ahead in China. And we've been in China, now 17 years or 18 years, and I think if you look at sort of what we have been posting on same-store comparables there, I think, China is the second largest and fastest growing market for Starbucks. It is the second-largest economy in the world. It is an economy that will have a growing middle class, doubling from roughly 300 million people to 600 million people, and so when we look at the global comp numbers, we look at the balance of the opportunities we have, and certainly two powerful growth engines being the U.S. and China. And so, I'll start there.","So if you look then, at the U.S., I think if we look at our U.S. data, it shows us that the overall retail industry disruption that is changing consumer behavior and traffic, data would show that it has had some impact on the overall U.S. retail restaurant sector, which has shown negative traffic here over the last year, where we have been showing positive comps and the traffic that we posted has been above that. Now at some point that turns, so you say, okay, well, in addition to looking for that number to turn, the initiatives that we have been driving, specifically through-put at peak, now the morning peak is the most important day-part at Starbucks. Certainly in the U.S., if you look at the volume that we do. All the actions that John took you through, and the team have been driving have generated demonstrable measurable progress at peak, in this \u2013 every quarter since we started those initiatives, and it just keeps getting stronger. We've got continuous improvement plan there that shows us we are growing through-put at peak, and at the same time, we are improving the customer experience. So I think that gives us evidence that certainly we have line of sight to what we need to deliver to be in that comp range in the U.S., and we have doubled down in China. And I think the combination of those two things gives us confidence that a 3% to 5% comp growth for the long-term guidance is the appropriate number to set it at. And from there, I think then the rest of the numbers fall into place.","Operator","Your next question comes from Sara Senatore from Bernstein.","Kevin Johnson - Starbucks Corp.","Sara? Sara, we can't hear you.","Operator","At this time, there is no response from Ms. Senatore. Her question has been withdrawn, and I will...","Sara Harkavy Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hello? I'm here.","Kevin Johnson - Starbucks Corp.","Hi, Sara.","Sara Harkavy Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi, sorry about that. Having some technical difficulties. Thanks.","Kevin Johnson - Starbucks Corp.","Sara, we're getting about every other word.","Sara Harkavy Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. You know what? I'm going to let my associate ask the question then. Steph, can you ask the question?","Stephanie Mun-Yee Ng - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. So you seemed very positive on the rollout in \u2013 or actually in Mobile Order & Pay in Japan, and yet based off the CAP comp it remains kind of a drag on CAP comps. Now that you have taken the business and turned it around, does it make sense to think about licensing it again?","John Culver - Starbucks Corp.","This is John. We have no intention of licensing the Japan business. We made a significant investment to buy that business back, because we believe in the long-term growth opportunity in that market. We now operate 1,300 stores there across all prefectures. We opened a record number of 90 stores this year, and the new-store performance continues to be very strong, and when you dig up underneath Japan, and really the numbers around Japan, Scott talked about the afternoon softness that we saw. That was particularly related to our blended beverage LTOs that account for about over 40% of sales during the summer period, but when you go beyond that and look at our core business of espresso, very strong performance. Tea, very strong performance. Food, strong growth there. And we saw momentum in the quarter, particularly in September build. We launched MSR in Japan in the middle of September. We now have nearly 2 million members on the rewards program, and we're excited with the opportunity that the digital flywheel presents for us there.","And then when you look at \u2013 in terms of are we growing our share in Japan, given our store growth, given our overall organic growth, we are outpacing the competition and actually taking share in that market. So we are bullish on Japan, and we have a long-term commitment to that market.","Scott Maw - Starbucks Corp.","And I would just add a couple financial points to that. If you go back to the deal model that we put together for Japan a few years ago, we're actually ahead of that deal model on every measure, except for comp. So revenue is ahead, profitability is ahead, profit margin is ahead. And that's because of the performance of new stores and the overall performance and strength of the market since we purchased. So we're trying to make sure we don't over focus on comps. We understand it's a challenge in Japan, but once we work our way through this blended mix issue, then you're going to see that profitability come through much more clearly.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Palmer from RBC Capital Markets.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you. Just a quick clarification. I think there's some confusion on this, but could you just touch on, Scott, the profit growth and tax assumptions embedded in your fiscal 2018 guidance? And then just separately a follow-up on initiatives that give you the most confidence that 3% would be the low point for comps. You talked about throughput and then you touched on a variety of other things, including things that would touch on the big three, digital, food, and beverage. If you had to sort of rank order the things that give you the most confidence or you think would be the most meaningful beyond the throughput initiatives, what do you think those would be? Thank you.","Scott Maw - Starbucks Corp.","Sure, David. So the overall profit growth, EPS growth on a non-GAAP basis will be 12% to 13%. I did say the tax rate would be 27%, but that's really impacted by the transaction in East China, assuming it closes. So we don't have any assumption of any change in the actual tax regulation in any of our major economies, particularly in the U.S. It's pretty much assumed status quo, but it's lower next year, specifically because of that transaction in East China, assuming it closes. And I think on the strength in comps, I'll hand it over to Kevin.","Kevin Johnson - Starbucks Corp.","Yeah, David, in terms of the things that I would stack rank around the initiatives that have, I think, the most impact on confidence of those comps: number one would be throughput at peak. That is the most important day-part, and with the work that's been done, and the roadmap and continuous improvement ahead, we have never been stronger. And so we grow at peak, we grow comps.","Number two, digital. It's predictable, it's powerful, and we're expand \u2013 we're widening the aperture of it by opening up Mobile Order & Pay to more customers. That will be another powerful driver of confidence. And the third is food, and with food, we continue to make very good progress that contributes to that. We're now over 21% of the mix, and good reception on what we're getting with the lunch day-part, good performance in the morning, and the continued innovation around beverage. So I think food and beverage innovation pipeline we have is just going to continue to crank, but I think added to that, the throughput at peak and the digital are going to be key drivers, and all of those give us confidence.","Operator","Your next question comes from Matthew DiFrisco with Guggenheim Securities.","Matthew DiFrisco - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Thank you. I just have one clarification I just want to ask first and then I have a question. The GAAP tax rate is 27%, and you're not implying that 27% is part of the 12% to 13% algorithm for operating income or EPS growth?","Scott Maw - Starbucks Corp.","That is correct.","Matthew DiFrisco - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Okay. So it's more comparable the tax rate. Understood. And then was share repurchase included in that?","Scott Maw - Starbucks Corp.","Share repurchase is included in that. And in fact, one of the reasons we have accelerating profitability as we move through the year is share repurchases will help earnings per share a little bit more each quarter.","Matthew DiFrisco - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Of course.","Operator","Your next question comes from Karen Holthouse from Goldman Sachs.","Karen Holthouse - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hi. A quick housekeeping and then an actual question. Looking at the unit growth guidance in CAP, can you give a sense of how we should think about the breakdown between company and licensed maybe this year and then longer term when you're thinking about your post-business mix changes there? And then thinking about the timeline of some of the things you mentioned as drivers of excitement, my understanding was that a broader expansion of the accessibility to Mobile Order & Pay or this digital relationship was going to be more of a 2019 initiative. Is that something that could actually start to benefit in fiscal '18? And are you seeing any earlier benefits from just the more streamlined sign-up process within the existing stored value platform? Thanks.","Scott Maw - Starbucks Corp.","Yeah. Thanks, Karen. We didn't give the ownership split in CAP on purpose. Because of the pending acquisition it was really hard to know. We don't have regulatory approval exactly how the stores are going to open and 100% when we were going to close. But I'll answer the second part of your question because I think it was really around what's it going to be going forward? So I think we said 1,100 stores in CAP, 600 stores in China. If the deal closes, those 600 stores would obviously be all company owned. So you're looking at about 50\/50 company-owned and licensed as we move through time. And I think I'll kick the second question over to Matt.","Matthew Ryan - Starbucks Corp.","Sure. Thanks for the question there. With regard to Mobile Order & Pay, we have found a way to accelerate versus our original intention. Now I want to point out that it's not a 'go great immediately' thing. We'll be ramping into it across the year. So it's one of the reasons why we have additional confidence that our business will be gaining momentum throughout the year, number one.","And with regard to the sign-up, we have, in fact started to see ourselves beat the typical seasonality with regard to customer acquisition. We have been talking about the fact that we will be leaning in there. That is precisely what we're doing. So if you've signed up for Mobile Order & Pay recently, you've noticed that the process has gotten better, and we are in recent weeks and months starting to see that in our business. You're going to continue to see us lean in across this year in acquiring digital relationships, first of all, within Starbucks Rewards, but then via other means, including Mobile Order & Pay that doesn't require a stored value card.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brett Levy, Deutsche Bank.","Brett Levy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good afternoon. I was just curious, you were \u2013 with respect to the Mobile Order & Pay, you had mentioned...","Kevin Johnson - Starbucks Corp.","I think we lost him.","Operator","Yes his line has been cleared from the queue. Your next question comes from Greg Badishkanian from Citigroup.","Gregory Robert Badishkanian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Great, thanks. So it sounds like the U.S. same-store sales should be around 3% to 5% from your comments. So I just wanted to make sure that that \u2013 I kind of read into that correctly. And then what are you assuming for the competitive environment as well as the macro environment? And the headwinds mentioned in your prepared remarks, do you assume that some of those moderate a bit over the coming year or even for your long-term to achieve that long-term target?","Scott Maw - Starbucks Corp.","Yeah, I would say if you do the math on our total company comps, they tend to follow very, very closely with the U.S. business just given the size. And on the second part, maybe I'll turn it over to Kevin.","Kevin Johnson - Starbucks Corp.","Yeah, I think on the second part, Greg, when we look at the data that we study, we look at a lot of different sources of data, and I'm sure many of them are sources that you use as well, variety of industry studies, credit card data, and other research to track comps in the away-from-home restaurant industry. And I think what it's shown is over the last year, it's been relatively flat with slightly negative transactions, and we know that over time that number continues to grow. And so at some point that turns, but I think we see some evidence near term that that's beginning to happen, but it's premature to call that.","I don't know, Matt, if you want to add any more in terms of the analysis on this, but I think the long-term prospect of \u2013 or assumption we made when we looked at the 3% to 5% comps that we set in the U.S. was that that number was going to stay at that point, and that gave us the confidence that this guide gave us upside in the U.S. performance.","Operator","Your next question comes from Dennis Geiger, UBS.","Dennis Geiger - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thanks for the question. I just wanted to circle back on the loyalty program. Just any thoughts how relevant that still will be to grow that program, particularly if Mobile Order & Pay doesn't require it. I guess just building on that, do you have good data or a sense for how big the pool of potential customers can be for that program, given we've kind of been in this range for a few quarters now. And just anything that you could add on this leaning in, certainly linking the card directly, your expectations for that, just any more detail on growing that base, given how strong the performance of that member program is? Thank you.","Matthew Ryan - Starbucks Corp.","Thanks. Matt Ryan here again on that one. We are extremely optimistic about the program as well as growing digital relationships outside of the program. And we have opened up the aperture, if you will, to explore additional ways of acquiring digital relationships. I think a couple things are really important to look at. We have seen 11% year on growth in our membership, and recently we've started to see an uptick because of the improvements to sign-on that we've put into place. But the even more impressive metric is we have seen from members 8% year-on-year growth. That is a function of a couple of things. It is a function of Mobile Order & Pay, but even more important has been the use of personalization, the customized offers and communications we put in people's hands.","We know that when we can talk to our customers through our own channels, like our app, like email, we can get a terrific response out of our customers. If you want to think about it, 8% comp from our members this year. And as we expand the number of people we bring into our digital fold, both inside the program and outside of the program, we see a great deal of upside. Just as a reminder, we have 75 million unique customers coming through our store, and right now we're counting 13.3 million of them signed up for Starbucks Rewards. There is a lot of upside there. And even when you sign up, people who are further down the food chain who are not as engaged with Starbucks, we see tremendous incrementality when they do become directly engaged with us.","John Culver - Starbucks Corp.","And I would just add, Dennis, to Matt's comments, in the U.S. specifically around Mobile Order & Pay and the impact that's having, we ended the quarter at 10% of transactions were Mobile Order & Pay and actually accelerated through the quarter where we exited the quarter at 11%. So these digital relationships and the ability to continue to bring customers into the fold is critical.","Matthew Ryan - Starbucks Corp.","And just to pile on there, please bear with me, I think it's important to recognize that we had turned off marketing for Mobile Order & Pay for a good while because we were focused on getting the operations right. It was just toward the end of the quarter that we were able to turn it back on, hence the acceleration up to 11% that John just mentioned, so we're very optimistic about Mobile Order & Pay.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brett Levy from Deutsche Bank.","Brett Levy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","At least we'll try this time. Getting used to this whole technology thing. I'm not quite as good as you guys are. If you could share a little bit more color on what you're looking at in terms of the capital plans and leverage, how you're thinking about the buybacks. Should we assume that this'll just be open market opportunistic? Will you consider things like ASRs out there? And should we think about this as a constant steady-state, pretty seasonal on a quarterly basis? Thank you.","Scott Maw - Starbucks Corp.","Yeah, thanks for the question. It will be front-end loaded a bit in 2018, and within 2018 in the first quarter. So if you look at that $15 billion, it's definitely ratably over the three years, but a little bit more in 2018 and a little bit more early in the quarter. We don't plan to use an ASR right now, but that's a tool that we will use if we want to access the market and take the shares out in a large chunk, but right now it'll be opportunistic open market. And we've done some back testing and we actually performed better than an ASR using that. The other thing I would just make sure you understand is the vast majority of that $15 billion will actually come from cash flow in the business. So we will increase debt, we will increase leverage, but the biggest source of that over three years is just the strong operating cash flow within the business.","Brett Levy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Nicole Miller from Piper Jaffray.","Nicole M. Miller Regan - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Thank you, good afternoon. I wanted to ask about Channel Development, and I was wondering if I've calculated this correctly, I think the operating margin is as significant as the CAP region. So do you see that as a powerful growth engine as well? And related to that, could COGS inflation positively impact the top line next year? And then just a very loose follow-on if I may. Could you give some modeling suggestions around removing TAZO, and what's the plan for those proceeds? Thank you.","John Culver - Starbucks Corp.","I'll take the first part, and then I'll turn the second piece over to Scott to answer it. We remain very bullish on the opportunity that Channel Development presents for us and see it as a continued growth engine. It is a $2 billion business this past year, and the margin is up near 48% overall. In the quarter, we grew top line 8%, which is great, but more importantly, is the share gains that we're seeing both across K-Cup as well as packaged coffee, and when you look at our share growth, it's 2 times as fast as the overall category growth. So if you remember back to Investor Day, we shared that we felt that the overall grocery category for coffee would decelerate. We've seen that, but we continue to capture more than our fair share of the share growth in premium coffee and packaged coffee overall.","K-Cups \u2013 we're the number one brand with over 16 share. Our brand, Starbucks, grew 16 times the rate of the category, and 2 times our nearest competitor in the quarter. And total Starbucks, including SBC grew 50% faster than any branded coffee company. So clearly, Channel Development is a growth engine. We are very optimistic about the future. Not only in the U.S., but then also when you look at international, we've got the Anheuser-Busch relationship with Teavana. We're going to double down on Teavana now in channels, and launch RTD nationally. And then also we'll be launching Teavana sachets down the aisle later this year, and so we're excited about that, so we feel very good about the business.","Scott Maw - Starbucks Corp.","And on the question on proceeds Nicole, I think what I would say is if you look at the broad set of activities that Kevin talked about around streamlining our operations, it includes selling our Taiwan market, licensing our Singapore market, licensing our Germany market a little over a year ago. Selling TAZO, and exiting a couple of other pieces of our business. All of those businesses had lower levels of returns and lower profit and revenue growth rates than the businesses we're investing in. And the biggest one to talk about is obviously East China. So if you add up the proceeds of all four of those transactions, it paid for a material portion of East China. And the returns and growth rate obviously for us China if you look at the numbers we just posted this quarter, are significantly higher. So that's how we're thinking about it. We'll continue to evaluate that as we move forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from Andrew Charles, Cowen and Company.","Andrew Charles - Cowen and Company, LLC","Great, thank you. Just to play devil's advocate, why not accelerate the amount of U.S. store models if this is the biggest piece to improving morning throughput, accelerating the rollout of Nitro Cold Brew. I realize it's going to be capital intensive, but provided the expected ROIC was greater than the 25%-plus target and give greater visibility and in resetting U.S. comps, and why not? And also just one clarification, were beverage comps in the quarter, were they 1% or flat in 4Q when you include the drag from Frappuccino and the hurricanes. Thank you.","Scott Maw - Starbucks Corp.","John, do you want to start with the renovations, I'll take...?","John Culver - Starbucks Corp.","Yeah, I think for us, we continue to focus on our new stores, and obviously existing stores in terms of the renovations. And as we have innovation to bring into those stores, we are planning the capital in order to go in and renovate stores. So Nitro Cold Brew is a great example. We have it right now in approximately 500 stores across the U.S., and we're seeing good growth from that. We have plans to continue to monitor that and continue to grow it. In addition, you're also looking at other innovation that we're going to be bringing into the stores to drive the same store sales.","Kevin talked about plant-based beverages and alternatives. That is a big area of opportunity for us, and our customers are asking for it. We're also seeing very strong growth as it relates to iced and refreshment. Iced and refreshment, in the quarter iced espresso grew 15%, and refreshment grew 24%, so iced and that area of the business presents a big opportunity. And then the last area is how do we continue to capture this opportunity that we're seeing on food and the attach rate that we're seeing. In the quarter, we grew food 15% year-over-year, and food now is 21% of the overall mix of what we're selling through our U.S. stores. We're seeing good strong growth on breakfast sandwiches. We're seeing good strong growth on Sous Vide Egg Bites. We now have that available in all of our stores across the U.S., and then the last area is in the protein bistro boxes, and the impact that those are having. So we remain bullish on the existing stores, and continue to drive more innovation into it, whether that is related to coffee, whether that's related to food, or whether that's related to the digital experience.","Scott Maw - Starbucks Corp.","And just to get to the last part of your question, yes, we had 1 point of beverage comp, 2 points of food comp. And I talked a little bit about the mix challenge. It's really an opportunity for us on beverage. John talked a lot about the things that we see to try to drive additional beverage comps. The mix impact on COGS was really not a food-cost issue, but really an opportunity around additional beverage comps. And as we move into the New Year, we've got lots of plans to try to accelerate that.","Operator","The last question comes from the line of Jason West from Credit Suisse.","Jason West - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Yeah, thanks. Just a couple of clarifications and then a question, first where was the $50 million donation in the P&L? And then Scott, I think you said you expect high single-digit revenue growth this year, including the China deal. Just want to confirm that. And then the bigger question was the margins in the Americas segment were down several hundred basis points in the quarter, the guidance of up margins in that segment this coming year, just can you talk about what's going to change there versus what we just saw in the last few quarters, really? Thanks.","Scott Maw - Starbucks Corp.","Yeah, so the foundation donation was in G&A expense. The impact of East China is not in that high single-digit number. It's really in that 2 to 3 additional points that I talked about, which is the net of selling TAZO, licensing Taiwan and buying East China, all of those puts and takes we think add 2 to 3 points on top of that. And then the acceleration in the U.S. business, John, really talked about it, but it is important.","So in this quarter, it was among the highest quarters we've had since we started the significant U.S. partner investment. The impact on margin this quarter, I think, we called it out as 130 basis points. There was also about 40 basis points of impact from the storm, and then 90 basis point of mix. And again, I talked about the opportunity we have in beverage. As we look forward and we look at slight margin expansion, frankly as early as Q1, it's really those things that John talked about that will drive that. Yes, some opportunity on the top line, but really going after waste in the middle of the P&L, going after optimized labor, and when we say optimized labor, those stores that need more labor to drive additional revenue, and those stores that might have a little bit too much labor, and there might be an opportunity to redeploy. So all of those things are focused at driving additional margin. Little bit of lower partner investments help year-over-year, but it's really about getting after the middle of the P&L.","Operator","I will now turn the call over to Mr. Shaw for his closing remarks.","Tom Shaw - Starbucks Corp.","Yeah, thank you. Before closing today's call, we wanted to give you visibility into our investor outreach calendar for 2018. Specifically related to two events that we have tentatively planned. During the week of May 14, we'll be in Shanghai for our China investor tour, which will include an experience at our Shanghai Roastery, presentations from our local leadership team and tours of several of our stores in the city. We'll provide more details as dates are finalized over the next couple of months.","Then concluding the year, we'll once again have our bi-annual Investor Day in December to provide a deeper understanding of our global strategy and financials. In the meantime, we look forward to speaking with you again on our first quarter 2018 results conference call, which has been tentatively scheduled for Thursday, January 25.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Starbucks Coffee Company\u2019s First Quarter Fiscal Year 2015 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","Thank you. Ms. DeGrande, you may begin your conference.","JoAnn DeGrande","Thank you, Mike. Good afternoon. This is JoAnn DeGrande, Vice President of Investor Relations for Starbucks Coffee Company. Thank you for joining us today to discuss our first quarter fiscal 2015 results, which will be led by Howard Schultz, Chairman, President and CEO; and Scott Maw, CFO. Also joining us for Q&A are Troy Alstead, COO; Cliff Burrows, Group President, U.S., Americas and Teavana; John Culver, Group President, China, Asia Pacific, Channel Development and Emerging Brands; Adam Brotman, Chief Digital Officer; and Matt Ryan, Global Chief Strategy Officer.","This conference will include forward-looking statements, which are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements.","Any such statements should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements in our earnings release and risk factor discussions in our filings with the SEC, including our last annual report on Form 10-K. Starbucks assumes no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements or information.","Please refer to our website, at investor.starbucks.com to find a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures referenced in today\u2019s call with our corresponding GAAP measures.","This conference call is being webcast and an archive of the webcast will be available on our website at investor.starbucks.com.","Before I turn the call over to Howard, please note that our Annual Meeting of Shareholders, which will be webcast will be held at 10 a.m. Pacific Time on Wednesday, March 18th here in Seattle.","With that, let me turn the call over to Howard.","Howard Schultz","Thank you, JoAnn, and welcome to everyone on today\u2019s call. Starbucks performance in Q1 was exceptional by any standard or metric. Financially each of Starbucks\u2019 principal business segments and each of the regions around the world which we operate contributed meaningfully to record Q1 revenues of $4.8 billion, record Q1 operating income of $916 million and record Q1 EPS of $1.30 on a GAAP basis and record $0.80 when excluding non-routine items, principally the gain on our acquisition of Starbucks Japan.","Operationally we delivered the best in-store holiday experience to customers in our history, bar none, with comp sales accelerating through the quarter and December\u2019s performance reflecting the success of our holiday lineup.","For the quarter, we drove nearly 9 million more customer transactions through our U.S. stores than we did in Q1 last year, almost 12 million more globally and our global comp store sales grew 5%, with 2% coming from increased traffic, representing our 20th consecutive quarter of comp growth of 5% or greater.","And every geographic region contribute to our performance this quarter with Americas delivering 5% comp growth, EMEA 4% and CAP 8%. These results are nothing short of stunning, particularly when you consider that our comps were calculated off of the U.S. store base of almost 7,000 stores and our global store base of almost 10,000 stores.","Our Channel Development segment grew sales 10% and delivered strong profitability. At the same time, we increased our share of premium single serve, premium packaged coffee and premium packaged tea, and we delivered record non-GAAP operating margin across the company of 19.5% for the quarter, an 80 basis points increased over Q1 last year.","I will be discussing a number of strategic initiatives and innovations that took shape in the quarter that will further extend our global coffee authority and leadership in retail and mobile technology and set us up to continue to lead and win around the world into the future, then I will turn the call over to Scott, who will take you through our Q1 financial and operating results in detail.","I\u2019ll start with our re-imagined in-store holiday experience that integrated and leveraged food and beverage innovation with all of Starbucks digital, loyalty, card, mobile, store footprint and partner assets to deliver the most successful holiday in our 40 plus year history.","Our new holiday seasonal beverage Chestnut Praline Latte was a huge hit with customers and one of our most successful LTOs ever. Our food platform driven by new and innovative holiday offerings, as well as our new lunch program continued to gain momentum during the quarter, contributing to incremental traffic and day part growth and our [Dot] [ph] Collection of premium, highly styled merchandise performed very well as well.","But the really big news is how powerfully the innovation of our card wall and vastly expanded selection of proprietary Starbucks gift cards enabled customers to give a Starbucks gift of choice throughout the season.","To put the success of our holiday card program into perspective consider these following metrics. This holiday, one in seven American adults received the Starbucks gift card, up from one in eight last year. Roughly 2.6 million Starbucks cards were activated on December 23rd alone and $1.6 billion was loaded on cards in U.S. and Canada in Q1, up 17% over last year.","The strength and success of our Starbucks card program reflects both the power and the growing relevancy of the Starbucks brand is further demonstrated by the fact that over 31-day period more than 13 million customers entered into our first ever, it\u2019s a Wonderful Card sweepstakes, so the chance to win Starbucks for Life.","Going forward, we know that increase Starbucks card sales drives My Starbucks Rewards membership and in turn traffic in our stores. We added almost 900,000 new MSR members in Q1 alone, bringing our total membership to over 9 million, 23% over above, where we were at this time last year and 5.5 million of our MSR members are gold members.","We are already seeing and realizing the benefit of increased activity in our stores as gift cards received over holiday are redeemed and have additional enhancements to the MSR program planned and have confident will continue to result in even further acceleration in MSR membership in the future.","It should be noted that MSR is one of the most important business drivers as new members contribute not only short-term increases in revenue and profit, but also long-term loyalty for years to come.","We continue to see broad customer acceptance and adoption of our mobile payment technologies. Today in the U.S. alone over 13 million customers are actively using our mobile apps and we're now averaging over 7 million mobile transactions in our stores each week, representing roughly 16% of total tender, more than any other bricks and mortar retailer in the marketplace.","In December we introduced Mobile Order and Pay into 150 stores in Portland, Oregon. The Starbucks Mobile Order and Pay experience is a proprietary, fully integrated technology that allows customers to order their food and beverage selections through their mobile device, ahead of time, go to their preferred store and pick up the completed order and pay automatically through the same mobile device that they ordered for.","Mobile Order and Pay saves our customers time by enabling them to avoid the lines and waiting for the orders to be filled, resulting in shorter lines, faster service and improved in-store execution and an elevated Starbucks experience.","Mobile Order and Pay has been extremely well-received by customers in the Portland market. We will be launching it now in over 600 stores in the Pacific Northwest in the months ahead and will be rolled out nationally later in calendar 2015.","Our experience to-date confirms that once fully rolled out, Mobile Order and Pay will drive a significant increase in mobile payment transaction in our stores overall and have a flywheel positive effect on our overall business, driving both increased MSR membership and app usage and creating significant additional one-to-one marketing opportunities.","As previously discussed, we are also preparing for the introduction of delivery in the second half of 2015 and are finalizing plans for two distinct delivery models. One of which utilizes our own people, Green Apron barista and the other which leverages the capabilities of a third-party service.","We will have more to share with you on our plans for delivery in the months ahead, but rest assure that delivery like Mobile Order and Pay will drive incrementality and increased customer loyalty.","Global leadership around all things coffee is and will always remain at our core, as we continue to innovate and invest to enhance and elevate the premium highly differentiated, but locally relevant coffee experience we deliver to our customers around the world.","This month we successfully introduced Flat White, an espresso-forward handcrafted beverage that combines premium coffee quality with creative artistry to deliver a unique and elegantly delicious hot beverage. While it\u2019s very early in its early days for Flat White, we have already seeing great attachment for our customers and we are exceeding the early expectations.","Many of you on the call today have the unique opportunity to experience the Starbucks Reserve Roastery and Tasting Room first hand when you were in Seattle for our Investor Day, while I am delighted to report that the Roastery has received an overwhelming response from our customers and has been the strongest opening in the 40 plus history of our company, well exceeding even our most optimistic projections. The Roastery is setting new records every week, at the same time as it draws both repeat customers and visitors to Seattle at all hours of the day and evening.","Personally I feel the Roastery is the finest, most creative and immersive experiential retail environment of any in the world today. There should be no coincidence that the Roastery opened in the same year that we identified and shared with you the urgent need for retailers to elevate, deepen and ultimately redefine how they were emotionally connecting with their customers.","The Roastery represents both premiumization of the coffee experience and a new chapter for Starbucks. The additional small batch coffee roasting capacity provided by Roastery is enabling us to source, roast, blend and market spectacular limited available coffees around the world, elevate the coffee experience we deliver to our customers, and expand the availability of super-premium, micro-lot Starbucks Reserve Coffee to ultimately 1500 Starbucks locations.","Customer response to Roastery has been so strong that in addition to the second Roastery, we have planned to open in Asia in calendar 2016. We are now actively looking at real estate in another major U.S. market as well. Roastery is also supporting the launch of our new Starbucks Reserve brand and the opening of 100 dedicated Starbucks Reserve stores over the years to come, devoted entirely to showcasing rare, limited premium small lot coffees as we continue to execute against our plan to elevate the consumer coffee experience globally.","At the same time, we are continuing to invest in smaller alternatives store footprints that respond to the continued urbanization of retail. And we will soon be launching a pilot project around express locations in New York that will offer streamlined assortment of food and beverage offerings and integrate Starbuck\u2019s mobile payment and mobile order intake functionality in order to enhance customer convenience and provide even faster locations in these locations -- faster service in these locations.","Turning to tea and Teavana. As we previously discussed, tea represents a massive, strategic opportunity for Starbucks around the world. And with the integration of Teavana complete, we are now executing our plan to double our key business to $2 billion over the next five years.","We will accomplish this goal by further elevating the Teavana in-store experience, expanding into targeted select global markets with a focus on regions within our China and Asia-Pacific segment, entering multiple new channels of distribution for Teavana and further developing Teavana\u2019s e-commerce platform.","We are already seeing lift in revenue generated by the sale of handcrafted tea beverages in Starbucks retail stores driven in large part by the very strong customer response to the launch of Teavana branded Shaken Iced Tea and Teavana Tea Lattes. In this month, we launched Teavana Hot Brewed Teas in Starbuck stores in U.S. and Canada to extremely favorable early results. We will be sharing additional specifics around our plans for Teavana in the months ahead.","Our fast-growing China Asia-Pacific region delivered strong sales profits in the company leading 8% store count in Q1 and continues to be a focal point of our future growth. As we shared with you at the Investor Day, we have plans in place to double our CAP store count to roughly 10,000 locations and triple our revenue to over $3 billion and our operating income to over $1 billion by 2019.","China, our largest market outside United States, is a big part of our CAP story and we are well on our way to achieving our goal of having 3,400 stores in China by fiscal 2019. We now are present in 86 cities in China and we will be adding seven more cities in 2015. To give you a sense of the size of the China opportunity, last month we opened our 1,500 China store and now have over 320 stores in Shanghai alone, making Shanghai the city with the most Starbucks locations in the world today and we have plans to open many more.","We expect to take full ownership of Starbucks Japan by the end of this quarter providing us with the opportunity to accelerate growth across all channels both in and out of our stores and ways not previously feasible.","Our EMEA segment demonstrated continued progress against its transformation plan delivering comp growth of 4% with the key U.K. markets outpacing the EMEA regional overall. I\u2019m particularly delighted to share with you that the EMEA segment delivered its most profitable quarter in company history in Q1. Special recognition goes out to Chris Ainscough in all of our EMEA Starbucks partners for delivering these extraordinary results.","Channel development. Our relationship with Keurig Green Mountain continues to strengthen at the same time as our K-Cup business continues to grow. Approximately 100 million Starbucks K-Cup were shipped in December 2014 alone, our largest single shipping month ever, up 20% over December 2013. Customers have now made Starbucks the number one coffee K-Cup in the category and we had another record share week during the key week before Christmas.","Starbucks\u2019 already industry-leading share premium packaged roast and ground coffee continues to increase as well, together accelerating sales combined with strong operating leverage, enabled our channel development segment deliver 10% revenue growth and strong profit in Q1.","Delivering the complete Starbucks\u2019 experience for our customers and creating an authentic emotional connection between our customers and our partner's has been and continues to be at the heart of everything we do. This month, we\u2019re making the single largest new investment we have ever made in our partner, our employee experience and it will touch 135,000 partners across our U.S. province.","Changes include increases in barista and shift supervisor pay rates, enhanced recognition programs, a new food benefit, and updates to our dress code among others. At the same time, we are investing in technologies that will help our partners deliver a consistently elevated Starbucks experience for our customers, including introducing technologies to ease and simplify required store test, improving access to core business tools and resources and introducing partner apps with information and resources to facilitate viewing work schedules from a personal mobile device.","We will continue to listen to our partners and we will endeavor to continue delivering enhancements to the partner experience that exceed their expectations. So they in turn will continue to exceed the expectations of our customers. And we are making similar investments in locally relevant ways to improve our partner experience elsewhere around the world as well.","In closing, Starbucks is off to a fantastic start in fiscal 2015. Together our record-shattering holiday quarter, financial and operating results, new store opening in the Roastery and the undeniable success of our card mobile and digital strategies underscore the increasing strength of the Starbucks\u2019 brand around the world and ideally and uniquely positions us to thrive in the face of the seismic shift in consumer behavior that is underway.","I cannot be more proud or appreciative of our partners and our teams around the world for delivering the record results we reported today. And I cannot be more optimistic about our future.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Scott Maw, who will take you through our Q1 financial and operating results in detail and I\u2019ll be back with Troy to share details on the transition. Thank you.","Scott Maw","Thanks Howard. Good afternoon everyone. Starbucks had a very strong start to fiscal 2015 with each of our reportable segments contributing to record consolidated revenues, operating income and earnings per share. Revenues grew to $4.8 billion, a 30% increase over the prior year, driven primarily by incremental revenues from the acquisition of Starbucks Japan, 5% global comp growth and incremental revenues from 1,641 net new Starbucks stores opened during the past four months.","This was partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation. As Howard mentioned, we saw global traffic increased 2% during the quarter, reflecting the strength of our brand and progress in many of the areas we discussed during Investor Day.","On a GAAP basis, operating income grew 13% over Q1 to $916 million, resulting in operating margin of 19.1% for the quarter and earnings per share of a $1.30. When excluding non-GAAP items, operating income was $935 million or 18% higher than the prior year first quarter. Non-GAAP operating margin was 19.5% compared to 18.7% in Q1 FY\u201814 primarily due to sales leverage including meaningful cost leverage.","After adjusting for certain items for comparability purposes, we also saw G&A leverage in Q1 as we continue to gain traction early in our efforts in both these areas. And non-GAAP EPS grew 16% to $0.80 per share over the prior year first quarter.","Before going into specifics, I\u2019d like to provide a quick update on the status of the Starbucks Japan acquisition. During Q1, with the closing of the first tender offer, Starbucks assumed majority ownership of Starbucks Japan and a second tender offer to the public shareholders was commenced.","We completed the second tender offer early in the fiscal second quarter and the transaction is expected to close as planned during the first half of calendar 2015. As of today, we own approximately 94% of the outstanding shares of Starbucks Japan. Therefore, our Q1 2015 financials reflect a consolidation of Starbucks Japan into our financials of the last eight weeks of the quarter and pre-acquisition JV accounting treatment for the first five weeks.","I also want to explain our non-GAAP adjustments for comparison purposes. For Q1 2015, we have excluded several items related to our acquisition of Starbucks Japan, including an acquisition-related gain of $391 million that was partially offset by certain expenses related to the transaction.","Combined, these items increased first quarter earnings by a net $0.41 per share. And for Q1 2014, we have excluded a litigation credit related to the Kraft arbitration. You can see the amounts, timing and description of these items in the detail reconciliation table provided at the end of the earnings release.","In the Americas, the strong holiday season and excellent execution by our partners drove increases in revenue, operating income and operating margin to record first quarter levels. Revenue grew by nearly 10% in the first quarter, driven by 5% growth in comps and revenues from the 766 net new stores opened this past year.","Americas delivered its 20th consecutive quarter of comp growth of 5% or greater. A notable 2% increase in transactions in Q1 was testament to the success of the traffic driving initiatives we discussed during our last earnings call and at our investor day. Increased operational focus helped drive transaction growth across all day parts, including strong growth at peak and accelerated during holiday.","And for the fourth consecutive quarter, food contributed 2% to comp growth, including the excellent performance by our breakfast sandwiches with net sales growing 29% in Q1 versus the prior year and strong holiday limited time food offers. Sales of our lunch offerings increased 15% over the prior year, driven by our warm sandwiches, which included three new items year-over-year.","Moving on to beverages, our core and limited time offerings contributed almost half of the U.S. comp growth during Q1. Holiday beverages delivered 9% year-over-year growth and total tea sales in our U.S. stores increased 17% over Q1 2014. The significant momentum gained from Teavana\u2019s handcrafted iced teas this summer continued in Q1.","In addition to the solid revenue growth in Q1, operating income in the Americas grew 12% over the prior year to a new all time high of $818 million. Operating margin expanded by 50 basis points to 24.3%, a new Q1 record due primarily to sales leverage.","Margin opportunity still exists in the established Americas business over the balance of the year, even when considering the additional investments in 2015 for our U.S. store partners. As you know, Target Corporation has made the decision to close all of their Canadian stores. We have a very good relationship with Target North America and our 132 Canada based licensed stores have been profitable and growing.","However, given the impact on our operations and to the customer experience from Target\u2019s decisions, our stores will close tomorrow, January 23rd. We don\u2019t expect these closures to impact our guidance for 2015, nor will they be material to our Americas business results.","Moving on to EMEA, with the momentum and remarkable results from fiscal 2014 continued into the first quarter, revenue grew by 3% after adjusting for $15 million of unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact. Revenue growth was driven by 4% comps in the first quarter including 3% traffic. Among the most positive signs from EMEA is the record two-year comp of 9% was achieved in the first quarter.","EMEA operating income in Q1 grew 49% over the prior year to $50 million, a new all time high. Operating margin expanded 510 basis points to 15%, as sales leverage and continued cost management, driven by the portfolio shift to higher-margin licensed stores and other operational improvements drove the segment\u2019s highest quarterly operating margin ever.","We now expect EMEA operating margin to be at the high end of the 10% to 12% target range we gave to you last quarter. Momentum continues to build in EMEA, and we are very encouraged by the broad reach improvements in both our largest company-owned markets and our licensed stores. Across EMEA, Q1 licensed stores comps were in the high single-digits, with comps in the Middle East in the double digits.","Turning to China Asia-Pacific, CAP revenues grew 86% over prior year in Q1 to $496 million, principally as a result of the Starbucks Japan acquisition. Revenue growth was also driven by 767 net new store openings over the last 12 months and strong comp growth of 8%, all of which resulted from increased traffic. China comps continue to trend higher than CAP comps as a whole.","Adjusting out the net revenue increase of $172 million attributable to Starbucks Japan, CAP revenue grew over 20% for the 18th straight quarter. On a GAAP basis, CAP operating margin grew 34% to $108 million in Q1 and operating margin declined 860 basis points to 21.8%, driven by the impact of the ownership change for Starbucks Japan.","Noteworthy is that under the previous joint venture ownership structure, our Japan margin was over 100% and our Japan store level margin remains among the highest in our global portfolio. The acquisition of Starbucks Japan was immediately accretive on a non-GAAP basis. We continue to believe that the CAP margin for 2015 will be in the high teens. Excluding the amortization of intangibles associated with the Japan acquisition, CAP operating income on a non-GAAP basis increased by 43% over Q1 last year.","Operating margin excluding the full 1,060 basis point impact of our ownership changes in Starbucks Japan increased by 200 basis points, driven principally by strong sales leverage and a continuing emphasis on improving operations in the region. Strong performance from China's new stores and overall revenue and margin expansion contributed significantly to CAP\u2019s excellent performance in Q1.","Starbucks China launched eight reserve stores in five cities during the quarter, including a world-class flagship store in Chengdu. Across the region, digital assets such as mobile apps, e-gifting Starbucks card and My Starbucks Reward continue to gain significant momentum.","In channel development, Q1 was very strong as we gain market share in our U.S. business despite significant competitive pressure. Robust sales of K-Cups and healthy growth in packaged coffee drove revenues to a new quarterly record of $443 million in Q1 and 10% increase over the prior year.","Operating income for channel development grew 33% in Q1 over the prior year to $158 million, another quarterly record. And operating margin was 35.6%, a 600 basis point increase over last year. Coffee cost capability and efficiencies in cost of goods sold were the primary drivers of this improvement.","As we mentioned last quarter, we expect modest improvement from channel development margin for the full year compared to 2014, with commodities and cost favorability lower in the latter quarters of 2015. Starbucks K-cups gained the leadership position in the category in December with an 18% share during the last five weeks of Q1, our highest shares since launch.","Overall, we shipped $232 million cups in Q1, 70% greater than last year, driven by strong customer response to new flavors such as cinnamon dolce and mocha and limited time offer such as Fall and Holiday Blend. A recently launched single origin K-Cups including Rwanda Rift Valley also contributed to growth, demonstrating customer demand for these excellent varieties.","Starbucks packaged coffee also gained share during the last five weeks of Q1, growing to 28% and exceeding 30% for the first time during the key merchandise week of the month. Our cross channel loyalty program, Stars Down the Aisle, also played a role in these results with 1.7 million MSR members entering codes to grocery in Q1. Almost 12 million codes have been entered since the launch of the program less than two years ago.","Teavana\u2019s performance, which is included in the All Other Segments, was relatively flat to the prior year. However, as Howard mentioned, sales of Teavana handcrafted beverages to our Starbucks stores in the America segments has driven exceptional growth in tea category revenue year-over-year.","Regarding taxes, our Q1 tax rate was 24.2% and the decrease in the rate was primarily due to the impact of the gain related to the Starbucks Japan acquisition, which is almost entirely nontaxable.","As I mentioned at the outset, Starbucks had a very strong Q1, with both solid revenue growth and margin expansion. This performance gives us the confidence in now targeting non-GAAP EPS of $3.09 to $3.13, thus moving the bottom end of our range up slightly from our previous target range while retaining the top end. A higher gain on the Japan transaction results in our raising the 2015 GAAP EPS target up to $3.53 to $3.58. Revenue growth is also expected to remain within our previous target range of 16% to 18%.","Noteworthy is that, based upon where exchange rates are today, the stronger dollar will adversely impact revenue growth and operating income growth by about 1-point each. We are confident that we will be able to offset this foreign exchange impact, given the strength of our Q1 global operating results and the progress we will continue to make in leveraging constant G&A.","It is also important to note that the vast majority of this currency impact represents only the effect of translating our foreign earnings into the U.S. dollar for reporting purposes. We actively hedge our largest Rio\u2019s economic cross currency cash flow risks.","We are now expecting Q2 GAAP EPS in the range $0.63 to $0.64 and non-GAAP EPS in Q2 is expected to be in the range of $0.64 to $0.65. The second quarter is when the majority of our U.S. store partner investments begin in earnest, including our new food benefit and the changes in wages Howard mentioned earlier. This will have some impact on Q2 Americas margin.","I also want to acknowledge that we see many external analysts' projections for Q2 EPS growth about 20%, higher than the Q2 earnings range I just mentioned. I suspect that this difference is driven by our increased partner investments in Q2 and some seasonality that we always see in our second quarter.","I want to reiterate that our fiscal 2015 non-GAAP EPS growth remains the previously targeted 16% to 18%. We expect the first half of the year to be near the lower end of this range and the second half of the year to be closer to the upper end. Increasing revenues, strong global comp growth, new innovation, including Mobile Order and Pay, and the strong momentum we are seeing across our business gives us confidence in this slight acceleration despite additional foreign translation impact. In addition, we expect some acceleration in the benefit from our constant G&A leverage over the course of the year.","Moving on to commodities, we have recently priced a significant amount of coffee, as prices have moved down within our target range over the past six weeks. As such, we now have 94% of our 2015 coffee needs priced, and therefore we expect commodity cost to be roughly flat to 2014. We will continue to provide updates, as we price our coffee needs for fiscal 2016.","We continue to expect to add approximately 1650 net new stores globally. Of the 1650, we expect 650 in the Americas, 150 in EMEA and 850 in China, Asia Pacific. The outlook for our effective tax rate continues to be around 31%, and we expect capital expenditures of $1.4 billion for fiscal 2015.","In closing, Q1 represented another quarter of excellent global growth for Starbucks by any metric. Our strong results in the quarter and confident outlook for the year reflect many of the critical strategic growth initiatives we outlined during Investor Day. We expect EPS growth to accelerate as we move into the back half of the year and coffee costs remain well under control, and our financial forecast includes an appropriate level of investment in our store partners and food, beverage and technology integration. We consider this as an investment and not as expense as it is integral to our continued growth in sales and profits over the long term. We look forward to updating you on our progress as we move throughout the year.","With that, let me turn the call back over to Howard. Howard?","Howard Schultz","Scott, thank you very much. I have one more important announcement to share before moving on to Q&A. Today, I am extremely pleased to announce that Kevin Johnson, former CEO of Juniper Networks and former President of Microsoft\u2019s Platforms Division, and a 5-plus year Starbucks Board member will be joining the Starbucks senior leadership team as President and Chief Operating Officer effective March 1. Welcome Kevin.","Kevin has worked closely with the Starbucks senior leadership team and me as a Board member since 2009 collaborating and providing deep insights and wise counsel in connection with our transformation in 2009. And many of the strategies we\u2019ve outlined at our Investor Conference last month and we will be executing against over the next several years. Kevin and I have been discussing his coming to the company in order to contribute his insights and expertise and help us as we grow our business in North America and around the world for some time. These discussions were independent of Troy\u2019s subsequent decision to take a sabbatical. Kevin will be reporting directly to me.","Now as I said at our Investor Day and I want to underscore here, my passion and personal commitment to Starbucks has never been greater. I also want to make it clear that Kevin\u2019s addition is not part of some unannounced succession arrangement because it\u2019s not. Instead, Kevin\u2019s public company experience and his deep management, technology, global operating company supply chain, mobile and digital expertise will be a fantastic addition to already the strongest and most talented management team in our history.","Please join me in congratulating Kevin, who is with us this afternoon, and welcoming him to Starbucks, and I would ask him to say a few words of introduction. Kevin?","Kevin Johnson","Thank you, Howard. Greetings, everyone. For nearly six years now, I have had the great privilege of working closely with Howard and the SLT and my role as Starbucks Board member. Through this involvement, I have gained the deep insight into Starbucks business, its values, the culture and the critical role that our 300,000 passionate partners play in delivering an elevated Starbucks experience to millions of customers around the world each and every day.","In December I attended the Starbucks Investor Day, at which time we outlined our strategies for the next several years. We are fully committed to working with Howard, the SLT and our partners around the world to fully operationalize those strategies and to deliver results consistent with the expectations we share, our core values, and our culture. As always, performance driven through the lens of humanity.","Troy and I are already engaged to ensure a smooth handoff as he begins to sabbatical on March 1. Our prior business experience leading global organizations combined with my Starbucks Board experience should enable me to quickly ramp up in my new role. I want our partners and shareholders to know the deep sense of responsibility and accountability I feel to fulfill our aspirations and deliver results. Howard?","Howard Schultz","Kevin, thank you so much. And on behalf of all of us today, this is a wonderful opportunity to welcome you to the Starbucks. This also marks Troy\u2019s last earnings call before he takes his sabbatical, a coffee break in Starbucks parlance. Troy has been a true friend, a great leader, and a passionate 23 years Starbucks partners, who is beloved inside our building and around the world. I am going to miss, Troy, in my daily conversations and collaborations and look forward to the day when he is ready to return to the company. Troy wants to say a few words to all of you in the financial community before taking his leave. Troy?","Troy Alstead","Thank you, Howard. I have had the incredible opportunity to be part of Starbucks for 23 years, starting from the early days as a small, privately-held coffee company with stores primarily just here in the Northwest. And while very difficult to step away from this place that I know and love so deeply, I recently made the personal decision to dedicate the next year to my family with four school age children. It gives me great comfort in stepping away right now as the incredible strength of the organization and momentum of the business.","As we demonstrated during the Investor Day here in Seattle in early December, the performance of the business around the world is stronger than ever, the opportunities ahead of us are greater than ever, and the aspirations of the company are higher than ever before.","The holiday quarter we just reported underscores that strength and opportunity. We are fortunate to have a leader of Kevin's caliber and experience able to join Starbucks at this time. I've worked with Kevin in his role as a Board member for many years and have benefited from his experience and insights. His experience as a public company CEO, combined with his years on the Starbucks Board, positioned him to hit the ground running.","Kevin and I have already spent much time together in the transition and we\u2019ll engage further together over the next month to make sure everything transitions smoothly. Most of you on the call today I have come to know very well over the years. Thank you for your engagement and your support to Starbucks and of me. I assure you that the best days for Starbucks are still ahead.","And finally, I'd like to say thank you to Howard for giving me incredible opportunities and support over many years and for supporting this personal family decision at this time. Thank you, Howard.","With that, we'll turn the call back to the operator for Q&A. Mike?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question is from Jeff Bernstein with Barclays.","Jeff Bernstein","Great. Thank you very much. Congratulations, Troy. A question on the mobile payment platform, I know you\u2019ve got a lot of attention at the Analyst Day and it seems like that\u2019s probably the biggest opportunity from a traffic driving standpoint. It sounds like Portland must have gone reasonably well. It sounds like you\u2019ve identified the next few markets in the rollout by the end of fiscal '15.","Just wondering whether you can give us some color on maybe early learnings over the past couple of months in terms of any challenges or nuances you\u2019ve had to overcome, or whether there\u2019s any insight into what kind of incremental sales, or how it helps speed of service? I saw there were some quotes from Scott earlier this afternoon in terms of the significant benefits that it provides. Just trying to get some insights in terms of your early learnings and what we can expect in the year so to come?","Adam Brotman","Hey, Jeff. This is Adam Brotman. I\u2019ll answer that. First of all, we\u2019re not breaking out specifics. But what I can tell you is we have completely hit the ground running in Portland and the experience for both our customers using the app as well as the partners operationally has met and even exceeded our expectations. So we are full steam ahead in terms of rolling this out around the country as you mentioned over the course of the rest of this calendar year.","And what we\u2019ve learned is that this is absolutely every bit of what we thought would do in terms of helping us add convenience for our customers, integrate it fully and to not just our technologies, but our operational flow. And we are as confident as day we launched it that this is going to help drive incremental transactions, improve throughput and capacity, and even help us accelerate MSR.","Jeff Bernstein","Great. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from John Glass with Morgan Stanley.","John Glass","Thanks very much. Scott, you outlined $1 billion in cost savings over the next four years and there are several buckets. How much of that is in your thinking for '15 guidance? And specifically, you commented on through you\u2019re expecting a second half acceleration in earnings growth. Is that largely due to these cost savings coming in? Are you -- do you believe that there is like a sales benefit or an uptick in sales in the back half to drive that?","Scott Maw","Yeah. Thanks, John. Maybe I\u2019ll answer the back part of that first. There is a number of things as we look into the second half of the year that will help us accelerate profit. It includes cost of goods sold leverage, which I\u2019ll get you in a second, but also some of the work we\u2019ve done around.","So for cost and then what we believe will be accelerated revenue opportunities through things like Mobile Order and Pay, some of the things we have around innovation with beverage and some of things we see in our international operation. So all of that is driving the slight acceleration in our earnings growth in the back half of the year, we are pretty confident we\u2019re going to see that.","As far the COGS savings, we think it will be about $200 million this year. You may remember from Investor Day, in 2013 we had a $100 million that we booked, in 2014 it was $140 million, and in 2015 it\u2019s getting up close to $200 million. So, great work by the supply chain team and all the business units. And we\u2019re well on our way to recognizing most of that, most of that is already in the run rate.","John Glass","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Karen Holthouse with Goldman Sachs.","Karen Holthouse","Hi. Congratulations on the quarter and Troy on what comes next. Kind of a little bit of a deep dive question. If you look in the Americas segment, we\u2019ve now had a couple of quarters where licensed store revenue growth has been pretty meaningfully exceeding, unit growth plus comp growth. Is there something -- at the same time coffee prices are going down, so would you think that would be the opposite? Is there something in store composition or anything else in the model that we might be missing there?","Cliff Burrows","Karen, hi. It\u2019s Cliff. The significant difference is with our approach to food. And for the first time ever most of our licensees are now taking the incredible La Boulange range of food plus our breakfast sandwiches and that has allowed us to increase our revenue stream through our licensed stores. And it\u2019s been extremely well received. It also helps us improve our offers to the customers with a greater consistency than we\u2019ve ever had before. So food is the meaningful change.","Scott Maw","And I would just add to that. We are seeing comp growth in our licensed stores that equal to or greater than what we\u2019re seeing in our company-owned store. So it\u2019s the combination of those few things that\u2019s driving revenue.","Karen Holthouse","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.","John Ivankoe","Hi. Thank you. I wanted to just see about how much of a change there was in this enhanced partner experience and maybe what was driving that? And maybe what was driving that\u2019s just you are in a position of strength where you can just improve how you treat your employees and how you attract and retain the absolute best talent that was out there?","But just wanted to understand a little bit more substantive, how their day-to-day or their year-to-year is going to be affected? And maybe if you were beginning to see some tick up in turnover or in execution consistency as the labor market for the better people is starting to get a little bit tighter?","Howard Schultz","Hi, John. This is Howard. You are probably, better than almost anyone on the company, you've covered the company since the IPO, you know first hand at the culture, values and guiding principles of our company are directly linked to the equity of the brand. And the equity of the brand is defined purely by the relationship we have with our customers, which is defined by our people.","There is no issue of increased turnover or anything like that. We are in the business of doing everything we can, not only to invest in customer-facing experiences and enhancements but we have to do everything we can to do the same thing with our people. Starbucks has had a long history as you know of equity in the form of stock options healthcare now, college achievement in which we\u2019re providing free tuition for juniors and seniors.","We want to do everything we can to demonstrate the amenity of the company and we have felt since day one that investing over the long term in our people is the best investment we can make in the customer experience. So we\u2019re taking these steps, not because we have a problem, we\u2019re taking these steps because it\u2019s the right thing to do.","Operator","The next question is from Sara Senatore with Sanford Bernstein.","Sara Senatore","Thank you very much and my congratulations to both Kevin and to Troy on these new stages. Hi. I actually wanted to sort of ask about this transition. In the context of a couple of things, I mean, first of all sort of how Kevin\u2019s responsibilities might be similar to different from what Troy had in the sense that it sounds like Kevin has a lot of experience but not in retail or restaurants per se.","And then I don\u2019t know if you can talk at all about this but obviously, Kevin has been a board member since 2009, so not really new to the story. But so I guess, is there any sense of what -- of may be what kind of initiatives he might undertake or where he might see the opportunities there?","Howard Schultz","Well, look this is Howard. I\u2019ll start it and I'll give Kevin his initial opportunity to share his own thoughts with you. If we were hiring someone from the outside who did not have almost six years of experience with the company, I think this would be a different story. The transition would be longer, the learning curve will be longer. But Kevin has lived and worked in Seattle for many years at Microsoft. So he has been a customer to Starbucks for many years.","And as a board member, he has been the kind of board member that has been deeply involved in the strategies of the company and specifically aligning himself and helping the digital side of the transformation of the company which has been so successful with Adam. His responsibilities in many ways will mirror Troy\u2019s with the exception that he is picking up digital with Adam and he\u2019ll have IT as well as supply chain which Troy had. Scott Maw who had been reporting to Troy will be reporting to me.","And Kevin will have the geographies, which are represented at this table with John and with Cliff. And I have spend many, many hours with Kevin over the many years sharing with him the aspirations we have with the company and he is very, very well versed. And what we are trying to do in the opportunity that lies ahead and we are very, very fortunate.","In many ways, I said to a reporter a couple of hours ago having Troy leave the company is in no doubt a significant loss. But we are so fortunate at the same time, in a sense have a number one draft choice in Kevin Johnson. So Kevin, I\u2019ll give you your own opportunity.","Kevin Johnson","Yeah. Well, thanks for your question. I think, clearly my professional experience has been in the tech industry, companies like IBM and Microsoft and Juniper. But in that experience, I\u2019ve had the opportunity to work with many retail industry customers on technology-based solutions and ways to help them drive their business.","Now certainly, as Howard mentioned, my experience on the Starbucks Board since 2009 is providing me a solid understanding of the strategy, and the culture and the leadership talent that we have here at Starbucks.","And certainly Troy and I are working closely together on the transition just to ensure that this is a seamless moved transition. And in terms of what initiatives to undertake, I think the Starbucks Investor Day in December, we outlined strategy. And so my focus is going to be working with the SLT and working with our partners to operationalize that strategy. And that\u2019s going to be my priority.","Howard Schultz","Thank you Kevin.","Sara Senatore","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from David Palmer with RBC.","David Palmer","Thanks. Congrats on the quarter and Troy, congrats on your career. Last year, Starbucks talked about a significant follow-up in result after Black Friday. How did the growth rate change through this last quarter and perhaps what did that tell you about your business? And then separately, Scott, with regard to your COGS commentary, dairy and energy prices, they come off lately, is that a factor in the back half? Thanks.","Troy Alstead","David, I\u2019ll take the holiday question and then give it to Scott. You are exactly right. I think we were here at last year at this time. And I think I said for the first time that the U.S. retail environment and the consumer, we are in -- we are experiencing a seismic change in consumer behavior. And as a result of that brick-and-mortar retailers will have to redefine their relevance.","We went to work at this time last year in completely redefining and transforming not only our holiday season, but in many ways the calendar year at \u201815 with leveraging all the assets we have and specifically understanding how we could utilize MSR, our digital platform to lower our cost of customer acquisition and emotionally build a relationship with them that was not only based on than being in our stores for driving traffic in our stores.","And so the results that we posted today is a manifestation of all that and specifically the merchandise relationship that we built around the Dot Collection, the Starbucks card and we got very fortunate in once again hitting a bull\u2019s eye with Chestnut Praline Latte. And we may have another winner of that magnitude with Flat White, don\u2019t know yet. But clearly the beverage resonated with our customers.","And we were going to position like and unlike many other retailers who demonstrate such relevancy in store with a beverage that created demand and experience that was spot on in terms of the card and the gifts of choice, and Starbucks for Life just added all of that in terms of the excitement. And I would just add that our people were so proud of how we went to market for holiday and they rose to the challenge and were able to really develop that kind of relation with our customers.","Serving millions of customers more than we did last year, we should not underscore. We are talking about 9 million more customers. It\u2019s an unbelievable number and that was U.S. alone, and we saw the same level of accretion worldwide with 12 million more customers. It\u2019s a stunning number in any environment, especially when you consider the environment we are in with a different type of consumer who is really turning away from traditional and bricks-and-mortar retailers. Scott?","Scott Maw","On the commodity piece, the way that it shapes up for the year, David, is we saw some significant coffee favorability in the first quarter, not much on dairy and diesel. And you can see that coffee favorability in the channel development margin improvement. That coffee favorability at that level is not going to continue in the back half of the year and so you\u2019ll see channels margin growth come down. However, we do see offsetting that some favorability in dairy and diesel. So when you add that all the way, all up across the year, we think commodities will be roughly neutral year-over-year. But that\u2019s kind of how it shapes up.","David Palmer","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Keith Siegner with UBS.","Keith Siegner","Thank you. And similar congratulation to you everyone involved. I just want to circle back and ask one more question on the [indiscernible] or the mobile order and payment since it\u2019s such an exiting part of the story for this year. Scott, maybe you can help me think about this. When we think about that pace of rollout and we know kind of what the completion date is, but how does the pace of the rollout happen? Is it a slow build and we get a big boost right at the end? And then similarly how did the costs associated with this roll? Did they come a little early? Maybe is that part of what leads to some of the cadence of the year -- if you could help me with those two pieces, it would be very helpful? Thanks.","Howard Schultz","Adam, why don\u2019t you start and then Scott could jump in.","Adam Brotman","Okay. Keith. In terms of the rollout pace, it\u2019s going to be fairly evenly spread out throughout the year. So it\u2019s neither front loaded, nor back loaded and so that\u2019s how we are thinking about it. And so far everything seems on track to that.","Scott Maw","And as far as the cost goes because of the rollout, the cost is pretty evenly spread as well. And I\u2019ll just remind you, there is not a lot of cost. There is some incremental costs that will happen this year, but because of how integrated this is with our existing technology and how seamlessly it works with our existing system that cost is manageable.","Howard Schultz","Can I do one thing, also? There is lots of companies who are ringing the bell about mobile order and pay. But in my prepared remarks, I specifically talked bout this is a proprietary integrated relationship that we are building with our infrastructure and in turn with the customer. Adam, can you just -- you or Matt can just touch on that for one minute?","Matt Ryan","Well, yeah. And this is -- and actually at the investor day, but this is -- what's so unique of what we are doing is we are not starting from a cold start. We already have 13 million active mobile users. We have the POS and payment capability. We have MSR now up to 9 million plus. And so for us, we are simply adding on mobile ordering on to that stack of proprietary integrated technology that allow us to do something like that. And it sets us up frankly for delivery as well. So the kind of pace of innovation, our ability to roll it out and positively influence our business overall is because we have built this and integrated in the way I just mentioned it.","Howard Schultz","And then the other thing I just want to say one more time is that in a traditional advertising and marketing to try and overcome this seismic shift in consumer behavior is probably not going to work for most people. The relationship that we have build with our customers though mobile payment through MSR, through gold members and now Mobile Order & Pay and delivery is a significant driver in not only elevating the relation that we have with our customers, but significantly lowering our traditional cost of customer acquisition, especially when you compare it to other national retailers.","Keith Siegner","Thank you much.","Operator","Next question is from David Tarantino with Robert W. Baird.","David Tarantino","Hi. Good afternoon, and congratulations again to everyone. My question is a follow-up on the Mobile Order & Pay experience you've seen so far in Portland. And really, I wanted to focus on the operation side of this. And I know, there was some potential, I guess changes in how the back of the house or the baristas operate and some potential conflicts with how customer timing and pickup might work. So, I was wondering if you could comment on your experience so far and if your operations are running as smoothly as you would have envisioned at this stage of the game?","Cliff Burrows","David, it is Cliff here. It\u2019s been incredibly smooth. We did a lot of work upfront. As Adam already said, we built off existing platforms. We integrated it with MSR. It is totally intuitive and we took the existing flow in the store, have build a printer into the register lineup and so it is an absolutely seamless experience for our baristas. And it doesn\u2019t change the routine for the bar, as consolidation area for our food and beverage come together and quite frankly, I say without fear of contradiction from any of my colleagues here. It has been seamless and we are delighted by the way the customers from day one, when we are down in the market and our partners have embraced this and that\u2019s why we are still confident we can meet this 2015 rollout.","David Tarantino","And I guess one quick follow-up. Have you run into issues with the timing of the order being prepared and the timing of the customer picking it up, is that, I know that was one potential watch out, but is there any issues like that that you are still working through or is it working pretty smoothly?","Howard Schultz","No. We have had, David, incredible smoothness in this. There are obviously individuals who will learn it, it\u2019s a new technology. We didn\u2019t go in with a narrow test or pilot. We went in replicating our final rollout plans. We are learning along the way, but it has been -- it's improved everyday, adoption has grown from day one and we are extremely confident about this.","David Tarantino","Great. That sounds great. Thank you very much.","Operator","The next question is from Matt DiFrisco with Buckingham Research.","Matt DiFrisco","Thank you. I just had a follow-up and then a question. I just wanted to understand, you made a comment, Scott, regarding the investment in your partners and how that's going to be a little bit more or comes into 2Q and that's somewhat of the 16% or lower end of the full year guidance in 2Q and then the somewhat ramp in the back half? I'm just curious, isn't that though like wages, so I don't know why is there like a level of investment that is going on in 2Q or a conference of sorts or one-time training or something that\u2019s weighted in 2Q, if you could give some color on that?","And then my question was with respect to Portland and the digital. I'm curious on if you have had an early read in the first six weeks or so of the rollout or four weeks of the rollout? What you are seeing in winning over more people, has Portland outpaced bringing people into the mobile app versus other regions, obviously, everyone is moving over, but are they moving over faster because of the added benefit of Mobile Order and Pay? Thank you.","Scott Maw","Well, I\u2019ll go first and then I\u2019ll turn it over to Adam. Matt, what I was referring to was if you look at analyst estimates for the second quarter, they are north of 20% on average. And I was trying to speak to what might be missing in those forecasts. And I think, this investment that starting really in January and you\u2019re right, continuing all year in our forecasts and partner wages and other benefits might be an explanation for that difference between what we\u2019re seeing and what you\u2019re seeing.","What\u2019s really driving the second half acceleration in earnings, by the way, it\u2019s a pretty slight acceleration from 16% to 18% is all the things that we\u2019ve talked about on the topline, the momentum we see in the business and then the things we\u2019re doing in the middle of the P&L book within the stores and within the supply chain and support cost, we see that picking up a little bit in the back half of the year. Adam?","Adam Brotman","And again we\u2019re not like -- I can\u2019t get into specifics, the answer is yes. We are seeing incremental driving of MSR membership, usage of our app. And what\u2019s so exciting about that is we have -- this is still in beta mode in terms of -- we haven\u2019t even put this on our android platform yet, which is coming soon. We have additional features to come. So we\u2019re just getting started and we like what we see early on in terms of all the drivers that we talked about at the Analyst Conference.","Scott Maw","And Matt, while I\u2019m clarifying some comments that I made earlier, I want to make sure everyone\u2019s clear that target stores that we\u2019re closing in Canada are licensed stores. And then I want to make sure the amount of non-GAAP EPS relate to the Japan transaction is $0.49, I may have said $0.41, so clean all that.","Matt DiFrisco","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from R.J. Hottovy with Morningstar.","R.J. Hottovy","Thanks. I had a question about lowering the cost of customer acquisition, specifically the success of the holiday promotions, like Starbucks for Life and other things you are running during the period? Just wanted to get a sense of how you plan to keep this momentum going and other activities, promotional activities that you might have planned for the rest of fiscal 2015? Thanks.","Matt Ryan","Matt Ryan here. The reason why customer acquisition will continue to come down in terms of cost is a confluence of a number of factors. As we add more features that are meaningful to the customer, things like Mobile Order and Pay, down the road delivery, we\u2019re going to be giving the customer added reason to sign up for MSR, that is an organic thing that happens.","The second thing that happens is as we sell more and more gift cards, we naturally get through the process of registration incremental MSR customers. Those are probably the two most important things we see rolling out. And that along with increased focus within our stores, which is a low-cost customer acquisition opportunity, builds out MSR as a platform and the acceleration in MSR growth we saw last quarter was the result of all three of those things.","R.J. Hottovy","Thanks.","Operator","The next question is from Nick Setyan with Wedbush.","Nick Setyan","Thank you. Congrats again on the great quarter. My question is on the China Asia Pacific, we saw a very meaningful acceleration from last quarter, both on a one and three-year basis, and maybe -- there\u2019s a lot of folks on the U.S. comp drivers, maybe you can -- maybe give us some color on the various drivers in China Asia Pacific and whether it's market-by-market or one product or another, that would be great? Thank you.","John Culver","Yeah. Nick, this is John. Thanks for the question. I think, really we saw obviously 8% comp growth in the quarter and it was all driven by traffic and what I would say is that, we have more customers now coming in our stores than ever before in our history, across the 15 markets that we operate in, that is being driven in large part as well in China.","And when you look at the China comp and I'm not going to quote any specific number, but China comp actually outpaced the entire region. We opened our 1,500 store there, we opened eight new reserve stores there and the relevance of the brand in China has never been stronger.","We did a consumer study in China and what we have seen is that, we are looked at as the coffee leader in the market. That our products, the localization of our products are locally relevant and we are building a strong trust between our baristas, as well as work with our customers.","And what we have been able to do is we have been able to take the awareness that we built around Starbucks in China, as well as in other markets, we have been able to translate that into traffic into our stores and we have done a very good job of converting that awareness to actual visits.","We had a very strong holiday season, our promotional beverages did very well and we feel that we are in a position to continue the momentum. When you look at our two-year comp across the region, it\u2019s at about 15% and Starbucks card and mobile does very well in China. We are at now over 40% of our transactions are done on the Starbucks card in China, as well as two other major markets.","Japan had a very strong quarter as well, given the tough economic environment that\u2019s going on in Japan. The acquisition, as Scott said, was accretive in the quarter and we are in a good position in Japan to accelerate the growth through new stores, through channels outside of our stores, as well as aggressively going after the digital platform in Japan as well. So feel very good about the job our team is doing across the region.","Howard Schultz","John, thank you.","Nick Setyan","Thank you.","Howard Schultz","Last question.","Operator","We will take one last question. The last question comes from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.","John Ivankoe","Follow up.","Howard Schultz","John, you don\u2019t get two questions. Go ahead. Kidding.","John Ivankoe","I know a lot of people will probably ask this, so I will just take the opportunity to ask it publicly. It\u2019s sounds like December was the high month of the quarter, if I am listening to your comments the right way and I think in your prepared remarks you made some comments that you already seeing and realizing the benefit of increased activity in the stores, which I assume is January? So should I interpret the right way or are you saying that, there was further acceleration in January relative to December? Just trying to get a sense of what you are trying to communicate regarding March in general year-over-year and relative to the first quarter, if I can ask that?","Scott Maw","Yeah. Thanks, John. It\u2019s Scott. We haven\u2019t said anything about January. You are correct that within the quarter we did see some acceleration and as the holiday period our busiest period, we actually saw the highest transaction comps we have in the U.S. and that is certainly encouraging as it relates to the first quarter.","John Ivankoe","Okay.

(Operator Instructions) Thank you.","Ms. DeGrande, you may begin your conference call.","JoAnn DeGrande","Thank you, Mike.

Any such statements should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements in our earnings release and the risk factor discussions in our filings with the SEC, including our last annual report on Form 10-K.

Howard?","Howard Schultz","Thank you, JoAnn and good afternoon to everyone on today\u2019s call. I am very pleased to report the record Q2 results that Starbucks announced today. Global comp store sales growth of 6%, marking the 13th consecutive quarter of comp growth greater than 5%, comp growth of 7% in the U.S., total revenue growth of 11% to a Q2 record of $3.6 billion, 180 basis points increase in operating margin to a Q2 record of 15.3% and record Q2 EPS of $0.51, which after excluding a $0.03 gain on the sale of the Company\u2019s minority equity stake in the JV that operates our stores in Mexico represents a 20% increase over last years record Q2 results.","Starbucks is continuing to deliver strong consistent performance in the phase of still challenged retail and consumer environments in many of the markets around the world in which we operate. While I\u2019m very pleased with the record results we\u2019ve been reporting in the value that we\u2019ve been creating for our shareholders over the last several years. As I\u2019ve mentioned at our annual meeting of shareholders last month, we remain laser focused on our aspiration to become one of the worlds most admired, respected, and enduring brands.","I\u2019m honored with the progress we\u2019re making on this journey has been recognized by Ethisphere Magazine, who for the seventh straight year name Starbucks as one of the worlds most Ethical Company and Fortune Magazine who recently ranked us as the fifth most admired company in the world. Neither this humbling and inspiring recognition, nor our Q2 results would have been possible without the hard work and dedication of our 200,000 Starbucks partners who done the green apron everyday and deliver the unique Starbucks experience, 70 million times from almost 19,000 stores in 52 countries around the world each week. From Starbucks leadership team to each of our partners we say thank you.","In a few minutes Cliff Burrows, President of our Americas segment will discuss Americas Q2 results in detail and provide a glimpse of what\u2019s ahead. Under Cliff\u2019s leadership Starbucks U.S. business today is at healthy as it ever has been. We continue to introduce new innovative ways to excite our customers around all things coffee. And clearly anyone suggesting in 2008 or 2009 that Starbucks U.S. retail store portfolio was approaching market saturation was just flat out wrong. In fact, stores we\u2019ve opened in the last few years are among the best performing stores in the 42-year history of the Company in terms of all key metrics, including unit economics, return on investment, profitability and the qualitative aspects of how well we deliver the Starbucks experience to our customers.","This performance is due to a new discipline and rigor we\u2019ve brought to all aspects of store development that is both underpinning and driving our U.S. retail expansion. We plan to add approximately 3,000 new stores in the Americas over the next five years with at least 1,500 being in the U.S. and are now on track to open over 300 new stores and to renovate 14 other stores in the U.S. this year alone.","Our China and Asia-Pacific region continues to be at the forefront of Starbucks global expansion efforts and we are on course to have 4,000 stores in the region by the end of 2013, including more than 1,000 stores in Mainland China and more than 500 stores in South Korea.","We will establish China as Starbucks single largest market outside of the U.S. in 2014 and have more than 1,500 stores by 2015. We are building and deepening our connection to customers in China by continuing to deliver locally relevant innovation, including Chestnut Macchiato and Peach Blossom Tea Latte, two customer favorites' seasonal beverages evocative of the flavors of the Chinese New Year season and actively building My Starbucks Rewards membership.","We have now sold over 2 million My Starbucks Rewards cards in China representing an average of 2,000 members per store and the highest first store average anywhere across our global retail system, the sales on cards now representing 35% of total tender. This is a powerful endorsement of the emotional attachment and engagement we now have with Chinese customers in relationship to the Starbucks brand.","A few weeks ago, John Culver, President of our China and Asia Pacific segment and I traveled to Indonesia and the Philippines, key growth markets as well as being the sources of some of Starbucks best tasting and best selling coffees. John and I observed firsthand how powerfully the Starbucks culture and the Starbucks brand coupled with the new store designs are resonating with our partners and customers.","We now plan to open 100 new stores in Indonesia in the next three years and another 100 stores in the Philippines over the next four. And next month, John and I will be in Tokyo to celebrate the opening of our 1,000-store in Japan, an historic achievement for the first Starbucks market that opened outside North America and personally a rich reminder to me on how far we've come since I attended the opening of the first store in the Ginza district back in August of 1996.","In Q2, we also opened our first store in Vietnam to record crowds, another dynamic market with a rich cultural heritage in coffee tradition. Our flagship Ho Chi Minh City store will be followed by stores in Hanoi and other key metropolitan cities across Vietnam in the future.","Michelle Gass and her team are in the early stages of a transformative new economic business model for Europe that will further move us towards long-term profitability. We are actively continuing to expand our new UK franchise program with a number of experienced and well capitalized regional and national franchise operators as well as growing our captive licensed store footprint into important customer segments such as rail stations, airports, universities and hospitals.","We're also making considerable headway in the growth of our drive-through operations, adding our first drive-through store in Germany and adding to our drive-through portfolio throughout the UK. These and other strategic moves together with a robust set of brand initiatives will provide competitive differentiation and make Starbucks more relevant to Europe's diverse consumer base.","Starbucks performance across our joint venture and license markets in Eastern Europe and the Middle East continue to be extremely strong with growing customer response in markets such as Turkey, Hungary, Russia and across our Middle East portfolio, thanks and good measure to our partnership with the Alsea group that started with a single store in Kuwait City in 1999 and now comprises over 500 Starbucks stores throughout the Middle East.","Our Q2 results give me confidence that the strategies we have in place across Europe and the Middle East combined with an intense focus on execution and elevating our customer experience will enable us to make solid, continuous progress in the EMEA region over time, as we continue to leverage all of the learnings from the U.S. transformation.","Last quarter, Jeff Hansberry, President of our Channel Development and Emerging Brands segment detailed an extraordinary, multibillion dollar opportunity that exists for Starbucks in channels outside of our stores. Today, Starbucks has over 100,000 points of distribution across grocery, drug, mass and club locations around the world and sales topping $1 billion, with nearly 25% of the $3.4 billion U.S. premium coffee market making us the number one thing in packaged coffee brand in America. From this strong position Starbucks channel development opportunity remains in its infancy. Premium single cup currently an $8 billion categories of fastest growing segment in the coffee industry, now accounting for 27% of total coffee sales in grocery. And premium single cup is a segment Starbucks intends to lead with a solid product lineup that includes Starbucks VIA, Starbucks K-Cup portion pack and now Verismo. We continue to build Verismo\u2019s install base to generate incremental pod sales with a successful promotion on cable Home-Shopping Channel QVC in March.","In Q3 we will gear up for a robust fall and holiday by further extending Verismo distribution to include additional specialty retailers and expand the Verismo portfolio to include both machine and pod innovations including tea. All of which will culminate in our stores what we anticipate to be a very strong Christmas holiday shopping season. Starbucks K-cup portion pack sales in U.S. food, drug and mass channels out case the industry at large increasing more than 75% versus the prior-year and maintain a leading share in the premium single cup category. This last week Starbucks K-cups remain one of the top product launches of the year by IRIs pacesetters. I am pleased to report that we have now shipped over 850 million Starbucks and Tazo cups since launch.","Q2 marked our first quarter since completion of the Teavana acquisition, an important move into the $40 billion global tea category. The tea category we believe is right for innovation and we now intend to do for key what we have done for coffee. Beyond representing a very exciting retail store platform with strong unit economics Teavana enables us to add super premium estate teas to our tea lineup and introduce and leverage a multi-brand tea strategy to complement our existing billion dollar plus Tazo tea business.","In Q2 we opened eight Teavana stores and have plans to add additional mall stores in fiscal 2013 and to add a complete line of handcrafted beverages to the Teavana menu over time. We also expanded Starbucks loyalty program to include Teavana purchases giving Starbucks customers the convenience and benefit of using their Starbucks card and mobile app to pay for purchases in Teavana retail stores. To further leverage the best capabilities of Starbucks retail including real-estate design and store operations I\u2019ve asked to Cliff Burrows to lead the Teavana retail business as part of our U.S. and Americas business with Andy Mack, Teavana\u2019s founder reporting to Cliff.","Our Evolution Fresh Cold-Pressed Juice platform continues to grow nicely and there is now more than 4000 Starbucks stores and other retail locations including 300 Starbucks stores in the New York and Boston markets. We continue to see healthy sales lift in juice as customers increasingly make Evolution Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Juices a part of their daily ritual. And we\u2019re working hard to increase production, capacity to meet the growing consumer demand and our plan to have Evolution Fresh juices available in approximately 8,000 U.S. locations by the end of 2013.","It's now been more than two years since we unveiled and began to execute against our unique blueprint for profitable growth strategy in the U.S. and the time is now right to begin taking our tested embedded blueprint on the road to China. Our success at retail in China is providing us with confidence to both continue building our retail store portfolio and to leverage our brand growing retail store footprint and deepening connection to Chinese consumers into a future overall business that will also include Starbucks products and categories marketed through CPG channels to the rapidly growing Chinese middleclass. Stay tuned for updates on this exciting initiative in the quarters ahead.","I want to turn now to global payment, loyalty and social and digital media. As I have shared with you before, we're witnessing a seismic change in consumer behavior due to the emergence of social and digital platforms and a significance and ubiquity of mobile as a consumer platform, and Starbucks remains on the very leading edge of all of these developments. In Q2 we introduced new innovations and initiatives that further demonstrates Starbucks leadership in consumer card, loyalty and mobile payment experiences as more and more of our customers choose the Starbucks card as their preferred method of payment. Consider the following statistics; today, nearly one-quarter of all U.S. transactions are made by My Starbucks Rewards loyalty members and nearly one-third of all U.S. in-store transactions are prepaid.","Our mobile apps now have more than 10 million active customers and we are approaching 4 million U.S. global payment transactions per week, accounting for roughly 10% of total U.S. tender. To put this in perspective, Starbucks card tender now exceeds $3 billion annually in the U.S. and Canada, a scale that rivals many premier U.S. banks.","In Q2 we significantly accelerated My Starbucks Rewards membership by offering a $5 credit for U.S. Starbucks cardholders who became a program member, resulting in nearly 1 million new registered members and nearly 500,000 global app downloads during the two-week offer period alone.","Through this and other initiatives, we are adding approximately 80,000 new My Starbucks Rewards customers each week and expect to double the number of active members enrolled in Starbucks Rewards program from 4.5 million at the end of fiscal 2012 to 9 million in 2013.","Even more encouraging is that accelerating adopting is not just a U.S. phenomenon. We are now seeing usage of My Starbucks Rewards at the same or even higher rate than the U.S. in countries like China, Korea and Canada, providing us with a significant sustainable competitive advantage over competitors in these markets.","And beginning in May, we will unveil the market's first cross-plan, cross-channel rewards program, a capability only made possible by the unique combination of Starbucks national retail store footprint, broad consumer package goods presence and industry-leading digital capabilities.","Our customers will be able to earn My Starbucks Rewards stars for purchases of Starbucks packaged coffee in grocery channels. The star can then be redeemed for free food or beverages in Starbucks retail stores, an exciting new example of our blueprint for profitable growth being brought to life.","It's very hard, I think, to actually explain this in the kind of detail or the attachment that we think this is going to do, and this gives us a significant competitive advantage over other like coffee products that are sold in grocery, and we're going to see incrementality as a result of that in our own retail stores.","The revenue and operating leverage provided by the scale and synergies among our digital, card loyalty, mobile and social platforms provides us with strong core muscle in our U.S. business and increasingly in multiple channels in markets across the globe. And Adam Brotman, Starbucks Chief Digital Officer and I'd like to tell the digital team we are just getting started literally in the nascent stage.","Today, Starbucks ability to touch people in and beyond our stores is greater than any time in our history. And as a reality that gives me great confidence that we can obtain the high aspiration of becoming one of the worlds most respected and admired and enduring companies.","We are very fortunate to have added [Mike Conway], our new Executive Vice President for Channel Development as well as Sharon Rothstein and Matthew Ryan as Chief Marketing Officer and Chief Strategy Officer respectively to help us achieve these ambitious goals joining an already experienced and talented leadership team. I'd like to personally take this opportunity to publicly welcome Mike, Sharon to Starbucks.","I'm convinced that the next two to three years for Starbucks will be among the most dynamic and exciting periods in the history of our company. The results we announced today demonstrate that Starbucks Coffee Company has the strength, the health and the talent to continue profitably building our business in multiple channels around the world, at the same time as we continue delivering value to our shareholders.","I'll now turn the call over to Cliff who will take you through the Q2 results of the America segment.","Cliff Burrows","Thank you, Howard, and good afternoon everyone. I'm very pleased to join you today to discuss the strongest second quarter results of our Americas business and to share with you several new exciting initiatives we have ahead of us. Americas revenue grew by 10% in the second quarter to $2.6 billion, fueled by 6% same-store sales growth with 5% coming off increased transactions and 2% from the higher average ticket.","In the U.S., comp sales grew by a very healthy 7%, a number of drivers were behind it. We had a great success with our featured beverages including Vanilla Spice Latte and Hazelnut Macchiato, which combines nearly two percentage points of comp growth in the quarter.","Food sales also lifted our comp, with strong growth in the afternoon from offerings from food offerings aided by expanded panini availability and strong Bistro Box performance. On our first quarter call, we talked about the strength of Starbucks card sales during the holiday and how that gave us great confidence in our ability to deliver a strong Q2. That absolutely played out this quarter and what is particularly encouraging is we\u2019re seeing a lift in both afternoon daypart and in our high priced indulgent beverages by card users. There are significant number of new customers and new occasions being introduced by Starbucks card leading to new daily routines and greater loyalty, all of which bodes well for our future growth.","While America segment revenue grew 10%, operating income grew 22% to $550 million. We delivered strong flow through on our exceptional sales growth with margins in the Americas growing by 220 basis points to 21.1% in the second quarter. That is the highest Q2 margin we have ever reported in the Americas segment and there are several things contributing to this improvement.","Firstly, we are intensely focused on store operations, including (indiscernible) waste and utilities management. We are improving productivity as well and this is allowing us to increase customer visits without adding costs. For example, our new (indiscernible) are leading to simplified operations which in turn allows us to bring in new products or minimizing additional complexity to the system. We are also benefiting from lot of coffee prices; this alone provided 40 basis points of favorability in our costs and occupancy line in Q2.","Today's public stores are busier than ever, but we remain very conscious that outstanding service is what brings back customers again and again, that is why I am so proud about the focus of our store partners. The focus of store partners continues to place on delivering the Starbucks experience. We can see from customer voice metrics within the U.S. taste of beverage and speed of service rules are among the highest levels in recent years. Friendliness and order accuracy also moved meaningfully high in the second quarter. All these combined led to the highest total increase and our overall satisfaction goes in two years.","We continue to grow strongly outside the U.S. with Latin America delivering double-digit revenue growth. The success was seen in our licensed markets across the region together with the potential of Brazil, giving confidence to Starbucks future growth across Latin America. Our performance in Mexico is particularly exceptional, which is why we are so excited to build on the strong foundation already in place and enhance our intent to open 250 new stores over the next five years as part of the sale of our equity there. That sale is consistent with our strategy to simplify equity structure.","Looking ahead, there are number of values that been critical to our growth. One begins next week as we signaled the return of summer at Starbucks by launching our new Caramel Ribbon Crunch Frappuccino and this will be to accompany the full line up as signature handcrafted Frappuccino beverages that are being in our stores for nearly 20 years. This will be a strong compliment to the retaining line of chilled summer beverages including ice coffee, ice teas and our handcrafted refreshers.","Food is also near and long-term growth driver for the Americas. Our overall food program continues to perform well and we are excited about what's coming in the U.S. with La Boulange. At the end of the second quarter we had 150 Starbucks stores having La Boulange products. As of today we\u2019re in 439 stores, having rolled out to the entire San Francisco Bay Area. And unless we\u2019ve seen this far, what is still early has been encouraging. I look forward to sharing more detail with you as all of the sites become in more meaningful.","What I can tell you is the La Boulange pastries will roll out in specific Northwest including Seattle, in June then we'll expand to cities including Los Angeles and Chicago, followed later in the year by New York and Boston. We remain on track to have La Boulange products in all of our U.S. company operated stores by the end of 2014.","Another area of focus for the team is unleashing the real potential we have in drive-thru. As Howard mentioned, in the last quarter the majority of U.S. new store growth over the next few years will come from drive-through. The business case is very compelling. Our drive-thru stores have healthy profit margins as we're able to better leverage fixed occupancy costs and depreciation with sales coming from both out of the window and in the caf\u00e9.","We're not only focused on opening new drive-through stores, over the past two years we've conducted a deep analysis on how best to enhance efficiency and the customer experience through the drive-through window. As a result, we have already improved our menu boards, optimized operational standards and upgraded our equipment. These improvements are driving faster speed of service, high order accuracy and improved customer satisfaction.","We're still in the early days of our overall drive-through innovation. As we know our relationship with customers is just as important as the drive-through window as inside the caf\u00e9 and our priority as well as our financial results over the coming years will reflect this.","Meanwhile, we're focused on maintaining the high quality of our existing portfolio, updating stores to approximately 1,600 renovations across the Americas segment this year. While we don't state meaningful overall sales lift due to routine renovations, we do see immediate results when we add new programs or increase capacity as part of the work.","As Howard mentioned, our integration to Teavana business is well underway and I'm extremely proud to now be leading this premium, innovative concept, and I know the expertise we have gained over 40 years of coffee merchandising and our leadership in handcrafted beverage preparation will translate tremendously well to the high level of product quality and innovation already associated to the Teavana. We're excited in the coming quarters to share more about the ideas and plans that are emerging.","All that we have accomplished and all that we have yet to accomplish would be impossible without what is far and away Starbucks most important asset, our people. I can say with certainty that my Americas leadership team has never been stronger than this today. We have great stability and rich diversity resulting in a deep talented bunch.","While I get the fortune of discussing our record results and tremendous growth with you all, it's important to remember that the partners in the 13,000 stores of the Americas region really made this all happen. So to them I'd like to say thank you.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Troy Alstead. Troy?","Troy Alstead","Thank you, Cliff, and good afternoon everyone. We are extremely fortunate that the Americas business produces results that consistently exceed what you would normally expect from a business so large and mature. Cliff cited many of the reasons behind that success; innovation, consistent delivery of outstanding customer service and a deep entrepreneurial spirit. It's the consistent strength of the Americas performance that allows us to nurture the seeds of growth outside of the Americas.","I will now talk to the second quarter results of those businesses. In China and Asia Pacific, we continue to [grow] rapidly while delivering strong results. Net revenues of $214 million represented 22% of growth in the second quarter and reverted by a mixture of 15 net new store openings over the past year along with same-store sales growth of 8%. Considering the difficulties that others are experiencing in this part of the world, coupled with the fact that we are lacking extremely strong comp of 18% last year, we are very pleased with this performance.","Half of our Q2 comp growth was due to increased transactions as customers were receptive to our seasonal offerings with continued strength from the My Starbucks Rewards program in China also contributing. Ticket growth was due to a combination of pricing as well as sales mix.","Operating income of $68.3 million [plus] operating margin of 32.0%, down [Technical Difficulty]. We have grown our company-operated store base by 35% in the past year, double the pace of growth in the region overall. And as I have indicated for some time now, that portfolio mix shift is strategically and financially very valuable, but it does currently have a negative mix shift impact in operating margin in the region.","We added 56 new company-operated stores (indiscernible) in the second quarter, the highest number of company-operated stores we've ever opened in a single quarter in this region. We are solidly on track with our previously communicated growth trajectory in China and across the regions. Just as with last quarter and as we expect to continue, this higher pace of growth carries with it investment spending to open and operate these new stores. That also led to a portion of the margin decline we reported this quarter.","Finally, we reported a year-over-year decline at $2.1 million in income from equity investees in the second quarter. This is entirely the result of favorable non-routine income of $6.7 million in the second quarter of last year. Our partnerships across [capital thriving] including in Japan where comps and new store growth are both higher this quarter than in the prior-year.","In EMEA the difficult economic climate and continued weakness in retail football continued to impact our business. Total net revenues of $273 million reflect the last Q2 with license store revenue growth of 48% offset by a 6% decline in company operated revenue. The license store revenue growth was primarily the result of the addition of 117 license stores over the past year combined with strong comp growth.","The company operated revenue declined, it was the result of the declining company operated store base which is the outcome of the store closures we\u2019ve previously spoken about as well as the sale of a number of company operated stores to license partners. Also contributing was a 2% in comparable store sales. Profitability in EMEA remains challenged, but we're making progress on a number of fronts.","Operating income for the quarter rose to a positive $5.2 million up from a loss of $7 million in Q2 of last year. Our continued disciplined focus on cost management is one of the items contributing to the improvement. Additionally we\u2019re beginning to see the benefit of our portfolio mix shift to a more heavily licensed model. EMEA net new store growth in Q2 was entirely comprised of license stores also contributing to the Q2 profitability with a $5.7 million reduction to the estimated asset retirement obligations of our store leases in the region.","We are in this for the long run in Europe. It will take time to grow our license business in the region and it will take time to drive increased profitability to our existing company operated store base. The opportunity in Europe and the Middle East is meaningful though and the eventual payoff will be well worth. I mean now moving to channel development where revenues of $344 million grew 7% over the prior-year. The second quarter as it is the case for all of fiscal 2013 for channel development reflects slower growth as we continue to develop and invest in the products and businesses that will drive more rapid growth in future years.","The channel development business consists of the larger highly profitable but slower growing roast and ground coffee in food service businesses which account for approximately two thirds of current channel development revenue, and a smaller, faster growing single-serve ready to drink in international businesses. While these newer businesses account for only one third of our channel development revenue today, we are building for the future with new capability, distribution and innovation across VIA, K-cups, Verismo, Iced Coffee, Refreshers and Tea. The investments we\u2019re making now will help fuel solid, long-term growth in the segment in the coming years.","During the quarter, dollar sales in the roast and ground coffee category declined 3.5% versus prior-year in U.S. food, drug and mass channels. And while we are pleased that we\u2019re outperforming the industry, we are not pleased that our roast and ground dollar sales did not grow over that same period. Nearly all of our competitors have reduced pricing over the past several quarters and has announced earlier this month we have responded with a list price reduction effective in May. We believe our move reflects the right pricing in this environment along with other unique loyalty and value drivers such as My Starbucks Rewards will provide value and relevance in the category to grow share.","K-cups continue to be an outstanding contributor to our channel development business and were the primary driver of revenue growth in the quarter. Starbucks K-cups share of the premium single cup space in U.S. food, drug and mass channel grew 2.3 percentage points to 14% in the quarter reflecting the continued momentum of this still young platform. Bottom line growth in channel development in the second quarter outpaced top line growth. Operating income of $94 million grew 18% over last year; operating margin expanded 270 basis points to 27.4% as lower coffee related costs provided year-over-year favorability.","Finally, let me briefly touch on our other segments. JoAnn briefly mentioned at the beginning of the call that we have included results for Teavana along with Seattle\u2019s Best Coffee, Evolution Fresh, the Tazo retail store and our digital ventures business and are reporting under all other segments. For the second quarter the year-over-year growth in revenue and operating income of these other segments was primarily due to the inclusion of Teavana results this quarter for the first time, then the other businesses also contributed to the revenue growth. We are working to integrate inline Teavana reporting and as this becomes a more meaningful portion of our consolidated results, I expect that we will enhance our disclosure.","Now, I will wrap up the second quarter on a consolidated basis before moving to targets for the remainder of the year. Consolidated net revenues grew to a Q2 record $3.6 billion representing growth of 11% over last Q2. This increase was due to comparable store sales growth of 6% including 4% coming from higher transactions and 2% from higher average ticket. Beverage and food innovation outstanding customer service and a growing base of highly loyal customers all were key contributors to this quarter's growth.","Consolidated operating income grew to 26% to $544 million in the second quarter. Consolidated operating margin expanded 180 basis points to 15.3%, the highest Q2 margin we've ever reported. Leverage on our strong sales coupled with 50 basis points of lower coffee cost drove the improvement.","The combination of strong sales growth in our core business, operational efficiencies in our retail stores and favorable commodity tailwinds led the record earnings per share of $0.51. This includes a $0.03 gain on the sale of our equity in our Mexico joint venture which is reported in the interest income and other line. Excluding this gain, EPS grew by 20% at the high end of our targeted range.","Also of note, Starbucks repurchased approximately 3 million shares of stock during the second quarter. This leaves approximately 26 million shares authorized as available for repurchase. The combination of these repurchases along with the $0.21 per share dividend resulted in $309 million return to shareholders in the second quarter and brings our first half of fiscal 2013 total to more than $850 million.","Now that we are halfway through fiscal 2013, I will provide an updated outlook for the year. Given our strong first half results and the momentum we are carrying into the second half of the year, we are raising our full year earnings per share target to a range of $2.12 to $2.18.","For the third quarter, we're targeting EPS in the range of $0.50 to $0.53. For the fourth quarter, we're targeting EPS in the range of $0.54 to $0.57. We now expect to add 1,600 globally reflecting the previously targeted 1,300 Starbucks stores in addition to 350 Teavana stores that were acquired or will open this year.","We remain on track to deliver on all other previously communicated targets, including 10% to 13% consolidated revenue growth, mid-single digit global comparable store sales growth, approximately 100 basis points of consolidated operating margin improvement, a tax rate of 33%, and capital expenditures of $1.2 billion. Finally, we now anticipate resolution of the dispute with Kraft sometime in the second half of fiscal 2013.","As we now progress into the second half of the fiscal year, we are extremely pleased that we were able to deliver yet another record set of results in Q2. Our Americas business continued its remarkable top and bottom line performance and we continue to demonstrate solid growth across our entire portfolio. We recently wrapped up our strategic planning for the next five years, and I can tell you that I've never been as optimistic at what lies ahead as I am today. The future growth potential of this company is as clear as it is diverse.","Our opportunities to deliver industry-leading shareholder returns are as great as our opportunity to enhance the communities in which we serve. And the rigor and discipline with which we make decisions and proceed along this path will only be matched by the focus on the outstanding experience we deliver to each and every customer. I am excited for what lies ahead in the second half of this year and even more excited for what lies ahead in the coming years.","With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to the operator for Q&A. Mike?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Michael Kelter from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs","Can you guys talk a little more about your early experience rolling out La Boulange in the stores and that where do you use \u2013 because the lift was encouraging. I was hoping you could help us with what exactly encouraging meant? And maybe in your answer you could touch upon the impact to traffic versus ticket and whether you're getting a lift in coffee or just food?","Cliff Burrows","Thanks for the question. It's Cliff here. The reason I said encouraging, we are in 150 stores with any track record and we've been working live with this in refining the products as we've gone along. We are now in a meaningful 439 stores, so it will be much more meaningful when we report the next quarter and the coming quarters. I am firstly encouraged by the pride our partners in the stores have in sharing and serving and enjoying this food, the reaction of the customers, especially to the lemonades, things of the croissant, (indiscernible) and Almond Croissant which are the signature products of La Boulange. With any change, it takes time for people, customers to get used to new products, ourselves to get confident with those products and obviously we\u2019ve got a new routine with warming in stores. I\u2019m encouraged by the progress we\u2019re making. I\u2019m encouraged by the reaction, and again as I said I look forward to sharing more of that in the coming quarters.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Glass from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","John Glass - Morgan Stanley","Thanks. On the earnings guidance, I guess just a couple of questions. One is; why are you raising it now, it would suggest an acceleration of earnings growth from a 20% range in the first half to 25%, so what are the components that drive that, first? And secondly, does it include that $0.03 and where is that $0.03 I can\u2019t find it, what segment is that in?","Howard Schultz","Thanks John. We\u2019re raising because first of all we\u2019re half way through the year. So we now have half the year in the bank, we\u2019ve been able to see two quarters worth of great top-line growth and great earnings growth, and that gives us increased confidence in our expectations for the balance of the year. I\u2019d also point out that we\u2019re just that much closer now to new products that will launch as we move to the balance of the year; how the seasons are trending; our ability to drive flow through on incremental sales. All of that now half way through the year has just increased in confidence and allows us to increase our guidance for the balance of the year and for the full-year. Specifically to your second part of your question; yes the all year-to-date results are reflected in that full-year guidance so that $0.03 of the Mexico gain is included in that new 212 to 218 range that we put out there today. And that is reported in the interest income and other expense, so you need to look at the consolidated P&L and you\u2019ll see a year-over-year change there. There\u2019s a number I think going on in that category but there\u2019s a big driver of this Mexico gain that shows up in that line.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Keith Siegner from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Keith Siegner - Credit Suisse","Thank you. Just a question about the new multi-channel loyalty program rolling next month. I mean, this is \u2013 it definitely is unprecedented, and I\u2019m sure, at least to some extent there\u2019s going to be some education required, but that\u2019s kind of the big opportunity right, you get to bring in a lot of the non-current loyalties as they realize this opportunity. If you could talk a little bit about that marketing program, maybe how you plan to message this? Do you roll it out first just to existing users? How do you get the broad based awareness of this new opportunity? Thanks.","Jeff Hansberry","Hi, Keith its Jeff Hansberry. We\u2019re very excited about bringing My Starbucks Rewards down the isle. And to your very point, today we\u2019ve got about 6 million My Starbucks Rewards customers. As we extend the program into channels we\u2019ll be able to reach an audience and make My Starbucks Rewards available and create awareness for the program to an audience that is 10 times larger than our current My Starbucks Rewards audience. The way we\u2019ll bring that to live is, in the store there will be point of sale material and there will be material on each and every package of roast and ground coffee to create rapid awareness with both our loyal customers and with new customers as they become aware of the program. We will thread MSR trough everything we do in channels and will become an integral part of every promotion that we run going forward. So, we have great expectations in how it will transform the way our customers experience the brand and their loyalty to the brand.","Howard Schultz","Jeff, maybe you can also say, the benefit we have about the stores within all of these stores, 1000\u2019s of licenses.","Jeff Hansberry","Yes, yes. Thanks, Howard. So, we\u2019ve got over 3000 license stores that sit within some of the best grocery and mass merchant real estate in the U.S. What that allows us to do is to create an ecosystem within the store where our customers have the opportunity to buy hand-crafted Starbucks beverages and also their packed coffee needs down the isle. And as Howard, mentioned in his comments; every time you buy a Starbucks roast and ground coffee you\u2019ll earn My Starbucks Rewards stars that can be redeemed for Starbucks food or Starbucks drinks. And now with those 3000 stores in the best grocery stores around the U.S. that makes it more relevant, it helps to thread it through or blueprint for growth more easily.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sara Senatore from Sanford Bernstein. Your line is open.","Sara Senatore - Sanford Bernstein","Hi. Thank you very much. I wanted to just talk about the channel development business briefly, obviously you said that you're pleased with the share gains, but would've liked to seen a little bit more growth in the biggest part of your business. I'm just trying to reconcile sort of the slower top line growth with, I think, what is continued confidence that there will be \u2013 that ultimately this business will be as big or bigger than retail, and if you could just talk about the cadence you see and maybe when some of these other initiatives will start to look a little bit or be a little bit more present to offset what appears to be sort of a slower growth core package business? Thank you.","Jeff Hansberry","Hi, Sara, it's Jeff Hansberry again. We remain very confident in the future of channel development. Q2 was a challenging quarter. In that we saw both a slowing in the roast and ground business overall combined with a lot of competitive activity on our largest segment, roast and ground. That said, we feel strongly that we have the right mix of value and promotion and merchandising and loyalty activity to reignite growth in our roast and ground business with the list price reduction that we announced this month that will take effect in May with the activation of the My Starbucks Rewards program with some new additional innovation that will be hitting the market in Q3 and Q4 to include a 40% increase in the number of SKUs of K-Cups across the Tazo Tea brand as well as the Starbucks Coffee brand, additional innovation hitting the market in VIA as well as our ready-to-drink portfolio with Starbucks Iced Coffee and some other new innovations that will come later in this year. So we remain very optimistic. And layered on top of what we're seeing in the U.S. business, we continue to be in the nascent stages of our international expansion. I think I've shared previously that today the channel business only operates in about 20 of the 62 countries where Starbucks has retail operations and we're working aggressively toward expanding beyond the U.S. with our CPG portfolio.","Sara Senatore \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Greg Badishkanian from Citigroup. Your line is open.","Gregory Badishkanian - Citigroup Inc.","Great. Thank you. In the press release, you mentioned that you had considerable momentum in business as you entered the second half, which is very encouraging and I'm just wondering, what's the read through of that comment to April same-store sales?","Cliff Burrows","Greg, we won't speak specific about April at all. What we can say with confidence is the great strength that we came through the first quarter, the holiday period that we've reported on previously as you know and then as we progressed through this quarter with a backdrop of, as you know, very choppy and mixed results broadly in the retail environment and with many other retail companies, we produced very steady, healthy strong growth and traffic growth and in same-store sales growth in the U.S. and consistent ability to leverage that strong top line into profit growth at the bottom. So no specific comments about April, but we exited Q2 in a very healthy place and that's given us confidence in terms of the low momentum combined with the pipeline of what's to come in the third quarter and the fourth quarter, the lineup of innovation across all channels encourages us that leads to our confidence in the momentum and that leads to our ability to speak with such confidence about the back half of the year.","Howard Schultz","Greg, I'll add one other thing. I think it's hard to perhaps really get underneath what's going on with social and digital media, the loyalty card and mobile. What I can tell you though is that we as a company have cracked the code on being able to leverage those platforms in a number of ways. To create awareness in trial of new customers who are not in the Starbucks franchise, to lower our cost of customer acquisition as a result of the fact that we're using these channels as opposed to conventional advertising. And then thirdly, we can analyze with great specificity that the loyalty and the stars that now will be leverage on to the CPG channel is significantly relevant to our core customers. When you combine that with what we've been able to do during peak periods in terms of efficiency and productivity plus creating new need stakes for customers in dayparts that in the previous years we have not been as busy as Troy said, gives us great confidence that the 7% comps that we sold in the first quarter and second quarter is stunning accomplishments when you look at the backdrop of the economy and what other people are reporting, especially given the environment we are in. So, I would say that the ecosystem that Jeff talked about and what we're going to be able to do with these programs going forward gives us the optimism that we are in very good shape for the balance of the year.","Gregory Badishkanian - Citigroup Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein from Barclays. Your line is open.","Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays","Great. Thank you very much. It's a question on more so balance sheet, in terms of cash or even looking at the cash flow statement and after CapEx spend, obviously there is no shortage of cash. I'm just wondering if you can give us kind of an update in terms of forward discussions as it relates to and how you determine the right balance first of all this is the share repurchase and dividend, what is the right level there, because obviously you could be a doing a lot more of both. And then the potential whether its considered an increase in leverage obviously right now may be it is not your priority, but rates are fairly compelling, so I\u2019m wondering whether you consider boosting leverage or how you even think about the leverage \u2013 the right leverage level perhaps once the settlement is complete? Any thoughts on that front will be great.","Troy Alstead","Sure Jeff. I think the first thing I mentioned is where you ended which is we are awaiting resolution of our dispute with Kraft and as we come through that, which we now expect for sometime in the second half of this fiscal year, that will bring clarity to allow us to then formulate a little bit more specifically our go-forward plans. But I will say that we are very committed to sustainable dividends and growing the dividends through two metrics. One is by at earnings grow over time, the payout ratio where we have been paying since initiation at 35% to 40% payout ratio; I would expect to grow dividends just as earnings growth. But I would also expect to look at that range over time, not immediately but we are well aware of whether as an industry payout and I would anticipate at elevating that payout ratio at the appropriate time, which I think the strength of our cash flow in the business. Similarly with share repurchases, we are committed to a balance of dividends and repurchases. Of course repurchases are much more opportunistic, but we\u2019re committed  to the program and our Board has authorized continued opportunities for us to being more active in the open markets, so we will take advantage of that as we believe market conditions exist for that. Now with respect to, Jeff what I will tell you is, I\u2019m looking closely at debt on our balance sheet and while we certainly have very, very strong cash flow position, we do recognize that we got opportunities to optimize that balance sheet and bring some additional debt on to leverage over time. And I\u2019m well aware of where the market conditions are today and again looking very closely, we had nothing to announce today, but its definitely something close thing on the radar screen.","Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jason West from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Jason West - Deutsche Bank","Yeah, thanks. Just a question on EMEA. If you guys can talk about this thinking on holding on of the company stores there, it\u2019s a business that\u2019s not earning much of a margin today and just wondering, you mentioned some refranchising, but I think that\u2019s for new growth. Just if you revisited the thoughts on refranchising some of the company business to try to pull more profits out of that market?","Howard Schultz","Michelle is sitting in London; I think she is going to answer the question.","Michelle Gass","Yes. Hi, Jason. Michelle here. Excellent question. Actually Howard spoke to, we\u2019re actually now looking at franchising not only for new growth, but sale of some of our existing base. And we\u2019re \u2013 we\u2019ve begun to do that in London and Africa with some learning, then on U.K we will look for other opportunities across the continents. So to clarify, its not just about new store growth, it is actually by looking at the sale of some of our existing base. And we\u2019re confident that this will dramatically shift the profitability of the market.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Palmer from UBS. Your line is open.","David Palmer - UBS","Hey guys. Congratulations on the quarter. Obviously, unbelievable performance, especially at the core U.S. retail. Last year Starbucks did a $10 card for $5 with living social and I\u2019m not acquainted with all the details on these deals, but that seems that the time to be a way to nudge the sales higher during \u2013 after what was a tough June last year. This year I think you did one with Groupon at the end of March when the retail momentum seems very strong. So I'm wondering if you're doing things like this maybe more strategically as you're trying to think about broadening that rewards user base, or maybe just what were you thinking with these types of things? Thanks.","Howard Schultz","It's true that the success that we enjoyed with LivingSocial coupled with the learnings that we had in terms of analyzing it, gave us great confidence that during the right time of the year there was an opportunity to do this again. I think the Starbucks brand and the frequency and the relevancy of the Starbucks experience puts us in the unique position to leverage these kinds of opportunities versus a traditional retailer or restaurant. I think you're exactly right, the momentum in this quarter there was no specific need to be a catalyst, but we felt there's no reason to embrace the status quo. We learnt a great deal from LivingSocial, so we had planned to do it again. I think that Starbucks is in a unique position in that we are a super-premium brand. You don't have to go to Starbucks as a discretionary purchase, but at the same time we've been able to find ways to provide a value proposition throughout the menu system and take advantage of these kinds of offers. When you couple that with the incrementality that we have gotten from our rewards program, we have a new level of analytics that we feel is a significant competitive advantage going forward domestically and internationally, and we're now going to apply that to other channels of distributions specifically the grocery. And I want to go back to one question that was asked earlier about, is in fact the other channels going to be as large as we've said in the past? And no one on this call should doubt whatsoever the commitment we have and the ambition for the multiple channels of distribution to live outside of our stores that will rival the scale of the U.S. business. We have an opportunity as we've demonstrated with VIA, as we've demonstrated with Evolution to introduce products in our stores, create the brand and then draft off that into the grocery channel. These are early, early days but the evidence that we have about what I've just described, coupled with this new level of analytics and the benefit from these loyalty programs gives us great confidence that we have the tools, the resources and the multiple channels of distribution that no other consumer brand or retailer has to do things that have not been done before. And this loyalty program that we're going to launch into CPG is a significant idea both for the consumer and I also should say for the trade that we have been in close contact with. And I'm stunned that no one has asked the question about the CPG opportunity in China. Did you not hear what I said? We are looking at the opportunity to take the CPG business into the largest growing market into the world leveraging the equity of the brand and our 1,000-store retail footprint in China.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","John Ivankoe - JPMorgan","Howard, I will \u2013 be a follow-up on that last statement and then another question, if I may.","Howard Schultz","Finally.","John Ivankoe - JPMorgan","How many points of distribution do you think you could have in the CPG market in China? I mean is it like the U.S. in terms of grocery stores? I don't know exactly what the numbers are there?","Howard Schultz","I think the type of distribution that we'll ultimately have in Mainland China will be different than the core distribution we have in the U.S. That channel does not have the nationwide grocery businesses. However, the demand for Starbucks coffee and coffee products that we've had from customers and from people interested on the trade side has been growing. And so we believe very strongly that we can take advantage of that. And when we look at products like Bottled Frappuccino and the success of Blended Frappuccino in China, which has been a significant opportunity for us, we think we can leverage Bottled Frappuccino in the same context that we\u2019ve done in the U.S. which is a $1 billion brand. So, this is a big long-term idea and it\u2019s built off the unique trust and confidence and the relevancy of the Starbucks retail brand in China. And for any of you who have been to Mainland China, you\u2019ve seen that the people who are going into our stores in now over 70 cities in China are Chinese nationals who are using our stores in the same way that Starbucks customers have for years in the U.S. They\u2019re drinking Starbucks coffee, they\u2019re drinking espresso beverages and they\u2019re using our stores as an extension of home and work.","John Ivankoe - JPMorgan","Okay. And if I may, follow-up on a slightly different topic. There was, I guess some discussion on the last conference call that in your early quarter sales, your March quarter sales may have been helped by very high Starbucks card redemptions because of the heavy gifting that happened in the December quarter. So, I was hoping that you could, kind of comment whether that was the case, also comment \u2013 I don\u2019t think I saw the number anywhere, what the end of quarter, March quarter Starbucks card balance was and you\u2019re kind of in the thought just \u2013 in case I don\u2019t get, I cut off Troy, if there was anyway that we can tighten up the coffee cost guidance for \u201914 and \u201915 as appropriate they need to be that?","John Culver","Well, there is no doubt that we got a boost from the sale of Starbucks holiday cards, following the holiday season. But the one thing that has happened over the course of time is that the velocity of Starbucks card sales are much more significant in the off peak holiday season than ever before, coupled with the fact that we now have a significant spike in other smaller holidays, Mothers Day, Fathers Day, Graduation, Birthdays and Gift giving. So the card itself is growing at over 30% and we expect that we continue and we just \u2013 we\u2019re just getting started with it. I think Troy is going to give you the answer to the other question.","Troy Alstead","Yeah, John. Specifically we had on the balance sheet at the end of March, at the end of the second quarter, deferred revenue on the P&L is $668 million. That largely reflects Starbucks card balances as it does in each quarter. And our overall loads during the quarter were 32% higher than the same period time last year. So a couple of metrics that I think tell you two things. One is, the huge up tick in Starbucks card in all forms. Mobile, physical card in a loyalty program in the holiday period very profoundly came through our business in the second quarter. Card overall added roughly two percentage points of the comp growth during the second quarter, very powerful for us and not unlike what we\u2019ve seen over the past couple of years that that program has built tremendously. I think as encouraging as anything is the fact that in the second quarter not only will we benefit from that big holiday slew of cards that came back into the stores. We also though turned new card users into loyalty program members that now allows us to connect with there much more meaningfully, and we believe gives us trajectory even more significantly into Q3 and Q4. So the card was very important to us in the quarter. Now specific to your question about coffee cost. We have now purchased a little bit more than or priced -- a little bit more than half of our coffee needs for fiscal \u201914. We have been doing some incremental buying given current market conditions. So we have got about half -- a little bit more than half of our needs locked up for \u201914 and given what we\u2019ve locked as well as visibility we have in the market conditions and how we might price the balance of the year, we expect that as I\u2019ve told you before about $100 million of commodity tailwind we would expect to come through the P&L in fiscal \u201914. That\u2019s the year-over-year benefit in fiscal \u201914. Now we\u2019re not meaningfully priced at all in the fiscal \u201915 yet, but I would just point out that given where the market has been trading and where we believe it will go from here, we\u2019ve got opportunity in fiscal \u201915 to experience another year-over-year commodity tailwind. Not a specific number yet, but it could be a meaningful tailwind coming our way again in fiscal \u201915.","John Ivankoe - JPMorgan","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mitchell Speiser from Buckingham Research. Your line is open.","Mitchell Speiser - Buckingham Research","Great. Thanks very much. And my question is on the food program in general in the U.S. a couple of parts of the question. First, have the same store sales continue to grow quicker in food versus the overall business. And secondly, I sometimes get the pushback where that food is a lower margin product, so as it grows it could hurt margins, but is the offset a higher ticket and kind of how that works? And then the last part of the food question is just on health and wellness and the bakery product looks great, I wouldn't consider it under the umbrella of health and wellness. If you can maybe give us a little sense of where you might be going with health and wellness in the Starbuck stores? Thank you.","Cliff Burrows","Thanks, Mitch, for the question. Firstly, we are seeing strong continued growth from food. And that has been the case now from the past 12 months. So really reporting a very strong growth in food in the U.S. Obviously, overall, it's a balance between food and beverage which is really important to us. On the margin, I think the \u2013 we're getting healthy margins out of our food. The opportunity here is if we can increase (indiscernible), which historically has been one in three transactions, vacancy is a big opportunity. The other side is it increases the relevance of Starbucks as a place for people to come to whether it's food on the way to work or indeed for their lunch. So we see that continuing and we'll support increased beverage sales throughout the dayparts as well. So that is part of our strategy on food. If I talk about the health and wellness as it relates to new bakery products, the fantastic thing with those new bakery products is they are all natural ingredients while we're taking out any non-artificial ingredients, we use natural sweetening. That's where we can reduce sugar. So when there is buffering there, finest ingredients, calories are managed both by the balance of those ingredients plus portion size. So that is a good part of it and health and wellness remains an important part of our strategy going forward. And you'll see in the coming months that we'll supplement a lot of launch products with other products which will give that balance. It's important to us for both food and for better customer choice and in all parts of our range of beverage and food to give healthy options.","Howard Schultz","And, Mitch, I'd like to just underscore Cliff's point about margins. While food has a lower gross margin than does our beverage platform, on a net margin level, so at the store level, food is actually additive to margin we would expect over time. And the reason for that is if we're selling incremental food and as we will be increasingly successful, we believe that increasing mix of food in our stores, the rent is already paid, the lights are on, staff is in place, our partners are in the stores, so we have an opportunity to very incrementally, perhaps see that impact of gross margin very moderately, but I would expect it to be neutral to most likely positive to margin at the store level.","Mitchell Speiser - Buckingham Research","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Buckley of Bank of America. Your line is open.","Joe Buckley - Bank of America","Thank you. Just a question on the China Asia-Pacific operating income performance for the quarter being flat. I know you mentioned making investment in the platform to grow the business, but could you talk a little bit about that for the quarter and what we should \u2013 how should we think about that going forward?","John Culver","Joe, this is John Culver. With regards to the operating income and the impact that we saw when you look at it on a year-over-year basis, there are really three things. First was, the portfolio mix shift that [Technical Difficulty] fact that more and more of our growth is coming from our company-operated markets, and in particular China. So, in the quarter, as Troy mentioned, we grew store count 35% on a year-over-year basis. The second big item that hit us was this non-routine income and Troy quoted that at $6.7 million. That was the joint venture income that we took last year in the quarter\u2026","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this is the operator. I apologize but there is a slight delay in today's conference. Please hold and the conference will resume momentarily. Thank you for your patience. ","Howard Schultz","This is Starbucks. We're back on the call, operator.","Operator","Your line is open.","Howard Schultz","Do we have a question?","Joe Buckley - Bank of America","Hi, Howard, this is Joe Buckley, I don't know if you can hear me, but we can hear you but John got cutoff\u2026","Howard Schultz","John, do you want to take another shot at that?","John Culver","Yeah. So, with regards to the operating income and what we saw in the quarter, there are really three factors playing into it. First, with the portfolio mix shift and the fact that more and more of our growth is coming from our company-owned markets. The second big piece was the investment that we continue to make in accelerating new store growth. And as Troy shared with you, we grew our new store base over 35% on the year-over-year basis. At the same time while we make those investments, we continue to see very strong returns from a sale to investment ratio. And those metrics continue to exceed our expectations. And then the last big item, which was a non-routine item, was some joint venture income that we have to lap over from last year. It was an accounting adjustment that took place last year. It was a $6.7 million accounting adjustment in the quarter and that was the other big non-routine item that we had to lap over for the year.","Howard Schultz","We take one more question, JoAnn?","JoAnn DeGrande","Yes, one more question please, operator.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of Matthew DiFrisco from Lazard. Your line is open.","JoAnn DeGrande","Mike, please (indiscernible) please.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of Brian Bittner from Oppenheimer. Your line is open.","Michael Tamas - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Great, thanks. This is Mike Tamas on for Brian. Just wonder if you can talk about the consumer habits a little bit, that you\u2019re seeing for people that aren\u2019t using the Starbucks card. I thought I heard something mentioned about those users purchasing premium beverages and alike. So I'm just wondering kind of what the spending habits look like when people aren\u2019t using the preloaded money? Thanks.","Troy Alstead","I will try and answer that Mike. What we are trying to come by was that we were seeing incrementality in terms of the afternoon daypart from cardholders and also we are seeing an increase in their purchasing of the indulgent beverages. We were not making and I certainly didn't intend to make any inference about the changing habits of customers who pay by other means and they remain a \u2013 the majority of our customers and they remain very consistent in their habits.","JoAnn DeGrande","Thank you very much.

[Operator Instructions] Ms. DeGrande, you may begin your conference.","JoAnn DeGrande","Thank you. Good afternoon. This is JoAnn DeGrande, Director of Investor Relations for Starbucks Coffee Company. Thank you for joining us today for a review of our first quarter fiscal 2012 financial results. ","This is our first earnings report under our new reporting segments, and we'll take the opportunity today to let you hear directly from 2 of the segment presidents on results from their respective businesses. We'll start our call with comments from Howard Schultz, Chairman, President and CEO. Troy Alstead, our CFO, then speak to consolidated results. Jeff Hansberry, President of CPG, Foodservice and Seattle's Best Coffee, will discuss results for these businesses, followed by Cliff Burrows, President of our American segment. Troy will then wrap things up with a look at Europe, Middle East, Africa and China\/Asia-Pacific results and a review of our targets before we move to Q&A.","Our discussion today will include forward-looking statements, which are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements. Any such statements should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements in our earnings release, and risk factor discussions in our filings with the SEC, including our last annual report on Form 10-K.","Starbucks assumes no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements or information.

","Before we turn the call over to Howard, let me cover a few housekeeping matters. Historical results recapped under the new reporting segments can be found under the Investor Relations segment of starbucks.com. In addition to the P&Ls we initially filed and posted late last week, we added 3-year historical same-store sales data and store counts. Also, please note that we filed the company's 2012 proxy statement today, which can also be found on our website. And finally, Starbucks' 2012 Annual Meeting of Shareholders will be held in Seattle at 10 a.m. Pacific Time on Wednesday, March 21. That meeting will also be available via webcast. ","With that, please let me turn the call over to Howard Schultz. Howard?","Howard D. Schultz","Thank you, JoAnn, and welcome to everyone on the call. We are delighted to report Starbucks' first quarter of fiscal 2012 results we announced earlier today. Q1 was an outstanding quarter for Starbucks on many levels. We served more customers in our stores around the world than at any other time in our history, and our financial performance indicates that we delivered on every key performance metric, to drive our ninth consecutive quarter of positive comps, including 9% growth in U.S. comparable store sales and 9% increase in global comparable store sales, a 7% increase in customer traffic and the strongest holiday season in our 40-year history, record quarterly revenues of $3.4 billion and record quarterly earnings of $0.50 per share. ","Combined with the growing strength and global relevancy of the Starbucks brand, our performance in Q1 was driven by continued product and beverage innovation, continued focus on operating excellence, fiscal discipline, deepening our connection to customers, elevating our customer experience and extraordinary execution by Starbucks' partners in all 57 countries around the world, in which we operate. Yet it's gratifying as our results last quarter were, we are even more motivated by the global opportunity that lies ahead, both in terms of growth of our store footprint and the growing opportunity within CPG. ","By now, you know that in October, Starbucks implemented a new leadership and organizational structure, the centerpiece of which, is a new 3-region global alignment of our retail business. This move was designed to support an acceleration of Starbucks' long-term blueprint for profitable growth, a global growth strategy we first shared with you in December of 2010 at our biannual analyst conference. ","The Starbucks' blueprint for growth is proving to be a differentiated and unique approach that allows us to integrate and build off of our global retail footprint, our deep and unique connection with our customers and our rapidly-expanding CPG business. While some companies may be able to execute some portions of this strategy, we strongly believe that Starbucks is the only company in the world with a global footprint of company-owned and operated stores, a growing CPG business, best-in-class social and digital media assets, a cutting-edge experience with mobile payment and millions of registered Starbucks cardholders as part of our loyalty program. ","These assets, along with our management talent and the underlying trust in the equity of our brand, allows us to introduce a new product or category within our stores, and draft off of that success to then build multiple channels of profitable distribution, as part of our CPG strategy. ","We have built and we are executing a synergistic model that we first initiated through the introduction of Starbucks VIA. Beyond product success and importance to our global single-cup strategy, VIA demonstrated that Starbucks has the unique ability to leverage our global retail footprint, and unique connection with customers to create and grow a completely-new CPG product category. And VIA was, in many ways, the proof source for our blueprint for growth strategy. ","In 2010, we aspired to build VIA into a billion-dollar brand, and today, we are well down that path. In its first year, VIA achieved $185 million of systemwide sales, and generated more than $250 million in systemwide sales in fiscal 2011, with over 80,000 points of distribution. The confidence and muscle memory we have developed with VIA is now being applied in our approach to new opportunities. ","The pent-up demand and growing customer response to the launch of the Starbucks K-Cup portion packs last November, is another illustration of our blueprint for growth at work. But unlike VIA, we inverted the model and the sequence of events. We launched K-Cups nationwide first in CPG, shipping over 100 million K-Cup packs, to every region of the country. Building off of that success later this year, we will bring K-Cups to our own retail stores, timing this availability with the additional supply that is required to meet the increasing demand in this exciting new area of business. ","We strongly believe that as we garner additional supply, and continue to execute against our channel rollout plan, we will build a second billion-dollar business within our single-serve portfolio, adjacent to the billion-dollar opportunity we see for VIA. ","And on January 10, we rolled out Starbucks' latest innovation, Starbucks Blonde Roast. The question might be asked why is Blonde so significant? Because Blonde provides us with a major new product platform within our core business, to deliver the Starbucks' premium coffee experience to a significant contingent of coffee drinkers that is completely incremental to our existing business, consumers preferring a lighter roast representing 40% of all coffee drinkers in the U.S. alone. ","What's more, following our blueprint for growth, we're launching Blonde differently than we have launched any other product in Starbucks' history, across all channels in our stores and within tens of thousands of points of distribution within CPG and around the world. And as you can see today, Starbucks' blueprint for growth is guiding everything we do and we are just getting started. ","For example, as we speak, we are applying the full talent and muscle of our creative, strategic, social media and operational expertise to our major new entry into the $50 billion health and wellness industry, as we build a national brand with Evolution Fresh. We have exciting news to share on this front in the weeks and months ahead, as we finalize plans for the debut of our Evolution Fresh health and wellness store in the first half of 2012. We're not ready to announce details today but I can assure you, we are incubating a concept unlike anything else in the marketplace today. We look forward to sharing a detail of our vision with you, so please stay tuned. ","Before I turn the call over to Troy, Jeff and Cliff, I'd like to close by thanking our nearly 200,000 Starbucks partners around the world for all they have done to deliver yet, another record quarter and set in motion what is shaping up to be another defining year on many fronts for Starbucks Coffee Company. As we continue to execute at this high level and pace, I couldn't be more proud that what we are doing -- that while we're doing all this, we're doing it in a way which we are preserving our core values in enhancing the connection to the communities we live and where we work, in a sense, using our scale through good [ph]. ","With that, I thank you for the opportunity and I'll turn the call over to Troy.","Troy Alstead","Thanks, Howard, and good afternoon, everyone. Starbucks entered fiscal 2012 with strong momentum, which we carried through our fiscal first quarter, with records being set for many critical measures of our financial health. As Howard mentioned, our blueprint for growth is taking hold, and now beginning to payoff in a big way. ","Record revenues, operating income and earnings are testaments to this, and as you'll hear on this call, we have a great deal of opportunity ahead. I'm going to quickly give you an overview of consolidated results, and I will turn to Jeff and Cliff for more details on their businesses. ","First quarter consolidated net revenues were $3.4 billion, up 16% from $3.0 billion a year ago. The revenue increase was primarily driven by a 9% increase in comparable store sales, attributable to a 7% increase in traffic and a 2% increase in average ticket. Two year global comp reached 16% in the first quarter. ","We reported consolidated operating income of $556 million in the first quarter, an 11% increase over the first quarter of last year. Consolidated operating margin was 16.2%, which represented an 80 point decline from the first quarter of last year. Higher commodity costs were particularly impactful in the quarter, having a negative impact on operating income of $105 million and 300 basis points of pressure on margin. Even with this headwind, EPS reached a record $0.50 per share for the first quarter compared to $0.45 per share on last year's Q1, an 11% increase. ","I'm now going to turn the call over to Jeff Hansberry, who will take us through the remarkable results of our CPG business in the first quarter, and will give you some insights into what's to come in this high-growth area of our company. Jeff?","Jeffery J. Hansberry","Thank you, Troy. We saw strong results amongst our portfolio of branded products in the first fiscal quarter of 2012, even as we continue to reinvest in the business for future growth opportunities. Record quarterly revenue of $336 million was a 72% increase over last year, driven equally by growth of the premium single-cup segment and the benefit of recognizing the full revenue in our packaged coffee and tea business, under the direct distribution model. ","Operating income for the quarter was $80 million, up 12% over the prior year, and operating margin was 23.7%. This is roughly in line with our fiscal year '12 target, driven 950 basis points lower, due to higher coffee costs, which as you know, have had a significant impact on this segment -- have a significant impact on this segment more than any other. ","I would like to provide some additional detail on our key CPG product lines. Our packaged coffee and tea businesses continue to improve, as we approach the anniversary of the transition to our direct distribution model. Despite a consumer shift toward single-serve formats, we did see positive share turns within the packaged coffee segment in the first quarter. We are well positioned to maintain and elevate our leadership in this space through new offerings like Blonde Roast, which I'll talk about more in a minute. Our recently-launched simplified new package -- packaging organized by Roast profile and stronger management of the channel with our direct selling team. ","Next, I'd like to discuss the premium single-cup category, which is without question, the most dynamic segment in the coffee category, with overall growth of more than 130% in the most recent 13-week syndicated data period. Starbucks continues to build share in this category, first with our introduction of VIA, and more recently, with the launch of Starbucks K-Cups. Customer demand for VIA continues to be strong with ACV now in almost 80%. In the first quarter, we added 2 new VIA flavors, House Blend and Breakfast Blend to our CPG offerings, with even more on the way in the near future. We will also continue to expand the availability of VIA, both in the U.S. and abroad. ","Now let me move to Starbucks K-Cups, where we are very pleased with the consumer excitement around our recent launch in the U.S. CPG channel. For the 2 months in the quarter in which Starbucks and Tazo K-Cup packs were available, over 100 million cups were shipped, and we have already reached an 11% value share in the premium single-cup market, with 66% ACV in the month of December. As we gained additional supply, we expect to see continued positive momentum in both of these areas. Looking forward, in Q2, we plan to launch K-Cups in the Canadian CPG channel, and later in the year, we will roll out the products in Starbucks retail stores in both the U.S. and Canada. ","Another area that we are excited about is our acquisition of Evolution  Fresh, a superpremium juice company. With this acquisition, we will reinvent the $1.6 billion superpremium juice segment by providing our customers even more healthy options for their on-the-go lifestyles. The rollout of Evolution juice products represent a significant entry point into the large $50 billion health and wellness sector. The integration of Evolution into our business is moving along as scheduled, and we will share more information on this front in the near future. ","Most recently, we introduced Starbucks Blonde Roast, a lighter roast of our premium coffee, simultaneously, through both our U.S. retail stores and the CPG channels. With over 54 million coffee drinkers in the U.S. preferring a lighter flavor profile, the new Blonde offering serves as an example of our ability to listen to and respond to our customers, providing them with the products they prefer, wherever and whenever they want them. The new platform is now offered in the U.S. CPG channel in whole bean and ground coffee formats, VIA and K-Cup. These new products will allow us to increase our share of the brewed coffee market down the grocery aisle, where a majority of coffee sales are in the light and medium roast categories, representing a $1 billion opportunity in the U.S. alone. ","In conclusion, as I look back on where the Starbucks CPG business was just one short year ago, it is amazing how much we have accomplished in such a short amount of time. We have revolutionized the way people think about and consume coffee at home, at work and on the go. We are driving rapid growth for the company through this part of the business, which requires relatively low capital investment. And looking forward, I remain enthusiastic about the health and continued growth opportunities of the entire Starbucks CPG business. The capabilities and experience we are building within our internal team has allowed us to concurrently and thoroughly deliver on all areas I've just covered, and will ensure that Starbucks remains the market leader when consumers shop for premium coffee products in the CPG channel. ","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Cliff Burrows, President of the Americas. Cliff?","Clifford Burrows","Thanks, Jeff. I'm pleased to share with everyone today, the very strong results of the Americas Retail business. Despite continued macroeconomic uncertainty, high unemployment and rising inflationary pressure, the Americas team continues to deliver exceptional results. Our business has never been healthier as both financial and customer metrics are extremely positive, and we've just had the most successful holiday season in our history. ","Total Americas net revenues for the quarter was $2.6 billion, an 11% increase over the same period last year. Company-operated comps were 9% for the quarter, with 7% coming from increased transactions and 2% from an increase in average ticket. U.S. same-store sales were 9% for the quarter, including transaction growth of 8% and ticket growth of 2%, with strong contributions coming from across the country. And we're pleased to see Canada showing signs of renewed strength with very solid comps, following several quarters of lower, although still positive comps. ","Our same-store sales, we generated mainly from a holiday program that resonated with our customers. Our holiday trio: peppermint mocha, gingerbread latte and caramel brul\u00e9e latte, highlighted our seasonal beverage offerings, which delivered the 20% growth over the last year, and our warming program also continues to show strength with 31% sales growth over last year. ","Average daily transactions per store in the U.S. for the first quarter surpassed our previous record, which was set in 2006, as throughput continues to benefit from initiatives put in place over the past 2 years.  The Starbucks Card and our mobile payment app are supporting increased frequency, and will contribute to second quarter revenue growth, as U.S. customers loaded $0.5 billion on their cards in December alone, that's 23% more than last December. We also gained another 413,000 new members to the My Starbucks Rewards program in December, bringing total membership to more than 3.7 million, and today, we're seeing 1 in 4 customers use their Starbucks Card for tender. ","Store managers have also helped us become more efficient, as U.S. store productivity in December hit record highs. Our partners are working together to create a culture of coaching, problem solving and change in leadership. Our 2012 key initiatives of staffing and scheduling, inventory management and a consistent method of work to deliver increased capacity, enables an improved experience for our customers and partners. Together, our sustained progress in these areas helped us deliver a world-class customer experience. ","In addition to increasing capacity during morning peak, we have driven additional business throughout the day, by efforts such as the successful launch of Bistro Boxes Petite, and special promotions such as Frappuccino Happy Hour and Treat Receipt in the U.S. We have growth opportunity in our drive-through stores, which now make up nearly 40% of our U.S. portfolio, the opportunity to improve transaction times and increased throughput. This is why we're focusing on this area like never before. ","Brand-new technology such as wireless mobile payment scanners, building efficiency driving improvements in our drive-through renovations, and testing many other ideas to improve the customer experience through this expanding platform. Our success is not limited to the U.S. company-operated stores, we're also seeing fantastic results from our licensed stores. Revenue in our Americas licensed stores were up 25% in the first quarter over last year, and in U.S., we're seeing double-digit revenue growth across all license partnerships, including airports and grocery locations, where we offer a Starbucks Experience for those on the go. ","Operating income for the Americas segment was $563 million in Q1, an increase of 7% compared to the same quarter last year. Operating margins contracted 80 basis points to 21.8%, from the record of 22.6% last year due to higher commodity costs, primarily coffee and that reduction and that impact was approximately 240 basis points. This cost pressure was partially offset by sales leverage. ","The Americas region, the most mature and largest for Starbucks, will remain focused on growth. We're well underway to have 400 net new stores this calendar year. The majority of that will be in the U.S., where we have a solid pipeline of stores that will be LEED certified and are expected to produce strong returns. ","In Canada, we're beginning to see signs of economic recovery, particularly in the east. The recent launch of the My Starbucks Rewards program was an important step to continuing to drive frequency among those loyal customers. We now have more than 500 stores open in Latin America, and comp sales are healthy in all major markets. In Mexico, where we have more than 300 stores, we will celebrate the 10th anniversary in September, and we have increasing confidence in the potential for Starbucks in Brazil, supported by strong comps and exceptional new stores opened in Q1. ","Additionally, we are pleased to announce today that we'll be bringing the Starbucks Experience to customers in Costa Rica this May. We have a long relationship with this country, given our farmer connections and are pleased to finally have a retail presence there as well. ","We're in the early days of our Blonde Roast launch, which is generating a lot of pride from our partners, but they're now able to offer our customers a Starbucks coffee with a lighter roast. We look forward to launching this offering beyond U.S. and Canada. ","I look forward to working with all the markets in this high-performing region to deal with our customers, our value for our customers and rewards to our partners and shareholders. In closing, I would like to thank all our store partners across the Americas for their dedication and hard work each and every day. ","With that, I'm going to turn the call back over to Troy. Troy?","Troy Alstead","Thanks, Cliff. The next thing I will discuss is Europe, Middle East and Africa, which delivered revenue growth of 17% in the first quarter. As I commented on a recent conference call outlining the changes to our segment reporting, we're targeting this region as a big opportunity, both on the top line and throughout the P&L. ","We are underperforming against our expectations in this critical part of the world, and we have a solid plan in place to turn this region around. The first step in that plan was to put an experienced talented leadership team in place, which is what we did by appointing Michelle Glass, a 15-year Starbucks partner, to be president of this region. Michelle's played an integral role in the development and execution of Starbucks' transformation agenda, which was the strategic basis of our U.S. business turnaround that began in 2008. ","With the right leadership in place, we're going to focus on what matters most, our coffee, our partners and the store experience. On all these fronts, we'll do what we need to in order to turn things around. The second and third quarters will include foundational investment that will be reflected in lower margins in those periods, but as we come out of these implementation costs, we're targeting margin improvement to mid-single digits in fiscal 2012, declining over time to the midteens. ","Same-store sales growth in EMEA in the first quarter was 2%, with increased transactions of 2% and a higher average ticket of 1%, despite a worsening consumer outlook and high unemployment in many markets across Europe. In the U.K., we recorded our 10th consecutive quarter of positive comps, boosted this quarter by a highly successful holiday campaign. The overall revenue growth of 17% for the EMEA region was driven primarily by the consolidation of the Switzerland and Austria markets, with a 2% comp and its licensed store revenue growth of 18% also contributing. ","EMEA margin contracted 320 basis points in the first quarter, due largely to transitionary costs of bringing in-house the distribution of fresh food and dairy in the U.K. This is an important change that will improve the freshness and delivery efficiency of products to our stores. Higher commodity costs have also added 60 basis points of unfavorability. ","In China and Asia-Pacific or CAP, the strong momentum that built throughout 2011 continued in the first quarter of fiscal 2012. Net revenues increased by 38%, driven largely by rapid new store growth, along the same-store sales growth of 20%. The strong comps were comprised of a 15% increase in transactions and a 5% increase in average ticket. All 4 of our company-owned markets in CAP posted double-digit comps, with China leading the way at 28%. ","We have now recorded greater than 20% comps for 6 consecutive quarters in China. Consistent with results across our global store base, the holiday platform produced very solid results as well. Additionally, we're gaining traction on our loyalty program, with nearly 250,000 My Starbucks Rewards members already signed up in China. Strong holiday merchandise sales contributed to the higher average ticket. ","Operating income in CAP was also strong, increasing 26% to $58 million in the first quarter. Operating margin contracted 350 basis points to a still outstanding 34.6%, resulting from higher performance-based compensation, higher costs necessary to fuel our expansion in this region, as well as 200 basis points related to higher commodity costs. While store operating expenses and costs increased, we saw solid leverage on occupancy and depreciation from the additional sales. ","I want to provide a bit of additional texture on Japan in particular, as it is important for its contribution to this region to be fully understood. At 950 stores, Japan makes up 1\/3 of the region store count, and makes up approximately 40% of CAP operating income. It only comprises about 13% of revenue, however, due to the ownership structure. Japan is a joint venture market for us, with Starbucks owning 40%, our partner, SAZABY, owning 40% and 20% being publicly held. The revenue that is recognized on CAP's P&L for Japan, includes royalties on sales in our Japan stores and sales of coffee, tea and other strategic products sold to the joint venture. Our stake of the equity, essentially 40% of the market after-tax profit, which recorded in the income from equity investee's line of the CAP P&L. ","From a performance standpoint, Japan continues to show improvement in revenue, operating income and operating margins. It was just 10 months ago that Japan was faced with a devastating earthquake and tsunami. We are extremely proud of the way that our Japan partners have responded, as that market has recovered faster than expected, and did so, while being a significant contributor to relief efforts around the country. With a very strong brand, powerful store economics and significant growth opportunities, Japan will continue to be a strong contributor to the region's success in the coming years. ","Given the consistency of strong results in China\/Asia-Pacific, we're going to continue to accelerate growth in the region. We opened 121 net new stores in Q1, the highest of our 3 retail regions. The growth came from 48 net new stores in mainland China, where we continue to see extremely strong returns that are surpassing our initial projections. Sales to investment ratio in mainland China is more than 2.5:1, and first-year, cash-on-cash returns are the highest in our system. Better store growth contributors in CAP in Q1 included South Korea, where we opened 24 net new stores and Japan with 15 net new stores. ","Now, I'd like to give you an update on our outlook for the remainder of our fiscal year. We continue to target revenue growth of approximately 10% for the year, driven by mid-single digit comp growth and continued momentum of our CPG business. We expect full year consolidated operating margin to improve by 50 to 100 basis points over fiscal 2011 non-GAAP results. ","Given the strong performance in the first quarter, we have raised our expectations for earnings per share to the range of $1.78 to $1.82, representing 17% to 20% growth over fiscal '11 EPS of $1.52, excluding the non-routine gains. The expected impact due to higher commodity costs in FY '12 remained virtually unchanged from what I've told you in November, approximately $230 million. We continue to expect a greater impact from commodities on the first half of the year, easing a bit during the second half. ","With that expected impact of commodities, we're targeting 10% earnings growth in the first half of the year, with 25% growth in the second half. We've taken advantage of the recent declines in the seed price to lock in more of our coffee needs for fiscal 2013, and now has 6 months of our fiscal 2013 requirements secured at costs markedly favorable to 2012. The specific year-over-year cost improvement is still too early to quantify, as we still have half of 2013 open. I will provide additional commentary in coming quarters as we lock in more of our coffee needs. ","As you heard Jeff discuss during his remarks, we continue to be excited about the opportunity ahead of us with regard to K-Cups. Given our current visibility into production capacity, we're targeting the high end of the $0.03 to $0.05 incremental per share range that was provided on our last call, as the FY '12 contribution from K-Cups. On a segment basis, our store count projections remain unchanged for fiscal 2012 at 800 net new stores. ","Operating margin for our Americas business is still expected to improve slightly over FY '11's 20%. EMEA is expected to show modest improvement over its FY '11 margin. CAP margin guidance remains at nearly 30%, and CPG margin also remains unchanged from our previous target of near 25%, lower than FY '11, largely due to the impact of higher coffee costs. ","We continue to expect marketing expense near 3.5% of revenue for the full year, a meaningful increase over a year ago. That marketing expense will be more pronounced in Q2 due to the rollout of Blonde Roast. ","Our first quarter was tremendous in nearly every measure, thanks to the continued focus and hard work of our dedicated partners. We have proven a unique ability to be immediately relevant in the marketplace, as demonstrated by our impressive launch of K-Cups in November. We've proven the ability to be nimble and flexible. The multichannel launch of Starbucks Blonde Roast is an example there. We've proven an ability to be focused and disciplined as our record productivity and transaction levels in the U.S. demonstrate, despite a still challenging economic backdrop. We've proven an ability to be innovative with the global launch of our Petite platform and additional countries launch in the frequency-driving My Starbucks Rewards loyalty program, including Canada and the U.K. just recently. ","And importantly, we continue to drive shareholder value in all the various ways I've described. As Howard, Jeff and Cliff mentioned before me, we're not slowing down one bit in 2012. ","With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to the operator for Q&A. David?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of David Palmer of UBS.","David Palmer - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Want to ask the question just about the U.S. business. The traffic momentum there is pretty great, 8% growth. The check was also not quite as high as I might have thought it would be, given the fact that you seem to do well with some of the premium drinks, and you were doing a lot with food earlier in the quarter, and I would have thought that would've carried into the quarter. Could you give any hints as to maybe what's going on with that check there? And then separately, with that amazing traffic, is there any insight beyond that -- the trio of holiday drinks? I can understand those would be doing well. But there are things beyond that like the Starbucks Reward, the point-of-sale systems helping throughput that it can help us get our heads around this traffic.","Clifford Burrows","It's Cliff here. This whole piece around focusing on throughput and focusing on the basics of the customer experience is really our outstanding priority, overriding priority. And we know the customer continues to seek value, and their engagements in the My Starbucks Rewards program is really a big part of this. And we are increasing frequency of visits, and obviously, there are benefits attached to the My Starbucks Rewards program, and obviously, our growth on ticket, the net growth. The other thing that I have to say is that we have pulled back somewhat over recent years in our merchandise range around holiday time focusing on cold products like our holiday trio and like our foods. And all of that has really helped. So the focus is on the frequency and on transactions, and we're seeing good growth across the U.S. We continue to benefit from the improved technology, whether that was the introduction of Symphony, whether that is the introduction of the scanners or the applications for iPhone and Android, all of those are increasing the opportunity. The other area where we're seeing good growth which is helping ticket, is on Christmas Blend coffee. We had a very, very strong season there. And if you remember, we took price in July on whole bean, and that also came through at both the Christmas Blend, whole bean coffee and our VIA coffee Christmas and both of those benefited. So we're pleased with the mix, we're pleased with the focus and we will continue to work on throughput and on attach of products like food.","Operator","Your next question comes from Sara Senatore of Sanford Bernstein.","Sara H. Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I have a question about some of the margins. Just trying to work through the operating leverage opportunity for some of them. Obviously, I understand that CAP, it's mostly mix shift coming out, left [ph] Japan and more company-operated. But store operating expenses maybe weren't quite -- didn't quite see the leverage I would have expected, and maybe I could say the same thing about CPG. So can you just help me figure out whether this is mix shift versus incremental spending, whether it's a marketing or incentive comp, or basically, something else that I'm not thinking about? Because you had great, great top line, and obviously, I understand the commodities issue but just trying to get a sense of how to bucket these things?","Troy Alstead","Let me start and let me call some of my -- Cliff or Jeff here to speak a little bit about their businesses as well. We're actually -- we're very pleased with the flow-through in the margins we saw delivered to the bottom line in the quarter, given the headwinds that we faced in coffee. And I appreciate your question, we'll do our best to answer it. But on balance, we drove margin improvement in a quite significant way across the business, absent the 300 basis points of commodity cost pressures. And just on that point, before I hit the margins for a moment, this quarter we just ended is the single biggest peak of year-over-year coffee costs we will face, and we're quite pleased that we found our way through this challenge and delivered the kind of earnings growth in margin delivery that we did despite what is an extreme coffee cost pressure, in the quarter and the first half of this year. And CPG in particular, the business is most impacted by coffee cost, and so the decline in margins we saw there, is consistent with what we told you to expect back on our November call in terms of the target for the year, right around the mid-20s. And again, that's heavily impacted by more so than any of the business segments by coffee costs. In the U.S. and other regions, I'll perhaps talk to Cliff to speak a little bit more about productivity and the flow-through that we're seeing in that business.","Clifford Burrows","Yes, and it really was, Sara, a very strong performance across all areas in the U.S. And again, as Troy says, we were very pleased that we're able with productivity gains, and we were serving more people in December per hour than we have ever done in our history. And that is how we managed to overcome the increased -- significant increase in coffee prices and other pressures, whether it's cocoa, dairy or fuel. All of those have an impact, so we were pleased with the quarter.","Troy Alstead","One last thing I'll say to your question Sara, to make sure we get it all. You asked about China\/Asia-Pacific, and you're correct there, that as we've talked about in previous quarters, we fully expect and did experience in the quarter, margin improvement at the country level, and we would expect this to continue to grow in China\/Asia Pacific with the phenomenal economics that we have there and the great top line growth we're experiencing, that will continue to drive margin improvement country by country. There is a mix shift going on, as you've referenced, it's just important to recognize that it happen over time, as we grow extremely rapidly in the company-owned businesses. In China, there will be some dilution of the highly licensed revenue business that comes out of Japan. It's not a bad thing, that's actually a great measure of our success in China that we'll see that shift over time. And then one last comment I'll make about our global business, and particular, our U.S. business, is that we have -- just as we have the past couple of years in 2012, we're moving the needle upwards again on our marketing spend in support of the business. We've had great results as we have in a very disciplined careful way, spent a bit more on engaging consumer to our marketing spend than we have in years past. Some of that's driven in our retail channels and some of that, driven in our CPG business. That marketing spend is paying off quite nicely for us but that is a bit of an uptick on the P&L this year compared to previous years, and it will be most pronounced in Q2, particularly relevant to the launch of Blonde Roast in this quarter.","Sara H. Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Great. And just the CPG, so it was, it was all commodities as opposed to say, mix shift towards K-Cups or something like that?","Troy Alstead","Almost entirely driven by commodities.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein of Barclays Capital.","Jeffrey Andrew Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I actually had related questions, probably for Jeff, just on CPG and the related K-Cup. Just first, specific to the K-Cup, I know you talked about 100 million packs shipped in the first quarter. Just wondering if you can size up how that compared to your internal expectation? I know that's only 2 months through the quarter but I'm just trying to figure out how you assess the momentum in that business, whether it's people filling the shelves and therefore, that raise is not sustainable or whether in fact, it is because post holidays, things pick up. I'm just trying to think about how you do some internal planning in terms of your thought process for the K-Cup ramp through the rest of this year. And more broadly speaking, as you now embark on kind of this bigger CPG push, I'm just wondering whether you had any insights for us or learnings on the new segment's aggressive growth whether there's anything that gives you pause or have you really exceeded all of your expectations in terms of building the second platform that's literally going to rival the entire retail business?","Howard D. Schultz","With regard to K-Cup, it's still early days, but as we've shipped over 100 million cups in the first 2 months, we're running ahead of our initial expectations on what we expected for the business. And based on everything we can see at this point, it is not just pipeline. It's very hard though at this point for us, to really have an understanding of how high is high, given that we are supply-constrained. So we are seeing takeout at the shelves, we have delivered, as I mentioned my remarks, an 11 share in essentially an 8-week period of even being available, and that's with -- call it 66% ACV distribution in the food drive mass space during the month of December. So we haven't fully reached distribution yet. We haven't really started merchandising yet because we are supply constrained. And at the same time, we are seeing strong sell-through, and again, we don't know what the full upside is yet, because we don't have enough supply. Now importantly, we are working closely with Green Mountain to ensure that we get as many cups as we possibly can. They have been a great partner in meeting their initial expectations on the volume they committed to supply. Again, we're working closely with them to get additional cups to try to fully meet the need in this premium single-cup space. But we are very encouraged, and in fact, the pull on K-Cups is greater than what we had initially expected.","Jeffrey Andrew Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And in terms of the broader, just ramp up, is there anything that gives you pause? I mean, it's tremendous growth you saw. I know, I guess half of that 70% growth is, I'm assuming that's coming from craft and therefore, that disappeared this quarter, if you could just confirm that, and then if there's anything that gives you pause in terms of this very aggressive ramp that we're seeing?","Howard D. Schultz","Right, we are seeing some revenue growth associated with bringing, taking the business in-house to the direct model. So that is accurate. We -- there is nothing that gives me pause as to the growth prospects of the CPG business. In fact, as I noted in my comments, we're just getting started. So every day, we're getting stronger as the team that we have assembled from some of the best CPG companies in the industry, learns how to work together more effectively, as we get our syndicated data sources in place, as we get our shopper [ph] marketing resources in place with our key customers, as we learn everyday how to more effectively connect the unique strategic assets of Starbucks to communicate with our customers in unique and different ways to build awareness, consideration, trial and ultimately, loyalty to the brand. So if anything, I am more optimistic about this future that we can build as we learn and get smarter every day. So we're just getting started.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Kelter of Goldman Sachs.","Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I wanted to ask about China. First off, China ticket was up 5%. Does that represent a price increase to offset inflationary pressures? Or is there some sort of a change in the way consumers are interacting with the brand in China? And then also in China, the acceleration in unit growth which you're now actually starting to see, curious if you're bumping into any internal or external bottlenecks, and what you're finding you have to tweak as you accelerate the trajectory there?","Howard D. Schultz","This is Howard and we've got John Culver here, the President of that region. So John?","John Culver","Yes, I would say that -- I mean, what we're seeing in China is on the ticket side, there's no impact from pricing. So we have not taken pricing in China. So what you're seeing is real. The comp growth is mainly being driven by transaction. We continue to accelerate the new store growth across all the markets. We now sit in 41 cities across the country. We opened our 500th store this quarter, and this past quarter, we opened 5 new cities, all right. So what we see is continued acceptance of the Starbucks brand and the Starbucks Experience. And in terms of any kind of bottlenecks or barriers, clearly, we are ramping up the investment around the infrastructure, and back-in-the-house systems. So IT systems, as well as supply chain systems and distribution capabilities, and then also, continuing to accelerate the advancement around hiring ahead of the curve, particularly around store operations, as well as with the store development teams. To help drive the growth, we're also accelerating the ability to design stores in market. So we've made significant investment from a store development standpoint of shifting the resources back here in Seattle, and pushing that out into China, into markets of the world much closer and much quicker in the market. And then we've also added additional investment in China around research and development to really capture the consumer trends in China, and to drive innovation that really is going to be impactful for the Chinese consumer.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sharon Zackfia of William Blair.","Sharon Zackfia - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Troy, a question for you on the full year revenue guidance, kind of keeping it at 10%. I guess you look at every division, and every division's been solid double-digit revenue gains. So implicit in your guidance is that revenue growth will decelerate to the single digits at some point this year. Is there a particular division you're looking at or something we should be aware of on the outside, which would be happening as the year progresses or bring us down to that 10%?","Troy Alstead","No, there's actually not. We've been fairly pleased with the revenue growth in the first quarter, it has outpaced our own expectations. But it's still early in the year, and with 3\/4 of the year yet ahead of us, just too early to meaningfully update much of that guidance. We have every bit of optimism about our ability to continue to drive the growth in of the business. The only comment I would make is that I recognize, as we all need to, that the algebra at some point, will suggest that those percentages get harder to keep growing, despite the fact that we have every expectations to drive dollars of revenue to all of our channels. So we're very optimistic. Nothing has changed in our view of the future whatsoever. And as we progress through this year, we'll continue to watch our progress in the top line and update targets accordingly.","Operator","Your next question comes from Nicole Miller Reagan of Piper Jaffray.","Joshua C. Long - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","This is Josh on for Nicole. I had 2 quick questions, one to the extent that you can share some details around the expanded test of your evening day part program, that would be great. Any sort of learning to date, or things where we might or opportunities we might see some of those tests or learnings show up in the breakfast or lunch day parts in throughout the rest of the system? And then, maybe one for Jeff as well. Anything longer term that prevents you from kind of expanding this Seattle's Best brand into the K-Cup platform as well. Obviously, it's still early in your relationship with Green Mountain and the K-Cups, but anything that would prevent that from happening over the longer term?","Clifford Burrows","Josh, it's Cliff. Let me comment on the evening day part. We are -- as I'm sure you've read, we are extending our tests on beer and wine, supplemented by a small range of appropriate foods to the evening. Today, we have 6 stores serving beer and wine in what we probably call the Pacific Northwest, and we are very encouraged by the customer's one, acceptance; and two, use of the stores over our longer day part. And that's been very encouraging. That's the first part of the test. We will now expand that test to 3 areas: California, Atlanta and Chicago, where approximately, 5 stores in each. And then, it's not going to happen immediately because we have to apply for licenses. But that really will form a meaningful part of the test, because each of those stores is selected based on our learnings. And I think over the coming quarters, we'll be in a better position to say how material is that. And the great news is, customers have accepted it, and they're using the longer day part, not just for beer and wine but for food and using it for occasions where some people have coffee, some tea and someone may have a beer or wine. The good news is, we're on their radar now for that evening day part which I think, in many areas, we were not. So pleased with the initial tests, and we will keep in the U.S., working on the different day parts. And we've seen great success, as I said earlier, with our world platform which is predominantly breakfast. We continue with Bistro Boxes and we'll have further developments there in the future months around the lunch period, and then with the K-Cups, that sort of afternoon day part. So really, challenging ourselves in the U.S. on all day parts, and those learnings are shared with each of my colleagues who run the other regions. But we really are focused on food. It is relevant to our customers in each of the local markets. Jeff?","Jeffery J. Hansberry","With regard to Seattle's Best and K-Cups, again, as I mentioned earlier, we're just getting started. And our near-end focus is going to be optimizing our Starbucks brand on that platform. In March of this year, we will launch into CPG in Canada, and later this year, we'll launch in Starbucks retail stores, both in Canada and the U.S. as well. So near end, we're going to be focused against driving Starbucks first.","Operator","Your next question comes from Keith Siegner of Credit Suisse.","Keith Siegner - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So I apologize in advance, Troy, I'm going to ask a similar question to the one I asked 2 weeks ago. But looking at G&A as a massive category, particularly, on unallocated. On that call 2 weeks ago, you went through kind of what the pieces were that moved around this part of the restatements, but it's still a really big number. And what I'm trying to get a sense of here is we just saw a pretty nice leverage of G&A in the first quarter. If you could talk through kind of like what the pieces are and then like how maybe the business good leverage G&A over time, should that be coming? Now how should we think about modeling this nearly $600 million expense over the next couple of years as all these businesses grow into the infrastructure you've put in place ahead of that growth?","Troy Alstead","Yes, that was the same question you asked 2 weeks ago. G&A, we firmly believe over the long term, is a leverage opportunity for us. Now that won't necessarily be true quarter-to-quarter. In any one particular quarter, there may be investments that are more meaningful or incentive compensation that spikes up or down in a particular quarter. We have, as we've talked with you about before, a hedging program rounded for comp that will spike G&A in any one particular quarter. So quarter-to-quarter moments can be deceiving, but no question over time, we fully expect to be able to leverage that. Now the infrastructure in our support center in Seattle, all the back office functions that live here, as well as our G&A functions that live entirely around the world, are all part of that G&A function overall. We also have operating expenses and G&A that sits in the business units as well. But in terms of the big G&A, the big picture with the large infrastructure we have, both here but now growing around the world, to some extent, we are ahead of the curve on some of our G&A to support growth outside of the U.S., and G&A in this building to support growth in our channel development organization, the CPG business and our global business. That G&A spend we believe, gives us an opportunity to accelerate growth as we have been to drive innovation, and position the growth platforms we have for the future, and then also, to become a leverage point down the road. So I believe you should expect, over the long term, moderate leverage to come, year in and year out, for some period of time now.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Glass with Morgan Stanley.","John S. Glass - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","My question had to do with the launch of the Blonde Roast. You mentioned that it was incremental to the category. I took that maybe to mean it was more incremental to the category of the CPG channel. But can you talk about how you think about that? Is it incremental to the retail business as well? What are your early reads? Is it actually seeing, producing the sales lift and are new customers coming into the stores, or are you just sort of trading an existing customer to a lighter roast who may prefer that in the afternoon, for example? So can you talk about how you think that performs in the 2 different channels? And can you also just, maybe Jeff, can you add to how that's going to fold into the CPG this year? How soon can you get, forgive me if you already mentioned this, but how soon can you get that full distribution on that lighter roast?","Howard D. Schultz","This is Howard, John. The comment that we made in our prepared remarks regarding Blonde, in terms of incrementality was all channels. The research we've done and the early read, and I want to underscore it is early, leads us to believe that there are millions of customers who have not really chosen Starbucks as their primary place for either the beverage or holding [ph] coffee. And we believe, based on the research we've done, and as I said the early read, that we're going to see incrementality on both fronts. But also, I want to make an overarching comment about just we have witnessed, as well as other consumer brand companies, a seismic change in consumer behavior, going back to the height of the cataclysmic recession in 2008, 2009. And I just want to just dive into that very briefly, so you understand the attributes and the differentiation that we have as a company to go after that. And I would list 3 major areas in terms of the seismic change: One is that as a result of the recession, there is a significant amount of pressure on the consumer, whether they're buying luxury or mass in terms of value. The second is, as a result of the technology and the web, social digital media has become a primary vehicle to gain access information. And I will revisit that in a minute. And the third is the unbelievable way, in which mobile payment and mobile commerce is going to change the way in which consumers buy things. On the issue of value, the question was asked earlier about transactions and ticket. One of the differentiating factors of the last year or so has been the loyalty and the stickiness of the Starbucks Card. There's almost 4 million people holding that card. 1 of every 4 people are buying with the card. And what we've been able to do is, which is very difficult, is balance the premium position and premium pricing of Starbucks, while creating value, in a sense, putting our feet in the shoes of our customers and giving value, that's A. B, with regard to social and digital media, there probably isn't very many companies in America that has created the capability and the discipline that we have with almost 40 million worldwide fans on Facebook, leading company in Twitter on Foursquare, what that has done, has given us the ability to lower our cost of customer acquisition in terms of traditional advertising, and build a more enduring emotional relationship with our customers. The third issue is that Starbucks today, and this is an important point, we are the #1 company not in the U.S. but in the world in terms of mobile payment, transactions and dollars. Now all of this is wrapped into the relevancy of the Starbucks brand and the experience, and this is what is driving much of the incrementality that we are experiencing. These 3 things wrapped into what Cliff and his team have been able to do in the U.S. is build a customer experience. And to think that today, we are serving more customers than ever before in our history, despite the economic downturn, and this year's stores that opened 12 months ago, are performing at the highest level of any other time in our history. So I think it's very important that you understand that the macro issues that are facing many companies, we have been able to turn into a competitive advantage with regard to value, social digital media and mobile payment.","John S. Glass - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And just the rollout of the Blonde then in the grocery channel, is that fully distributed at this point or...","Clifford Burrows","Yes, John. First, it is a big deal for us in CPG, given that 70% of all premium coffee sales are in the light or medium roast segment, 54 million customers prefer a lighter roast. And when you take Blonde and you match it up with this brand-new roast architecture packaging that is rolling out right now, those 2 pieces combined will make it easier than ever to shop the Starbucks aisle for our customers, and we offer this lighter roast in Blonde Roast which is a big deal. We have timed the launch to be synchronized with our key customers, shelf resets happening during Q1, and you will see Blonde Roast in a number of stores. We will be fully rolled out with the new pack architecture and with Blonde Roast coffees by the middle of this quarter. And also very importantly, all of our key Tier 1 and Tier 2 grocery and mass customers have accepted Blonde and are in the process of cutting it in now.","Operator","And you have a question from John Ivankoe of JPMorgan.","John W. Ivankoe - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just a really quick follow up and some prepared remarks. Troy, do you have the unredeemed gift card balance for the end of the quarter in front of you?","Troy Alstead","No, that's something we'll finalize and disclose when we produce the 10-Q ass usual, John. And that'll -- you'll see those balances at that point in time. And I think you'll notice the deferred revenue line, but I will point out, we saw rapid growth in all use of the Starbucks Card, of reload, of use, and that was true of transactions within the quarter, but importantly, the deferred revenue for future quarters was very significant in the first quarter.","Howard D. Schultz","And over 20% growth over last year.","John W. Ivankoe - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, great. And secondly, if I may and completely unrelated, there is a fairly big deal made around the redesign of the Starbucks logo last year. I mean really focusing on the iconography of the green mermaid. And there was at least interpretations I had that we might begin to see that logo on non-coffee products such as, for example, Evolution juice. And I guess what I'm asking is, as you think about the broader CPG portfolio is, will you start to use that type of iconography on brands like Evolution or other brands that you might develop or acquire that won't necessarily be coffee, but we know what kind of an honor [ph] the same type of principles that Starbucks as a company has?","Howard D. Schultz","Well, the logo change clearly, was designed to give us the freedom and the flexibility to take advantage of the blueprint for growth with other CPG products and categories. I think we're going to be very thoughtful and very disciplined, when and how we use the new graphics on products or categories that, on their own merit, will make that decision. And when we redesign the graphic and brand architecture of Evolution, which will be in the middle of the year, you'll see us unveil how we're going to use that or whether or not we're going to use it. But clearly, the new logo gives us the flexibility to operate within the other categories and other products, and we'll leverage the blueprint for growth by bringing those products into our stores, primarily first.","Operator","And you have a question from the line of Joe Buckley of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Joseph T. Buckley - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I just had 2 questions on things, just to try to clarify a bit. The ticket increase in the U.S., can you talk about the breakdown of that between price, and maybe the food contribution? And there's been reports of price increases here in New York and other places. How should we think about price in the U.S. going forward.","Clifford Burrows","Joe, this is Cliff. We have continued the same strategy on pricing now over the last 3 years, and developing our, I would say, expertise and focus around individual products, the whole portfolio of products, but unique to that local market. Overall, price is approximately 1% over the course of the year, but you will find that, that is not all prices up by 1%. We're very conscious of the value, as I've said for the customer, and we're also conscious of just the price architecture. So we've been very focused on items, on food. Obviously, we take every opportunity to focus on new product, improved ingredients, improved quality, at the same time, we're very conscious of the pressure on prices and commodities in the market place. So yes, we continue to review it periodically, and we are very conscious of keeping that to a modest level to support our customers. And obviously, on those frequent visitors, have the My Starbucks Rewards programs to support the use of the Starbucks Card and the price they pay on certain items will be discounted because one of the benefits of the card, or they get free beverage every 15, all of which helps them keep their average ticket down.","Joseph T. Buckley - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then just one my clarification question. Jeff, you talked about the CPG revenue growth being driven, I think, you said driven equally by takeups and the craft business. Could you talk, just elaborate a little bit further on that, and maybe throw VIA into that discussion as well?","Jeffery J. Hansberry","Yes, Joe. So that is in rough terms, probably roughly equal parts from single-cup growth and from bringing the roast and ground business to a direct model. In terms of VIA, I'm glad you asked, I think for VIA to be overshadowed by all the other great news in the CPG space. We continue to do extremely well on the VIA business. And when you look at VIA and K-Cup together, we have now captured nearly a -- we're up to, in the most recent month, a 17% of the premium single-cup space between those 2 big and important brands and again, just getting started. So for VIA, we launched House Blend and Breakfast Blend in the quarter, and we're building distribution on those varietals. We've got more good news coming on VIA. In the quarter, we grew on a syndicated databases by 42% on the VIA business. And what is also very encouraging on VIA, I've reported to you in the past about our repeat rates running in the high 30s. Most recent tracking against repeat rates, they're actually now approaching 40. So we're getting people to try VIA, and when they try it, the repeat rates are at the higher end of the category. Again in the first quarter, we ran the VIA products for the second time, which gives customers an opportunity to try VIA, and if they don't like it, we'll replace the coffee. That has continued to prove itself to be a great vehicle for getting -- garnering trial for the brand. So we're very encouraged and see a lot of opportunity for VIA going forward, both in the U.S. and abroad.","Operator","And your final question comes from the line of Matthew DiFrisco of Lazard.","Matthew J. DiFrisco - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Just a couple of clarifications there. On that last response there, when you mentioned premium cup market share. I guess it was 11% with the K-Cups. It was 17% when you lump in VIA with that, if that's correct. Can you just put that in context with, I guess we've, mostly, we think of sort of the $2 billion K-Cup single-serve category, how do you -- do you have market share data on that? And then, Troy, earlier in the call, I think the first couple of questions, were on the leverage in the stores. When I looked at the store operating expense line, it grew 10% sort of in line with -- in the Americas this is -- the America revenues from the company-owned stores. I guess it was lagging about half the pace of growth in the prior couple of quarters. I'm curious, is that the beginning where we're going to start marketing show up? And is that pretty much limited to the first half for the year and starting to get back to lagging top line trends if we were to sustain these type of comps?","Howard D. Schultz","With regard to the market shares that I'm speaking to, I'm speaking from IRI syndicated data for the food drug mass business. That does not provide the full picture of K-Cup. But the premium single-cup segment that I'm speaking to, is a combination of all premium single-cup packs, priced at or above $0.50 per serving. And that's exactly right, we are at a near 17 share for the month of December, and are trending upward quickly. And again and importantly, we see both the K-Cup business, the Starbucks K-Cup business, as well as the Starbucks VIA business, as both being billion-dollar opportunities for Starbucks.","Troy Alstead","And to your -- Matt, your margin question, for the full year, so not just Q2, it's just more pronounced in Q2, but for the full year, we are moving the needle upwards modestly on marketing spend, and that's a very conscious move, a very strategic move in something that paid off for us quite meaningfully, we believe in driving incremental traffic in the last year, in the last 2 as we've moved the needle, some of [ph] the marketing and we plan to do it again this year. It will be more pronounced in the second quarter, particularly the launch of Blonde Roast, but it is true throughout the year, that we'll have some incremental spend on marketing, and that shows up in store operating expense, when it's applied against our store business. But the overarching point I'd make here is that our whole intention here is to, over time, provide the right leverage points on the overall Americas P&L. It's a high-margin business already, last year, about 20% operating margin. We've targeted improvement in that margin in the Americas as we have in each of our regions, as we go throughout the course of this year. So we would expect that margin to improve. And some of that over time will be fixed expenses, store operating expenses will have some leverage points, but those also incremental investments that we do make from quarter-to-quarter in, as I said marketing, and other elements of that line.","Matthew J. DiFrisco - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Certainly, the comp and the traffic that you're getting, shows that there's a massive response to the marketing side. I was curious as far as if you were to look at the comp growth that you've had the last couple of years, I'm assuming you're surpassing average store level volumes prerecession and pre-closing down the stores. So can you talk about -- I mean I guess with all of the new products coming down the pipe, with K-Cup soon to come into your stores, with the Blonde starting to get more momentum behind it, food, healthier items, all of it, looking at the upper decile of your stores and capacity, can you sort of put us to rest to not be concerned about capacity constraints? Can you -- What are you seeing as far as improvements that your upper decile, as far as store volumes versus historical levels? And I guess you've focused a lot in the beginning about efficiency. Is that where we're starting to talk about that more and look at throughput, and being able to handle those capacity issues?","Howard D. Schultz","Well, let me start, this is Howard and Cliff can finish. I think what we have uncovered over the last 18 months or so, is that we've really kind of dialed into the need phase [ph] that customers have during different day parts of the day. And that's where you see the new products that we've introduced. And also, I think the marketing has been much more focused on being able to capture customers at different parts of the day, where that is a new discipline within Starbucks that we did not have a few years ago. And I think what that has resulted in, is that we think there's lots of runway, lots of whitespace throughout the day, and I think there's opportunities that we still have not uncovered that goes past the evening hour, whether it's the test that we have now with beer and wine, or other things that we're thinking about that take advantage of the fixed cost of our real estate. But no one at Starbucks is looking at any kind of ceiling. We believe that we're just getting started and we're not going to use historical information or data to put a lid on what we think is possible. And I think the fact is that we're doing more volume and serving more customers than any other time in the 40 year history of the company, and we're just getting started.","Clifford Burrows","I think it's really true, Howard. Just to add to that. We've really been focused and we continue to focus on our effectiveness and efficiency. And what I mean by that, is simplifying the work, investing in growing the skills of our baristas, supplementing that with technology. And the performance of our stores at the top end, have just got stronger this year, and we still believe there is more capacity even at peak. Add to that work we're doing around technology in the card, again, it will help us drive, Troy mentioned earlier, we've now seen some testing which gives me real confidence that we can show significant improvement. If you look at the day parts to Howard's point, we have virtually no share of lunch, and that is a huge opportunity for us. We've started -- we have a commitment to that, and that ray [ph] will be a big opportunity. So we do see volumes growing. We do see as being more efficiency to peak and capitalizing on other opportunities in day parts.","JoAnn DeGrande","Thank you all for the great questions this afternoon.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you.","Mr. Shaw, you may begin your conference.","Thomas Shaw - Starbucks Corp.","Thanks and good afternoon, everyone. This is Tom Shaw, Vice President of Investor Relations at Starbucks Coffee Company. Thanks for joining us today to discuss our fourth quarter and fiscal 2016 results, which will be led by Howard Schultz, Chairman and CEO; Kevin Johnson, President and COO; and Scott Maw, our CFO. Joining us for Q&A are John Culver, Group President, Starbucks Global Retail; Cliff Burrows, Group President, Siren Retail; Matt Ryan, Global Chief Strategy Officer; and Michael Conway, President of Global Channel Development.","I'd like to remind everyone that our fiscal 2016 year had 53 weeks as opposed to the usual 52 weeks. This happens every six years as our fiscal year ends on the closest Sunday to September 30 and the extra week is reflected in our results for the fourth quarter. We'll be presenting our GAAP results for the 14-week quarter and 53-week full year, but some of our discussion will be on the non-GAAP basis, excluding the extra week. As a further reminder, non-GAAP earnings also continues to exclude certain costs related to our purchase of Starbucks Japan discussed on prior earnings calls. Please refer to the reconciliation table at the end of our earnings release and on our website at investor.starbucks.com to find a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures referenced in today's call with the corresponding GAAP measures.","This conference call will also include forward-looking statements, which are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements. Any such statements should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements in our earnings release and our risk factor discussions in our filings with the SEC, including our last annual report on Form 10-K. Starbucks assumes no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements or information. This conference call is being webcast and an archive of the webcast will be available on our website.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Howard Schultz. Howard?","Howard S. Schultz - Starbucks Corp.","Thank you, Tom, and, Tom, welcome to Starbucks. This is your first conference call, wonderful to have you. And welcome to everyone on today's call.","Starbucks record fiscal 2016 financial and operating results highlighted by an 11% increase in global revenues, a 17% increase in non-GAAP EPS and record operating margins despite persistent economic, consumer and geopolitical headwinds and the significant investments we continue to make in our people and our business and once again demonstrating the power, relevance and resilience of the Starbucks business and brand. Today, Starbucks is delivering an increasingly elevated Starbucks Experience to over 85 million customers through our 25,000 stores in 75 countries every week.","The trust and confidence our customers have in the Starbucks brand is propelling our business forward in markets and channels around the world as never before. But our record performance does not yet reflect what may be the most important strategic developments since Starbucks first changed how the world consumes coffee. The initiatives we have underway that are elevating the Starbucks brand, transforming the customer experience and setting the foundation for the next wave of growth in our business, starting right now with holiday, with premiumization as a core defining theme.","On today's call, I will provide context around several of these initiatives and open a window on exciting new innovations that are coming to life and will begin contributing to our sales and profits this year, and increasingly more so in the quarters and years ahead. And Kevin will provide highlights of our Q4 and fiscal 2016 operating performance, and Scott will take you through the details of our Q4 and fiscal 2016 financial performance and share our 2017 performance targets.","Perhaps nowhere in the world has the Starbucks Experience come to life more powerfully and been embraced more enthusiastically than in China, a country we first entered 17 years ago. I personally observed this again firsthand on my visit to the market just two weeks ago. Starbucks stores in China are among our most elegant, efficient and profitable of any stores in the world, and China once again produced record revenues and profits and strong comp store sales growth in both Q4 and fiscal 2016.","There are countless examples over the last decade of western companies and consumer brands that have tried but failed to achieve relevance in China. Not only has Starbucks cracked the code in China, consistently delivering record operating and financial performance, but our newest class of Starbucks stores in China is delivering the highest AUVs, ROI and profitability of any store class in our history in the market. And we have created partner pride and a deep emotional connection among our customers and our partners in the Starbucks brand in China that rivals any market in the world. By building the foundation of our business in China carefully, methodically and respectfully, we are creating a growth and profit engine that will continue to accelerate for decades to come.","Now, as I have said before, we are doubling down on China. We currently operate roughly 2,400 Starbucks stores in 114 cities in China, and employ over 30,000 passionate partners. And because we have consistently invested ahead of the growth curve, we can continue to open over a store a day, a rate of growth that will continue or accelerate into the foreseeable future.","We now have over 500 stores in Shanghai alone, a city of over 24 million people, making Shanghai the city in the world with more Starbucks stores than any other, and we continue to add stores. We remain on plan to have over 5,000 stores in China by 2021, and I am convinced that given the trust our customers in China have in the Starbucks brand and experience, and the loyalty they show us every day, in time, we will have more stores in China than we do in the U.S.","These are the reasons we have chosen Shanghai as the city for our first international Starbucks Reserve Roastery. Roasteries define coffee premiumization and are the epitome of the Starbucks coffee authority and retail experience. And the portfolio of Roasteries we plan to open around the world will enable us to extend and elevate the Starbucks Experience and the Starbucks brand overall for decades to come.","Opening in late 2017 on Nanjing Road, among the busiest shopping destinations in the world, the Starbucks Shanghai Roastery will be a stunning, two-level, 30,000-square-foot experiential destination showcasing the newest coffee brewing methods and offering customers the finest assortment of exclusive micro-lot coffees from around the world in an immersive, all-center experience emblematic of our Seattle Roastery, respectfully curating through a unique lens that will make it highly impactful and relevant to our Chinese customers.","Starbucks business in China is only in its very early stages of development, but we are already ideally and uniquely positioned to grow and profit in this key long-term growth market as economic reforms take hold and the Chinese middle class grows ultimately to encompass over 600 million people. And following on the heels of the Starbucks Shanghai Roastery, we'll be opening Starbucks Roasteries in New York City and in Tokyo in 2018, and our first roastery in Europe in 2019 in a city to be announced early in 2017.","Our decision to aggressively but thoughtfully and strategically expand our portfolio of Roasteries is supported by the one-of-a-kind, ultra-premium Reserve experience our Roasteries deliver to our customers, and the accelerating outperformance against plan we are experiencing in our Seattle Roastery, where full-year comp sales increased a full 24% over the prior year, thanks in large part to a ticket that has grown to be four times the ticket of a typical Starbucks store. But in addition to elevating the Starbucks brand and customer experience, our Seattle Roastery has also become a working laboratory for breakthrough innovation that is driving new product introductions and contributing to results across the entire Starbucks ecosystem.","Nitro, for example, an innovative, new cold coffee beverage infused with nitrogen to create an ultra-creamy texture that has been enthusiastically embraced by our customers and is now being rolled out in coffee-forward markets across the country, was developed and tested in the Seattle Roastery. So too was Starbucks Affogato, our expression of a classic artisanal ice cream dessert infused with espresso, as well as handcrafted, proprietary Teavana iced teas and several other innovative new coffee-infused mixology beverages that are already showing great promise in test stores. Stay tuned.","As with Starbucks Seattle Roastery, our Shanghai, New York and Tokyo Roasteries will serve as the foundation for the exciting, new-format, coffee-forward Starbucks Reserve stores. Also offering customers a range of artisanal food items, we plan to open around the world in the years ahead. The first of these new-format stores will open in the U.S. in the second half of our current fiscal year.","And we are extending elements of the high-end roastery experience to include Reserve espresso bars in existing and new Starbucks stores as part of our plan to further elevate the overall Starbucks Experience. Customers' response to this initiative has been both very positive and very encouraging, as customers are trading up to premium espresso beverages.","Still at the heart of all we do is our store partners, the best people in the industry. The investments we make in our people and in our business over the long-term is what drives the results we deliver quarter to quarter. The culture, the values and guiding principles of our company have always defined the brand. Consider our Starbucks College Achievement Plan, now in its third year, the Starbucks College Achievement Plan, a program that offers all Starbucks partners working 20 hours or more per week are given a company-paid, four-year online college education through our association with Arizona State University. The program now has over 6,200 partners enrolled, and we will celebrate 1,000 college graduates by the end of 2017.","Partners participating in the College Achievement Plan have twice the retention rate and four times the promotion rate of our core U.S. barista population.","The incremental investment in both wages and benefits for our store-level partners that we began making two years ago have been right not only from the perspective of sharing success, but also from the perspectives of enabling us to support and elevate our partners, attract and retain the best people, provide measured improvement in service to our customers and deliver outsized returns to our shareowners, due in part to an employee turnover rate that is the envy of our industry. We demonstrated this again in Q4 and in fiscal 2016, difficult environments for retailers by any measure. Yet here we are once again posting record performance, 11% top-line and 17% bottom-line for the year. Scott will update you on the size of the timing of our partner and other investments shortly.","A few final thoughts before handing the call over to Kevin. Since its opening two years ago, our Seattle Roastery has become recognized as the most immersive coffee-forward retail experience in the world today, and it has cast a bright halo across the entire Starbucks brand and ecosystem. We knew from the start that the Roastery would introduce a previously unattained level of premiumization to the coffee category curated through the unique Starbucks lens. We also knew that the Roastery would support the development and rollout of Starbucks Reserve stores, a new retail format that we believe will deliver 2x the financial performance of a traditional Starbucks store and represent a new significant growth opportunity for the company domestically and around the world.","But what we are achieving is much more than that. It's innovation and aspiration for the entire company and the beacon for the next wave of transformation that will elevate the entire Starbucks Experience. The Seattle Roastery is at once a laboratory for invention and handcrafted beverages, theater for coffee and the design cornerstone for new experience, like Reserve bars that over the next few years we'll incorporate into thousands of new and renovated stores.","Given both the success of the Roastery itself and its impact on the entire Starbucks company, we see the opportunity over time for 20 Roasteries to 30 Roasteries in influential cities around the world, defining the way for 1,000 or more Starbucks Reserve stores, carrying through to Reserve bars in 20% or more of existing and new Starbucks stores. Together, these innovations will further deepen connection to our customers, increase AUVs, ROI and profitability, and drive incrementality through new premium occasions we currently do not capture.","I am reminded of early days at Starbucks when we could foresee the transformation of coffee consumption that started in Seattle and spread all over the world. The scale of the opportunity, the confidence in our capability and the early validation we have all point to the next wave of growth for our company. In my years at Starbucks, I have never been more energized about the opportunity that lies ahead, and it's why Roasteries, Reserve stores and the premiumization of the Starbucks Experience will be my personal focus as we set up Starbucks for long-term growth and success.","The Shanghai Roastery is just the next tangible proof of the innovation and the entrepreneurial DNA of the company as we take our customers in China on a magical carpet ride starting just a year from now. But you don't need to wait to see what's happening if you can't get to China, or, for that matter, Seattle, where we have our first Roastery. Please visit our new stores with Reserve bars at 10 Waverly Place, 9th and Broadway, Brookfield Place, and 85th and Madison in New York City or in Lake Forest, Illinois. You'll see for yourself how the experience is defining the transformation of these stores and the experience for our customers, and how accretive this will be for our brand and our business. Better yet, come to our Investor Conference in December where we will be showcasing the Roastery, the evolution of the Starbucks Reserve brand, and demonstrating the impact that each of these stores will have on the Starbucks Experience and the future transformation of the company.","I'll now turn the call over to Kevin. Kevin?","Kevin R. Johnson - Starbucks Corp.","Thank you, Howard. Good afternoon, everyone. Starbucks' strong performance in Q4 capped off another record year for the company. In fiscal year 2016, we opened over 2,000 net new stores, which are outperforming the prior classes of new stores. We grew global same-store sales by 5%. And we gained share of at-home coffee and ready-to-drink down the aisle. We also advanced several long-term growth priorities that include new Roasteries, a new Reserve store concept, enhanced CPG growth platforms, and we continue to execute against our long-term commitment in China.","I believe these results demonstrate the value we are realizing from the investments we are making in our partners, innovation, and the digital flywheel. Our approach of investing for long-term value creation, while driving excellence in execution today, is enabling us to deliver results in a challenging operating environment while positioning our business for long-term growth.","Serving as a member of this leadership team is a privilege, and I want to take this opportunity to thank each of my partners for their passion, teamwork and focus. On today's call, I will share an overview of our Q4 segment performance, provide insight into the work we are doing to expand our customer reach and frequency, and update you on our upcoming holiday campaign. Let's start with our Americas segment.","Our Americas business, with more than 9,000 company-operated and 6,500 licensed stores in 17 countries, delivered 5% comp growth in the quarter, driving record Q4 revenues, up 17% year-on-year. Please note that all references I make to revenue on this call will be on the 53-week basis. AUVs for both our existing and newest class of U.S. stores reached record levels, giving us confidence in our decision to open approximately 800 net new stores throughout the Americas in fiscal 2017. This was where our focus on innovative new store designs, from express stores to Roasteries, elevating the customer experience, and innovative premium offerings, are paying off.","Drilling down, our U.S. business delivered record Q4 revenues, up 18% over last year. U.S. comps accelerated from Q3 and posted a 4% increase. Our U.S. comps included a 6% increase in ticket and a 1% decline in transactions resulting from a shift in customer behavior away from order splitting and towards order consolidation. This follows a foundational change we made to our Rewards program, taking it from a frequency-based to a spend-based model.","While neutral to revenue, we estimate the impact of order consolidation drove transactions down by approximately two points and ticket up by approximately two points. It's important to note that this conversion from transaction to ticket reflects customers choosing to put multiple items on one ticket rather than an actual decline in traffic in our stores. And this will persist in our comp results until we lap the transition to the new Rewards program.","Overall, our U.S. business grew in every day-part, with particularly strong growth in our morning day-part. Our core beverage platforms contributed approximately two points of comp in Q4. Beverage innovation drove another point of comp, with Coconut Milk Macchiato, Latte Macchiato, Vanilla Sweet Cream Cold Brew and Teavana Iced Berry Sangria. These are great examples of customers trading up to premium beverage offerings that differentiate the Starbucks Experience and create further separation from competitors.","Food contributed one point of comp in the quarter, led by continued strength of our breakfast sandwich lineup, up 17% over last year and 60% over the last two years. Lunch remains a significant opportunity as we amplify the strength of our Bistro Box platform through the Power Lunch offering. While we've made great progress around food in the lunch day-part, we believe there is a significant opportunity ahead.","Our digital flywheel momentum accelerated through Q4 and we have now enabled this digital flywheel to spin even faster with the launch of true one-to-one personalization. While still in the early days, personalized reward offerings have more than doubled customer response rates over previous segmented email campaigns. This translates to increased customer engagement and spend.","A few relevant metrics on Starbucks Rewards. Membership is up 18% year-on-year. Mobile payment now represents 25% of all transactions, up from 20% a year ago. Customers continue to embrace Mobile Order & Pay, which now represents 6% of transactions, reaching 7% in the month of September. To put this into perspective, approximately 3,300 of our stores are handling 10% of their orders at peak through Mobile Order & Pay. In 600 stores, Mobile Order & Pay represents over 20% of orders at peak, triple the number from last year. The data shows that Mobile Order & Pay is making a difference for both our partners and our customers. For customers, Mobile Order & Pay provides a simple, elegant ordering experience, enabling convenience when they want it and rewards them with stars along the way. For partners, Mobile Order & Pay reduces line congestion, enables a more efficient in-store operation.","We are continuously improving the Mobile Order & Pay experience with newly released functionality that presents our personalized offer directly on the front screen of the mobile app and allows the customer to save favorite stores, favorite customized beverages. And we have new features in the pipeline to be released shortly, including real-time, personalized product suggestions, and the ability to save favorite orders, and there's more coming. We are enabling these digital experiences to bring joy to our customers while driving business outcomes. These digital flywheel investments are core to elevating our brand experience and building for our future.","Let's move on to China-Asia Pacific. Starbucks China-Asia Pacific delivered another record performance this quarter, with year-on-year revenue growth of 29%. Starbucks China remained strong despite moderating GDP growth in China, and we remain committed to build at least 500 net new stores each year for the next five years.","Comp sales in CAP increased 1% in the quarter, with China's 6% comp almost evenly split between increases in traffic and ticket, demonstrating that we are both reaching new customers and increasing frequency in China. As we have previously indicated, CAP comps are more heavily weighted towards Japan, where comps were slightly negative but profitability remains strong. Japan comps in the quarter were impacted by ongoing consumer and economic challenges, as well as a tough compare over last year. As we navigate the near-term challenges in Japan, we remain very optimistic about the long-term potential in the country.","We opened 316 net new stores in CAP in Q4 and now operate over 6,400 stores in 15 markets across the region, including over 2,400 stores in 114 cities in China. As Howard mentioned, Starbucks stores in China are among the most elegant, efficient, coffee-forward and profitable stores in our global store portfolio. With loyalty as a cornerstone, we are extremely pleased with the growth and evolution of our digital ecosystem in CAP. Currently, 13 CAP markets of our 15 CAP markets offer a loyalty program and stored value card. 11 of those markets accept digital payment. We now have 20 million Starbucks Rewards members in the CAP region, with over $1 billion loaded on the stored value cards in FY 2016.","The momentum of our digital platform in the region is particularly evident in China where we now have 12 million members, just under half of whom are active Rewards members. Our China-Asia Pacific business continues to perform well, further reinforcing our confidence in the long-term growth potential of this market.","Let's move on to EMEA. The Starbucks brand remains strong in EMEA. Although reported comps declined by 1%, overall system comp grew at 4% for the quarter. EMEA's Q4 reported revenues declined year-on-year by 12%. However, after adjusting for the approximately 26% impact of the transfer of company-owned to licensed stores and for foreign exchange, EMEA adjusted revenues increased 13% year-on-year, this despite continuing economic, geopolitical and consumer headwinds throughout the region. We now operate in 43 markets throughout EMEA, and in FY 2016, we added 280 net new stores. In Q4, we opened 77 net new stores, all of which were licensed.","The mix shift toward a licensed model is enabling us to grow our store footprint more rapidly while expanding underlying operating margin over time. We introduced Teavana handcrafted beverages in Starbucks stores across 29 EMEA markets. Teavana has been very well received by customers, exceeding our most optimistic expectations. We're off to a good start in EMEA.","Let's move on to Channel Development. Channel Development had a very strong Q4, with revenue growing 14% year-on-year, driven by share gains in at-home coffee. The strength of the Starbucks brand and great execution by our channels team drove this result. Our K-Cup business posted strong sales growth and gained over half point of share. Starbucks continues to be the number one K-Cup brand for the fifth consecutive quarter.","Fall Blend, a seasonal favorite and the launch of Caff\u00e8 Latte K-Cups including Pumpkin Spice, contributed to the strong results. Starbucks roast and ground coffee continues to be the number one premium packaged coffee brand, growing faster than the entire category, and gaining over one full point of market share in the quarter. In addition to being the number one premium coffee brand, Starbucks solidified its position as the number two brand in the total coffee category, with share increasing to 15.8%. Through our North American Coffee Partnership with PepsiCo, our Ready-to-Drink business performed well with double shot Frappuccino and chilled multi-serve, which enabled another point of share gain in the liquid coffee and energy segment.","We have added additional CPG growth engines to the pipeline. The first is our plan to bring premium Teavana Ready-to-Drink teas to the U.S. through our partnership with Anheuser-Busch. We will begin to launch regionally during the first half of calendar 2017. In addition, we are expanding internationally with the recent launch of locally manufactured ready-to-drink Frappuccino through a partnership in China. Tingyi has rapidly achieved distribution in over 35 major Chinese cities and although it is still early days, we are experiencing strong consumer demand.","In Europe, we recently launched Starbucks Nespresso compatible capsules in the UK and France and the early results are encouraging. Channel Development continues to perform extremely well with additional growth opportunities just getting started.","On to holiday. We are very excited about our holiday plans. We have a solid marketing plan in place where our stores transform to holiday red and the holiday cups return. We will introduce wonderful food and beverage offerings, an amplified Starbucks for Life campaign and a platform of beautiful Starbucks gift cards and merchandise. We will also introduce our first specialty Cold Brew Coffee for the holidays, spice sweet cream Nari\u00f1o 70 Cold Brew, our Starbucks Rewards members can get a first taste of this new handcrafted beverage starting today.","A few final words before turning the call over to Scott. As a leadership team navigating the current environment, we are mindful of our responsibilities to deliver near-term results, build a foundation for our future growth and stay true to the mission and values that brought us to this point in our journey. I believe our fiscal year 2016 results reflect this mindset. I want to thank the more than 300,000 Starbucks partners around the world who proudly wear the green apron. No other company has the opportunity to touch so many lives and each day, our store partners show up committed to our mission and deliver a customer experience like no other. Each and every Starbucks partner helps bring our brand to life. For their commitment and hard work, they have my utmost respect and gratitude.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott. Scott?","Scott Harlan Maw - Starbucks Corp.","Thank you, Kevin, and good afternoon, everyone. Starbucks Q4 of fiscal 2016 was the most profitable quarter capping off the most profitable year in the company's history. Q4 EPS was $0.54 and on a 14-week non-GAAP basis it was $0.56 with the extra week contributing approximately $0.06. Excluding the extra week, our non-GAAP EPS in Q4 grew by 16% over last year, representing our 15th straight quarter of non-GAAP EPS growth of 15% or greater.","Please note that for comparability purposes, all remaining non-GAAP references on today's call will exclude the extra week. Our consolidated operating margin in Q4 came in at 21.5% on a GAAP basis and 20.9% on a non-GAAP basis, improving 90 basis points over last year's fourth quarter non-GAAP operating margin. Operating margin improvement was driven primarily by sales leverage and favorability in commodity costs that more than offset the impact of increased partner investments and certain additional G&A costs. For the quarter, consolidated operating income increased 27% on a GAAP basis and 13% on a non-GAAP basis.","I'll now take you through our Q4 operating performance by segment. Let's start with the Americas. The Americas segment delivered both record operating income of $1.1 billion, and operating margin of 27.6% driven by strong performance in our businesses across the region. Non-GAAP operating income increased 18% over last year to $988 million, while operating margin expanded 210 basis points to 26.9%. This improvement was primarily driven by sales leverage that was partially offset by partner investments.","I'd like to call out two specific additional items in the Americas results this quarter. First, you will note that we saw leverage on store operating expenses during the quarter compared to deleverage for the full year. This result was driven by several factors, including a somewhat lower run rate of partner investments in Q4, a comparison to higher relative partner investments last Q4, some salary and benefit true-ups during Q4 this year and improved productivity in the stores. This productivity improvement includes the impact of removing nearly 10% of transactions from the POS over the past year or so, 6% coming from Mobile Order & Pay and two points coming from order consolidation. Going forward, we anticipate that store operating expenses will again show deleverage, given the level of partner investments we have planned for 2017. Second, Americas operating margin in Q4 was favorably impacted by 60 basis points as a result of a favorable legal settlement recorded in other operating expenses.","Let's move on to China-Asia Pacific. Starbucks China-Asia Pacific segment also delivered record quarterly GAAP and non-GAAP operating income in Q4. Operating income increased 48% to $192 million, and operating margin expanded by 300 basis points. On a non-GAAP basis, operating income increased by 34% to $189 million, and operating margin expanded 250 basis points. This performance made CAP once again the segment with the strongest quarterly top- and bottom-line growth. Margin expansion in CAP was primarily driven by the transition to a value-added tax structure in China, increased sales leverage and higher income from our joint venture operations. This favorability was partially offset by a negative 150 basis point impact of foreign currency translation. Stiff currency headwinds made CAP's margin expansion in Q4 even that much more noteworthy.","Let's turn to EMEA. Despite a very difficult business environment, EMEA delivered the second most profitable quarter in its history. Operating income decreased slightly in Q4, driven by lower revenues from company-owned stores. GAAP operating margin in Q4 came in at 17% while non-GAAP operating margin came in at 16.2%, down 100 basis points from the prior year's record quarter. Foreign exchange impacted EMEA margins significantly in Q4 with margin actually expanding after adjusting for FX. This expansion resulted from the ongoing shift in our store ownership model to an increasingly licensed store point \u2013 portfolio, once again reinforcing the correctness of our EMEA store strategy.","As Kevin mentioned, Starbucks Channel Development segment continued to take category share in Q4 while also delivering record quarterly operating income and strong operating margin expansion. Operating income for the segment was $244 million, and operating margin was 47.1%. On a non-GAAP basis, operating income reached $230 million, up 16% year-over-year as operating margin increased 480 basis points over the prior-year quarter to 48%. This improvement was driven primarily by favorability in COGS, primarily coffee costs, and higher income from our North American Coffee Partnership with Pepsi.","Noteworthy is that Channel Development Q4 revenue growth excluding the extra week was 5%, somewhat lower than recent quarters driven by a very strong comparison in Q4 of last year. We are off to a strong start in Q1 of 2017 and anticipate revenue growth for Channel Development in the high-single digits for the current quarter.","Our consolidated and segment performance for the full fiscal year 2016 were equally as strong. For the year, Starbucks posted record consolidated operating income of just over $4 billion with an 80 basis point expansion in operating margin to 19.6%. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding the $0.06 for the 53rd week, EPS grew by 17% or nearly 19% after adjusting for approximately two points of impact from foreign exchange.","Non-GAAP operating margin of 19.6% reflected a 50 basis point improvement over last year's non-GAAP operating margin. The increase was primarily driven by sales leverage that more than offset approximately 70 basis points of increased costs related to partner and digital investments.","Consolidated revenue growth on a 52-week basis was 9% but reached 10% after adjusting for one point of negative FX impact. Drilling down into segment performance for the year, our Americas segment delivered 110 basis points of GAAP operating margin expansion and 80 basis points of non-GAAP margin expansion, driven primarily by strong sales leverage, partially offset by increased partner investments. For the full year, our CAP segment delivered 60 basis points of margin expansion to 21.5%. On a non-GAAP basis, operating margin expanded by 50 basis points to 23.1%. Noteworthy is the CAP margin expanded despite approximately 200 basis points of negative impact from the combination of foreign exchange headwinds and the last bit of impact from the Japan ownership change.","Excluding these two items, segment margin expansion was significantly ahead of expectation for the year, driven by strong store level profitability in both China and Japan. For the year, EMEA margin was 13.5% on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis and a decrease of 30 basis points from fiscal 2015, due primarily to the impact of foreign exchange. Excluding the impact of FX, EMEA margin expanded slightly as the continued shift to a licensed model drove margin expansion despite very challenging macroeconomic and geopolitical environments in the region.","Finally, for the full year, Channel Development operating margin reached 41.8%. Non-GAAP operating income grew 21% and margin expanded by 410 basis points, representing Channel Development's fourth straight year of margin expansion in excess of 100 basis points. We started the year planning to open 1,800 net new stores globally and ended the year with over 2,000 net new stores, showing the confidence we had both in our store development teams and in the profitability our new stores generate. In a time where most other retailers are cutting openings and increasing closures, we are prudently but confidently increasing our openings somewhat for next year.","Finally, our effective tax rate for 2016 was 32.9% compared to 29.3% in fiscal 2015, reflecting the impact of almost an entirely non-taxable gain in fiscal 2015 related to the Starbucks Japan acquisition. The strength and health of our business enables us to continue generating significant operating cash flow to both fund profitable growth opportunities and return significant amounts of cash back to shareholders. We returned a record of approximately $3.2 billion to shareholders in fiscal 2016 through dividends and share repurchases, a 33% year-over-year increase. And today, we announced that our board has approved the 25% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.25 per share.","Looking ahead, we remain confident in our ability to deliver strong performance and profitability. Here are the relevant targets for fiscal 2017. Consistent with our long-term guidance range, we expect global comp growth in FY 2017 to be in the mid-single digits range, with the first half of the year towards the lower end of that range and some improvement during the second half of the year within that range. Complementing our expected comp growth will be the addition of approximately 2,100 net new stores globally, up slightly from 2016, with 60% of planned openings outside the U.S. The Americas segment is expected to add 800 net new stores, split roughly evenly between company-owned and licensed.","Our China\/Asia Pacific segment will drive almost half of our global new store growth at approximately 1,000 net new stores, two-thirds of which will be licensed. And our EMEA segment is targeting approximately 300 net new stores in fiscal 2017, virtually all of which will be licensed. These factors contribute to expected revenue growth of approximately 10% compared to fiscal 2016 on a 52-week basis.","Consolidated GAAP and non-GAAP operating margin is expected to improve slightly from 2016 on a 52-week basis, reflecting strong revenue growth and leverage on cost of goods sold and G&A partially offset by the impact of increased investments for retail store partners and digital investments. We expect partner and digital investments to increase by approximately $250 million versus an increase of approximately $160 million in 2016. The bulk of these investments will be in the U.S. and driven by increased partner wages and benefits. We also expect to make investments in our major markets around the world including paving the way for global expansion of our digital flywheel and increases in certain partner benefits such as housing allowances in key markets.","Let me pause to put our increased partner investments in relation to our earnings growth in 2017 into proper perspective. Last year, we increased investments by about $160 million and delivered non-GAAP EPS growth of 19% when adjusting for 2 points of negative FX impact. This year, we are targeting about $250 million of incremental investments and we are still planning to deliver non-GAAP EPS growth of 15% to 16%. Given the strength in our businesses across the globe and ongoing efficiency opportunities in our supply chain and G&A cost structure, we are confident that we can deliver on our targets while appropriately funding our investments.","Looking at our segments, we expect our operating margin in the Americas to be flat to up slightly relative to 2016, reflecting sales leverage and increased operational efficiencies but offset by the impact of increased investments. We expect moderate operating margin expansion in CAP with FX negatively impacting this segment a bit again in 2017. Operating margin in EMEA will approach 15% for the year as we continue to optimize the portfolio and realize the benefits of the ongoing business model shift from company-owned to licensed stores. And our Channel Development segment will again drive moderate margin expansion versus prior year, though less than the very strong 410 basis point expansion we saw in 2016. All of this segment margin guidance I just shared is on a 52-week non-GAAP basis.","Given all of these inputs, we expect fiscal 2017 GAAP EPS in the range of $2.09 to $2.11 and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $2.12 to $2.14. Specifically looking at Q1 2017, we are targeting GAAP EPS in the range of $0.50 to $0.51 and non-GAAP EPS of $0.51 to $0.52, representing a somewhat lower year-over-year growth rate than the full year. This dynamic is driven by the significant Q1 ramping of the partner investments we announced this summer.","Neither FX or commodities are expected to have a major impact on year-over-year profit growth, with FX slightly unfavorable and commodities slightly favorable. We have our coffee needs about two-thirds price locked for FY 2017. We expect our effective tax rate for 2017 will be about 34% and capital expenditures will be about $1.6 billion.","As I said at the outset, Starbucks fiscal Q4 capped off a record year for the company, performance that was particularly noteworthy, as it was delivered in the face of strong FX headwinds and challenging economic, consumer, and geopolitical environments in many markets around the world in which we compete. And as you can see, each of our segments contributed to our performance in the quarter and year in a meaningful way. We are producing industry-leading returns on our capital and investments while increasing our cash return to shareholders. Once again, credit for our success goes to our store partners around the world, whose dedication and commitment to delivering an elevated Starbucks Experience to our customers enables us to consistently deliver the results we do. We're looking forward to sharing more of our future plans with you at our upcoming Investor Day.","With that, I'll turn the call back to the operator for Q&A. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of Andy Barish from Jefferies. Andy, your line is now open.","Andrew Marc Barish - Jefferies LLC","Yeah, just wondering on the U.S. comp and the round-down. Did you see sort of some of the afternoon pressures and Frappuccino declines as the summer went on with your summer beverage program? Or did things get a little bit better there and you kind of have some products that can maybe pick up the slack for Frappuccino?","Kevin R. Johnson - Starbucks Corp.","Yeah, Andy, this is Kevin. First of all, we saw growth in every day-part in the U.S. this last quarter. And Frappuccino contributed a bit of comp. So, from the weakness we had in Frappuccino in Q3, we saw positive contribution towards comp from Frappuccino in Q4.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Palmer from RBC. David, your line is now open.","Eric Gonzalez - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi. Good evening. This is Eric Gonzalez in for Dave Palmer. I think you said your mobile payment mix is about 25% during the quarter. I think this implies that, similar to last quarter, I think they have flattened out on a sequential basis. Have you analyzed why this might be? And do you think that there's steps you could take to jumpstart the growth in that mix?","Kevin R. Johnson - Starbucks Corp.","Yeah, this is Kevin. First of all, the order consolidation impact has an impact on this as well. Keep in mind, this is 25% of transaction paid for with the mobile app. And so, with the order consolidation, you have customers actually doing more spend on the mobile app, but the number stays the same. And I think late in the quarter, we've seen that tick up 26%. So you have \u2013 the big contributor, though, was the order consolidation that impacted that.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Sara Senatore from Bernstein. Sara, your line is now open.","Sara Harkavy Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you. I wanted to ask about the Roastery and the Reserve stores. And I guess the halo you mentioned. Can you talk perhaps about anything you're seeing in terms of customer perception that you might track? And I guess for those of us in New York, we see a lot of these so-called third wave coffee shops opening up. So is this sort of a beachhead for Starbucks against that? Are you not seeing an impact from that? Just wanted to get a sense of what the Roasteries and the Reserve stores are doing for you. Thank you.","Howard S. Schultz - Starbucks Corp.","Thank you. Sara, can I just ask you, have you seen the Roastery in Seattle? Have you been there?","Sara Harkavy Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","I have.","Howard S. Schultz - Starbucks Corp.","Okay. Would you agree with me that you've never seen anything quite like that?","Sara Harkavy Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","It is magical. That is an accurate assessment.","Howard S. Schultz - Starbucks Corp.","Okay, all right. I guess if you're a lawyer, you're never supposed to ask a question you don't know the answer to, so I took a little risk there. But I think anyone who has seen the Roastery understands that in addition to it being the kind of coffee experience, it has really no peer in terms of any retail experience. But all along, we set out to build a new brand and that was Starbucks Reserve, with the understanding that we had an opportunity to elevate the core business and really take the brand and the coffee up to a new level. Now, many of us have seen this take place in other industries, the fashion industry, the automobile industry, I think a good analog is what Nike's been able to do with Air Jordan and that is build a profit center and a sub brand that unto itself is a growth engine and, as a result of that, shines a halo on the entire company.","Now the Roastery itself has created the kind of retail experience that we are learning a great deal from. And the primary thing we're learning is that the Reserve bar, which in our parlance, that's the espresso bar and where all the coffee is made in multiple brewing methods, that has created excitement, interest, education, romance, theater, but it also has created the opportunity for us to provide our customers with a different coffee experience and, candidly, at a higher ticket. And so, we're taking learning from that and we're integrating that into existing and new Starbucks stores.","Those are the four stores that opened in Manhattan. They've opened in Lake Forest, Illinois. They've opened in Japan and China. And what we're seeing is the core Starbucks customer is coming into the store, and as a result of seeing Reserve and getting educated, they're taking their cue from the Reserve bar and the presentation and they're moving over to the Reserve bar and now purchasing espresso-based beverages that are more exotic, different taste profile, higher ticket, and obviously that shines a halo on the Starbucks Experience. Now, the big opportunity, in addition to that, is we believe that given the fact that the Roastery is only going be in 10 markets, 20 markets, 30 markets over the next number of years, the question is how do we scale the Reserve brand and how do we make it more accessible to our customers?","So we have been diligently working on a new store format and that new store format is Starbucks Reserve stores. And basically, if you can think about it this way, it's a 3,000 square foot store that has the design, the elegance, the materiality and all the romance without roasting in the store with artisanal food that we're bringing from Italy that we talked about in the last call, that's Princi. And those stores will begin opening in the second half of the year. So the Reserve brand, the pyramid starts with the Roastery. It goes to the Reserve store and then goes to the Reserve bar. As I said in my prepared remarks, we think that we're sitting on an opportunity to not only elevate the equity of the brand but drive incrementality in existing Starbucks stores and create a new growth platform for the company domestically and internationally. And, most importantly, take the company up.","But the short answer to your first question is this is not in response to any so-called third wave coffee, this is in response to the fact that we have a customer base of almost 90 million strong. And we know that our customers have given us license and have the trust in us to elevate the experience, and the Roastery is a proof source that we're onto something that we can scale and create a national and a global footprint as a result of it.","And the last piece of this is we're now selling Starbucks Reserve whole bean and ground coffee in existing Starbucks stores, and this is just the beginning of leveraging multiple channels of distribution under that brand.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Glass from Morgan Stanley. John, your line is now open.","John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks very much. It seems that membership in My Starbucks Rewards is sort of the beginning of the funnel, you get consumers in at these mobile payment, mobile ordering, and yet I'm always surprised at how few people are actually members when I talk to friends, families, whatever, the members of the program. So how do you accelerate that? And I thought one of the reasons that you were changing the point system was enable to use the points outside \u2013 or the Stars outside of the Starbucks stores. We haven't heard much in terms of new alliances, for example, to broaden that to people who may not have been Starbucks customers become members through other organizations or affiliations you may have. Where do you stand on that process?","Matthew Ryan - Starbucks Corp.","Thank you, John. Matt Ryan here. First of all, we see this as an enormous opportunity moving forward. We know that very few of our customers, relatively speaking, have become members. And that, to us, represents an enormous opportunity moving forward. What we do know is that when we are able to convert somebody into being a member of the program, we see tremendous incrementally as they join the program. And we continue to see that accelerate. Over the past few months, we have worked on successfully transitioning our program to a spend-based program, and we are now seeing the uptick in spend per member and engagement that we anticipated from the launch of the program. So we're completely on track and accelerating in that regard.","Our next big opportunity moving forward, especially in the natural window that we have ahead of us in the next two quarters is to take advantage of the traffic we see, the card volume we do to convert even more people into Starbucks Rewards.","And just on the topic of extending outside of Starbucks, it's never been our intention to have Starbucks Stars be used at other venues. But we are going to be giving customers the opportunity to earn Stars at other venues, starting with a partnership with Chase, which we previously announced.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Tarantino from Robert W. Baird. David, your line is now open.","David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Hi. Good afternoon. Scott, I wanted to ask about the guidance. I know you mentioned that you expect mid-single-digit comps for the year and perhaps a lower part of that in the first half of the year and the upper part of that in the second half of the year, if I heard you correctly. So could you just talk about what you might be trying to signal there about the first half of the year? Whether it's kind of more of the same versus what we've been seeing in the recent quarters? And then maybe talk about why that would be the case? Is it just comparisons? Or are you thinking there's certain initiatives that start to kick in in the second half of the year that will help the comps?","Scott Harlan Maw - Starbucks Corp.","Yeah, thanks, David. I think I would start with the fact that Howard covered around the environment that we're facing right now in many of our major markets around the globe. So the consumer remains under pressure in many places in Europe and Asia as well as here in the U.S., economic uncertainty around the overall consumer environment, around the election, that continues to weigh on our customers around the globe. And I think we can see that continuing as we get into 2017.","And then I would point to the fact that the comparisons that we had over the last couple quarters have been particularly difficult and impacted our comps that we reported in Q3 and Q4. And those comparisons, if anything, they get a little bit tougher as you get into Q1 and certainly stay as tough in Q2. So that weighs into the guidance.","And then the third thing, perhaps the most important thing is, we do have a number of initiatives that we'll be rolling out and accelerating over the course of the year. And we're going to spend a lot of time talk about this during Investor Day, but they include innovation around store development and store design, even beyond what Howard's talking about in Reserve focused stores.","But as we go through a pretty significant cycle of remodels, we see ways to do those remodels to both improve the customer experience as well as our partner experience and productivity. When you get on the digital front, Kevin talked about some of this, but we just launched Favorites from an item standpoint and from a store standpoint. I'm sure John you've used the Favorite stores. It's so much easier if you're in a dense, urban area that to pick among your stores and save them and quickly get what you want.","Same thing with Favorite items for highly customized beverages. So that's just rolling out. And over the next couple of quarters, we'll get to suggested selling, where as the customers building their order in the app, we'll be able to make relevant product suggestions to them. So that's all coming. Then product and food or food and beverage innovation is coming. Kevin talked about holiday. As we get into the new calendar year, there's a number of things that we'll talk about on the food side that we'll sample at Investor Day. So I think as we look into calendar year 2017, there's a number of things that make us a bit more optimistic that we might be able to get in the middle of that mid-single-digit range versus I think the first six months or so it will be towards the lower-end of that range.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Charles from Cowen & Co. Andrew, your line is now open.","Andrew Charles - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you. Can you walk us through how that 1% headwind from transaction splitting in 3Q widened to the 2% in 4Q? It's basically implying that there's going to be with one person used to do three transactions or two people used to do three transactions consolidating that into one. I understand the benefits obviously of the program and why that would normally happen but I guess I'm curious about why that widened?","Matthew Ryan - Starbucks Corp.","Sure. It's Matt Ryan here. Let me take a stab at trying to answer that. It's a little bit complex so bear with me here. What we are seeing is basically how we record the transactions of customers in our stores and what we had in the past, but we didn't necessarily have visibility to, are people or parties of people coming in and buying multiple items. We could predict and forecast based upon what we saw on a singular account, somebody coming in and buying something and then right away using the same account again to buy something else. And that accounted for about 1 point of, what we call, transaction splitting going away. But what we were able to see through the end of the second quarter, especially as people adjusted their habits, was that there was actually consolidation taking place between multiple accounts.","And, of course, there would have been no way for us to see that before. But what we saw were multiple beverages being put on Starbucks Rewards accounts where they hadn't been put on there before. When you roll that all up together, what that means is we had two total points of what had been recorded on separate accounts before, now being consolidated onto a single account. So while the actual traffic wasn't any different, we're seeing consolidation of two points when you take both of those things into consideration.","Scott Harlan Maw - Starbucks Corp.","I'd just add one thing to what Matt said. We started to see that in beverage attach, so as we got into the summer we had the point that we expected but when we looked at beverage attach that really started to increase significantly and that's when we knew that multiple accounts were putting beverages on a single transaction where they were splitting it before.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe from JPMorgan. John, your line is now open.","John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Thank you. Howard, I was going to ask you to maybe apply the current environment in terms of what we're seeing both in the U.S. and around the world in the consumer environment, to what you've seen elsewhere in your decades of experience at Starbucks. And I guess a lot of us who are on the call are wondering if the environment can actually get better from where we are today. And as you kind of think about the election and getting that behind us, whether there's kind of an opportunity for the overall consumer sentiment in spending and the external environment perhaps being more of a tailwind than a headwind that's been in the last couple of years.","Howard S. Schultz - Starbucks Corp.","John, I wish I was as smart as you might expect me to be. I mean I think we're asking ourselves the same questions that you have just posed. And also I think as we get around our table and we talk about the business, if you were in the room you'd hear us talking about the fact that we don't want to use weather and we don't want to use the uncertainty in the election as an excuse. But nevertheless, we are all trying to navigate through a difficult time. I mean I would label this time as just a high degree of uncertainty that obviously is domestically driven but has affected the rest of the world. John and I and Cliff just last week we're in China and Japan, and Cliff and I will be in Europe next week, and I think it's safe to say that wherever we have been, I don't think we've ever witnessed such concern about what could happen in the U.S. as a result of the election.","And I think there's no question, as I speak to other retailers and other merchants both in and out of our sector, that there isn't one exception where everyone is experiencing, I think, a very unpredictable and erratic chain of events where it's very, very hard. I think what's equally hard, it's very hard to cut through all of the noise and try and get access to the customer and try and get your message out.","So I think we've tried to be very disciplined and very thoughtful about how we spend our money, both in traditional advertising and social media, so that we are not in any way kind of getting caught into all of this. I think everyone is hoping that post the election, there will be a return to a natural state of affairs in terms of the consumer behavior. But I think there's another issue on the table that we have not yet discussed that I talked about three years ago, and that is the seismic shift in consumer traffic.","I was talking to Fred Smith just a couple of weeks ago about his situation at FedEx and he shared with me a piece of research which showed a significant drop in foot traffic on Main Street and in malls, not only domestically and around the world, as a result of e-commerce, the Web, and what I'll loosely describe as the Amazon effect. As a result of that, you're certainly seeing large companies and small companies not only not open new stores, but announce closures.","And let me just speak to that. I know this is a little long-winded but I think it's important. There's no doubt that over the next five years or so, we are going to see a dramatic level of retailers not be able to sustain their level of core business as a traditional bricks-and-mortar retailer, and their omni-channel approach is not going to be sustainable to maintain their cost of their infrastructure. And as a result of that, there's going to be tremendous amount of changes with regard to the retail landscape.","We believe, as we look down that pipe and look at the future, that our ability to maintain our growth in terms of new stores domestically and internationally, coupled with the fact that Starbucks still maintains a very special place in terms of a sense of community, the third place environment, and people looking for and seeking out human contact and a place to go, that as these store closures occur, and they will, that we are going to be in a very unique position five years, 10 years down the road because there's going to be a lot less people competing for those customers. I'm not talking about the coffee category; I'm talking overall.","But we are in the very, very early stages of a tremendous change in the bricks-and-mortar footprint of retailers domestically and internationally as a result of the sea change in how people are buying things, and that's going to have, I think, a negative effect on all of retail. But we believe that it's going to have ultimately a positive effect on the position that we occupy and the environment that we create in our stores.","So short answer, I think we got to get through this uncertainty. We're playing the long game in everything we do and we're going to continue to do everything we can to win the hearts and minds of our customers and invest in our people, and really, I think, create a breakthrough innovation as a result of what we're doing with the Roastery and other things. And just one thing about the Roastery. As New York and Shanghai opened, for those of you who have seen Seattle, I'll tell you that Shanghai and New York will be 2.0 as good as Seattle is. Wait until you see what we're going to do in New York and Shanghai. I mean, it's going to change the company, the brand, and everything we do.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jason West from Credit Suisse. Jason, your line is now open.","Jason West - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Yeah, just two quick clarifications and a question. Just one, Scott, on the guidance on the investments. Just to be clear, that $250 million is incremental to the $160 million? It's not $90 million over the $160 million? And then on the coffee outlook, can you just say if that's kind of looking flat or up or down for next year on what you have locked? And then the bigger picture question is just on the disruption I guess you saw last quarter when you switched the loyalty program, and people getting used to that new structure. Do you think there's still some disruption there that needs to get worked through or has that been sort of fully understood and people moving forward now with that?","Scott Harlan Maw - Starbucks Corp.","Thanks, Jason. I'll take the first couple and then I'll pass it over to Matt. The $250 million is incremental, so it would be on top of the $160 million. And then we see coffee a little bit favorable year-over-year. But as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, it's pretty much offset by slightly negative foreign exchange impact.","Matthew Ryan - Starbucks Corp.","Great. And as for the disruption, a couple of key things. I think we're through with anything you might characterize as disruption, but I want to be careful with what I mean there. Number one is that we saw no attrition from the so-called disadvantaged people. We studied this issue very carefully and tracked it all through the summer, and we did not see those people who are not earning Rewards as quickly diminish in any way within the program. The thing that we did want to see last quarter but which we saw this quarter was an acceleration in spend per member.","So keep in mind that the reason why we did this was to able to have the lever not just of transaction but also of ticket. That didn't materialize in Q3 but did materialize in Q4. And we are seeing acceleration in the spending per member. So we're feeling very, very good about having come out of the program transition with very minimal collateral damage in any way and a good trajectory in front of us, especially as we lean into acquiring new members.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Buckley from Bank of America. Joe, your line is now open.","Joseph Terrence Buckley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. One follow up as well and then one additional question. Could you share with us \u2013 this is the follow-up \u2013 could you share with us the My Starbucks Rewards, what percent of either sales or transactions the total program represents? I mean whether people are doing it on their phone or doing it kind of in a more old-fashioned way or however they're doing it, what that total is? And then secondly, wanted to ask about the espresso bars and where you stand in that rollout and if you could talk a bit about the type of sales impact you see when you install that in an existing Starbucks.","Matthew Ryan - Starbucks Corp.","Sure. Matt Ryan here. Very quickly on the percent of tender. So we see 33% of tender coming in from Starbucks Rewards across mobile and registered Cards. We see an additional 5% coming in from non-registered Cards. So between Card and the Starbucks Rewards program is at 38%. And mobile of course is at 25% right now.","Howard S. Schultz - Starbucks Corp.","Joe, with regard to the espresso \u2013 sorry \u2013 with regard to the espresso bars...","Joseph Terrence Buckley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","No, no. Thank you.","Howard S. Schultz - Starbucks Corp.","What's very interesting about the evolution of the espresso bars is that we actually started this, believe it or not, in China. That the China experience and the design of the stores gave rise to the understanding that we had an opportunity in existing Starbucks stores and some new stores to offer the customer an alternative based on what was going on and what we were initially learning in the Roastery. So it's very early on domestically and we've been doing this in Asia for a while.","But if we look at what's happened in the Roastery and we say to ourselves, could we transfer the opportunity of premiumization in an existing or new Starbucks store? What we're learning is in the stores that have opened in New York \u2013 and I'll mention them again \u2013 85th and Madison, 10 Waverly, Brookfield Place, and 9th and Broadway, a new store in Lake Forest, Illinois \u2013 what we're seeing, and it's early days, is that customers are moving their core beverages to the espresso bar. They're enjoying the opportunity to sit at the bar because of the theater and the romance of watching their beverage be made. And the ticket is going up. But it's early.","So this is an opportunity that we have to integrate those Reserve bars in many of the stores that are going to be naturally on a remodel cycle as well as open new stores from scratch. And then as I said earlier, the Reserve stores coupled with their Roastery is going to create an opportunity for the brand to be elevated with a lot of awareness and a lot of trial. So this is part of a comprehensive all-in strategy that, we believe, will create an incremental opportunity for profit and revenue as a result of this new brand and, as a result of that, shine a halo on the core brand of Starbucks. John, you want to add something?","John Winchester Culver - Starbucks Corp.","Yeah, I just want to add one thing, Joe. This is John Culver. What we saw in China and what we're seeing in the U.S. is really the enablement of the partner and customer connection, really come to life in a very special and unique way. And it really played out for us very clearly in China by the fact that a lot of the Chinese consumers didn't have a lot of education around coffee, and didn't have a lot of education around brewing methods, espresso-based beverages. And it's interesting to see in China how the customers gather around the bar, basically pull out their cell phones, take pictures, take videos and really we are educating customers one at a time in China around great tasting coffee and a great experience that Starbucks is able to provide.","You walk into New York City, we were there a couple weeks ago with Howard, and we saw firsthand a similar type of experience from the standpoint of the number of people sitting at the bar, wanting to interact with the baristas and really wanting to understand the various brewing methods. And it's really something that really elevates the experience, and the customer response has been incredible, number one. And even the partner engagement around this has been remarkable as well. So we're very positive and optimistic about what the future has for this for us.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Karen Holthouse from Goldman Sachs. Karen, your line is now open.","Karen Holthouse - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. China\/Asia Pacific comps came in a little bit lighter than I think what most folks were modeling. And in the past there's been I think a degree of seasonality to the China business related to changes in gifting practices. So just curious if you could help us understand sequentially how much of that trend was driven by China and within that maybe some seasonality to the comp? And what sort of gives you confidence that can reaccelerate? Thanks.","John Winchester Culver - Starbucks Corp.","Okay. Karen, this is John. Just real quick on China. Again, very optimistic about where we sit in the marketplace. We delivered a 6% comp in the market, far above any of our peer set in that environment over there. What we are seeing across China is just very strong acceptance for the Starbucks brand. You look at the number of customers that we're attracting into our stores. Our brand has never been stronger. And the customer engagement has never been stronger as well. So we're increasing frequency of existing customers, and we continue to attract new customers.","What you saw in Q4 was very similar to what we saw last Q4. Last Q4, last year we delivered a 6%. This quarter we delivered a 6% as well. There is some seasonality going from Q3 to Q4. We've seen that historically play out in China. I don't think you need to read anything into it other than the fact that our business there remains strong. We had record openings in terms of stores in the quarter in China, opening over 200 stores in the market. Our new store performance is the strongest it's ever been. Our average unit volumes, our return on investment, and our overall store level profitability remains best-in-class within the company. So very optimistic again about China and the opportunity that we have there to continue to grow. And the investments we're making on our people and the infrastructure are critical to the success going forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein from Barclays. Jeffrey, your line is now open.","Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thank you very much. I just had a question broadly on the U.S. comps. I know last quarter there was talk about the re-acceleration in trend to a 5% plus. I'm wondering if you were to look at that, maybe qualitatively, how much do you think was the elevated macro headwinds versus maybe any kind of internal headwinds that made it more challenging to hit that. And with that as a backdrop, and we've talked a lot about the broader macro challenges we're facing and starting the year kind of at the lower end of that range, so just wondering whether the mid-single-digit or better is still the best assumption to make once you get to a system your size? Or whether or not maybe we should just be tempering the expectation a little bit so it becomes less about the quarter-to-quarter of achieving a certain 5% or whatnot? I'm just wondering how you think about that holistically there. Or maybe just define what that mid-single-digit range actually means in terms of numbers?","Scott Harlan Maw - Starbucks Corp.","That's the easiest part. Mid-single-digits is 4% to 6%. I think what I would say, Jeffrey, as we started the quarter, we guided really on Americas to get to a 5% comp, and we got there. Obviously, as you know, and it's the nature of your question, the U.S. business is the biggest piece of that. What I would say is, with the Americas at 5% and the U.S. at 6% and minus 1%, it gives you an indication of exactly how close we were to 5% in the U.S. I don't want to split hairs. I'd much rather have a 5%. But clearly comps accelerated both in the U.S. and Americas from the third quarter and I think we feel pretty good about that, given the environment.","Kevin talked a little bit about what drove some of that acceleration. We had a really good summer around innovation including limited time offers, Teavana Iced Tea, we had a pretty good quarter in food and Frappuccino recovered a bit and helped us as well. So while we didn't quite get to 5% in the U.S., it was pretty close. And I think as we look forward, I think mid-single-digit comps, if you look at the U.S. comp in the first quarter, it's 9% and the global comp is 8%. And so I think it's just prudent for us to say there's a range in mid-single-digit comps for a reason. And I think in the first half with those types of compares and the backdrop we have, I think we're just thinking we're going to be at the lower-end of that range. And, of course, as always if we can beat it, we will.","Howard S. Schultz - Starbucks Corp.","Can I add one thing? Without putting anyone on the defensive and recognizing this is like the third rail, I would just ask you to consider that for a company our size and the track record that we have had domestically and now internationally, and as Kevin said in his remarks, the fact that our business went up on our scale during this quarter in every day-part. And if you look at our history of trying to do everything we can to really add shareholder value in everything we do, to just try and just take a step back every now and then and recognize that comp store sales, although we all recognize its importance, is not the driving force of a company that did $20 billion in revenue and $4 billion in operating profit and is adding a store a day in China and is on its way to building one of the most recognized and admired brands in the world. And yet, we're so focused on something that, yes, it is important and it is strategic, but it is not everything.","So just maybe every now and then recognize that we will have comps that will over-achieve and we'll have some comps that probably will disappoint. But we are here for the long game. This is a 24th year of our public life. The company had a market cap of $250 million at that point. It's at almost $80 billion today. And it's just the beginning. So maybe every now and then just recognize we're all in this together and comps is not the end all of everything.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matthew DiFrisco from Guggenheim. Matthew, your line is now open.","Matthew DiFrisco - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Thank you. And I appreciate that commentary you gave on the comps. Actually, my question is with respect to that a little bit and the 2,100 stores, I would think a couple years ago you did point out that you mentioned three years ago about the changing dynamic and you spoke also about the changing in traffic for the consumer out there. I guess the 2,100 stores does sound like a very good number, a very strong number on a global basis. I wonder can you talk about that as far as what are the different type of \u2013 you talked about highest volumes in some of these markets as well. What is the biggest driver behind that? Is it the new products you're doing now? Is it the mobile app? Can you give us some color on what do you think is behind? Is it better real estate sites? Have you changed the way you select these sites on a global basis?","Scott Harlan Maw - Starbucks Corp.","Yeah, thanks for the question, Matt. I'll give it a shot. I think if you go back five years ago or so into the mid-2000s when we were opening our highest number of stores, most of those stores were company-owned stores in the U.S. I want to say it was something like 80%. And now you look at where we're opening our stores today with 60% of those stores coming in markets outside of the U.S., two-thirds of those stores are licensed stores. And even end markets like China and the U.S. where we're opening significant numbers of company-owned stores, we're using different formats as we go into markets. And so, drive-thrus remain well over 50% of our stores.","So we're going into different real estate than we were back then. We have smaller footprint stores. We have the larger footprint stores including Reserve bars that Howard talked about. So the toolset that we're using as we build stores out, both from a product offering standpoint with Reserve and flexibility for our customers with drive-thrus in international markets really helps us gain confidence with our store growth.","Howard S. Schultz - Starbucks Corp.","I would add one other thing. And as Kevin said in his remarks, the fact that on our base for the new store performance this year, both in the U.S. and China, the best performing class of new stores in our history. And then the other thing I'd say is we're opening stores now in places that 10 years ago, even five years ago, I don't think we would have considered. And we were in Inglewood outside of Chicago last week. We've opened in Jamaica, Queens and, of course, we're so proud of the fact that we've opened in Ferguson, Missouri. In all these cases, the stores are performing at or above plan as we recognize more than ever that there's a lot of white space and opportunities to extend the reach of Starbucks. So I don't know, Kevin, if you want to add anything?","Kevin R. Johnson - Starbucks Corp.","Yeah, I think the strength of the brand and the fact there's latent demand in these markets for Starbucks. And so, we're very thoughtful about where we locate these stores. And the teams have put together a number of tools and things to ensure we're being thoughtful about where we locate stores but when we locate them, there's demand for those stores that shows up very quickly. And it's not cannibalizing existing stores. And that just shows that there's more customers we can reach and if we're thoughtful about how we do it, it strengthens the brand and strengthens the connection with the customer.","John Winchester Culver - Starbucks Corp.","Yeah, and I would just add that going back to what we learned during the transformation in 2007 and 2008, we've put in all new processes and all new ways in which we're evaluating real estate, evaluating new stores, monitoring the progress and making sure that they are in fact meeting the customer demand that's out there, the latent demand that Kevin spoke about. In addition, I would also say that the level of innovation from a product standpoint that we're bringing into our stores has never been stronger.","And so you look at Cold Brew, you look at Nitro, you look at Teavana, you look at some of the food gains that we've had. We continue to innovate and then add in the digital footprint and being relevant to our customers from a digital standpoint. We are engaging our customers more now than we ever have, and the stores or that place where they come for their favorite Starbucks beverage each and every day.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nicole Miller from Piper Jaffray. Nicole, your line is now open.","Nicole Miller Regan - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Thank you. Good afternoon. I want to understand a little bit more about the CPG trends with \u2013 and, again, an amazing operating margin there. Can you talk about the organic top-line growth from existing and new relationships and what kind of leverage that provides to operating margin? And then when you think about the grocery store price inflation or deflation, how does that impact operating margin and is the volume growth still outpacing revenue growth? Thank you.","Michael Conway - Starbucks Corp.","Hi, there. This is Mike Conway. I'll take that question. So from a top-line perspective, we're feeling good about the top-line performance that we've had certainly this quarter. If you look at our growth as measured by IRI both for our key businesses, Roast and Ground and K-Cup, we're up 8%. We're actually growing at a pace double that in the category. And that's really behind, number one, our strong brand. Number two, the great execution that we have on our holiday programs or LTL like Fall Blend and our innovation, and innovation that we have to come. So we feel very good about the kind of growth and share that we've been able to drive.","And what I would say is that volume versus the price, our volume and price growth are fairly close which means that we've been able to really get the right balance of promotional pricing, base pricing in the marketplace and we feel good about that. If you look at that and the margin expansion that we've been able to realize in the quarter, I think that's kind of the right balance for us, to continue to grow both the category, grow our brand and also drive share.","Kevin R. Johnson - Starbucks Corp.","Let me just add to Mike's comments. Nicole, this is Kevin. The CPG business, in many ways, is about scale economics. And so certainly the more we're gaining share in the grocery and mass merchants that we sell to, the more efficient we are at delivering that product. So that's helping. Number two, I'll remind you that we renegotiated our agreement with Keurig and so we've got favorable K-Cup tolling fees which are also helping. So there's a variety of things that are contributing to that but I think the strength of the brand and the share gains that we continue to get for at-home coffee, Roast and Ground as well as K-Cup and establishing Starbucks as the number one share player in premium Roast and Ground and K-Cups is a big part of that.","Operator","And your last question comes from the line of Matt McGinley from Evercore ISI. Matt, your line is now open.","Matthew Robert McGinley - Evercore ISI","Thank you. My question's on the free cash generation this year in...","Howard S. Schultz - Starbucks Corp.","We can't hear you.","Matthew Robert McGinley - Evercore ISI","Can you hear me now?","Howard S. Schultz - Starbucks Corp.","Can you speak up a little louder?","Matthew Robert McGinley - Evercore ISI","Sure. Can you hear me?","Howard S. Schultz - Starbucks Corp.","Yes.","Matthew Robert McGinley - Evercore ISI","Sorry about that. So my question is on the free cash generation over 2016 and the cash balance you had at the year end. You had a very good step-up in that ability to generate cash in 2016. It was about $1 billion higher versus last year. So my question is how much of that step-up in the cash generation was driven by durable increases in cash conversion relative to more one-time things, like a 53rd week, or favorable year-end timing on working capital or things like that? I think the margin commentary that you gave for 2017 made it seem like that is probably durable. But I'm curious if those balances are as good as they look?","Scott Harlan Maw - Starbucks Corp.","Yeah, the vast majority of the increase in cash is due to the core operating cash flow of the business. So that's a good thing.","Matthew Robert McGinley - Evercore ISI","Anything else?","Scott Harlan Maw - Starbucks Corp.","No.","Thomas Shaw - Starbucks Corp.","All right.

Howard?","Howard D. Schultz","Thank you, JoAnn and good afternoon everyone. I\u2019m pleased to report the record third quarter results that Starbucks announced today, reflecting 19% EPS growth, 13% revenue growth, 7% U.S. comp growth and 6% global comp growth. While these numbers reflect a very strong quarter and on their own merit will be viewed positively. The fact is they fell short of our expectations, while unacceptable for me personally, and I can assure you to all of us at Starbucks, the quarter does however demonstrate the strength of Starbucks business and brand around the world and provide insight into the enormity of the global opportunity that lies ahead for all of us.","With nearly 18,000 stores in 60 countries serving 60 million customers every week coupled with a rapidly growing, highly profitable, consumer packaged goods business. Starbucks today is a true multichannel global retailer that is both uniquely and ideally positioned to continue delivering solid, top, and bottom line performance to our shareholders into the future.","Our record Q3 EPS of $0.43 represented a 19% increase over last year\u2019s then record $0.36 per share and reflected the success of multiple innovative Channel Development initiatives and the continued profitable growth in our business in the key Americas and China and Asia-Pacific regions where comp growth was 7% and 12% respectively.","I\u2019m particularly pleased with the increasing operating leverage we are seeing, demonstrated by 120 basis point increase in our operating margin over last year and a 19% increase in EPS on a 13% increase in sales to a Q3 record of $3.3 billion in sales. All this translated into our 11th consecutive quarter of record operating results.","Noteworthy is that we achieved our Q3 results despite high legacy commodity costs, primarily coffee, in a challenging, economic, and consumer headwind in most of the markets in which we operate. We fully expect the operating leverage unique to our business model to enable us to continue driving EPS growth in excess of revenue growth over the long run.","While the record performance we reported today demonstrates our ability to continue driving significant consistent revenue and earnings growth, as with many leading restaurant retailers and consumer brands reporting earnings over the last few weeks, the fragile global economy, uncertainty in Europe, high unemployment in the U.S., a resumed decline in home sales and further diminished consumer confidence did have an impact on our business in Q3. Nonetheless, we are responsible for positively navigating through the uncertain economic climate we are operating in today and I assure you we are and will continue to do so.","In a few minutes, Troy will share more detail around our Q3 performance, discuss adjustments we have made to our Q4 targets in response to the current environment and share our FY 2013 outlook. But first I want to lay out a few of the steps we are taking to navigate through today\u2019s headwinds, including redoubling our efforts to examine all facets of our business and make certain that we are operating and executing with maximum efficiency, maintaining a laser focus on cost, deepening our connection with consumers and delivering an enhanced experience to our customers around the world.","To best accomplish these key objectives, in Q1, we moved to a three-region global business model in which the Americas, China-Asia Pacific, and EMEA regions are each headed by seasoned Starbucks leaders; Cliff Burrows, John Culver and Michelle Gass respectively, each of whom has more than 10 years with the Company and reports directly to me.","Our new business model has enabled us to decentralize the operations, eliminate redundancies in support center and regional operations, become more locally relevant, and improve Starbucks\u2019 execution on the ground in each of the markets around the world in which we compete and we are already beginning to see the tangible benefits of our ongoing decentralization initiatives with stabilization of both top line and bottom line performance in the EMEA region. as customer-facing initiatives and cost-control measures initiated by the team have taken effect, and as the team pursues opportunities to optimize our EMEA store portfolio.","I\u2019m confident that our increasingly more responsive and nimble three-region global business structure positions Starbucks to operate with the clarity, the flexibility and the customer centricity required to respond to current and the future headwinds and to drive sustained long-term profitable growth across our business and around the world.","Now succeeding today and in the future however, it will take much more than laser-focused execution and cost discipline. It will require a bold and relevant innovation. As we prepare for the holiday season and accelerate its store growth in fiscal 2013, we do so with a robust pipeline of innovation, highlighted by the much anticipated introduction of Verismo and on the heels of exciting recent new product introductions.","Let me highlight a few examples for you. Leverage a proprietary breakthrough innovation that features natural green coffee extract. This month we will have Starbucks Refreshers through more than 10,800 Starbucks stores in the U.S. and in 15 international markets. Starbucks Refreshers represents Starbucks entry into the $8 billion energy drink category, the fastest growing category in measured CPG channels that was up 16% in last year alone. Besides representing a fantastic new product platform, Refreshers is the most recent example of our blueprint for profitable growth in action.","Let me explain. We simultaneously launched the product globally and multiple channels of distribution including handcrafted ready to drink and VIA versions in our stores and ready to drink in VIA versions through over 50,000 points of CPG distribution all supported by a national advertising campaign.","Earlier reports suggest that Refreshers are proving to be a big hit with our consumers through both in-store and CPG channel sales. As you know, earlier in this fiscal year, we acquired Evolution Fresh with a strategic intent to build the national health and wellness brand and revolutionalize the fresh juice business.","We have been very encouraged by customer response to our first Evolution Fresh retail store in Bellevue, Washington, and just last week, we opened our second of Evolution Fresh store this one in Downtown Seattle. We also announced plans to open an additional store in San Francisco later this year and now have plans to build a new juice manufacturing facility in Southern California that will have four to five times of production and packaging capability of the current Evolution Fresh facility.","We now offer Evolution Fresh ready-to-drink juices in over 800 stores in Seattle, Los Angeles, and San Diego and have plans to double that number in the coming months as sales are exceeding our own internal expectations. Starbucks\u2019 $1.5 billion of food program in our U.S. company-owned stores is an important part of our core business that has grown at double-digit pace in each of the last two fiscal years and over the first two quarters of this year.","With roughly one-third of all transactions now having a food attachment, our food program represents a significant opportunity for us to continue growing our business across multiple channels into the future. and with the La Boulange transaction now completed, we have already begun the journey of bringing wholesome and delicious unique, fresh and French baked food to the U.S. marketplace in way similar to how Starbucks first brought romance of the Italian espresso bar to many North American coffee consumers.","Customers will first see the new bakery offerings in our San Francisco Bay Area stores with other markets following over time. We\u2019ll be sharing more about our plans for La Boulange in the months ahead. As I said before, evolving, social and digital media platforms and highly innovative and relevant mobile payment capabilities are causing seismic changes in consumer behavior and creating equally seismic disruptive opportunities for business.","Starbucks identified the power of mobile payment capabilities earlier than most retailers, restaurants, and consumer brands, and now have processed over 55 million transactions since launching it in January 2011. and today, we operate one of the world\u2019s largest mobile payment programs processing over 1 million mobile transactions per week in the U.S. alone.","Starbucks is committed to innovating and extending our leadership position in mobile payment technologies and in Q3, we launched the Starbucks mobile payment app for Android in Canada and the U.K. further extending the mobile payment experience to 14,000 Starbucks locations. But with smartphones representing less than 20% of the 6.1 billion mobile phone subscriptions worldwide, we know that the world is only in a very early nascent stages of the mobile payment revolution.","Starbucks digital team led by Adam Brotman has a clear line of sight on next-generation mobile payment technologies, and is deep into developing strategies to integrate next-generation capabilities into our global mobile payment program in ways that will materially enhance and deepen our connection to our customers around the world and give us a significant competitive advantage in the marketplace going forward.","In Q3, Starbucks opened 231 net new stores around the world, including our 600th store in mainland China and our first stores in each of Costa Rica and Finland. With these openings, Starbucks is well on its way to opening the 1,000 net new stores we committed to opening in 2012. I am pleased to announce today that Starbucks will open an additional 1,200 net new stores in fiscal 2013, primarily in the U.S. and the China and Asia-Pacific regions. John Culver, President of Starbucks China and Asia-Pacific will be speaking shortly about the continued momentum in China and provide you with an update on the progress of our very exciting plans to open our first stores in India later this year.","Coffee will remain at the core of everything we do as we grow our business around the world and into the future. I\u2019m particularly proud of the fact that cumulative sales within our Channel Development, CPG segment, led by President, Jeff Hansberry, that primarily includes our consumer packaged and soluble coffee products has reached $1 billion earlier this month for the first time in our 41-year history. And at the premium coffee segment of the coffee industry, a segment Starbucks created, now accounts for over 50% of total coffee U.S. sales through grocery and drug and mass channels according to IRI.","This is a very important statistic in fact I want to share with you. With a 28.2% share of premium coffee in these channels, up from 25.6% last year, Starbucks is a definitive premium coffee category leader. We are continuing to distance and differentiate ourselves from competitors by driving relevant innovation across both the Starbucks and the Seattle\u2019s Best brands including VIA, Blonde Roast, K-Cup and our new roasting architecture that makes it easier for customers to select their favorite coffee strength.","Starbucks will continue to play a leading role with the expansion of new forms and flavors in VIA and K-Cups. and we are already the second largest player in the premium single-cup market with Starbucks K-Cups continuing to make good progress against our volume distribution, and share growth plans and have already shipped more than 350 million K-Cups since last November\u2019s launch. We are anticipating further growth of our premium single-cup business with the availability of Starbucks branded Vue packs for Green Mountain's new Keurig Vue brewer this fall.","Finally, I could not be more enthused and excited about the launch of the Verismo System by Starbucks, our premium single-cup category innovation that will be a game changer for the single-cup industry and available for sale in time for the holiday season, shopping season.","Verismo produces the highest quality, best tasting, and in-home or in-office single-serve espresso and coffee beverages anywhere bar none and is the first and only single-serve machine that uses pods made from real milk and delivers beverage quality and versatility meeting Starbucks exacting standards. Verismo machines and pods will initially be available in Starbucks retail stores as well as through select specialty and department stores in the U.S. and Canada through retail channels and targeted European markets and on starbucksstore.com. Commitments and initial orders from retailers for the holiday season have exceeded even our most optimistic expectations, and obviously bode well for the holiday seasons.","In closing, I\u2019d like to thank our partners around the world for all they do to bring the Starbucks Experience to life for our customers. The record results we shared today would not be possible without their passion, dedication, and commitment to making the perfect beverage for every customer, everyday one cup at a time.","I want to ensure our partners and shareholders that our experience over the past four years has provided us with the muscle memory, the discipline, and the leadership to successfully navigate through any economic conditions that need come our way now or in the future.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Troy.","Troy Alstead","Thanks, Howard, and good afternoon, every one. Our fiscal third quarter results extend or run of record earnings to 11 consecutive quarters, and more importantly reflect a steady profit progression as we continue to grow traffic domestically, expand our retail footprint internationally and innovate in our Channel Development business.","Howard spoke to the unprecedented external challenges that currently faced retailers, yet we continue to get consumers reasons for coming back to our stores and other reasons to try Starbucks for the first time. Whether its new offerings that resonate with customers in that service, our store partners provide or rewards that holds great value during fragile times like these. We continue to thoughtfully press forward on our blue print for profitable growth with great success.","Today, I\u2019ll provide more contexts on our third quarter performance as well as update you on our full year projection, then I\u2019ll provide our initial outlook for fiscal 2013. Third quarter revenues grew to $3.3 billion, 13% higher than a year ago. Our 6% global comps were the largest driver of the growth with continued progress in our Channel Development business also contributing.","Operating income of $492 million was 22% higher than last year, and 14% higher than last quarter. We\u2019re seeing sales leverage continue to increase, while the high commodity cost that had been so impactful on our P&L over the past two years are easing.","Commodity, primarily coffee still had a negative impact on our Q3 operating income of $38 million and 110 basis points on margin. but as anticipated that is lower than the first and second quarters and we expect the impact to further lessen in fourth quarter.","Earnings per share grew 19% to a Q3 record of $0.43. This was $0.01 below the revised target range we provided in early June largely due to slowing in June in the U.S., which I\u2019ll come back to in a moment. Despite that slowing in June, our Americas business continued to produce strong results in the third quarter.","Net revenues of $2.5 billion were 9% higher than the third quarter of last year driven by comparable store sales growth of 7% in our company-operated stores and 24% revenue growth in our licensed stores. The comp store sales growth was comprised of 5% growth in transaction and a 2% increase in average ticket.","Continuing the recent trend, transaction growth was driven by contributions from our still-growing warming program, incrementalities from Blonde Roast and increasing throughput efficiencies in the busy morning daypart. The 24% licensed store revenue growth was driven by new products, pricing, and same-store sales growth. The continued success of our licensed operations gives us confidence as we continue to expand our licensed store portfolio in our Americas segment and throughout the world.","Specific to the U.S., third quarter comparable store sales grew 7% driven by 5% growth in traffic. Our U.S. stores produced record transaction levels this quarter, including consistent growth across all dayparts demonstrating that the initiatives to grow mid-day and afternoon traffic are producing results, while the initiatives to expand our tea daypart continue to gain traction. But as mentioned a moment ago, we did see slowing in June amid a weakening consumer environment.","Traffic trends are noticeably down in many areas across the U.S. and the soft traffic trends have continued in July. Americas operating income grew by 14% in the quarter with operating margin expanding by 90 basis points to 20.7%, despite the negative 70 basis point impact of higher commodity cost. Sales leverage drove the improvement in the third quarter.","Despite the recent softening in the U.S., our Americas business continues to produce outstanding returns. The pipeline of innovation, as Howard took you through in his comments is a deep source of opportunity, and will be a key driver of our future results. Our partners are positioned to seamlessly execute on these initiatives just as they have done with Blonde Roast and with Refreshers, and we will continue to give our customers great products, great experiences, and great value.","Moving now to the Europe, Middle East and Africa region where the third quarter results reflect a beginning of stabilization in that region even in the face of difficult conditions. We\u2019re starting to see the benefit of the consumer initiatives we put in place. Espresso sales are strengthening as we focused on proving to customers that we have the best latte on the high street. Our stores look better than ever as we\u2019ve renovated 70 stores in London so far this year and are ready to show our progress to the world during the Olympics. While we recognize that this turnaround will not be a quick one, the early indicators are encouraging.","Revenues for the third quarter in EMEA grew 9%, largely driven by the consolidation of results from the acquisition of our Switzerland and Austria markets last August. Our same-store sales were flat to last year\u2019s third quarter, despite a persistent underlying economic instability in those markets. We did see continued growth in our markets in Central and Eastern Europe and the Middle East, which have fared much better than those in Western Europe.","Operating income of $2.6 million was down from $4.9 million last year, and margin of 0.9% declined 100 basis points from last year\u2019s Q3, due largely to transition costs related to the new distribution model we began rolling out in the UK earlier this fiscal year. That transition is now nearly complete, and we look forward to the efficiencies and improvements it will bring both to our stores and on our P&L in fiscal \u201813.","One of the many components of our Renaissance Plan, our plan to profitably transform the EMEA business, it is optimizing our portfolio, both through active management of store real estate and through optimum market equity positioning. This portfolio optimization is even more important given the continued economic uncertainty in the region and we are currently conducting a more thorough portfolio review with related actions planning for Europe. This is similar to the work we did several years ago in our U.S. business, which left us with a much healthier store portfolio. As a result, we may revise our equity position in certain geographies and potentially close more stores in Europe over the next few quarters beginning in the fourth quarter.","Depending on the outcome of the evaluation work we\u2019re doing, it is possible that we might incur additional charges in the fourth quarter related to the store portfolio work. While we don\u2019t yet have a final determination of numbers of stores to close, I anticipate any potential charges in Q4 related to the store closures and to the many other initiatives in place to transform EMEA will be less than $20 million with perhaps up to an additional $10 million during the first half of 2013. As in the U.S. several years ago, targeted closures of unprofitable stores and the resulting stronger portfolio will enhance our ability to deliver more consistent earnings growth in EMEA.","I\u2019d like to now shift the discussion to China and Asia\/Pacific, and the President of that region John Culver is here to take you through those results.","John Culver","Thanks, Troy. Good afternoon everyone. I\u2019m pleased to be joining the call today to discuss the record results for the China and Asia\/Pacific regions. Our fastest growing regions made up of 12 markets more than 3,000 stores and nearly 50,000 partners who serve more than 9 million customers per week. As you can see from our results, the growth story in China and Asia\/Pacific is becoming a meaningful component of the Starbucks growth story. The region continues to expand its contribution to total company profitability raising from 9% two years ago to nearly 13% this year-to-date.","Today, we have a balanced portfolio driven by four significant geographies within the region. Each of these is in their own stage of growth led by the rapid expansion of China, our future second home market and including our partnerships in Japan, Korea and throughout Southeast Asia. This region has produced strong double-digit comps for 10 consecutive quarters, and while these levels are moderating to a more sustainable pace. I continue to have great confidence about our future performance given the investment we\u2019ve made in our strong new store returns.","Before I focus on our future, let me walk you through our third quarter results. Our financial performance met our high expectations as we delivered another strong quarter in the 30s. That is revenue growth of 31%, coupled with operating income growth of 37% and an operating profit margin of nearly 34%. These strong results were delivered while we continue to invest in a focused and disciplined way to further fuel the future growth for the region.","On the revenue side of the equation as expected, we are evolving to a more balanced revenue growth model as quarterly comps normalized to the low to mid teen levels in the near-term. This natural shift is occurring as the business moves from a heavy reliance upon comparable store sales growth to a balance of growth from comps and unit expansion in both our high-return company-owned markets and within our profitable well-capitalized partnership markets. Our 12% comps this quarter were driven by an 8% increase in transactions as well as expansion of our average ticket. Driving his outstanding performance is a growing brand awareness across all of our markets.","Now, there are few things we\u2019re reinforcing relative to our business performance in the third quarter. Two year comps are at a phenomenal 38% actually rising from what we posted in the second quarter. Our company-operated average unit volumes across the region are expected to end the year at approximately $850,000, up 71% from just three years ago. In China, despite headlines centering around an economic slowdown, our same-store sales continued to grow by double-digits yet again in the third quarter. This was against the backdrop of a very difficult comparative last year.","Additionally, customer service scores in China and in fact throughout the region reached an all-time high in the quarter, and in the 15 months since the My Starbucks Rewards program was introduced in China, over 700,000 customers have embraced the program. That\u2019s more than 1,200 members per store, roughly three times the level of the U.S. programs.","Given these highlights, and the acceptance we\u2019re seeing everyday with consumers across the regions, we continue to be extremely confident in our ability to drive strong same-store sales growth, while at the same time continuing to grow our store base even more aggressively.","Operating income and GAAP was also strong increasing 37% to $61 million in the third quarter. Operating margin grew 140 basis points to 33.8% as we continue to gain leverage on sales. Partially offsetting the growth and income were costs associated with our rapid pace of growth in new stores and the investments in infrastructure we are making across the region.","Our local teams continue to do an excellent job, the flow in our growing revenue through to the bottom line to display inflationary pressure. And as a result, we now are expected to finish fiscal 2012 with operating margins at the high end of our previously stated range of 30% to 35%.","Let me now be more specific regarding the future prospects of a few key markets. In China, we\u2019ve been aggressive about our plans to capture more of the massive potential of that market. With high-store margins and low-store penetration given the size of the country we are in the very early stages of what we think this market can ultimately reach.","We are targeting 1,500 stores on the mainland by 2015. That\u2019s a compounded growth rate of 34% from today. I\u2019m pleased to report that we are making excellent progress towards that target as we opened 42 new stores in Q3, nearly twice the amount we opened in Q3 a year-ago. We\u2019ll ramp that number up significantly in the fourth quarter continuing to be on track to open 200 stores by the end of the year. As Howard mentioned earlier, I would like to congratulate the China team on the opening of the 600 store. This is yet another exciting milestone in our growth plans for the market.","To support our future growth ambition in China, we\u2019ve established a solid talent acquisition and management pipeline. We\u2019ve hired more than 1,400 new retail partners this quarter compared with 900 in Q2, and we continue to prioritize the development of our people, investing more than 41,000 hours in training in Q3 compared with 35,000 hours in Q2. We\u2019ve also built local capabilities to lead important areas of our business, like store designs, product innovation, and research and development. We know that our 10,000 Chinese partners will continue to be a significant competitive differentiator for us in defining our long-term success.","Let me now turn for a moment to our single biggest contributor to the outstanding regional profitability reported today, Japan. Our first market outside of North America, Japan continued to provide a solid foundation upon which the region is built. Our business in Japan is extremely healthy and as we approach our 1,000 store in this market, we continue to remain confident about its future growth prospects.","Beyond China and Japan, we are profitable in every other single country in which we operate. I\u2019m particularly encouraged by our strong results and aggressive growth plans in key geographies like Korea, Thailand, Singapore and Indonesia. India also represents a significant growth opportunity in the future for the company. Our plans to open our first store in India this year with our business partner Tata remains on track.","In closing, I\u2019m incredibly proud and want to recognize all of our partners throughout the China and Asia\/Pacific region for the significant contribution they have made to our success. Our record Q3 results demonstrate why we believe this region represents the largest and fastest retail growth opportunity for the company in the foreseeable future.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over Troy to discuss the results from Channel Development. Troy?","Troy Alstead","Thanks John. Channel Development had another stellar quarter and we\u2019re beginning to see many of the complementary offerings within this business come together to drive growth. Revenue grew 45% in the third quarter to $316 million, up nearly $100 million over last Q3.","Starbucks K-Cups which continued to grow share and distribution were the largest driver of the year-over-year increase. As Howard mentioned premium coffee is now the largest segment of the coffee markets with premium single-cup making up nearly 20% of the market. Starbucks though our K-Cup and VIA offering commands a nearly 22% share of the premium single-cup space. In the coming months, we\u2019ll add Verismo to our product line up and is quickly expanding market.","In the third quarter, we also saw meaningful growth in packaged coffee. Remember, we transitioned this business in-house more than a year-ago in March of 2011. So the increase in packaged coffee revenue this quarter was real year-over-year of sales growth. Including Seattle\u2019s Best Coffee, nearly 32% of sales of premium packaged coffee in food, drug and mass channels in the third quarter belonged to Starbucks. That share is increasing and reflects the success we\u2019ve had with the direct distribution model and the contribution from innovations such as Blonde Roast.","Operating income for Channel Development in the third quarter was $86 million, a 25% increase over the same quarter last year, resulting in operating margin of 27.3% despite higher commodity cost which added 500 basis points of pressure in the quarter.","We continue to be enthusiastic about the growth of our Channel Development business is driving, and how it\u2019s contributing to our bottom line. In fact because of the results through the first three quarters of fiscal 2012, we are now targeting Channel Development margin slightly above our previous guidance of 25% for the full-year.","Before I move into the outlook for 2013, I want to provide an update on how we expect to finish fiscal 2012. Recognizing the continued deterioration in the macro environment that all retailers face along the trends from June and July, we now expect revenue growth from the fourth quarter of between 10% to 12%. We continue to expect mid single-digit comp growth, with continued strong growth in Channel Development also contributing to the revenue increase.","We\u2019re also revising our earnings per share guidance in light of current trends. We now expect earnings per share of $0.44 to $0.45 in the fourth quarter that represents earnings growth of between 19% and 22% over the prior fourth quarter non-GAAP results, despite the fragile global economy, challenging consumer environment and still unfavorable commodity costs. Note that any potential charges that might become necessary related to the Europe\u2019s store portfolio work I discussed earlier are not reflected in the Q4 earnings target.","Now, as we look ahead to fiscal 2013, we\u2019re charting a path to another year of strong growth. We expect revenue growth in the range of 10% to 13% driven by mid single-digit comp growth, approximately at 1,200 net new stores and continued strength in Channel Development. The 1,200 net new stores represent 20% acceleration in new store developments. Roughly half of our net new stores will come from the Americas with majority of those in the U.S. where new stores continue to produce very solid returns.","Licensed stores represent half of the 600 openings. In China and Asia\/Pacific we\u2019re targeting approximately 500 net new stores in fiscal \u201813, a 25% increase over fiscal \u201812 with more than half in China. Roughly two-thirds of CAP\u2019s 500 net new stores will be licensed. In EMEA, it consistent with fiscal 2012, we will open approximately 100 net new stores with roughly two-thirds have been licensed. The growth in new stores combined with additions in production capacity to support recently announced initiatives means an increase in capital expenditures, which we project at approximately $1 billion in fiscal \u201813. As a percentage of revenue that is consistent with our projected FY \u201812 spend.","Full-year consolidated operating margin is expected to grow by approximately 500 to 100 basis points over fiscal \u201812 as we continue to drive leverage. Earnings per share growth in fiscal \u201813 is expected in our target range of 15% to 20% or EPS of between $2.04 and $2.14. Given the uncertainty in the macro environment, we will update our estimate as we move on throughout the year.","With regard to coffee, we are virtually locked for fiscal \u201813 at prices favorable for 2012. We\u2019ve also begun purchasing into fiscal \u201814 and we\u2019ll continue to do so as prices dip to opportunistic levels as dictated by our internal analytics. Coffee cost will finally be a tailwind in 2013.","Dairy costs, however, are now expected to be meaningfully higher in fiscal \u201813. Dairy is a much smaller portion of our overall cost of goods than coffee, so while the impact will offset some of the coffee benefit, there will remain a net (inaudible) benefit to P&L of approximately $100 million in 2013.","Further as I\u2019ve indicated before, we expect increased investments in a number of areas in 2013, totaling potentially up to $50 million. These investments include our Global Leadership Conference scheduled in October and expected to cost approximately $35 million and potential additional investments to accelerate growth in Brazil and China and did better position at EMEA business for future earnings growth and margin improvements.","We expect our recent acquisitions of La Boulange and Evolution Fresh to be modestly dilutive to earnings in fiscal \u201813 as we continue to invest in testing and rollout in our stores. These impacts are factored into the targets I\u2019ve already discussed. And finally, our fiscal 2013 tax rate is expected to remain low at approximately 33%.","As we\u2019ve laid out for you today, Starbucks has much in front of us in the coming quarter and year. Our focus is sharp, our growth ambition is high and the opportunity is vast. We\u2019re actively making the right moves to improve our immediate economics, while building diverse sustainable growth channels that will drive long-term shareholder value.","As within a growth story, the path will not always be a straight one; economic slowdown, high expectations and many other challenges will arise along the way. But this is an entrepreneurial company and we\u2019ve become very good at cutting through that noise and focusing on the end goals; the goal that sees our coffee as the undisputed, unmatched favor across the globe. The goal that sees us as a clear cut leader in innovation and customer experience, while building a growing and vital, social and digital realm, the goal that sees our customers as the most loyal, most enthusiastic and most satisfied in our space, and the goal that leads to a sustained long-term growth in earnings and in shareholder value.","We\u2019ve discussed a great deal today and I\u2019m sure there are many questions. With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to the operator for Q&A. Latonia?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Joe Buckley with Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch.","","Howard D. Schultz","","Hello. Operator, I can\u2019t hear the question?","Joseph Buckley \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Hello.","","Howard D. Schultz","","Yep.","Joseph Buckley \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","","Hi, can you hear me now?","Howard D. Schultz","","Yes, we can hear you Joe, go ahead.","Joseph Buckley \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Okay, sorry about that. Troy, could you reconcile the comments about slowing U.S. growth and yet I think for the fourth quarter, you\u2019re still focusing mid-single digit comps and that doesn\u2019t seeing different from what you\u2019re saying in terms of guidance for the third quarter, and the 7% number you just registered for the third quarter looked quite good, so I guess I\u2019m little bit confused on the comment about the slowing U.S. numbers and then the mid-single digit comp growth forecast for the fourth quarter and for fiscal '13?","Troy Alstead","Thanks Joe. Here is how I would distinguish that is, we have been at the top end and even occasionally in quarters over the past couple of years above the mid-single digit range and comp growth as you know, and that continued with our 7% comp growth in the U.S. in the third quarter. As we moved into June, we continue to remain in that mid-single digit range, but not quite at the top end of it as or above it as we have been in recent quarter. So, as we move into the fourth quarter, it's important for me to just emphasize that we still expect to grow traffic in our stores. We still expect to expand margins in our business. We expect a very healthy improving AUV in our stores to record levels this year. All that will continue, now that's changed, but the growth trajectory is just slightly lower than that top end of that target range for that I\u2019ve been talking about for quite some time.","Joseph Buckley \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Okay. And is that the principal driver then behind the slower overall revenue growth or are there other factors that we should think about?","Troy Alstead","That's all \u2013 the revenue growth that we\u2019ve retargeted for Q4 really is driven by that uncertainty that we're seeing in the month of June and in July in our U.S. business, and that's really driving that change right now. We continue to expect very strong growth in our Channels Development business as we move into the fourth quarter. China, Asia Pacific, the freight train continues rolling, perhaps even accelerating as we saw in the two year comp growth numbers in the third quarter. We've begun to be encouraged by the turnaround we're starting to see early days up in Europe. So, things are firing quite nicely for us, and we just have seen a bit of a downturn in the U.S. and we're cautious about that.","Joseph Buckley \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Okay, thank you.","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from the line of Sharon Zackfia with William Blair.","Sharon Zackfia \u2013 William Blair","Hi, good afternoon. I just wanted to ask actually a two-pronged question. First on the slowdown you're seeing in the U.S., just wondering if that's pretty broad based, or if you've seen it more in the afternoon. It seemed like the last slowdown, you saw more discretionary spending in your afternoon day-part. And then secondarily on the new store development, it just seems like you're a little bit behind on company-owned development in the U.S. There\u2019s a lot that has to open here in the fourth quarter, so could you talk to us about the pipeline and your comfort in accelerating that into 2013?","Troy Alstead","Sure, Sharon. First of all on the pipeline, we have very high expectations for the number of stores that we'll open in this fourth quarter. It is quite a lot have been coming here very shortly. We\u2019re extremely confident in targets we\u2019ve laid out for store growth targets this year in all our geographies. And in fact, over the last two to three years with outstanding new store economics we\u2019ve been producing across our geographies in the Americas and in China\/Asia-Pacific we\u2019ve been deepening our capabilities, deepening our governance, deepening our analytics, all preparing for this acceleration that we\u2019re in the midst of right now. So we have a very, very healthy new store pipeline as we begin to move through this fourth quarter and into fiscal 2013 and great confidence in our ability to meet or exceed that target next year.","In terms of the moderate, and I just want to emphasize the word moderate, traffic slowdown as we moved into June, it was really very broad-based. There's no individual part of the business or day-part that we can point to. There is no geography across the U.S. we can point to. There seem to have been just very broad-based overarching change in the consumer feel. Again, we continue to grow traffic very healthily in that June period. Just not quite at the \u2013 and as rapid a pace as we had in the periods prior to that.","Sharon Zackfia \u2013 William Blair","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Michael Kelter with Goldman Sachs.","Michael Kelter \u2013 Goldman Sachs","","Thank you. I guess you are guiding to 15% to 20% EPS growth next year, and I guess my question is how can you have confidence, and how come we have confidence in that given it was hard to forecast this quarter with only three weeks left in the quarter when you last spoke publicly. I mean why not take a more conservative approach towards \u201813 or do you feel like 15% to 20% is being conservative for \u201913, and if so, why?","Howard Schultz","Michael, I think that we believe strongly that 15% to 20% is achievable. I want to be careful not to say it\u2019s conservative. I don\u2019t think it is, but it takes a great deal of work across all our business to deliver that kind of consistent steady growth. What surprised us in Q3 was a very quick change in the month of June that even at the beginning of June had not really begun to be apparent to us. And so that did lead to us being surprised by how the quarter ended as we've said earlier.","But given everything we see today, even with these trends in place, given what we know is coming in terms of product innovation, given our confidence in the holiday period that we have coming up, giving the momentum we have in China\/Asia Pacific, the improving turnaround that we are seeing the early signs of in Europe, all those things give us confidence at this early stage in that 15% to 20% earnings target for next year.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of David Palmer with UBS.","David Palmer \u2013 UBS","Thank you. My question is built upon those other questions. You\u2019re talking about same-store sales having deteriorated lately, yet you're talking about us, the company holding mid-single digit type same-store sales over the next \u2013 not just the next quarter, but over the next year. Is there \u2013 I assume that the company is seeing a new level of stability at this new level of same-store sales, first, maybe you can address that. And also perhaps there are things that you see that you can do and that you have in your innovation pipeline that can really help assure that even if the environment does continue to deteriorate, that perhaps you can cause that same-store sales in the mid-single digits to be maintained in fiscal '13? Thanks.","Howard Schultz","Dave, this is Howard. I think in a conversation like this it's very easy to use some words that can be misinterpreted. So let's just rewind the last five minutes or so, so there's no misunderstanding. We had 7% U.S. comp growth and 6% global comp growth for the quarter. We would take that any quarter over the 41 year history of the company. It's stunning accomplishment given the backdrop of the economic issues.","What Troy said, and I think it's important to just to make sure there is no misunderstanding, we saw a moderate change in June, but the numbers that Starbucks now has are so big that a moderate change in transactions and comps can have a swift and acute change to the economics of our current quarter, and because it happened in June, we did not have the time or the nimbleness to really affect change. The pipeline for innovation that we have planned for fiscal '13 is probably a stronger pipeline as we ever had with center piece going to be Verismo for holiday, but that's just the beginning.","I think we took a very conservative approach by lowering the estimate for Q4. It's responsible and it's the right thing to do. But let me reiterate on behalf of Troy and I, that we are completely locked in the hip that we believe strongly in the guidance that we've given for 2013, and if you look at the last four years since 2008, we've had a 11 consecutive quarters of record results.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.","John Ivankoe \u2013 JPMorgan","Hi, great, thank you. If I may Troy in the past you've kind of given us margins by segment or at least basis point increases on margin per segment in previous guidance and given various moving pieces in your business it would be great if we could have that and maybe just kind of again clarifying something that you've said earlier. The 4Q charges that you're contemplating if we're kind of transforming Europe in the fourth quarter and then in the first half of '13, are those numbers included in your guidance, and I know it's three things.","But finally this is really, a question maybe for Howard as well, but you haven't shown leverage on the labor side at the U.S. store level in the past couple of quarters including this one, but also in previous one despite what has been very good comps in any other operating expense side. And I do understand that there\u2019s been some staffing up around the peak morning day-part, but might we have an opportunity for labor to begin to turn around the other direction as you begin to lap some of those initiatives. So, three parts, margin by segment whether the charges are included and then opportunity to leverage labor?","Troy Alstead","Okay. John, I'll take the first two, and then perhaps Howard and\/or Cliff will jump into the last part of your question. First of all, through the margins by segment, we will provide our expectations to you as we get a little bit closer to fiscal '13. This is the time of year where [we haven\u2019t had] the opportunity to give you our initial expectations given the many moving parts that we see, but I\u2019ll just acknowledge we\u2019re also deep in the mix of our own annual planning for this next fiscal year. So, it's a bit early for us to go much deeper than what we have for you.","Now, I would anticipate by the time we get into our November earnings release, we'll update our guidance at that point in time with everything we know, including how we finished out fiscal '12, and that point in time, I\u2019ll also give you a better sense of what we expect to happen in the coming year by segment. Now in terms of the potential Europe charges, and I want to emphasize potential. I called these out today to give you transparency to some deeper work that we're doing. It's work that's enabled by the fact that we are just say number of months now into leadership in Europe and this regional operating model that we've discussed with you before, it is really empowering much deeper local management, analytics and decision-making.","We also now have several months into discontinuing economic climate in Europe that is just as the U.S. did several years ago, exposed our business to us in some different, more informative ways and helps us do this evaluation of the store portfolio. That work is underway. We don't know the answer yet. It's possible, possible that we could make some changes in equity and some changes in the store portfolio in this fourth quarter. The up to $20 million and that's an up to, it's not an estimate that it will be 20, but the up to $20 million that may occur in the fourth quarter is not included in my guidance for the fourth quarter.","The potential carry-on of charges into next fiscal year and in my prepared comments I said that possibly an additional $10 million, and these are all just very broad ranges at this point in time, but possibly up to $10 million in fiscal '13 is roughly captured in the very big target range we have right now. So, '13, we're confident in the 15% to 20% earnings delivery, the fourth quarter because we were so specific on an EPS guidance range of $0.44 to $0.45 that if there are store closures to be had and charges associated with them, those would not be captured in that guidance already.","Cliff, do you want to take the level question \u2026","Cliff Burrows","Yeah, I'll just talk about [level] question, and we saw leverage in our store operating expenses of about 70 basis points and really pleased with the progress we're making there. We are operating at record productivity levels in terms of sales labor. We continue to work hard using lean practices and all the work we've done over the last three years to bring this discipline around having labor at the right time and we'll continue our work and I see us having continued opportunity to leverage.","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from the line of Keith Siegner with Credit Suisse.","Keith Siegner \u2013 Credit Suisse","I just want to follow-up on an answer from an earlier question, and Howard you had mentioned in talking about a swift and a key change at the end of June, and it happened quickly, you didn't have time to respond. I'm curious, in July we've had the launch of Refreshers. It\u2019s been a big push, lots of media, there's lots of buzz around at least where we are here. With that push of product innovation and marketing, has that helped in terms of a response to that change? How has that been received and what has that done to trend, if you don't mind talking about it?","Howard Schultz","The answer to the question is somewhat bifurcated. Refreshers is off to a very good start, both in our stores and in the 50,000 points of distribution and CPG, and we're very pleased with it and I think it's a big idea today and in the future. I just bifurcated because the traffic slowdown, the moderate traffic slowdown that we saw in June has somewhat continued in July. The difference in this quarter versus the last is that we had no time to respond. I can assure you that a response is coming in Q4 that we believe we\u2019ll address some of the issues and we have other levers that we can use. But the marketing that we've done for Refreshers has achieved its objective. I think the tactic to drive incremental traffic at multiple day-parts is a different approach than trying to build awareness and create trial and loyalty for Refreshers. That's why I said the answer is somewhat bifurcated.","But I think the reason we've taken the guidance down to Q4 is just to take a very conservative approach to ensure the fact that if this continues, we're in a position to meet the expectations that we\u2019ve laid out today, but I want to assure everybody that there is a meeting going on every single morning at 7.00 AM in this building addressing yesterday's sales, diagnosing the issues, and then we're also, and I think this is important. You know I'm on the phone talking to many other heads of companies that are in the consumer retail space, and we're comparing notes about what's going on, and I think what we're all experiencing was very few exceptions Whole Foods being one of them, is that most \u2013 everyone one that we're talking to has almost a similar pattern that mirrors what we've just explained in June and July. So this is not a Starbucks issue. This is a macro problem. It's not an excuse we have to correct to quote on it, but we've got a fractured consumer confidence, and all of the things that you already know about, but we're confidence and we'll be able to navigate through it.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Sara Senatore with Sanford Bernstein.","Sara Senatore \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","Thanks. I have one question and then a follow-up. The first is on your license businesses internationally, one of the things that I noticed is that you actually got \u2013 pretty nice leverage on that other operating expenses line, pretty much across the Board and in some cases much better this quarter than the other quarter. I think a big piece of your strategy at least internationally in terms of margins has been the leveraging of that line as your units growth. So, I was just wondering if this \u2013 if we finally kind of hit that inflection point where we should start to see that really happening. And then my follow-up actually was on what you had said about obviously the step down in June and we haven't heard that from others. Did you see any regional variation within the country like just trying to figure out if there is any sense that there was any weather involved or anything that might \u2013 beyond just kind of that consumer really retrenched?","Howard Schultz","We don't talk about weather at Starbucks, I can tell you that. So, there has not been any regional differences that we can identify and the people that we've talked to on the phone I have had the same response. I know Troy want to answer your question, I mean Troy made a comment that I just want to make sure everyone stood, and that is we're going to accelerate the licensing of stores in Europe, and if you look at the progress that Michelle and her team have made just in the last 90 days, it's fairly significant. We have our board meeting in the U.K. this year coming up in another month, and we're going to really I think focus our attention with great specificity on the learnings we head in the U.S. to help Michelle, but I think we\u2019ve made great progress during the licensing acceleration is going to help that leverage line as well. Troy?","Troy Alstead","Yes Howard. Sara to your question and building-up on Howard's comments, licensing is a big part of our growth going forward, and as you know, we have historically built an infrastructure around the world ahead of the building of our store business. Very consciously often, occasionally, I would suggest that it's a little bit too far into that hurdle, but in the event as we have been addressing those issues, tightening up our capabilities, getting our model in the right places and are now prepared to accelerate that to us more meaningfully. We are beginning to see both \u2013 generally we would expect in the other operating expense line and also on our G&A line in the international segment to build and provide the leverage over time. It won't be the same leverage degree every single quarter, but certainly this trend line will be leveraged. It will begin to meaningfully see as we expand internationally and particularly focus on our licensed business.","Sara Senatore \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays.","Jeffrey Bernstein \u2013 Barclays Capital","Great, thank you very much. Just following-up on the EMEA side as you talk about the portfolio reevaluation and potentially some closures in Western Europe. If you could just take a step back perhaps just wondering whether you view it more as Starbucks specific or macro driven? It would seem like there's potential for both. But if it's Starbucks specific, I'm just wondering perhaps what learnings you would apply to your other regions of the world that might be similar? If it is macro, I'm not sure why perhaps you wouldn\u2019t fight through it and lead the charge in what seems like it would be a powerful long-term regional opportunity for you?","Howard Schultz","It's Howard again. Well first, I think we learned lots of lessons during the transformation of Starbucks in the U.S. business three, four years ago and those decisions looking back were based on making very tough choices about store closures and really rationalize the portfolio. And I think as we look today on the U.S. results, there is a direct correlation between closing those bad stores and taking your medicine. And looking back now, I think the strength and health of the U.S. portfolio is the strongest that it's been in decades.","I think we want to take a similar approach in Europe, and I think we have an advantage. Michelle Gass who is now the President of EMEA was literally at my side during the transformation agenda and co-authored that strategy with me. So she's there and understands the game plan as well as anyone in the Company. Like any decision, there's always some self-induced mistakes that we have to [hold up to] and I think we made a few, but these are macro issues that have so much to do with things that are beyond our control.","The austerity in Greece and Spain, the underlying issues outside of London and the U.K., the change in political leadership in France, all of these things have added to the lack of consumer confidence and we have to navigate through that and we're going to take advantage of it. I want to say something I think it is very important. We have great confidence that we are going to be able to turn Europe around. No one should doubt whatsoever that we're not going to be able to do this. It's not going to be a sprint. This is a long slog. The progress we made over the last 90 days is very encouraging, but we\u2019re going to be sitting at this table and we're going to be announcing with you just as we did in the U.S. a significant turnaround in Europe over time.","Jeffrey Bernstein \u2013 Barclays Capital","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of John Glass with Morgan Stanley.","John Glass \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. Inc.","Thanks. First, I just want to clarify that the source of the earnings miss in the third quarter potentially for us is mostly the U.S. It would seem to me not Asia, not the general development businesses. They all seem to have improved or at least relative to my expectations. Secondly, one of the hallmarks \u2013 if I could just, one of the hallmarks of Starbucks has been your ability to manage expenses over time and I understand maybe the slowdown happened quickly, but I would still think you would have that ability through fourth quarter, particularly in the next year to have some management of discretionary expenses that would give you greater degree of confidence.","So can you talk about what discretionary expenses are flexible? You've got a lot of growth initiatives going on. Are there some that you're maybe willing to sacrifice in the short-term if you believe that it would help you get through this more challenging times? Can you talk about flexibility over the next 12 months as well as the source of that earnings miss? Thanks.","Troy Alstead","Sure. John. You're right, in that the miss to our expectations in the third quarter was largely, but completely driven by surprising change in the growth trajectory in the month of June in the U.S. That was, as Howard mentioned earlier, happened quick enough that we just had the ability to respond very meaningfully.","Now, let me add on to that statement, so by saying that even with that slowing traffic, we leveraged our P&L very significantly in that month of June and in the third quarter. We picked up 120 basis points of margin improvement in the U.S. in the third quarter and adding despite the fact that the sales trajectory maintained growth throughout the quarter, but just not as rapid growth as we moved into June. So, it's very important to distinguish. We're talking about very moderate changes here that moved us off of our expectation. So, it still put us in a position to drive the top line and drive the bottom line even faster in that business.","Absolutely nothing to do in Q3 or Q4 of what we're seeing in China and Asia Pacific, which is a freight train for us, the key to rolling very powerfully, double-digit growth as we opened in new markets. The volumes are coming in as strong or in many cases higher than what they are in the Tier 1 cities. The profitability is very, very strong and maintaining our capabilities are deep, and we keep moving quite nicely.","In Channel Development, 45% of revenue growth in the third quarter, probably not much else I need to say. We are extremely confident of the portfolio of products we have there and our ability to continue that moment as we move. So, it's been a modern consumer environment in the U.S. that we are adjusting both in our third quarter results and as we think about this fourth quarter.","Now, to your point about expenses, and we've talked about this John in times past. One of the most important things we accomplished and learned and improved our abilities around coming out of the crisis of 2008 and 2009 was our ability to have visibility into and manage our P&L in a much, much more disciplined robust ways than ever before. Part of that through reporting and attention and focus, some of it through technology as we put in place things like new inventory management systems that gives us significantly more visibility into our inventory and enhanced all of that capability with our ability to manage that P&L, and we have every opportunity we believe to continue driving leverage, as Cliff said a short time ago, and manage appropriately our P&L as we build.","I also want to be clear though that, there is nothing in the trends we saw in June or even in early in July here that changed our belief that we should be investing into our future going forward. It has caused us to give you some different perspective on what we think in the short-term here in Q4, but there is no change in our long-term trajectory, nothing that\u2019s leading us to think about anything other than the ability to continue to leverage our P&L as we move into 2013.","John Glass \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. Inc.","","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Will Slabaugh with Stephens.","Will Slabaugh \u2013 Stephens Inc.","Just wanted to ask quickly about the guidance one more time for fiscal 2013, just considering the rate of bottom line growth we're seeing now and what you're expecting in 4Q, just wondering what the puts and takes are from a sales down to a cost standpoint and considering you will have the coffee cost tailwind for next year. So, I guess my question more is just wondering what the offset is to the improving input cost for next year or if you're just being prudent with your guidance there for next year?","Troy Alstead","Well, I would suggest it's July and our fiscal year doesn\u2019t start until October. So some of this is just were well, well in advance of that new fiscal year beginning. We do expect, as you know, some commodity benefit coming our way next year. We also have some very conscious strategic, great return on investments coming in the next year, including our leadership conference. We're thinking our way through investments that might allow us to accelerate growth in our emerging markets, which are extremely valuable to us. We're thinking our way through investments perhaps in Europe that will help us accelerate the turnaround in that region, and move us towards a very, very healthy place in that part of the world over time. So, early in our planning and all those things are weighing through our thinking.","With that said, everything we see in our trends and in our plans leads us to have some confidence in a 15% to 20% range for next year, which is quite a broad range at this point in time, and allows us as we get into the year and into the analyst conference in December, which we hope we'll see you all at to fine-tune that estimate and manage it and report to you a little more as we go throughout the year.","Will Slabaugh \u2013 Stephens Inc.","","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Jason West with Deutsche Bank.","Jason West \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities","Just a quick clarification question. Troy, can you just clarify what you would define as a mid-single digit range of comps, just what that would entail? And then on the China comments, I'm just a little bit confused, I saw you guys made some comments that things had returned to more of a sustainable run rate, but then you're pointing to pretty healthy trends, double-digit sort of level continuing, if you could just clarify how we should be thinking about the China comps going forward?","Troy Alstead","Sure. Mid-single digit is consciously a bit of a range only because it's not unusual that it may move around a little bit. Certainly, I view the 7% we turned in this quarter in the U.S. in mid-single digit range, 6% which was our global number but if that were in 5% or 6% certainly in the mid single-digit range. So, I can't be much more precise than that, but that's how we think about it and that's what we would expect over the long-term.","Those aren\u2019t necessarily exact predictions for what we think happens this quarter or next year, but we do believe we have a healthy capability around innovation in our stores. We have continued opportunities to drive day-parts in our stores. We have continued opportunities through efficiencies and improving productivity in that busy morning day-parts. They put more volumes through there. We see no one in the sight that drive average unit volumes in our stores higher than they are today and we\u2019ll continue pursuing those opportunities, and we think we can do that steadily with a very healthy kind of mid-single digit comp growth over time.","In China, without getting to a specific comp growth prediction, I would just suggest that we think we are very, very early days in our development of China. We're very excited to have just passed the important milestone of 600 stores in China recently and yet that is just a small number in the big scheme of what this market will represent for us in terms of store count over time, in terms of the other store channels and consumer products and food service that we expect to be able to develop more meaningfully as time progresses and in terms of our ability to drive AUVs across Asia and in China through healthy comp growth over time. So no specific guidance for you beyond the kind of ranges that we\u2019ve produced historically, but we think there's huge opportunity to keep driving that business forward.","Howard Schultz","One more question, please.","","Operator","","Thank you. Your last question comes from the line of Matthew DiFrisco with Lazard.","Matthew DiFrisco \u2013 Lazard Capital Markets","Thank you. Troy, my question I guess is a little bit more thinking about the business model going forward and during the last two years with all the coffee headwinds, you still put up 20% EPS and you had the high mid-single digit comps, and I guess the story was we're getting leaner and less comps and in a model where there's normalized commodities, we won't require as big of a comp to drive the earnings, especially when you see the high margin growth coming from the CPG business. I'm curious what is changing or how do we look at 2013 as far as you're giving guidance of mid-single digits whether that's four, five, six or seven?","I would have thought in prior quarters you were setting up for a business model that probably could support even 20% or so EPS type growth, especially when you have the commodity tailwinds into 2013 as a net benefit to the overall cost. I'm just wondering, is this an innovation way down, is this a couple of years of building and investing or \u2013 and we're going to get to leverage eventually or is this is a model that requires always mid to high single-digit comps to get to the 15% to 20% model?","Troy Alstead","Matt, let me be clear. Absolutely nothing is changing in how we have built the model and navigated it and what we see coming in the next year. We've always said that coming out of the recovery period of 2008 and 2009, the bite of the apple in terms our ability to pull cost out of our structure to drive efficiency, those bites were naturally bigger in that first year and two and three and of course we took bigger step-ups in margin improvement in 2009 and in 2010 and 2011 and we expect even doing in 2012 for example.","As we go forward from here, we have a long list of initiatives running efficiency around being leaner as we continue to go from here and better at what we do every day around driving the top line, about expanding day-parts. We have a longer list of things than we could ever get with any one particular quarter and it is that long list of efficiencies around the top line and managing the middle of P&L's that allow us to say with confidence that we have a long-term trajectory to drive leverage.","We feel very confident of that and feel very good about that and I think we can sustainably drive that number forward and we'll have some commodity benefit coming our way in fiscal 2013. I would anticipate early days some additional commodity benefit coming to us in 2014, given the current commodity cycle as well. So, we think the combination of everything we're doing in the business and driving north of 10% revenue growth and 15% to 20% earnings growth, this is very, very healthy leverage point, and very healthy earnings growth for a company our size.","Matthew DiFrisco \u2013 Lazard Capital Markets","Thank you very much.","JoAnn DeGrande","This concludes our third quarter fiscal 2012 earnings call.

I'd like to start by taking this opportunity to thank our outgoing VP of Investor Relations, Tom Shaw, for his leadership over the past couple of years and to wish him well as he pursue the new opportunity outside our industry. Durga is a 5-year Starbucks partner, and a 20-year veteran of Investor Relations and I'm thrilled that she is stepping up to lead our IR function in close partnership with Pat.","Now last month we were pleased to meet with many of you in New York, not only to showcase our latest Starbucks Reserve Roastery but to also discuss the next chapter in Starbucks growth agenda, which we call growth at scale. We shared with you our strategy to streamline the business, drive growth in the key markets of U.S. and China, expand our global reach to the global coffee alliance, while simultaneously returning significant capital to our shareholders. The strategy is working as evidenced by our Q1 results and we remain confident in the longer term outlook for the business. Integral to our growth scale strategy is the higher level of focus and discipline to drive predictable, sustainable long-term growth and shareholder returns. The positive business momentum that we experienced in the fourth quarter of fiscal '18 clearly sustained throughout Q1. The strength of our results in Q1 has further reinforced the confidence and conviction we have, both near-term and long-term in our strategy.","Now let me give you a few of the key financial headlines for the quarter. Record revenue is $6.6 billion representing 9% growth versus prior year. Comp sales growth of 4% including another quarter of sequential improvement in traffic comp. Net store growth of 7% on a global basis versus prior year with over two-thirds of our new store openings outside the U.S. Continued digital momentum with U.S. Active Rewards members growing 14% to 16.3 million, and return of $5.5 billion to shareholders through a combination of dividends and buybacks. These results were enabled in part by solid execution during our holiday season. Our holiday plan was informed by insights we gathered from customers who highlighted what they appreciate from Starbucks during the holidays. We leveraged those insights to reignite the customer connection in many ways; with improved brand and product awareness, sharper and cleaner holiday merchandising, relevant new offering such as our limited edition red cup promotion, and an enhanced in-store experience. This comprehensive insight driven approach delivered results and importantly, created momentum that provides a solid foundation for future quarters, helped in part by strong performance in our gift card business.","Taking a step back from the solid results in the quarter, I'd like to highlight the broader approach we're taking to sustain growth well into the future. And to update you on the progress we're making to advance this strategy. As a reminder, our growth at scale agenda is composed of three key building blocks; streamlining our business, focusing on three strategic priorities, and amplifying the Starbucks brand. Our streamlined efforts over the past six quarters are paying off by allowing us to bring more focused and discipline to our three strategic priorities of accelerated growth and our targeted markets of U.S. and China, expanding global reach of the Starbucks brand, leveraging the global coffee alliance with Nestl\u00e9 and increasing shareholder returns. Importantly, we are doing all of this while staying true to our brand promise with the understanding that the foundational elements will remain pivotal as we continue to build our brand through the Starbucks experience, the quality of our coffee, and our corporate reputation for doing good. And as with any strong foundation there are opportunities to amplify these cornerstones of the brand that we continue to demonstrate. Most recently, with the opening of our New York Roastery, and soon in February with the opening of the Tokyo Roastery. Now we will consistently use this growth at scale framework to guide our communications with investors going forward.","So let me share a few more details about the progress we've made against our three strategic priorities and what to expect for the balance of the year. Starting with accelerating growth in our two long-term growth markets, the U.S. and China. In the U.S. we are focused on three operating initiatives; enhancing the in-store experience, delivering beverage innovation and driving digital relationships. Enhancing in-store experience encompasses building customer connections and creating those best moments that keep customers coming back time and time again. Our Starbucks store partners who proudly wear the green apron are at the center of connecting with customers and we are on a mission to support them by simplifying work and reducing some of the non-customer facing tasks that historically have taken upto 40% of their time. This is freeing up more time for our partners to connect with customers. For example; we've shifted certain cleaning tasks to after-hours and we're automating product planning and replenishment which reduces store clutter and time away from customers. This work will span multiple quarters, the actions thus far are already paying off as our customer connection scores continue to improve in Q1 on both a sequential and year-over-year basis. And importantly, across both, the morning and afternoon day parts.","We're also creating a new channel for customers to engage through Starbucks Delivers. Our partnership with UberEats is gaining momentum and we expect to bring delivery to nearly a quarter of our U.S. company-operated stores by April, including our second market in San Francisco which launched earlier this week. Our early experience is encouraging and has provided us the blueprint for how to operationalize this new channel, an important step to create a seamless workflow for our partners. From a customer perspective, Starbucks Delivers is being seamlessly integrated into the UberEats mobile app enabling full beverage customization and fully integrating into our store operations to ensure a premium Starbucks experience.","Moving on to our second U.S. priority, beverage innovation. Our focus here is ongoing led by the momentum we are seeing with cold beverages across multiple dayparts. The focus of our latest beverage innovation revolves around iced espresso, draft nitro beverages and refreshers. We have expanded the deployment of our nitro offering from about one-third of U.S. company-operated stores last quarter to 40% in just one quarter. And we remain on-track to reach our goal of 100% penetration by the end of fiscal '19. Draft nitro beverages represent a significant opportunity for the brand. This platform is differentiated, provides theater and drives incrementality [ph].","We also made great progress on our third U.S. priority driving digital relationships; our enabler convenience, awareness and value. To build our digital ecosystem we widened the aperture of digital reach and created a funnel of activation that is leading to increases in active membership in our Starbucks Rewards program. Since we've started these efforts last spring, we have acquired 13 million digital customer registrations, and we're excited about the potential this has to drive our Starbucks Rewards program. I'm pleased to share that in Q1 we expanded our active member base by an impressive 1 million customers, a 14% increase that takes active reward membership to 16.3 million. This result was driven by leveraging our increased digital reach, as well as a more seamless customer onboarding experience, greater mobile order and pay adoption, and enhanced personalization features. Between digitally registered and active reward customers, we are now approaching 30 million digital connections in the U.S.","Starbucks Rewards continues to be a powerful enabler of loyalty and we are thoughtfully evolving the program to provide greater choice and flexibility for rewards members. We will enhance the program this spring to enable loyalty customers to earn and redeem more quickly, and redeem those awards across a broader range of items in our stores. We have leveraged learnings and customer insight from prior changes to the rewards program to inform our work ahead of this launch. This includes a robust marketing activation plan to drive not only awareness of the changes but overall awareness of the program and key customer benefits. As we've shared in the past, lack of awareness has historically been one of the limiting to customer adoption, and we had a significant opportunity to amplify a powerful message around loyalty.","Having covered the U.S. let's talk a bit about our second largest and fastest growing major market, China. This month marks the 20th anniversary of Starbucks in China, and we continue to play the long game with our purpose-driven growth agenda. We've recognized the tremendous opportunity ahead requires navigating a rapidly evolving competitive landscape, changing consumer behaviors and a dynamic economy. With a large and growing addressable market around coffee, we expect competition to remain highly promotional and disruptive. As we have done over the past 20 years in China, we will continue to learn and adapt as we create a broader coffee culture, expand our presence in both new and existing cities, and deliver a differentiated Starbucks experience throughout China whether it's serving customers in our beautifully designed stores or enabling new channels like Starbucks Delivers.","China represents a large opportunity and a dynamic market which informs the low single-digit comp guidance that we outlined last month. The bigger story in China is total transactions driven by our store growth which underpins approximately 80% of our growth algorithm in China. This quarter our store base in China grew by 18%, comp stabilized at 1%, and we remained confident in the future opportunity. The launch of our China digital partnership with Alibaba, the rapid expansion of our Starbucks Delivers program now in more than 2,000 stores, and the added coverage of Star Kitchens and Hema supermarkets are just the beginning. Starbucks Delivers is already contributing mid-single digit transaction mix in our key markets of Beijing and Shanghai which validates customer demand and reinforces the significant runway of opportunity ahead. The benefit from our unique Starbucks virtual store integrated throughout the Alibaba ecosystem is largely still ahead of us as awareness and adoption build. Along with the recent upgrade of our Starbucks Rewards program, new food and beverage offerings and powerful new store economics, we remain bullish on our path in China and the growth that lies ahead, we are playing the long game in China.","Moving on to our second strategic priority; expanding our global reach through the Global Coffee Alliance. This is the story of two leading global companies, with unique capabilities, coming together to accelerate growth of coffee around the world. The transition of the North America business to Nestle has gone extremely well, and we are rapidly shifting our attention to growing the share of Starbucks capsules on Nestle platforms, accelerating our leadership position in North America, and expanding the presence of Starbucks Coffee into international markets. We remain on-track with our go-to-market approach strategies to bring Starbucks products to life across the Nespresso and Dolce Gusto platforms beginning this spring and progressing throughout the remainder of the year. Naturally, we will focus initially on strategic markets across traditional CPG and foodservices chains [ph], and we look forward to sharing our progress with you in the months and quarters ahead. We are very pleased with the initial success of the strategic partnership and very optimistic about it's potential.","And finally, let me comment on our third strategic priority of increasing shareholder returns. As we first outlined last June, we are committed to return $25 billion of cash to shareholders through fiscal 2020 and we are on-track to do just that. In fiscal '18, we returned approximately $9 billion of cash through buybacks and dividends. And with the additional $5 billion, accelerated share repurchase plan initiated on October 1, we have now returned over $14 billion of our total commitment of $25 billion. So in summary, our growth at scale strategy is working, and our leadership team is fully committed to the future growth and vibrancy of Starbucks.","To the more than 350,000 Starbucks partners who proudly wear the green apron, I thank you; you have always been at the center of everything we do to create that warm and welcoming Starbucks experience in our stores. Because of you we were able to distribute bean stock to nearly 200,000 partners in 21 markets around the world this past year. We hired over 21,000 veterans and military spouses, and nearly 65,000 opportunity youth over the past three years. And we welcomed more than 12,000 Starbucks partners into a pathway to a college degree through the Starbucks College Achievement program. I am proud to be your partner.","And with that, I'd like to officially welcome Pat to his first Starbucks earnings call. Pat?","Patrick Grismer","Thank you, Kevin and good afternoon, everyone. I too am pleased with the overall business momentum that we demonstrated in the first quarter with solid revenue growth of 9% driven by net new store growth of 7% over the past 12 months and global comp growth of 4%. 9% revenue growth for the quarter included an approximate 1% unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation, and an approximate 1% net benefit from streamline-related activities, primarily the acquisition of East China through Global Coffee Alliance, and the sale of Tazo.","Non-GAAP EPS of $0.75 was up 15% versus prior year and included a net favorable impact of $0.07 related to discrete income tax items, primarily, the release of certain tax reserves. I'll now take you through our Q1 operating performance by segment.","Our America's segment delivered 8% revenue growth in Q1, primarily driven by net new store growth of 5% over the past 12 months, and 4% comp sales growth with flat comp transaction growth in the U.S., a sequential quarterly improvement as Kevin highlighted earlier. For the second consecutive quarter, beverage, our highest margin category was the primary driver of U.S. comp growth contributing three of the four points in Q1, followed by two points from food and a one point decline in lobby. Beverage growth was led by our espresso and brewed platforms which delivered the highest contribution to comp growth in nine quarters. Of note, iced beverages continued to lead this growth across all dayparts with strong performance from Starbucks Refreshers, Iced Espresso and Iced Coffee, in particular, Cold Brew and Nitro.","And although lobby continued to weigh on comp, due to our SKU rationalization efforts that are improving store level profitability and streamlining the in-store experience, our overall holiday offerings performed well. From a daypart perspective, we saw improvement across the board with continued strong growth in the morning and afternoon performance that was the best in the last five quarters. Americas non-GAAP operating margin declined 60 basis points to 22.4% in Q1, primarily due to partner investments including tax reform funded investments, partially offset by sales leverage.","Moving on to China\/Asia Pacific, our fastest growing business segment. Capped segment revenues grew 45% in Q1 excluding the net 32% combined impact of streamline activities, notably, the acquisition of East China and foreign currency translation. Revenue grew 13% in the quarter, this was driven by 13% net new store growth over the past 12 months and 3% comp sales growth including 1% comp transaction growth. I'll now highlight the first quarter performance of two key markets in our CAP segment; China and Japan.","China delivered comp sales growth of 1% in Q1 including a 2% decline in comp transactions consistent with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. 3% comp ticker growth was driven by our Starbucks Rewards Loyalty Program food and merchandise. Importantly, we sustained our high rate of store growth in China entering 10 new cities in the quarter and with 18% growth in net new stores over the past 12 months we ended the quarter with nearly 3,700 stores in 158 cities. We are also pleased that our newest class of stores in China continue to deliver strong profits and returns on investment.","Our Japan business delivered an outstanding quarter driving mid-single digit comp sales and transaction growth that lifted comp for the overall CAP segment. These results were driven by holiday marketing efforts which led to successful LT [ph] outperformance in both blended and brewed beverages. We are also pleased with a continued growth in Starbucks Rewards Program in Japan representing 22% of sales in Q1 and reaching 1.6 million active members, a 33% increase over the prior year. CAPs non-GAAP operating margin declined by 210 basis points to 23%, primarily due to the ownership change in East China, excluding the combined 220 basis point impact of the East China acquisition and unfavorable foreign exchange, the segments non-GAAP operating margin was essentially flat.","On to our channel development segment which reported a revenue decline of 20% in Q1 including the impact of the Global Coffee Alliance which reduced segment revenues by approximately $130 million in the quarter, as expected. Excluding the impact of the Global Coffee Alliance segment revenues increased 1%. Non-GAAP operating margin declined by 700 basis points to 35.9% in Q1 including a 770 basis point margin dilutive impact of the Global Coffee Alliance. Absent that impact, the segments non-GAAP operating margin improved 70 basis points. Finally, at the consolidated level, non-GAAP operating margin of 17.4% in Q1 represented the decline of 180 basis points year-over-year largely due to streamline related activities. Excluding the 110 basis point impact of these activities, non-GAAP operating margin declined by approximately 70 basis points reflecting the impact of partner investments including tax reform funded items, as well as strategic investments in our cyber [ph] retail business which remains in the concept development phase. These investments were partially offset by the benefit of sales leverage.","Now moving on to our guidance for fiscal year '19; we still expect fiscal 2019 GAAP EPS in the range of $2.32 to $2.37 because the $0.07 benefit from discrete income tax items in Q1 which I mentioned earlier is largely offset by a net increase in cumulative unfavorable tax items related to the 2018 Tax Reform Act. However, relative to our previous guidance, we do expect non-GAAP EPS in fiscal '19 to increase by $0.07 resulting in a range of $2.68 to $2.73, mostly because the tax reform related adjustment is excluded for non-GAAP reporting. Additionally, for fiscal 2019 we now expect our GAAP effective tax rate to be in the range of 21% to 23% and our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be in the range of 20% to 22%. Finally, in light of the ongoing earnings growth model that we shared at our 2018 Investor Day in December, we are confirming our fiscal year 2019 global comp growth guidance to be between 3% and 4%. All other full year 2019 guidance metrics including net new stores and operating margin are unchanged from what was communicated on our Q4 fiscal year '18 quarterly earnings call and reaffirmed at our 2018 Investor Day.","Although it's not our practice to give quarterly guidance, I'd like to provide some qualitative commentary on the shape of our P&L for the balance of the year. As a reminder, we rollout the East China acquisition at the beginning of Q2 at which point we will no longer see the year-over-year benefit to our total revenue growth. At the same time we will still bear the year-over-year revenue headwind from the Global Coffee Alliance. We expect these factors to yield significantly lower revenue growth in Q2 compared to Q1. And given the fact that Q2 is a seasonally low period for us, and with the continued substantial carryover of last year's U.S. tax reform related investments we also expect our non-GAAP operating margin percentage to be lower in Q2 compared to Q1. We are in the early phases of our G&A reduction program having just started in Q1 and the benefits to the P&L will not begin to meaningfully materialize until the backhalf of the fiscal year. This is an area of continued focus for us and we remain committed to reducing G&A spending as a percentage of system sales over the next three years to drive profitable growth at scale while making the necessary investments in our business.","As we start to lap the tax reform related investments in Q3, and with the benefit of our continued focus on improving G&A efficiency, we expect our non-GAAP operating margin percentage to be higher in the second half of the year compared to the first half, even with the onetime cost of our global leadership conference that will impact Q4. Please note, that all of this is consistent with our full year guidance for 2019.","To summarize, we are pleased with our first quarter performance and view these results as a validation of our strategies to grow Starbucks at scale with greater focus in discipline. We appreciate the hard work of Starbucks partners around the world in our stores, at our roasting plants, and in our support centers, who deliver these results in a manner that remains true to our company's mission and values which is the core of our business.","And with that, Kevin and I are happy to take your questions joined by Ross Brewer and John Culver as Durga outlined at the top of our call. Thank you. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Sharon Zackfia with William Blair.","Sharon Zackfia","You probably didn't make as big of a deal as I would have expected about gross margin going up in the Americas for the first time in a couple of years. I don't know if you can give any more color around if it's just because of the beverage mix leading the comp? And whether or not you believe that's sustainable for the rest of the year?","Patrick Grismer","We typically don't highlight gross margin but what I will do is speak to the performance of the Americas OI [ph] margin, just to give you some flavor for how we saw that play out in the quarter. In the quarter we've realized meaningful operating efficiencies and positive sales leverage which includes some gift card accounting benefits but those were more than offset by an unusually high level of investments including seasonal marketing expense to support holiday, product mix and inflation, primarily higher wages. And to give you a flavor for how we see this playing out balance of the year, we do expect stronger margin tailwinds and lighter margin headwinds compared to the first quarter and thus less store level margin contraction as the year unfolds. I'm specifically looking at product mix and what happened there in the first quarter. We experienced an adverse margin impact as beverage mix shifted from blended to refreshers, and also from higher food sales but that was partially offset by the positive impact of lower merchandise sales.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Tarantino with Robert W. Baird.","David Tarantino","My question is on China, and I just -- maybe it's a two part question. First is, holding the line on comps sequentially despite I guess some signs of a slower macro economy over there. So I was just wondering if you could comment on how you think you did on a relative basis if you benchmark your sales over there versus others. And then secondly, I think you mentioned that the delivery rollout in the first couple of big markets has led to mid-single digit percentage of product mix, is that all incremental or are you seeing a mid-single digit lift in the sales or is that cannibalizing some of the in-store sales? And how does that compare to what you expected as you started the rollout? Thanks.","Kevin Johnson","Thanks, David. I'll just comment briefly and I'll hand over to John Culver to go into some more detail. On your first question, I think that the fact that the performance we delivered, up 18% increase in new stores plus stabilizing our comp at 1% comp growth, that's delivering double-digit transaction growth which we think is the most important metric for us to focus on in China. Our new stores are highly profitable and they are working well, so we're going to continue to play the long game and I think we'll let you benchmark us versus others as their data comes out. But I think we're very comfortable and very confident in the strategy that we have in China. I'll let John comment further on that and take your question on delivery.","John Culver","David, I think that overall from a China perspective we saw strong Q1 performance and continued momentum in the business, and as I shared in New York at Investor Day, really, just looking at the total transaction growth in the market, the new store build out which represents about 80% of our total revenue growth and the fact that we continue to increase our overall share in the market as we build out our store footprint. Clearly, the environment in China right now; we've demonstrated our ability to navigate what is a changing consumer economic and competitive environment. But as Kevin said in his comments, we are playing the long game and we believe in the strategy that we have in place, and the strategy is focused in a couple of different areas. First, it's continuing to expand our store footprint, and the reason we're doing that is because we continue to see very strong returns, and best-in-class performance in the new stores that we're building.","The second thing that we're focused on again is continuing to grow the total revenues in the market. In the quarter we grew 19%, when you normalize for FX, as well as the East China integration, and our store count overall grew 18% as we opened up 10 new cities. So we now operate 3,700 stores across 158 cities. The other area that we're focused on is continuing to expand our digital partnership with Alibaba. And you mentioned Starbucks Delivers, we have rapidly rolled out in less than 90 days to 2,000 stores across 30 cities and we're seeing a strong awareness being build, we're seeing strong trail and we're seeing a growing adoption level from customers. I would say that from some of the metrics the average delivery time is approximately 19 minutes when a customer orders to the time they receive it; we're seeing strong performance in both, Beijing, as well as Shanghai, and the average ticket that we're seeing through the delivery orders is a bit higher than what we see in our average core stores and the mix tends to be more beverage led, and in particular, espresso led. So we feel good about the progress that we're making.","In terms of incrementality to your question, we are seeing some positive impact but I would just say that it's too early to call exactly what that impact is but we're encouraged by the initial results that we're seeing. And we feel that we've got a competitive edge in the market, we've set new standards for delivery of coffee to our customers, and to customers throughout China we've obviously introduced innovation with splash-proof lids for hot and cold beverages, tamper-proof packaging seals, and individual hot and cold delivery containers. And so we're very encouraged by what we're seeing on the delivery platform through Starbucks Delivers, as well as our through our partnership with Alibaba.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Glass with Morgan Stanley.","John Glass","On the U.S. business, two questions. One is, I know you gave some detail around daypart and product mix; how did the progression of comps work from a My Starbucks Reward member versus non-Starbucks Reward member? Are you stores seeing just more visits from your loyal members? Are you getting some of those less frequent users to come back, and maybe is that part of this -- are you seeing the actualization or can you quantify the benefit from some of this more -- this new digital relationship that you have? Can you also discuss, just -- if delivery will ultimately be available in the U.S. through the Starbucks app or is it only [indiscernible] and why is that? I would think you would want to capture your customers who are already visiting your app to get delivery and not direct them to the third-party app?","Rosalind Brewer","So, first of all let me start with the breakdown between SR and non-SR; we typically don't give a great detail in that area between SR and non-SR but I will tell you that we continue to grow our business at peak in the mornings, and that's when we see our strongest Starbucks Rewards customer in our store, so we are continuing to grow very well there. I will also mention that within the quarter we saw very nice improvement in the number of Starbucks Rewards customers, we added 1 million new Starbucks Rewards members to the business. When we look at those numbers, that is a number that -- we've not achieved that number since 2015, so we're pleased with where we're growing the Starbucks Rewards customer. I will also tell you that we continue to see spend per member list on the Starbucks Rewards customer that we are pleased with, and we're also continuing to do work to convert those customers that have joined us from non-SR perspective and to get them to join us as an SR member, so our work continues there.","Your second question was around how are we thinking about -- I think your question\u2026","John Glass","Starbucks Delivers\u2026","Rosalind Brewer","Starbucks Delivers, right, in the app; so that work is ongoing. So we just migrated from Miami to San Francisco this week and in the work that we're doing, the software integration is the most important part of the work that we can do right now, we are pleased with what we've seen just in the short week with the integration of the software. We are right now currently only able to access through the Uber app but there is word coming to bring us forward with the -- so that they can access Starbucks Delivers through the Starbucks Rewards app, so that is coming.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Palmer with RBC Capital Markets.","David Palmer","Just a follow-up on China, on delivery. How could that delivery contribution to growth progress based on what you're seeing in terms of the ramp of adoption just in this first few months? And could you also give a sense about how many -- what's the pace of that rollout after this first 2,000? And then, also you had previously talked about co-marketing opportunities with Alibaba, something -- a few hundred million of customers to whom you can market to; how is that going to ramp as well? Thank you.","Patrick Grismer","David, just real quick on the delivery side; as we shared in the comments, as Kevin shared, right now what we're seeing is delivery is contributing in the mid-single digit range through our transaction mix in the key markets of Beijing and Shanghai. So, we are seeing nice solid growth in terms of transactions that are coming through delivery and we're going to continue again to focus on how do we build awareness around the delivery -- Starbucks Delivers through Alibaba and the Alibaba app as well as the Starbucks apps, we're going to focus on gaining trail; and then obviously, getting repeat in growing adoption. So those are the three big areas that we're focused on. When you look at the overall opportunity that we're seeing with Alibaba is part of the partnership, right; I think that there is a couple of things to note. First off, we have the Starbucks Delivers program through LMA [ph] as well as through the Star Kitchen program with Hema, and that is an area that we continue to invest in jointly together and continue to grow and rollout. The second area I would say is as it relates to Tmall and the opportunity that we see to make Starbucks product accessible through the Tmall site and today through this partnership we now have the number one position in terms of sales in the food and beverage card category across China, and in particular on the Tmall site.","The virtual store that I talked about at the Investor Day is something that we have kicked off with Alibaba that gives us access to their 600 million users, and gives them the opportunity to become a Starbucks Rewards members at a much easier pace and with no -- very little friction. So what have we seen from a Starbucks Rewards program? From a Starbucks Rewards program our 90-day active membership grew over 14% in the quarter, we now have 7.3 million active members and the total membership across Starbucks Rewards stands at 22 million which showed an overall 8% increase in membership. So we're very, very pleased with the partnership and the opportunity that we're seeing with it and the opportunity to continue to innovate.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sara Senatore with AllianceBernstein.","Sara Senatore","I have two follow-ups, if I may. One on delivery, I was just wondering if you could talk about the economics at all either in China or the U.S. I know you said you don't know, yet you don't have firm numbers on incrementality but are there any sort of hurdles that you would need to clear in terms of percentage incrementality for this to be profitable or accretive? Just trying to understand what it might look like and whether the bar is lower in China because it's lower labor cost? And then my second follow-up is on -- just the MSR customers, and Roz's point it's the greatest growth since 2015 but obviously the comps are a bit slower now. So is there anything to say about the nature of those new customers that you're acquiring just -- perhaps lower spending in general or less of a lift when they join? Thank you.","John Culver","To your first question on delivery and margin impact; as part of the guidance that we've provided, we've modeled in a slight dilution of margin for our business in China but that is offset broadly across the CAP segment and roughly in line with us delivering a roughly flat margin across the entire segment. We're going to continue to look at ways to optimize the margin but more importantly, how did we rapidly expand this program and grow it in a way that brings more customers into the Starbucks brand and extends our reach because ultimately what we want to do is grow our overall share of consumption and our overall total revenues, and we feel very good about the position that we're in and the way we have this model into our P&L in FY19.","Rosalind Brewer","Just to tip it on the U.S. delivery progress; so we were encouraged exiting the work that we were doing in Miami and it's given us some insights in terms of how important it is for us to have the software integration to be successful so that the process actually works and the partners can execute very cleanly in the store; so that's going well. But in Miami we did learn that we have a little bit larger ticket with the delivery order. Secondly, we also learned that we are able to deliver certain beverages very well and others not, and so we are refining the menu so that we can make sure we understand when this program is fully rolled out that we understand what the menu needs to be. And then lastly, I would tell you one of the things that we learned in Miami is the operational pieces around what needs to happen so that we have affected delivery, so that's what we know at this point that it was encouraging and now for us to advance. You will see us go into six more areas, six additional areas over the next 4 to 6 weeks, and hopefully we'll be able to share more in second quarter -- at the end of second quarter with you.","You asked a question about SR members versus non-SR and what are we learning about the new non-SR members. One of the things that we have been learning with the non-SR members, we're watching their spend levels, we're noticing that some of our non-SR members shop more with us in the afternoon, they are more of an occasional customer for us.","And then lastly, I wanted to remind you that we are introducing our multi-tier redemption program that starts in second quarter of this year, that will allow us to provide access to our customers. And when you think about that program, we're excited about it because it continues to allow us to provide access to our brand but in addition to it, it gives you access to benefit broadly to this non-SR group. So we are adjusting the program that will happen in second quarter and we look forward to sharing more information with you as we get through the introduction of it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.","John Ivankoe","I wanted to revisit China, if I may. And then, I have three separate questions and hopefully, I didn't miss any, thank you on asking these. Firstly, the East China impact on comps, it's obviously a very big market that I think will enter the comp base for the first time in the second quarter of '19. Do you expect that to be a positive or negative as that slug [ph] storage comes in? Secondly, it's been mentioned I think a couple of times, delivery in China is in 2,000 of 3,700 stores approximately or 30 out of 158 cities; so obviously I can understand the major market concentration there but in terms of thinking about percentage of the stores or percentage as the markets to where delivery could make sense based on what you're seeing today. Should we expect China to have a 100% delivery coverage at the end of '19 or '20 or does it make sense for you to have a bigger delivery business in fewer stores?","And then the third question on China, and Kevin, this is in reference to some comments that you made in your prepared remarks that China was highly promotional and disruptive. If I didn't see the results, I probably would have thought they would have been worse and they actually were based on what those comments were related presumably your competition. So, to talk a little bit more highly promotional and disruptive and whether there is anything that you would consider doing tactically or near-term in order to hold-on to your rightful share of same-store traffic if you do think that that could become more of an issue than it's previously been?","Kevin Johnson","We'll have maybe Pat take the first question on East China impact on comps.","Patrick Grismer","Just to provide a little bit more perspective on how we see that working into our results. East China moves into the comp base for the first time in Q2 which means that the waiting of China in the comp base will comprise approximately 55% of CAP's comp results. Now as was discussed on the East China modeling call last year, these stores modestly underperformed company operated stores from a comp perspective, given a higher level of sales transfer due to an accelerated pace of new store openings. But as we've had a year now to align these stores with our pre-existing company-owned business, the results of East China are fully embedded in the guidance that we provided previously for 1% to 3%. So we do not now expect they will have a materially dilutive impact to our recorded comps for China or for CAP.","Kevin Johnson","John, you want to take the second question on percent of stores for delivery?","John Culver","Sure. John, I think you bring up a good question and obviously we continue to assess how do we want to continue to cover our markets, how do we want to continue to reach customers and build out the footprint of the delivery service. Your question around could you expect 100% of our stores having delivery; I would say initially we're not going down that path from the standpoint of -- when you get into some of these trade areas, we have a condensed footprint in those trade areas, so we will leverage certain stores in those trade areas. We're going through that evaluation right now, and looking at it we feel good, very good about the first 2,080 stores that we have, the 30 cities that we're in, and the coverage that we're providing; and we'll continue to rollout new stores as we continue through the year.","Kevin Johnson","And John, I'll comment on your third question. I'll let John Culver add to that but -- you know, my comments about competition being highly promotional, it's just a reflection of the fact that there are number of instances where competitors will use price, free coffee, buy 1 get 4 free, a lot of promotional kinds of techniques for them to get a customer. And for us, clearly the topline metric for competitiveness is total transaction growth for China. And the fact that we grew new stores by 18%, those new stores are performing very well, they are delivering a significant portion of new transaction growth plus our same-store comp growth. And we're getting that by continuing to do what we do well, which is differentiate on the quality of the experience in our stores, the quality of our handcrafted beverages that our Starbucks partners customize for each and every customer. And we're now complementing that with the China digital partnership with Alibaba which is giving us reach now to 600 million people who are regular users of the Alibaba apps. And we're complementing that with Microsoft or the Starbucks Rewards Program that we launched, and John pointed out, the traction that we're getting behind that.","So all those things together, I think we're performing very well and we recognize that the Starbucks value proposition and the things that we do well, we keep doing those and we're going to keep growing that total transaction number and that will serve us well. John, you want to add to that?","John Culver","Yes, I would just add that clearly, as I've shared John, we remain focused on the long-term opportunity that we see in China. And as we make our investments in this market, we feel that the short-term, mid-term and the long-term prospects are significant for our company. So we're committed to continuing to grow in this competitive environment. I would say that you see the returns that we've been able to generate in the market through our new stores, in the growth rates that we've been able to deliver, in terms of the top line, in terms of total transaction growth. We have a very healthy economic model. More importantly, we have a premium brand that is positioned very strongly in the market. And as competitors come in, they will help build awareness, they will help build consumption, but we feel we're positioned to win over the long-term in the market. And economically, clearly we've got a healthy economic model and others are out raising cash on a consistent basis trying to fund their model.","Operator","Your next question comes from Matthew DiFrisco with Guggenheim Securities.","Matthew DiFrisco","My question is with respect to the My Starbucks Awards within the Americas. I think Kevin you mentioned in your prepared remarks that spring time, I didn't know exactly which quarter that was going to fall into if that's going to be fiscal 2Q or 3Q with regards to some marketing behind some of the new plans to continue this strong activation of those digital connections you made onto bringing them into the My Starbucks Awards ecosystem. So I was curious could you give us some more color or details on how we could expect the rewards program to change? And how maybe to just protect against any hiccups from that being altered as it has in the past sometimes occurred?","Kevin Johnson","Let me just clarify and I'll hand over to Roz. The fact that we've established 13 million digitally registered customers as part of the fedder pool in the way that we can now bring those customers into Starbucks at a deeper relationship and ultimately we'd like to bring them into our Starbucks Rewards Program. And that's part -- that's going to be an ongoing effort and there is a lot of the tools and things that we've implemented to help simplify the onboarding and help communicate and amplify the value proposition of the rewards program to them. There is also the changes we're making to the program that I'm going to hand over to Roz to talk about how we're enhancing the value proposition of Starbucks Rewards through the changes that Roz will take you through.","Rosalind Brewer","So Matthew, just a few things. First of all, it is second quarter where we will begin marketing to the non-SR 13 million digitally registered consumers. I wanted to remind that this is still a transaction to spin-based program, so this is a spin-based program and we're just opening the range of opportunity. Some of the customer benefits of the new program is, all members will now be able to redeem from the start, no more levels to hurdle like instant goals. There is options to redeem faster, so the earlier program engagement by offering lower thresholds for items and add-ons. And so choice and flexibility are really at the heart of this program, and we really believe that it will really increase the overall appeal of the program to these individuals that we've not been able to attract to straight into the Starbucks Rewards Program. So we're going to continue to learn about these individuals and access and market to them, they were part of the group that we marketed the new Happy Hour Program too, and we were able to monitor their response against the new Happy Hour Program just by their email accessibility. So while this program rolls out in second quarter, so we're looking forward to see other response to it at that time but we're encouraged at this point.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays.","Jeffrey Bernstein","Two related questions on China. The first one, Kevin or John, I mean you mentioned playing the long game and clearly, the competition is not referring the quality of product or the type of in-store experience that you are but they are offering I guess the much desired delivery at seemingly a much lower price. I'm just wondering is there anyway to maybe attack that specifically for those customers that just want delivery and don't necessarily want the full experience to be more competitive on price because it does seem like at least the largest competitor. In other grown units, north of 100% in '19; I know yours is high-teens which is normally quite high for the overall industry but it does seem like there is ramp in growth coming from potentially those others.","And my question was just quickly to Pat; I mean in your former restaurant life you really spend a lot of time focused on China and ultimately decided that in that case franchising was the best option. I'm just wondering as you look at the Starbucks business in China, what's different that gives you confidence that the right approach is to focus entirely on company ownership, especially with all those promotional and disruption activity? Thank you.","Kevin Johnson","John, you want to take the first one on China?","John Culver","Yes. Jeff, for us on China and in particular on delivery, we feel that we are well positioned from a price value perspective with our customers. And we always assess this but when you look at the experience that we provide, the investments that we've made into the delivery experience to make sure that the quality of the product is there and the true differentiators that customers have come to expect around Starbucks; we feel that we are well positioned to win in the delivery space in China. We'll continue to monitor but I would just say that we are positioned well in the short-term, as well as the long-term to capture the delivery opportunity.","Kevin Johnson","I mean just to add to John's comments, Jeff, a lot of the promotional activity is focused on the beverage, not the delivery fee. So I think the fact that we've launched delivery gives that channel -- customers that want that channel, and so it's less about promotion of the delivery fees, more about promotional activity on the beverages. Pat, you want to take the second question?","Patrick Grismer","I have to tell you, the economics of the Starbucks business in China are dramatically better than the economics of the restaurant business at another company I worked with, and their returns were very good. But when you consider the fact that Starbucks is a beverage-forward concept, Starbucks has dramatically higher cash margins and when you consider the fact that our store investment does not include a traditional kitchen, the sales to investment ratio again is dramatically superior. You combine those two things and what you have is an extraordinary return on investment, that means that it's in the best interest of Starbucks shareholders for us to continue to deploy capital to the development opportunity in China. I think you also have to take into account that given where we're at in the lifecycle of our business in China, we're into early innings; in many respects we're just getting started because of the vast potential we see for the Starbucks concept in China. So absolutely it makes all the sense in the world for Starbucks to continue to deploy capital against the new store development opportunity and to maintain company ownership and operations for the foreseeable future.","Kevin Johnson","And just one other thing I would just add to the comments here on China is, the opportunity that we see in the at-home coffee segment in China through the Global Coffee Alliance also is a big opportunity. As we expand Starbucks brand on the Nespresso and Dolce Gusto platforms, and continue to accelerate the expansion of Starbucks package coffee in home, this is wide space for us in that market and that will further extend our reach and grow the Starbucks brand in the country.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Karen Holthouse with Goldman Sachs.","Karen Holthouse","Kevin, little bit [ph] to the CPG business; the organic growth rate of 1% is certainly lower than what we've had until -- would you attribute that to macro or competitive factors or should we think of some disruptions and distribution and what-not around the transition [indiscernible]. And if it's the later, how long would you expect that to last for?","Patrick Grismer","First, what I'd like to do is to clarify the mechanics of that adjusted 1% growth. For purposes of our access streamline growth calculations we essentially exclude all aspects of the business is now licensed to Nestle leaving only the smaller portions that remain with Starbucks. And although that's the cleanest and the simplest way to remove the impact of the major transaction like this, the calculation itself belies [ph] the underlying growth in our global coffee licensing business. And we think that a more appropriate gauge of the health and growth of our channel business is market share, and so John will share with you a perspective on how our channel business has continued to grow and remain very vibrant, even under this new model, in fact enhanced by this new model.","John Culver","And I would just say Karen, we saw continued share growth momentum in Q1 which was very much in line with our expectations. For the Starbucks brand in total, we grew shares 60 basis points, the roasted ground category grew share 90 basis points, and cake-cups grew shares 30 basis points. So we continue to capture share from the competition, we're very pleased with the transition that's taken place with Nestle, we transitioned over 500 partners to the Global Coffee Alliance, the partnership itself leverages both unique capabilities from both companies, us as the leading premium global coffee brand, them in terms of their global reach and expertise to market sell and distribute across over 190 markets. We feel that we are well positioned with this partnership to continue to drive strong value for the company and for our shareholders.","Operator","Your last question comes from Andrew Charles with Cowen & Company.","Andrew Charles","You're caught in a strong holiday season in the U.S., definitely a nice rebound from last year. During the holidays you ran a TV advertising campaign which is something you guys have done in the past but I was curious if you're pleasing up for the results to take advantage of the brand scale and lean more into TV advertising in calendar 2019 to take advantage of that scale? And then separately, I remember you once previously called out night show contributes about 1% to a store's comps once that's introduced. Is that still the case? Thanks.","Rosalind Brewer","First of all, concerning the media that we ran during the holiday season, it was a benefit for us. We had typically been deeply engaged in a lot of our digital, media and our one-to-one relationship through our digital relationships, and the out-of-store media that we ran was effective for us. We do see every time the Starbucks brand is wildly advertised as it was, we get -- we enjoy the performance that we see. I will tell you too that those commercials, they very well were used; some of our own partners are in those commercials, so they were well received. You will see us in the future do a better balance of out-of-store media, with digital media and we'll do a combined effort unlike what you've seen in the past.","And then your -- the second question that you asked is around nitro; and if we see one point of improvement in our comp performance, I will tell you that our cold beverage platform overall actually does very well for us. When I look at our beverage performance in the holiday, cold espresso did extremely well for us, and we are encouraged by nitro which is why we're expanding it but the 1% comp, I'm not quite sure that I correlate with that number but I will tell you that the cold platform does extremely well for us.","Operator","At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin Johnson for closing remarks.","Kevin Johnson","Well, I want to thank all of you for joining us today. We continue to execute against our growth at scale strategy that we outlined at last month's investor conference. And I think the results that we just posted demonstrates that that strategy is working. Now I also know many of you were able to join us in New York at this opening of the Starbucks Reserve Roastery in December and we're excited to announced that the Tokyo Roastery will open to the public on February 28. So I would invite all of you on your next trip to Tokyo to please stop by and visit this beautiful roaster, and we'd love to host you. Thanks for joining us and we look forward to talking to you again, and we'll see you soon.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you.","Ms. Doraisamy, you may begin your conference.","Durga Doraisamy - Director of Investor Relations","Good afternoon, everyone. This is Durga Doraisamy, Director of Investor Relations for Starbucks Coffee Company. Thank you for joining us today to discuss our second quarter 2016 results which will be led by Howard Schultz, Chairman and CEO; Kevin Johnson, President and COO; and Scott Maw, CFO. Joining us for Q&A are Cliff Burrows, Group President-U.S. and Americas; John Culver, Group President-China\/Asia Pacific, Channel Development and Emerging Brands; Matt Ryan, Global Chief Strategy Officer; and Adam Brotman, Global Chief Digital Officer.","This conference call will include forward-looking statements which are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements. Any such statements should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements in our earnings release and risk factor discussions in our filings with the SEC, including our last annual report on Form 10-K.

Howard?","Howard S. Schultz - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Durga, and welcome, everyone. I taped my conversation today before heading to Johannesburg, where earlier today we opened the first of approximately 150 stores in South Africa, Starbucks's 71st international market.","In Q2, Starbucks' powerful 24,000-store global retail operation again drove record financial and operating performance, including record revenues, record profits, a 7% increase in comp store sales in the U.S., a 6% increase in comp store sales globally, our 25th consecutive quarter of comp store growth at or above 5% and a stunning increase of 5% in transaction growth and 18% in revenue growth in China. And we remain on plan to end fiscal 2016 with approximately 25,000 stores globally. Our recent classes of new and remodeled retail stores continue to defy established consumer trends away from traditional bricks-and-mortar retailing and deliver record-breaking unit sales, unit economics and return on investment; very strong performance metrics that underscore the increasing power and relevance of the Starbucks brand around the world.","In light of two very favorable recent developments, I'd like to take a few moments to frame for you the enormity of the near-in and long-term global single-serve opportunity that lies ahead for Starbucks. As many of you know, the last five years Starbucks has built a powerful, sustainable, premium single-serve business, operating on the Keurig K-Cup rails. And today, Starbucks has the leading U.S. market share of both premium single-serve and of premium roast and ground and is the leading brand on the K-Cup platform.","In 2016, we will sell approximately 1.5 billion Starbucks K-Cups, up almost 20% over last year and representing multiples of K-Cup category growth overall. Last month, we extended our relationship with Keurig on highly favorable terms that provide us with improved economics and increased operating flexibility, including the ability to sell directly into office and other complementary highly profitable channels of distribution. The Starbucks single-serve aspirations do not end with North America, nor do they end with K-Cup, and now we have capability and a clear line of sight on a second equally attractive single-serve opportunity. Because while Keurig has the dominant share of single-serve brewers in North America, it has virtually no share or relevant brewer product anywhere beyond North America.","Outside of North America is Nestl\u00e9's Nespresso unit that has the leading share of premium single-serve, with a rapidly growing installed base of what we estimate to be over 25 million largely espresso-based brewers in homes around the world. Nespresso also has a strong presence in global away-from-home and hospitality channels utilizing the same capsule design it uses for at home. So here's the opportunity, and it's big.","For years, customers have been asking us to produce Starbucks branded Nespresso-compatible capsules so they could enjoy Starbucks's quality and espresso varietals through their Nespresso machines, just as they do through their K-Cup brewers in North America. But we could not satisfy that demand because we had not yet cracked the code on roasting, grinding, and packing Starbucks Coffee in order to deliver Starbucks quality in a cup through a Starbucks-designed Nespresso compatible capsule. But now we have. And as we announced at our Annual Shareholders Meeting last month, starting this fall, we will begin leveraging our retail, CPG, e-commerce, digital and loyalty assets in order to market Starbucks's espresso varietals directly to Nespresso's installed customer base.","We're starting with Europe, Nespresso's largest market, and where in some countries single-serve represents over 40% of all coffee consumed, and 50% of our best Starbucks customers own a Nespresso machine at home. And in the future, we will begin selling Starbucks branded Nespresso compatible pods in additional Starbucks retail markets around the world.","Improved economics and increased flexibility with Keurig in North America will combine with the new global opportunity presented by Starbucks Nespresso compatibles to enable us to substantially increase the size and profitability of our single-serve business overall and to add significant shareholder value in the quarters and years ahead.","We also have big long-term plans for single-serve across CAP and in China. As the only truly global premium coffee brand, particularly in China, we are ideally positioned to leverage our deep connection to our customers and our unique retail store footprint to be on the forefront of single-serve in all CAP markets as the morning and at-home coffee ritual evolves.","Let me turn to China. Starbucks has committed to China, and we now have over 2,000 stores in 100 cities in China and are adding over 10 new stores every week. Our business in China remains very strong, and I personally have no doubt that the Chinese government's commitment to true economic reform is genuine and that its plan to double 2010 per capita income by 2021, resulting in a middle-class in China approaching 600 million people, almost twice the size of the entire current U.S. population, is achievable.","We are building our business in China through the lens and with the learnings of the success of our business in the U.S. We're building trust in the Starbucks brand and deep authentic connections between our customers and our partners. We're continuing to deliver an elevated in-store experience for our customers, we're increasingly, established Starbucks as a third place between home and work, and we're giving back to the communities we serve, all of which are enabling us to strengthen the equity of the Starbucks brand and develop and expand our retail, license and CPG businesses and partnerships.","Our partnership with Tingyi that will provide us with over 1 million points of ready-to-drink Frappuccino distribution in China beginning later this quarter is just one notable example, and there will be many that will follow. Today, not only are we building our brand and a great retail store business in China, but we are building a unique retailing capability that separates us from all other retailers and consumer brands and that we will leverage to continue growing our China business long into the future.","And on June 16, we will open in China what will, in all probability, become the Starbucks highest grossing retail store in the world virtually overnight. It is a stunning new Starbucks store at the main entrance of the new Shanghai Disneyland, a destination that may well become the number one tourist attraction in Asia. Our new Shanghai Disneyland store will showcase the Starbucks experience in all its glory and our premium coffee position and once again underscore the power and the relevance of the Starbucks brand in China and in CAP overall. We're honored that the Disney Company chose Starbucks to so prominently greet its guests at the entrance of the new park.","I am more convinced than ever that Starbucks is just getting started in China, and I am equally convinced that as we fully roll out our new partnerships with the leading digital companies and brands in China and leverage our unique digital, mobile, card, gifting and loyalty programs across our business in China later this year and ultimately across CAP overall, we will perform at even higher levels of success and profitability in the future than we do today.","Starbucks continues to redefine the customer-facing mobile and retail experience of the future. Kevin will be taking you through how we are combining proprietary technologies, digital engagement and customer loyalty to create and leverage a dynamic, integrated digital and mobile ecosystem that will continue to (10:35) business and propel it forward, including providing additional details around our Stars Everywhere initiative, the unique and highly opportunistic partnership we recently announced with JPMorgan Chase and Visa, and our breakthrough initiatives around personalization that are enabling us to deliver highly targeted and highly profitable one-to-one marketing programs to our customers wherever they may be.","I am particularly proud to report that we grew our MSR loyalty program 8% by adding approximately 1 million new members in Q2 alone and that we now have over 12 million active My Starbucks Rewards members in the U.S. And the MSR program changes that took effect on April 12 will, for the first time, reward both customer frequency and overall spend, resulting in increased rewards for our best customers at the same time as it enhances in-store efficiency, speed of service and our customer experience overall.","I'd like to speak for a moment about the excitement we have about the Roastery in the context of Starbucks's overall brand architecture. Our Seattle Roastery continues to delight our customers and perform well ahead of original expectations. Based on experience to date, our current view is that we will ultimately open between 7 and 10 full scale Roasteries around the world in key global cities. Our second Roastery will be opening in New York's Meatpacking District on the corner of 9th Avenue and 15th Street, next to the heavily trafficked Chelsea Market, directly across the street from Google's headquarters and adjacent to Apple's downtown store in 2018. And soon we will be announcing details of our third Roastery, which will be in CAP.","In addition to providing an immersive customer experience with the Roastery and through the discipline and the opportunity of segmentation, we have been building a new premium brand, Starbucks Reserve. Starbucks Reserve are ultra-premium, micro-lot, single varietal coffees that are being sold at premium prices through select Starbucks stores around the world, creating both increased profitability and further separation from our competitors. And we will continue to open coffee-forward Starbucks stores with elevated Reserve beverage and holding products like those in Williamsburg, Brooklyn; Chelsea, London; and across Asia.","Now, following the success and the learnings from these stores, we will be opening a new class of Reserve stores beginning in fiscal 2017. We believe we have significant runway to grow and develop our Starbucks Reserve brand on a global basis.","Starbucks's performance in Q2 demonstrates the continued success of our commitments to delivering an elevated Starbucks experience to our customers and world-leading financial and operating performance and long-term sustainable, profitable growth to our shareholders. With humility, our performance in Q2 is particularly gratifying in that it was achieved in the face of very challenging consumer, geopolitical and economic environments.","And with that, from South Africa, I turn the call over to Kevin. Kevin?","Kevin R. Johnson - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Thank you, Howard, and good afternoon, everyone. Howard touched upon several highlights from the quarter. I will add additional color on our performance and provide further evidence that our strategies for growth are working. And I'll again demonstrate how we are being deliberate and focused in connection with the investments we are making for our future.","Let's start with the Americas segment. We now have over 15,000 stores throughout the Americas business comprised of nearly 9,000 company operated and over 6,000 licensed stores. Our Americas business continued its track record of delivering consistent, profitable growth with revenue up 10% over last year and record operating margins. Americas comp sales included a 3% increase in transactions and a 5% increase in ticket, rounding to a 7% increase in comp (14:48).","Our store (14:51) strategy is enabling the introduction of new store formats and faster and more efficient drive-throughs, express stores, and beautiful renovations that provide our customers not only with increased convenience, but a more inviting and comfortable third-place environment. This approach is enabling record-setting unit volume in our new stores.","The morning daypart, once again our fastest-growing daypart, grew 13% year-on-year, driven by Mobile Order & Pay, strong performance from our core brewed and espresso product lineup and breakfast sandwiches. Flat White and cold brew both continued to gain traction and customer acceptance and drive food attach. In addition to our hot beverage lineup, our expanded iced beverage business is resonating with customers. Our tea business in particular had its strongest quarter in over a year, up 17% year-on-year and contributing one point of comp, fueled by an accelerating sales of Teavana handcrafted tea beverages in Starbucks retail stores.","Creating new customer occasions and driving increased attach are key priorities for our food programs, and we made great progress with our food business this quarter, growing revenues 16% year-on-year and contributing over two points to our comp, with every daypart contributing to this increase. Breakfast sandwiches continue to be a strong driver of the business, delivering nearly 30% revenue growth and driving both traffic and increased attach in the morning daypart. Our innovative new lineup of lunch offerings delivered an 18% year-on-year increase in food revenue during the lunch daypart. And we continue to test and learn as we shape our evenings program. For the first time ever, food represented more than 20% of revenue in the U.S. Our Americas segment had an outstanding Q2.","Let's now move on to the CAP segment. The China\/Asia Pacific business delivered another solid quarter with revenues increasing 14% and operating income up 15% over Q2 a year ago. Noteworthy is that this is the first full quarter in which our 1,100-store Japan retail business was fully included in both our CAP comp and revenue base, resulting in CAP comp growth of 2% in traffic and 2% in ticket, rounding to 3% overall. We now operate over 5,900 stores in CAP, including over 2,000 in Mainland China in more than 100 cities.","Despite moderating GDP growth in China, Starbucks China grew revenues 18% and transactions 5% in the quarter. We saw particularly strong transaction growth in the largest cities, and our newest China stores continue to deliver record-breaking volume and profit, once again demonstrating the increasing strength and relevance of the Starbucks brand in the China market. As Howard mentioned, we will leverage our loyalty and digital flywheel in China with the rollout of certain features this year and full digital capabilities over time. Our China\/Asia Pacific business continues to perform extremely well, reinforcing our confidence in the long-term growth potential of this market. While Starbucks is not immune to cyclical changes in the Chinese economy, our long-term outlook remains strong, and we're committed to increasing our store count to over 3,400 in China and to over 10,000 in CAP overall by the end of 2019 \u2013 fiscal 2019.","Let's move on to EMEA. We continue to build our 2,500-store EMEA business by increasing our store count, entering new countries, including Luxembourg in Q2, with South Africa, Slovakia and Andorra opening this quarter, and introducing new food and beverage offerings. Overall, we added 47 net new stores in EMEA, all in conjunction with licensee partners at high traffic venues such as train stations, airports, supermarkets and through geographic licensees such as Alshaya in the Middle East. We continue to see strong affinity with the brand as evidenced by the opening of our first Starbucks store in Strasbourg, France where hundreds of energized customers lined up to be among the first in the market to enjoy the Starbucks experience.","Company-operated EMEA stores delivered a 1% comp sales increase in the quarter, the 12th consecutive quarter of positive comp growth. With 72% of EMEA stores now licensed or franchised, total system comps are becoming increasingly relevant. Adjusting for continued mix shift from company-owned to licensed and foreign exchange headwinds, which together impacted revenue growth by 11 points, EMEA on an adjusted revenue basis would deliver growth of 7% and system comp growth of 4%, as well as increasing operating income in the quarter. This was in an extremely challenging consumer, economic, geopolitical environment across the region and reinforces the strength and resilience of the Starbucks brand in EMEA.","Looking ahead, we expect to see a continued mix shift to licensed stores in EMEA, where yesterday we announced entry into an agreement to license all 144 of our stores in Germany to an existing licensee partner, AmRest Holdings. This strategy supports our focus on store growth and expanded operating income.","Let's move on to Channel Development. Our Channel Development segment plays a key role in elevating the Starbucks brand outside of our retail stores. Channel Development has become our second most profitable business segment and once again delivered record revenue and record operating income, growing 8% and 17% respectively. Starbucks has the leading U.S. market share of premium single-serve on the K-Cup platform and premium roast and ground. And this quarter, we expanded our market share position in both of those categories. Our new partnership agreement with Keurig provides us with both improved economics and increased operating flexibility, including the ability to sell directly into complementary profitable channels of distribution, such as hospitality, college\/university and office where we consistently grow our business at two times to three times the industry rate.","Our success in single-serve in the U.S. provides the foundation for a larger aspiration around the single-serve opportunity globally. Later this year, we will introduce the Nespresso-compatible Starbucks capsules in Europe as one step toward building a business that one day may rival the size and profitability of our single-serve business in North America. Our ready-to-drink business in North America continued to see very strong performance in the quarter driven by new beverage innovation, including iced black coffee, refreshers with coconut water and product line extensions for Frappuccino and Doubleshot Energy drinks.","Outside of North America, we continue to make meaningful progress building our global CPG footprint. Our partnership with Tingyi is on track to launch this summer where we will move to a national presence with distribution in nearly every major city in China. Through our new agreement with PepsiCo Latin America, we are enabling distribution in the Latin American market in the second half of this year. Starbucks Channel Development segment continues to perform extremely well and plays a key role in elevating our brand globally.","Let's now move on to the progress we are making on our loyalty and digital initiatives. Loyalty remains the cornerstone of our digital flywheel. And in late February, we announced changes to our Starbucks Rewards program that benefit our most loyal customers by leveling the playing field and rewarding both transaction frequency and total spend. With these changes, we also laid the foundation for customers to earn Stars Everywhere which accelerates the pace at which customers earn rewards redeemable only at Starbucks. Rewards membership has accelerated. Just last week alone, we added more than 280,000 new Rewards members. Engaging with these new Rewards members will enable us to accelerate growth of our active Starbucks Rewards customer base.","Besides bringing us new customers, the program also addresses an operational challenge where under the old program, customers would ask baristas to ring up each item individually in order to get multiple stars, a time-consuming process that created additional work for our baristas, slowed service and lengthened lines. By completely eliminating any incentive to order split, we will improve in-store operations and efficiency and increase line speed.","I want to take a moment to underscore that the changes in our rewards program will be accretive to comps over time. As we mentioned during our February Starbucks Rewards conference call, as a result of the changes to the program, we anticipate a shift of about one point of comp between transaction and ticket. Also, we may see some noise in Q3 comps as customers react to the new changes of the program; Scott will speak to this further in a moment.","At the end of the quarter, we had 12 million active Starbucks Rewards customers in the U.S. with total program spend growth of 22% year-on-year. We've seen additional growth in active Reward customers since the launch of the new program last week. Our new mobile app continues to be very well received where today over 86% of our iPhone customers and 79% of our Android customers have already upgraded to the new version of the Starbucks mobile app that released just last week. And we now have almost 19 million users of our mobile app in the U.S. alone. Mobile payment represented 24% of total U.S. tender in Q2, and Mobile Order & Pay continues to be increasingly embraced by our customers. It adds incrementality, especially at peak. Mobile Order & Pay transactions represented approximately 4% of total transactions in the quarter, which was a 40% increase sequentially.","We are just beginning to see the full benefit of Mobile Order & Pay beyond the speed and convenience it affords to both our customers and partners. Consider this: though still in its infancy, in 300 of our busiest urban stores, Mobile Order & Pay represents over 10% of transactions. And in those same stores at peak, Mobile Order & Pay represents nearly 20% of transactions. In Portland, where we first introduced Mobile Order & Pay in December of 2014, Mobile Order & Pay transaction volume in March was up approximately 150% from March of last year.","The new Starbucks Rewards program and Starbucks mobile app have positioned us for two very exciting initiatives that you will see unfold later this year. The first initiative through a partnership with JPMorgan Chase and Visa is truly a first of its kind. A Starbucks general purpose prepaid Visa card that will enable Starbucks Reward customers to earn Stars Everywhere Visa is accepted. That's 40 million merchants worldwide. And where all stars earned can only be redeemed at Starbucks, we think this is a big win for our customers.","In the U.S., total annual spending on credit and debit cards totaled around $9 trillion annually, roughly half on credit and half on debit cards. While the majority of credit cards in use today offer rewards or points, typically with an annual fee, there is no meaningful debit-based rewards card program out there. That means that on more than $4 trillion of annual consumer spending, virtually no one using a debit card is getting rewards. Not anymore. This new Starbucks general purpose prepaid reloadable debit card is unique, and not only is it a win for customers, it is also a win for Starbucks by strengthening our customer engagement and providing us with a direct financial reward for every customer we sign up and leading to attractive interchange rates. Stay tuned for more details about the card and signup information later this year.","The second exciting initiative evolves around the work we are doing to enable real-time personalization. Let me frame this for you. A major contributor to the success of our rewards program has been the targeted offers that we have made to customers via e-mail. Since launching our targeted offer program in the 2013, we have been providing ways for customers to earn extra stars for purchasing certain items or making additional visits to our stores. However, existing technology had constrained our ability to laser target, respond in the moment, and vary our digital content based on what we know to be an individual customer's preferences and behaviors. All that is changing as we begin to introduce true real-time personalization across our entire digital ecosystem.","Following the successful implementation of the first wave of this new technology, we can now send significantly improved targeted communications to individual customers based on what we know about their specific tastes and interests, enabling us to become even more relevant to them. Over time, we will expand this capability to a more robust mobile app centric model that enables us at the very moment a customer orders to provide relevant suggestions and recommendations and, when appropriate, incentivized offers to delight our customers. As you can see, we are managing a significant number of accretive changes related to loyalty, digital and Stars Everywhere.","A few words on the success of the investments we continue to make in our partners and the work we're doing to improve the partner experience overall. Creating an enhanced Starbucks experience for our customers and an authentic and personal connection between our customers and our partners is core to the Starbucks experience. Last year, we began rolling out a number of significant investments in support of our in-store partners that included increased barista and shift supervisor pay rates, additional performance-based recognition, updates to our dress code, a new food benefit, as well as enhancements to our College Achievement program. These investments are paying off. We continue to see increases in partner retention, which is enabling better customer connections, and customer connection is a key driver of our record Q2 performance. As you can see, our results provide powerful evidence that our strategies and focused investments are paying off today, and setting us up for continued growth in the future.","With that, I'll turn the call over to our CFO, Scott Maw. Scott?","Scott Harlan Maw - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Kevin, and good afternoon, everyone. Starbucks once again delivered very strong operating and financial performance in Q2 with record Q2 performance across virtually all of our operating and profitability measures, including revenue, operating income, operating margin, and EPS. Noteworthy is that our revenues in Q2 were the highest of any non-holiday quarter in our history. EPS both GAAP and non-GAAP increased 18% to $0.39 in Q2, the top end of our guidance range. Non-GAAP operating income increased 11% over Q2 last year to $887 million, while non-GAAP operating margin expanded 30 basis points to 17.6%.","Margin improvement in Q2 was driven by sales leverage that more than offset the impact of ongoing investments, particularly in our partners and our digital platforms. It's important to note this quarter that our consolidated operating margin also reflects dilution from a multi-year employment tax audit accrual. More specifically, our 30 basis point increase in operating margin would have been 40 basis points higher or 70 basis points in total, and our operating income growth would have been 240 basis points higher than the reported 11% or 14% with rounding. The impact of this G&A related accrual was largely offset below the operating income line in Q2 income taxes, and is expected to be entirely offset in federal income tax expense by fiscal year-end, resulting in no impact to earnings for full year 2016.","You may recall that our Investor Day in December 2014, we discussed the importance of reversing the negative leverage we were seeing on cost of goods sold and G&A. I am pleased to report that the plans we put in place to do so are working and that on top of the significant progress we made on that front last year, so far this year we are seeing an additional 60 basis points of COGS and occupancy leverage driven mostly by COGS and 40 basis points of G&A leverage.","Return on invested capital expanded by over 100 basis points in the first half of 2016 compared to the prior year, once again reflecting excellent returns on our core businesses and demonstrating the outsized return we are generating on many of our significant newer investments. And our reported record Q2 results became even more noteworthy in light of the fact that foreign currency translation shaved a full point off revenue and two points off operating income growth in the quarter.","I'll now take you through how each of our major operating segments performed in Q2. In Q2, our Americas segment operating margin expanded 80 basis points over Q2 last year to 23.5%, primarily driven by sales leverage and favorable commodity costs, partially offset by ongoing store partner and digital platform investments, that together adversely impacted operating margin by 100 basis points in the quarter. Noteworthy again, as we mentioned last quarter, is that we continue to see essentially no net cannibalization of existing stores as we expand our store footprint in the Americas and leverage our full portfolio of new and existing store formats. For the full fiscal year, we continue to expect the Americas segment to deliver moderate margin expansion over prior year.","Let's move on to our China\/Asia Pacific segment. In Q2, on a GAAP basis, CAP operating income grew 15% over last year to a Q2 record $129 million, and operating margin expanded 20 basis points to 19.1%, driven primarily by strong sales leverage and higher income from our joint venture operations partially offset by the impact of foreign currency translation and the impact of increased compensation and benefit costs and store operating expenses. Excluding the 90 basis point impact of foreign exchange, CAP margins expanded by 110 basis points in the quarter.","Profitability of our Japan and China store portfolio continues to increase with our profitability of our store class up nicely from the previous age class. And as Kevin mentioned, returns on our new stores in these two important markets are among the highest Starbucks is generating anywhere in the world. For the full fiscal year 2016, we expect CAP revenue growth to be within our previously stated mid-teens target range and CAP margins are now expected to be roughly flat compared to 2015 levels.","We also still expect CAP comps for the year to be in the mid-single digits despite falling just below that threshold for the current quarter, somewhat impacted by the addition of our Japan business into the CAP comp calculation. Japan is the largest component of the CAP comp base with a weighting of just over 50% of the total.","Turning to EMEA, EMEA's operating margin declined 10 basis points in Q2 relative to last year to 10.3%, largely due to certain gains in the prior year related to the sale of assets as we shifted more stores from company operated to our licensed model. Excluding these gains and the impact of FX headwinds, EMEA's operating margin expanded slightly in Q2. As Kevin mentioned, our licensed stores in EMEA showed strong comp and profitability growth in Q2 and income from licensees now represents roughly 60% of the total operating income we generate from EMEA. Despite challenging macroeconomic, geopolitical and consumer environments that persist across the EMEA region, we remain confident that EMEA's operating margins will approach 15% in fiscal 2016, once again up nicely over the prior year.","Our Channel Development segment had another very strong quarter in Q2. Operating margin increased 300 basis points in the quarter to 39.5%, and operating income reached a new quarterly record of $182 million, up 17% over last year driven primarily by cost of sales leverage, favorable coffee costs and higher income from our North American Coffee Partnership with Pepsi. For the full fiscal year, we expect Channel Development to increase revenues by approximately 10% year-over-year with the back half of the year growing in the high single digits following the 12% growth rate we saw in the first six months.","Channel Development's record breaking Q1 performance, very strong Q2 results and positive outlook for the balance of the year has us confident that the segment will post moderate margin expansion in fiscal 2016 over last year. Given the momentum we are seeing in the business, we are also expecting strong operating leverage over the next two quarters.","Given the excellent performance across the company year-to-date, we are moving the bottom end of our fiscal year 2016 EPS range up slightly from our previous guidance while retaining the top-end. GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.85 to $1.86 and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.88 to $1.89 including the 53rd week, which by our rough estimate adds approximately $0.06 to Q4. For Q3, we are expecting GAAP EPS in the range of $0.47 to $0.48 and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.48 to $0.49. For the full year, foreign exchange is now expected to negatively impact revenue growth by one point to two points and operating income growth by two points to three points. We continue to expect to grow revenues by 10% or greater on a 52-week basis with the 53rd week adding approximately two points to the full fiscal year figure. And we remain confident in our ability to deliver comp sales growth somewhat above the mid-single digits for the full fiscal year 2016. But as Kevin indicated, there exists the potential for some bumpiness in Q3 as a result of the Starbucks Rewards program changes that took effect earlier this month. And as we mentioned on our February Starbucks Rewards conference call, going forward we expect to see a point or so of movement between traffic and ticket within comp in each of the next four quarters as our customers adapt to the changes.","Noteworthy is that given the significant value and benefits conferred on our customers in the new program, we fully expect the changes to be accretive to each of comps, revenue and profitability over time. The investment in our partner and digital initiatives globally will total between $275 million and $300 million in fiscal 2016 compared to approximately $145 million in fiscal 2015. And the benefits and the returns we are realizing from these investments are becoming increasingly apparent. We continue to expect consolidated operating margin for fiscal 2016 to increase slightly relative to 2015 on both GAAP and non-GAAP basis, reflecting strong revenue growth, sales leverage and increased operating efficiency and performance, partially offset by the impact of increased partner and digital investments.","Moving on to commodities, with 2016 costs coffee needs fully priced, we expect a slightly favorable impact for the year. We will continue to take careful advantage of lower coffee prices while ensuring that we source only the highest quality coffee and provide fair economics to coffee growers around the globe. We expect to add approximately 1,800 net new stores globally in fiscal 2016, 700 in Americas, 900 in China\/Asia Pacific, and 200 in EMEA. The outlook for our effective tax rate is now expected to be approximately 34%, and we still expect capital expenditures of $1.4 billion for fiscal 2016.","Finally, with the strong cash flows driven by our record-breaking holiday period, we took advantage of recent equity market volatility and significantly increased our share buyback activity since the end of Q1. We returned $1.6 billion to shareholders in Q2 alone, the highest amount in any single quarter in our 24-year history as a publicly-traded company, with share repurchases in the quarter nearly equal to buyback activity in all of 2015. And as we announced today, our Board of Directors recently increased our share buyback authority by an additional 100 million shares.","As I mentioned at the outset, Q2 was another quarter of strong growth and excellent financial, operating and profit performance for Starbucks. And once again, the credit goes to our partners around the world who continue to deliver an elevated Starbucks experience to our customers every day.","The tremendous momentum we have created over the first half of fiscal 2016 ideally positions us to benefit from the investments we are making in our partners, in our stores, and in groundbreaking innovation and to continue delivering world-class returns to our shareholders. And we will do so despite today's challenging global economic and geopolitical landscape.","Now, we'll turn the call back to the operator for Q&A. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from David Palmer with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. Good evening. With regard to the rewards switch that you just mentioned and that noise that you mentioned that tradeoff of one point to two points, is there a net drag to overall same store sales that you're seeing so far, or is this simply just an exaggerated version of the traffic versus check tradeoff that you expected earlier?","Scott Harlan Maw - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, thanks, David. We're not trying to signal any trends that we're seeing early in the quarter or post launch. And in fact, as Kevin referenced, we have seen an increase in account activity and customer acceptance post launch. All we're trying to say is this is a big change. It's a very positive change. We're bullish on it in the long-term. But it's a big change in customers. We've got a number of plans in place to leverage the new program, and we'll keep an eye on things as the quarter moves on. But you notice we haven't changed our guidance for the year, and we're not trying to signal anything about intra-quarter trends.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thank you. There's been a lot of focus on getting COGS leverage and G&A leverage over the past couple of years. So the question is really on the labor expense at the store where you have been making significant investments over the last four quarters or so. So as we think about over the next year, do those increases in labor costs begin to slow, and is there anything that Starbucks can do to begin to get more efficiency out of that line which has been deleveraging?","Scott Harlan Maw - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Right. What I would say, John, is we expect to continue to make those partner in digital investments as we move through time. We know that they're driving comps. We have talked before about the tie between the changes we made about a year ago in pay for our U.S. store partners and the increase in comps that started at the same time. And in fact, what we see is at the stores that have the lowest turnover, they have the highest comps. And we've seen turnover tick down since we've made those changes. So it's all tied together, it's highly accretive and highly profitable. So we'll continue to make those investments.","And as we go into each year, we'll talk a little bit about the size of those investments, the impact on leverage. But there are other places in the P&L that we can go to continue to grow EPS at 15% to 20%, which is our long-term range, G&A and COGS just being two of them. And then (44:50) and the team have done a nice job driving productivity on \u2013 in the stores and Mobile Order & Pay has been a key aspect of that to help us with throughput at peak. And as Kevin said, peak was once again our fastest-growing daypart in this quarter. Last quarter, it was our fastest-growing daypart in over five years. And as you know, last quarter is the first quarter we had Mobile Order & Pay fully rolled out and what we're seeing, based upon the numbers that Kevin showed, is in those busiest stores at peak, Mobile Order & Pay is driving significant productivity and throughput. So those are all places elsewhere in the P&L we can go to fund the investments we need to drive growth.","Operator","Your next question comes from Joe Buckley with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Joseph Terrence Buckley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. I was wondering, in the CAP segment, if you could be a little bit more specific on the same store performance in both Japan and China?","John Winchester Culver - Group President-China\/Asia Pacific, Channel Development and Emerging Brands","Yeah, Joe. This is John. First off, obviously, from a CAP perspective, the composition of comp has changed dramatically over the past year with the weighting of Japan coming in. If you go back a year ago, sequentially Japan was not included in the comp base at all in 2015 and it was only partially included in Q1, and now we have it fully included in Q2. When you look at the total comp growth for the region, we came in at a rounding basis of 3%. 2% of that was transactions and 2% was ticket. But more importantly, when you go into China and you dig underneath China, we delivered a 5% transaction growth rate across the country. And when you dig even deeper into that, in our Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities where we have over 65% of our stores, we outpaced that 5% growth \u2013 transaction growth rate significantly. So for us, we have great optimism around the opportunity that exists for us in China as well as in Japan. We continue to see very strong new store performance, as Scott highlighted, in both China and Japan, with record revenues and record sales results and significant return on investment. So for us, we remain very bullish on the opportunity that exists not only in China, but then also across the entire segment.","Scott Harlan Maw - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","And I would add, in those larger cities, that's where we have most of our new store growth targeted. And so that's why you see revenue growth at 18% and the overall CAP segment continuing to drive the profitability and revenue growth that we expect.","Operator","Your next question comes from Keith Siegner with UBS. Your line is open.","Keith R. Siegner - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you. Just two quick questions on Channel Development. The first one, it sounds like there's so much good stuff coming later this year: new economics with K-Cups, we've got Nespresso-compatible pods, we've got ready-to-drink options expanding. There's a lot of moving pieces that sound very beneficial. But yet you mentioned lower revenue growth in the second half. Maybe you could talk through why?","And then the second part of it would be, against the five-year operating profit targets that you laid out in December 2014, one of them was doubling Channel Development. Would all of these new announcements that you made, are we still within that target? Could this actually outpace that target? Where are we against that five-year plan? Thanks.","John Winchester Culver - Group President-China\/Asia Pacific, Channel Development and Emerging Brands","Yeah, Keith, this is John. Let me take the first part of the question, and then I'll turn the second piece over to Scott. And clearly, Channel Development continues to perform very, very strong for us as a company with the 8% revenue and 17% income growth in the quarter. We are gaining share across all categories that we operate in, whether it's the roast and ground category, premium coffee, or K-Cups. This was our 17th consecutive quarter of share growth in the Channel Development business across all categories. And in the quarter, we grew five times the category average and our shares increased over 100 basis points. Roast and ground, we now have a 25.3% share growth and K-Cups share now sits at 16.3%.","And when you look at the success that we're having in channels, a couple things are driving it. First, it's the execution that we're seeing in the stores and the merchandising that we're doing and the fact that we're winning down the aisle. It's the fact that we're increasing our points of distribution. We've seen significant success with the larger pack size that we've introduced and clearly that's been driving our share gains across all our major categories.","In addition, we've taken the My Starbucks Rewards program and introduced that down the aisle as well, where in the quarter we saw an 18% increase in the number of codes that were redeemed and today we have over 20 million codes entered by over 2 million MSR customers in the CPG segment. So for us, we're very encouraged by the results that we're seeing in the category and in the segment, and we're very bullish on continuing to deliver that double-digit growth for the entire year as we look to finish out the year strong.","Scott Harlan Maw - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, Keith, on your second question, what I would say is in the near term, the new Green Mountain agreement doesn't go into place until later this quarter. So not \u2013 a little bit more than a quarter impact in this year's earnings. Over the long-term, there could be upside to the range that we gave back at Investor Day, and I think one of the key pieces to that is all of the international opportunities that Kevin and John laid out. And so I think as you look at international CPG growth, particularly over the medium-term, out a couple, three years, once the partnerships get up and running and we get product rolling off the lines, if those things go as well as we expected, there could be some upside there.","John Winchester Culver - Group President-China\/Asia Pacific, Channel Development and Emerging Brands","Yeah, Keith, and just one other thing I would just add on the K-Cup opportunity, when you look at K-Cups, we grew more than three times the rate of the category this past quarter. And the new Keurig agreement gives us an opportunity to extend the agreement, number one, on very favorable terms. We have improved economics coming in, as Scott highlighted. But more importantly, we have greater operating flexibility in terms of being able to drive more innovation into the K-Cup category, additional SKUs, and new packaging. And we also have the opportunity to now sell the K-Cups directly into office, into food service, college and universities, hotels, and C stores. So, we're on track this year to do about 1.5 billion K-Cups, and we expect this category to push near the 20% growth rate for the entire year for us. So very optimistic on the opportunity that K-Cups has.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Glass with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks very much. I just want to go back to the Americas traffic of 3%. You seem very pleased with the throughput given mobile ordering. Is there other constraints in other parts of the business? I mean, the 5% and the 3% don't add up to \u2013 they add up to 8% to 7%, so one of those or both of those are probably a little less than a whole number.","And just as a related question, in my observation, does the new chip credit cards \u2013 has that slowed transactions down, for example? Are there obvious bottlenecks or maybe just a little color around that in general, please?","Clifford Burrows - Group President-Americas, US & Teavana Region","Yeah, thanks, John. I have to say I'm really pleased with the traffic we're seeing. The 3% on traffic and the 5% on ticket, as you say, rounding to a 7%. It's our 25th consecutive quarter of 5% or better comp growth for the Americas. At the same time, we're seeing very, very strong growth in our new stores, and they are adding, in total, 4% to our revenue growth. So things are very, very healthy and we're seeing great progress there. Mobile Order & Pay just gets better and better as it becomes a normal part of doing our business. And as you heard earlier, the strength in the higher volume stores at peak gives us confidence we can keep growing our capacity and our comp through the stores.","I think the other thing just to add is daypart. We are seeing growth across all dayparts being led by the morning. So we're very, very pleased with this. And the EMV or the Chip and PIN is negligible at the moment. We're in the early phases of rolling out, and we're just working through the ways that that will be implemented across the system and we're planning for it not to have any impact on transaction speed overall.","Scott Harlan Maw - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","And, Adam, why don't you talk a little bit more about Mobile Order & Pay and what we're seeing?","Adam B. Brotman - Chief Digital Officer","Yeah, thanks. This is Adam. So, first of all, as we mentioned in the remarks earlier, our overall average number of percentage of transactions for Mobile Order & Pay is 4% across all stores, all dayparts, all store types in the U.S. But that's just the beginning of the story with Mobile Order & Pay.","First of all, Kevin mentioned in his remarks, over 10% of all orders at our busiest 300 stores are mobile orders, and it's been noted that we're seeing mobile orders comprise 7% of all orders at our busiest 1,200 stores. So when you really look at our busiest stores, Mobile Order & Pay is very important.","And drilling into that further, when you look at the busiest (54:48) peak for those 300 busiest stores, for example, mobile orders are already approaching 20% of transactions at those peak hours. So you're really seeing how Mobile Order & Pay is benefiting all customers. It's benefiting the overall store performance in all these stores because of the incrementality and throughput unlock. Of course, Mobile Order & Pay is allowing customers convenience so they can have that incremental visit, incremental occasion they wouldn't normally have time for, but it's also driving a huge capacity unlock because of the program. You take 20% of transactions at peak, out of the line, out of POS, and you see it benefit all stores and allow customers to benefit from less people in line and allow partners and customers to benefit from the fact that now our partners can concentrate more of their energy on making food and beverage, on connecting with customers, and that's a big capacity and throughput unlock. And as a result, we're seeing Mobile Order & Pay meet or beat all of our expectations and grow as we mentioned in a way that's very pleasing to us.","Scott Harlan Maw - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","And, John, I'd just also remind you that Cliff's business had nearly 9,000 stores. It's going to approach $15 billion in revenue this year, and it's rounding down this quarter to 7% comps with 3% transaction. Those are really significant numbers, and I just sort of remind everyone of that.","Operator","Your next question comes from Andrew Charles with Cowen & Company. Your line is open.","Andrew Charles - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks. One thing we didn't touch on is with the full quarter of delivery now underway, just was curious about your early learnings from that. Your customers using it primarily in the mornings or is it more balanced over the course of the day relative to in-store transactions? And also, what would lead you to expand the Green Apron Delivery to more stores? What do you need to see before you do that? Thanks.","Adam B. Brotman - Chief Digital Officer","Thanks, Andrew. This is Adam. It's still very early on delivery. So, the headline is that we're continuing to learn. Yes, the orders are in the morning like we're seeing in other examples. But frankly, we're continuing to learn how does this integrate with our technology, what's the customer behavior, what's working well? And so we're not prepared to talk too much about delivery yet while we're still in the learning phase but stay tuned for more in the future.","Operator","Your next question comes from Nicole Miller with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","Nicole M. Miller Regan - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Thanks. Just one question, two quick clarifications, if I may. Back on the Channel Development question earlier, because I think it's an important one, if I recall right, lower coffee prices would be shared with the consumer in Channel Development more so, well, than a retail store, and maybe that's what's driving high single-digit growth because there is discounting. You give back when coffee prices go down, whereas underlying business is still \u2013 when you normalize that growing double digit. I just want to see if that gut check is right.","And then, did Easter have any shift \u2013 any impact, the early Easter, that you would call out? Thanks and congrats on another great quarter.","Scott Harlan Maw - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. Nicole, I think what I would say is we continued to grow volumes significantly independent of price. I will say that both in K-Cups and roast and ground, it's competitive. We continue to gain share in that competitive environment. We continue to outgrow in food service by many times the industry. So we're able to work through that pricing. But we are seeing volume growth somewhat above revenue growth. So I think that lines up with your overall pricing comment.","John Winchester Culver - Group President-China\/Asia Pacific, Channel Development and Emerging Brands","Yeah, Nicole, this is John. I would agree with what Scott said. The volumes when you take pricing out and you just look at total pounds sold, our pounds are outpacing as well. So we feel very confident that the business again is very healthy down the aisle, that we continue to take share, and that we are priced appropriately for the consumer. And we're not only taking it from other premium retailers, but you're seeing the mainstream customers also trading up into the premium segment and trading into Starbucks, frankly.","Scott Harlan Maw - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Any impact from Easter, John?","John Winchester Culver - Group President-China\/Asia Pacific, Channel Development and Emerging Brands","No sequential impact to Easter. We did have a very good Easter holiday, as we did last year.","Scott Harlan Maw - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Great.","Clifford Burrows - Group President-Americas, US & Teavana Region","I'm not sure, Nicole, whether you were commenting on Easter as it refers to the retail business, but here in the U.S., early Easter did not have a material impact. It obviously does change spring breaks, but all in all, it is not significant to the quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays. Your line is open.","Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thank you very much. Maybe just two related questions on the U.S. comp. Just first, it would seem like the compares now \u2013 well, they have been growing increasingly difficult as we move through this whole year, so I am just wondering whether it would be fair to expect the comp deceleration at least on a one-year basis from the current 7%, just based purely on a comparison.","And as a follow-up, I am just wondering whether the offset on that \u2013 or what the offset on that could be? And it would seem like Mobile Order & Pay would be the biggest near-term opportunity to buck that trend. It seems like you're talking quite favorably about the order and pay signup and whatnot. Just wondering whether you can perhaps frame for us where it could go, and I think you said it's now 8 million transactions a month. I think the number was 6 million just last quarter and I know we're in very early ramp-up mode, so I'm just wondering if you had any insight into where that number could go over the next 12 months. Thanks.","Scott Harlan Maw - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","I think I'm going to have Adam start with the mobile order question. I'll talk about U.S. comp guidance, and Cliff can jump in on the operational things we have going.","Adam B. Brotman - Chief Digital Officer","Yeah, Jeffrey. This is Adam. So just in terms of the growth in Mobile Order & Pay, let me touch on a couple of things. One is that you're right, so we had 8 million Mobile Order & Pay transactions per month run rate on this quarter, up from the 6 million the previous quarter. And so you get the 40% sequential growth that Kevin mentioned. You also have the fact that we are seeing a huge number of new capabilities that we're going to be adding to this, which will continue to grow that momentum and accelerate us. So one of them is that we added the ability for customers to redeem their rewards in the Mobile Order & Pay flow just 10 days ago. We're seeing great customer excitement about that. And as I've said before, we're going to continue to add a large number of new features for Mobile Order & Pay, including favorite stores, favorite orders and recommendations in the flow, all of which will contribute to the growing acceleration of Mobile Order & Pay as we move over time.","Scott Harlan Maw - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","And then on guidance, what I would say, Jeffrey, is we're still saying somewhat above mid-single digits for the year. That obviously relies on good performance in the U.S. business, and I'll let Cliff talk to some of the things we have lined up for the back half of the year. It expects good performance in CAP as we look at the back six months and some recovery in EMEA. But as we look forward, we have a number of things in each of those geographies as the summer comes up to drive additional transaction, additional comps (1:02:19) and additional profitability. And I'll let Cliff speak to the (1:02:20).","Clifford Burrows - Group President-Americas, US & Teavana Region","Yeah. Thanks, Scott. It really does start, Mobile Order & Pay. We've got our new Starbucks Rewards, and we're really excited by the early signup and contribution that is going to come from that. We have a fantastic season ahead of us, building on the strength of last year, whether it's Frappuccino or later on in the summer with our cold brewed coffees, our iced coffees and a recent introduction of Nitro into select stores. And we're in the early phase of that. And I think our Teavana iced teas are set for a fantastic season. And all of that is going to be complemented by the continued growth we are seeing in our food in the U.S. now, where we're up to 20% contribution coming from food, and it's the first time we've seen it there, and we continue to see growth in our cold beverages. So we've got a great season ahead.","Scott Harlan Maw - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Matt, maybe talk a little bit about the new rewards program.","Matthew Ryan - Executive Vice President, Global Chief Strategy Officer","Sure. And let me comment first of all that we were a little over a week out from launch here, so these are very early days, but they're very encouraging nonetheless. In addition to the signups we're seeing, the new people raising their hands to join, we're seeing a couple other very encouraging things. Spend per member is up across the board, and I know somebody is going to ask this question, so let me try to get ahead of it here. We do obviously track all cohorts of people in our rewards program, and they are the people who are going to be better off by the new rules, they are going to be the majority of people who are more or less the same and a small minority of people who will earn rewards a little bit slower. All three of those cohorts are up in terms of spend so far. And we see absolutely no difference in the percentage among those three cohorts. So we are not seeing any of the noise that has been speculated on coming to bear. So very encouraging news there. And we'll be keeping a very close eye on it, and obviously, there's a lot of unlocked that comes with the new rewards program as well, too. It's enabling the stars as currency initiatives because of the lowering of the denomination of the star. We have a lot of runway ahead with this, and we're very excited about what it will do in the long-term.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Tarantino with Baird. Your line is open.","David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Hi. Good afternoon. My question actually you just answered on the loyalty program, but I guess as a follow-up to that, the new partnership that you have with the prepaid debit card, I am curious to know how you are planning to support that and how that will work in terms of stars being earned and just what the pace of that rollout and development of that strategy might be? And then, was that the primary motivation for reducing the value of the stars or are there other initiatives that have yet to be announced that are on the way?","Matthew Ryan - Executive Vice President, Global Chief Strategy Officer","Sure. It's a multiple-part question. Let me see if I can remember all of them and get through it. With the program, the timetable for the actual product facing forward to customers will be late this year. The product obviously will work just like the current product works except it will bear the Visa mark on it, and it will be a general purpose stored value card that works everywhere. We'll be announcing all the details about how to sign up and the exact value proposition as we get closer and have a way for customers to sign up. But we're on track to do it this year.","With regard to whether or not that was the primary motivation, the answer is no. There are a number of different things that we're going to be able to do as a result of lowering the denomination of a star. So you can expect this to be the first of a number of partnerships that you'll see down the road in the future.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jason West with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Jason West - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Yeah. Thanks. Sorry to circle back on this again but, Scott, I am just still confused about the message you guys are sending around the rewards change. It sounds like signups are up, you are very happy with the overall program, but you're using the word noise and bumpiness. So I am just trying to understand, are you saying that there has been some customer pushback on the changes and it's going to take time for people to get used to the new system? Or are you saying there has actually been a strengthening in the program? That would be helpful. Thanks.","Scott Harlan Maw - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. I just want to remind, we launched it a week ago. And so the first week metrics that Matt talked about are encouraging. But there's obviously a lot of customer spending and behavior that will happen over the coming weeks. And given the importance of the MSR program and the significance of the changes, we think broadly beneficial. But to some customers, they may not feel so benefited. We want to just make sure we communicate to you guys that there could be some noise. We're not seeing it yet. We'll see how the quarter plays out. So nothing in the early results but this is a big deal for us and we want to make sure we get it right.","Howard S. Schultz - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Scott, can I add something from South Africa about that?","Scott Harlan Maw - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yes.","Howard S. Schultz - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","First of all, I have been very quiet on the phone because you guys are doing such a great job. But it's very odd sitting here in South Africa listening to this. But I think the answer to the question is with great transparency, we just want to make sure that everyone understands this is a complicated change for our customers, lots of training for our people, and I think the better part of valor is just to say to you upfront that there could be some noise in the quarter. We're not signaling anything, but as Matt said, we're building something so significant over the long-term that I wouldn't be so concerned about noise in the quarter if there is some because what's happening here is we're building something so enduring and so unique that I think it's going to be one of the most significant changes to the equity of the brand, customer experience. And as Kevin said earlier, the opportunity for Stars Everywhere in terms of ubiquity of people using that debit card and the only way they can bring back stars and get rewards is to Starbucks is going to be a significant flywheel effect on our overall business. So I think we just wanted to just be open with you about the complication and the degree of the significant change. But the long-term is so beneficial for our customers and obviously to our shareholders.","Scott Harlan Maw - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Howard.","Operator","Your next question comes from Andy Barish with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Andrew Marc Barish - Jefferies LLC","Hey, guys. I want to circle back on Channel Development, more on the profitability side. Margin-wise, you're up 250 basis points in the first half, yet just guiding to moderate improvement for the year. So what are the cost implications or are there things going on with the new Nespresso rollout in the back half of the year with whomever you are using? And actually, who are you using to manufacture those, if you care to share?","Scott Harlan Maw - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","I'll take the first part of the question. I think you can expect to see margin expansion in that same range that you saw in the first half, which is obviously very strong at 250 basis points. I guess it's just the definition of moderate. We continue to see revenue growth opportunities. We continue to take share, and we continue to do that at highly profitable overall margins. And so we see that continuing throughout the rest of this year. And although the Green Mountain change doesn't impact us too much this year just because of the timing of it, that has a chance to help us as we look forward into next year. And I'll let John answer that manufacturing question perhaps.","John Winchester Culver - Group President-China\/Asia Pacific, Channel Development and Emerging Brands","Yeah, Andy, I'm not going to disclose who we're working with from a manufacturing standpoint, only to say that we are in a position now to launch the Nespresso-compatible pods in both our retail stores, as well as through the CPG channels across the U.K. and France later this year. We are focusing first and foremost on Europe because there's 25 million machines of Nespresso machines that are installed there. It's a very similar size right now in comparison to the number of install base on Keurig here in the U.S., and we feel there is a significant opportunity to build this capsule business similar to the way we built the K-Cup business here in the U.S. And as Howard highlighted on his comments, single-serve represents 40% of the coffee consumed in-home in Europe and nearly 50% of our Starbucks customers have Nespresso machines in their homes and so we see this as being a big opportunity.","Beyond Europe, the big size of the prize is going to be in CAP, and more importantly in China, and we are going to continue to look at how we expand the single-serve opportunity as the only truly leading global premium coffee brand in Asia across our store footprint, and really go after this opportunity as well. So looking forward to the growth opportunity that exists both in Europe as well as in Asia around the single-serve opportunity.","Operator","Your next question comes from Karen Holthouse with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Karen Holthouse - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. So I have a question a bit more on the rolling out of a better targeting solution. I'm curious what the end game of this is. Is it something that you think you will be able to better control exactly, what percentage of rewards are redeemed? Does it ultimately lead to more redemptions per person or more traffic per person on the back end of it? And I might have missed it in the prepared remarks, but was there \u2013 is it something that's rolling out now or something that's coming later this year? Thanks.","Matthew Ryan - Executive Vice President, Global Chief Strategy Officer","Sure. Matt Ryan here. We're in the process of rolling that out and you'll see that across the remainder of this year. What we're talking about doing is basically stepping up our game with regard to how we communicate with customers and there are a couple key components to it right now. To date, we've really communicated in a targeted way via e-mail. And as we progress through the year, you're going to begin to see the targeted communication emerge within our digital platform, specifically our app with recommendations. So we don't catch people in the moment right now. We will be catching people in the moment as time goes on, so that's a very important piece.","We also are going to be able to use triggers and to target much more individually than we currently do. We have limitations because of the technology right now on how many different messages we can put out. Those limitations go away with the investments in technology that we've already made. So you'll see, from a customer perspective, more relevant, more targeted messages, some of which will be offers, and that will allow us to basically manage those more economically in the future.","Operator","Your next question comes from Matthew DiFrisco with Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open.","Matthew DiFrisco - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Thank you. I think you may have answered this question in a different way, but I just wanted to make sure that there was specific mention of how you're going to \u2013 you looked at the Mobile Order & Pay transition and also the combination of switching over to the new loyalty program as being accretive to both margins and to the top line over time. I wonder, was that purposely said to say over time? Is there any investment when you switch over in the loyalty program that you might do that might be upfront loaded to hold on to that lower ticket customer that might look at this as his reward program is being devalued a little bit, the guy who spends less than $5 per transaction? I was just curious if that was purposely said over time, meaning there might be some upfront investment to discount that guy or give him extra rewards and target him so you don't \u2013 so you keep him thinking he is getting big rewards.","Scott Harlan Maw - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Matt. No, there's no big upfront investment from a technology standpoint or from any customer standpoint. What I will say is we're obviously investing in marketing and in-store training for partners and messaging for customers just to make sure everyone is crystal clear on the program. And then as we talked about in our February call, we have a number of contingency plans and things that we can do with some of the personalization capabilities that Matt just talked about to target any cohorts of customers that may be displaying lower frequency or different types of behavior. But those won't be expensive. They won't be a big impact in the quarter. I think the only reason we said over time is obviously we expect the momentum to build with this program. Customer will become familiar with it. They'll get used to earning more stars. We'll layer in the Chase opportunity in some of the other Stars Everywhere opportunities, and those will really build. But it will be profitable immediately and build over time.","Matthew Ryan - Executive Vice President, Global Chief Strategy Officer","If I just could add to that. One of the things when you sign up new members, you don't necessarily see all the value in the first few weeks or even first few months of somebody signing up, it is something that laps over time. So as you build the membership of Starbucks Rewards, that is a benefit that keeps on showing up in the results for not just months but years to come.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Palmer with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks for the follow-up. Just a quick one on breakfast sandwiches. Your check growth has been up 5% and I think you said breakfast sandwiches are up 30%. That might be the majority of the check growth, if I'm doing the right math. I guess the question is, how are you doing it? Do you think you can keep it going with regard to that sales layer? Thanks.","Clifford Burrows - Group President-Americas, US & Teavana Region","Matt (sic) [Dave] (1:16:55), we said that breakfast sandwiches were up nearly 30% in the quarter year-on-year, food overall was up 16%, lunch contributed an 18% growth. So you're absolutely right. We're getting some uplift on ticket plus better attach from food. But by no means is that accounting for all of our growth. We continue to focus on price giving us between 1% and 2%, and the rest is from either the swift movement to a higher ticket product or increased attach, and we're seeing a mix of all three of those.","Scott Harlan Maw - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","And, David, I would just add in the morning daypart, the breakfast sandwich is a meaningful contributor, but really it's all three of those items that Cliff outlined: a bit of price, premiumization or up-leveling, and attach at morning and at lunch both very strong.","Operator","The last question comes from R.J. Hottovy with Morningstar. You may ask your question.","R.J. Hottovy - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Thanks. I had a quick follow-up question on the single-serve business and I was particularly struck by Howard's comments about the future opportunity in CAP with the single-serve product. I was just hoping you could give us a preliminary roadmap as to how you see this business evolving over the next couple of years, and in particular if there is any particular hurdles that you have to overcome to really accelerate that business. Thanks.","John Winchester Culver - Group President-China\/Asia Pacific, Channel Development and Emerging Brands","Yeah, thanks, R.J. This is John.","Howard S. Schultz - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","John, can I just...","John Winchester Culver - Group President-China\/Asia Pacific, Channel Development and Emerging Brands","Sure. Go ahead, Howard.","Howard S. Schultz - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","John, can I lead with that and just give it right back to you?","John Winchester Culver - Group President-China\/Asia Pacific, Channel Development and Emerging Brands","Sure.","Howard S. Schultz - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I think John should answer the question specifically, but the thing that I would mention is throughout Asia and specifically Japan and China, we have a very, very large strategic advantage in that distribution in terms of educating the consumer, demonstrating the product and really I think leveraging our ability to educate the customer the way we have just with regard to our basic coffee business. We are in a unique position to leverage the national footprint we have in Japan, in Korea, and obviously in China. And it will be very difficult for the single-serve companies who are in the machine business to really create national distribution. So our ability to leverage the equity of the brand, the in-store experience puts us in a lead position. And I think that, as John said in his comments, there's no global super-premium brand of coffee, and specifically, that doesn't exist at all in Asia other than Starbucks. So we're in a very unique position as we have to train the customer, educate them on all-things-coffee. And as the category evolves, and it certainly will, the biggest prize for single-serve ultimately is going to be China. And our store base is going to give us a tremendous advantage, not if, but when that market emerges.","John, go ahead.","John Winchester Culver - Group President-China\/Asia Pacific, Channel Development and Emerging Brands","Yeah. And the only thing I would add, Howard, to that is the fact that the single-serve business is really \u2013 does not exist in China nor in Asia to any significant degree. So this is all white space. And as Howard said, we are truly the only global premium coffee brand both in Japan, Korea, China, or the rest of Asia that is going to be able to leverage a retail footprint and an awareness and a trust level with our consumers on educating them about in-home consumption of single-serve coffee. So we are building plans as it relates to going after this opportunity, and we will follow up with you on what those plans are going to look like in future calls.","Scott Harlan Maw - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Before we end the call...","Howard S. Schultz - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","It wasn't too long ago \u2013 go ahead, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I was just going to say it wasn't that many years ago where people would not walk in the street holding a Starbucks cup because they might lose faith in Asia. Now, obviously, throughout Asia, specifically Japan and China, that's exactly what's going on. It wasn't that many years ago where the morning ritual did not exist in many of those countries and other than China that it now exists and we're beginning to see it in China. So single-serve is going to be a major business throughout the region, and we're going to be in a winning position to take advantage of it.","Scott Harlan Maw - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Howard, I thought before we ended the call, we would just turn it back to you to see if you had any final comments.","Howard S. Schultz - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I was just saying now that we have opened here in South Africa, this is our 71st country and market, I just wish that the people listening to the call could witness firsthand what we have seen now throughout the world, and that is the universal acceptance of Starbucks Coffee Company and what we're doing in-store, the relationship we have with our partners, the relationship we have with our customers. And I have said for many, many years, these are the still the early days of the growth and development of the company. And despite with 24,000 stores globally, I've never been more enthused especially sitting here so far away from our home in Seattle and seeing exactly what we started in the early years, and that is Starbucks being the third place between home and work and delivering extraordinary cup of coffee. And it's just a wonderful opportunity for us once again to open up a new market, especially here in South Africa.","Scott Harlan Maw - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Thank you.","Operator","This concludes Starbucks Coffee Company's second quarter fiscal year 2016 earnings conference call.

I would like to welcome everyone to Starbucks Coffee Company's Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2018 Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks there will be a question-and-answer session.","I would like to turn the call over to Tom Shaw, Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Shaw, you may begin your conference.","Tom Shaw - Starbucks Corp.","Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us today to discuss our third quarter results for fiscal 2018. Today's discussion will be led by Kevin Johnson, President and CEO; Roz Brewer, Group President, Americas and Chief Operating Officer; Belinda Wong, CEO, Starbucks China; and Scott Maw, CFO. For Q&A, we'll be joined by John Culver, Group President, International, Channel Development and Global Coffee and Tea; and Matt Ryan, Chief Marketing Officer.","This conference call will include forward-looking statements which are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements. Any such statements should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements in our earnings release and risk factor discussions in our filings with the SEC including our last Annual Report on Form 10-K.

These items are excluded from our non-GAAP results. Please refer to our website at investor.starbucks.com to find a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures referenced in today's call with their corresponding GAAP measures.","This conference call is being webcast and an archive of the webcast will be available on our website as well through August 25, 2018. I will now turn the call over to Kevin.","Kevin Johnson - Starbucks Corp.","Well, thank you, Tom, and good afternoon and welcome, everyone. On today's call, I will provide an overview of our financial performance in Q3, expand on the business update we provided last month, and reinforce our strategic priorities going forward. Then I'll turn the call over to Roz and Belinda to report on our Q3 operating performance in each of our two key markets, the U.S. and China, and update you on our plans for each market going forward. Scott will then take you through the Q3 financials in detail and we'll turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.","Starbucks revenues in Q3 totaled a record $6.3 billion, up 11% over last year driven by consolidation of our East China business, strong performance from new stores, favorable FX, and comp sales increases of 1% both globally and in the U.S. Excluding FX and the net impact of streamlining activities, revenues were up 7%. June comps in the U.S. and Americas landed as expected, representing an acceleration from May and April. For the quarter our non-GAAP EPS totaled $0.62, inclusive of a $0.02 impact from the anti-bias training on May 29, representing a solid 13% increase over Q3 last year.","While we fell short of the expectations we had entering the quarter, we made measurable progress against two commitments we've made to our shareholders: to deliver predictable, sustainable growth at scale and to create meaningful increases in shareholder value long into the future. To deliver on these commitments, we continue to focus our energy, capital, and resources on executing against our three strategic priorities.","Our first strategic priority is to accelerate growth in our targeted long-term growth markets \u2013 China and the U.S. Our success in each market will be driven by further elevation and modernization of the third-place experience we deliver to our customers and continued expansion of our digital advantage. Roz will provide context around the progress we are making in the U.S. and a plan that is built with a clear understanding and focus on four evolving consumer trends. Consumers have increasingly ubiquitous digital lifestyles. Consumers want premium products, premium experiences, and value convenience. Consumers appreciate choice, including better for you food and beverage selections.","Our innovation agenda in each of food and beverage, digital, and store design is being informed by each of these trends. And we are committed to increasing the velocity of innovation at Starbucks in each of these areas, as they are all key determinants of customer and brand relevance today. I remain extremely optimistic about the future of our U.S. business for several reasons. First, our beverage innovation platform is working and we have a full pipeline of new beverages on the horizon to delight our customers in the quarters ahead. Beverage innovation is fueling growth in our core platforms of coffee, tea and refreshers and offsetting some of the softness we've seen in blended.","Second, our digital reach is expanding by every measure including a double-digit increase in active rewards membership year-over-year and the addition of 6 million digitally registered customers who are not yet rewards members but who have established a digital connection with Starbucks. And third, we have redoubled our efforts to drive disciplined operational excellence within our stores and to mindfully allocate capital with a sharp focus on managing our corporate expenses.","China represents an important part of our strategic growth agenda, and Belinda will share specific detail around the incredibly powerful long-term growth opportunities we are curating in China. While acknowledging a disappointing Q3, I want to be clear that we have 100% confidence in our growth strategy and the sustainability of the leadership position we have built in the market. Having been in China since 1999, the strength of our brand, the trust we have built with our customers and partners, and our working knowledge of the many nuances of the China market uniquely positions us for continued long-term success.","Now, keep in mind that this quarter alone, excluding the East China integration, we grew total transactions in China in the mid-teens. We are, by design, in a phase of growth in China that is primarily driven by new store expansion. We also acknowledge the need to move faster to enable delivery in China, and we are committed to piloting delivery this fall in two key cities, Beijing and Shanghai, with the intent to expand from there. We will introduce delivery in a way that combines the best coffees and the most innovative coffee and tea beverages in the world with the rapidly evolving consumer trend in China for at home and at work convenience.","So be assured that as we grow in China, we will not deviate from the culture and values that have built the Starbucks brand and resulted in Starbucks today being recognized as one of the most successful global brands, and sought after global employer of choice in China. I have complete confidence in Belinda and her team to navigate the next phase of our China growth strategy.","Now, our second strategic priority is to expand and leverage the Starbucks brand through the Global Coffee Alliance with Nestl\u00e9. We remain on track to close the Nestl\u00e9 deal in our fiscal Q4. Nestl\u00e9 is the ideal global partner to accelerate Starbucks growth profile by combining our global brand and coffee leadership with the world's leading distribution network, covering 189 countries. In addition, this alliance will bring Starbucks coffee to customers around world through the world's leading single-serve platforms, Nespresso and Nescaf\u00e9 Dulce Gusto. These single-serve platforms represent the largest install base of systems globally. The Global Coffee Alliance represents an important and highly opportunistic pillar of our growth agenda.","Our third strategic priority is to sharpen our focus on shareholder value return. Step one was the development of a company-wide emphasis on streamlining our business and organization. Over the past year this work has enabled us to identify the strategic steps we needed to take to better and more profitably unlock opportunities that amplify our core value drivers. Those steps include further business simplification, retail market alignment, as evidenced by our purchase of East China and the sale of smaller markets better suited for local ownership, and most recently the Global Coffee Alliance we entered into with Nestl\u00e9. Streamline has freed up billions of dollars of capital and has enabled us to focus our management attention and critical resources on the most important priorities for Starbucks, our partners, and our shareholders. Last November we committed to return $15 billion to shareholders through buybacks and dividends through fiscal 2020. As our streamline initiatives have unlocked more net capital and as we have flexed our balance sheet, we've now expanded that commitment to $25 billion through fiscal 2020. We have already returned over $5 billion to shareholders in the last three quarters alone.","Now, to deliver on our commitments, we know we must drive consistent growth at scale by driving excellence in execution and customer-focused innovation. Let me assure you that we are energized by the foundational changes we have made and the prioritization that it provides toward our core value drivers.","Before handing the call over to Roz, I want to quickly touch on our recent announcement around sustainability. Sustainability is one of three of our social impact priorities. Our aspiration to make coffee the first sustainable agricultural product is in direct support of coffee farmers around the world. Our commitment to eliminate plastic straws in all of our stores globally by 2020 is in direct support of sustainability of the planet. In the same way, our agronomists innovate on behalf of coffee farmers, our packaging teams along with partners have innovated to create strawless lids, and alternative material straw options. And we are also pursuing a broad approach to recyclable cups. We have long espoused the importance of companies doing well by doing good, and we will not waver from our focus and leadership position in sustainability.","Finally I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge Scott Maw for his partnership and tireless contributions to Starbucks. Scott will remain an integral part of the management team through November and serve for a period as a consultant to ensure a seamless and successful transition to a new CFO. Thank you, Scott. All of us at Starbucks thank you for your contributions and we wish you well. With that, I'll turn the call over to Roz.","Roz?","Rosalind G. Brewer - Starbucks Corp.","Thanks, Kevin. I'll start out with how the Americas is reinforcing its commitment to improving current transaction trends by focusing on three priorities for growth: improving customers' in-store experience, delivering beverage innovation, and driving digital relationships. I'll also provide some perspective on how we're driving enhanced profitability and increasing agility.","First I'll address Q3 results. We delivered another record performance of $4.2 billion in revenues, which represents a 6% increase over the prior year, and our new stores contributed four points of growth for the 17th consecutive quarter. The impact of Frappuccino decline and the store closures to support the anti-bias training is estimated to be three points of comp in the quarter. These were the main factors that led to a 1% comp in the Americas for Q3. Factoring into this shortfall, we continue to grow share, as supported by growth in our most loyal customers, growth in all categories except Frappuccino, including both core coffee beverages and innovative new products, such as Draft and Refreshers, continued strong growth in the morning, our most important day-part, and continued strong performance of new stores as we opened in underpenetrated geographies. With these indicators of brand strength, we continue to move with speed to reposition the business for growth.","To modernize and elevate the third place, our first priority is improving customers' in-store experience. The U.S. operations team, led by veteran Starbucks operator Rossann Williams, is keenly focused on driving efficiency, reducing the time our partners spend on administrative tasks, and redeploying that time to customer-facing tasks. We have set an ambitious target to cut up to 50% of current in-store administrative tasks by the end of fiscal year 2019 that we expect will initially unlock up to 2 to 3 hours daily to focus on customer and partner experience this fall. Through more efficient labor scheduling, automated ordering and raising store standards, we continue to leverage our earlier work around Deployment 2.0 by moving from one labor algorithm to store segmentation based on product mix, traffic patterns and store type. Partners will also have mobile access to their schedules, reducing the time it takes to communicate and manage changes. Using AI will right-size inventory levels while reducing waste, improving product availability, and reducing manual inventory tasks. And our clean, safe welcoming initiative will help to unlock the afternoon by moving disruptive tasks to after close.","Our U.S. real estate strategy will be driven by placing the majority of our new stores throughout middle America and the South with careful consideration of the format type. More than 80% of stores built in the next few years will be drive-thru, as data indicates significant opportunities for store expansion in higher growth, lower cost markets, especially when considering rising wages and occupancy costs.","At the same time, we'll continue balancing our portfolio of U.S. company-owned and licensed stores. Starting in Q1 fiscal year 2019, we'll also test a new approach to store portfolio management in Austin, along with new technology in the form of digital menu boards and drink preparation.","Next is beverage innovation. As consumer trends and consumption habits evolve, we're focused on staying ahead of the market with relevant new products that reinforce the reputation of the brand. While not yet enough to offset declines in Frappuccino sales, we see substantial accretive growth from Draft, Refreshers, Tea, and Cold Brew platforms. In general, consumer demand for cold beverages has grown from 37% of sales five years ago to more than 50% of sales today. There's also strong demand for customization, including Blonde Espresso as an alternative to our bolder signature roasts and plant-based milk and cold foam for our cold coffee and tea beverages.","I'll share a few examples. Cold foam is a cold frothed skim milk designed to be a perfect creamy finish to our cold beverages. Launched this spring, we are just beginning to explore some of the opportunities here, as evidenced by our latest offering, the Salted Cream Cold Foam Cold Brew. Drafts allows us to extend beyond Cold Brew and has proven highly incremental, especially for occasional afternoon customers. We're accelerating this platform to more than 2,800 stores by the close of fiscal year 2018, up to more than 6,000 stores by year-end fiscal year 2019. We're also exploring multi-task systems to add customization and innovation across Tea and Milk.","We expanded our Refreshers line with the new Mango Dragonfruit, whose performance helped fuel strong double-digit growth in the overall Refreshers platform. And we introduced several coconut and almond milk-based beverages, including our new Iced Vanilla Bean Coconutmilk Latte. In sum, having established ourselves as the premier retailer of specialty coffee, leaning into cold-focused beverages and platforms is where we can further differentiate, premiumize, and continue to lead the market.","Our third priority is digital. Our digital flywheel remains a compelling opportunity to connect with customers in a personalized way, driving convenience, product awareness, value, and ultimately incrementality. We now have 15.1 million active Starbucks Rewards members, up 14% year-over-year, driving 40% of tender in the U.S. Spend per member has grown in the mid-single digits range, with Mobile Order and Pay representing 13% of transactions.","We'll significantly enhance the appeal of the rewards program next spring when, for the first-time, customers will be able to redeem different amounts of stars for different products, giving them a choice to use stars sooner for lower ticket items or save for higher ticket items like lunch, packaged coffee, and merchandise.","We're also quickly building a strong base of direct digital relationships with non-SR customers, registering 6 million since March. We're marketing to them with special offers including invitation-only Happy Hour. And as we learn more about their transaction histories, we'll target increasingly relevant offers to drive more incrementality and engagement. This expanded focus on digital is expected to drive an incremental one to two points of comp by year-end fiscal year 2019.","In closing, we recognize the work we need to do to deliver transaction growth in the U.S. and have balanced plans and talented teams in place to deliver against those expectations in the coming quarters.","I'll now turn the call over to Belinda.","Belinda Wong - Starbucks Corp.","Thank you, Roz. Good afternoon, everyone. I appreciate the opportunity to speak to you from Shanghai in order to expand on Kevin's comments around Starbucks' solid foundation in China, put our Q3 performance in context, and provide details on the steps we're taking to deliver comp and profit growth consistent with our historical performance and future expectations.","Relative to our historical success, we believe the minus 2% comp we posted in Q3 is not a reflection of the strength of our business and brand in China. On the contrary, I assure you that the enormity of the opportunity that we shared with you at our China Investor Day remains fully intact.","Let me take you through the factors that combined in somewhat of a perfect storm to drive our Q3 underperformance. And when I explain what we're doing about each, I suspect you'll leave today's call confident in our understanding of the transitory situation and in our action plans to resume the level of consistent profitable growth that both you and we expect.","First, as Kevin mentioned, we're making progress on our plans for delivery across China. We start this fall in Beijing and Shanghai with plans to expand across the country as we enter calendar 2019. We're fine-tuning details and approach over the coming weeks, fully confident that delivery will enhance the premium Starbucks experience our customers expect, fueling comp growth and financial performance in FY 2019 and beyond.","The delivery opportunity has enabled a different yet not unusual competitive retail environment in China. Starbucks' success, growth and sustainable long-term business approach has incented upstarts and other players to enter the coffee business from time to time. Yet over the long-term the focus we put on the quality of our coffee, the passion of our partners, beautiful third-place environments, and the premium Starbucks experience we deliver has always set the bar for performance and market success.","While recent coffee market entrants have chosen to capitalize on delivery combined with heavily discounted offers, there's significant compromises at play in terms of quality, experience, and business sustainability. These will prove to be short-lived. Let me assure you that our new delivery service will adhere to the high standards our customers in China have come to expect with regard to the Starbucks experience. And we're fully confident that the holistic and premium nature of our experience in store or delivery and the quality of our products will differentiate our offer to customers as we expand our business in China.","While we do expect to see some residual comp headwinds as competitive promotions unwind over time, we do have a strong plan going forward. Besides delivery, we have broad reach and depth in the digital space. Starting in June, we have now expanded our digital social gifting on the Alipay platform which today boasts 520 million monthly active users, providing a new channel which we can communicate and engage with our customers and drive transactions to our stores.","We also have a strong pipeline of innovation. This includes doubling the availability of our Coffee Meets Ice Cream product line to 1,100 locations, expanding our successful cold foam innovation to include three new offerings: Cold Foam Caramel Macchiato, Green Tea Latte, and Cold Brew, and up-leveling our bakery platform. These have all been big hits in early testing and we are excited to expand these offerings to more customers this quarter.","Finally in Q3 we did experience higher-than-expected levels of sales transfer from existing stores to new stores due primarily to the acceleration of new store openings in the first half of the year. We intentionally choose to move faster in key investment clusters to seize specific opportunities, resulting in 60% more store openings in the first half of FY 2018 versus the prior year, excluding East China. While this acceleration has temporarily impacted comp growth, we continue to achieve best in class performance from new stores opened in the last 12 months. I am absolutely sure that our intentional and strategic investment actions were the right moves to set us up for strong future growth in both market share and profitability.","Looking ahead, the pace of new store openings should result in more typical levels of sales transfer. We remain on plan to add 600 net new stores per year and to achieve our goal of 6,000 stores in 230 cities across Mainland China by the end of fiscal 2022. Starbucks continues to invest in China for the long term.","In closing, I would like to share a few thoughts. Number one, there's no substitute for our 47-year history of sourcing, roasting and blending the world's highest quality arabica coffees or our direct connections with coffee farming communities around the world including Yunnan in China. The proof and the quality are in the cup.","Two, we have learned from our 19-year experience and developed a very strong brand and a profitable and sustainable operating model in China that competitors have yet to figure out and will never be able to replicate.","Three, we will continue to build our business in China by fostering deep connections among our partners, their families, our customers, and the communities we serve.","Four, we're proud to deliver a third-place experience that inspires and fosters human connection that is relevant to the Chinese consumer aspirations. This will continue to be a majority of the specialty coffee occasions in China and our business for the years to come.","Five, our world class retail locations, store footprint and design, unit economics, growing CPG presence and new delivery capability ideally position us to continue to lead in the marketplace and deliver venti sized returns. I assure you that Starbucks' runway in China is wide and long, and I remain absolutely convinced that China will become Starbucks' largest and most strategic market in the world.","Thank you, and I'll now turn the call over to Scott. Scott?","Scott Maw - Starbucks Corp.","Thank you, Belinda and good afternoon, everyone. Starbucks consolidated revenue growth was in excess of 7% after adjusting for 4% of favorable impact from streamline activities and FX in Q3, and despite falling short of forecast, reflects the underlying strength of the Starbucks business and brand around the world.","Our Americas business reported 6% revenue growth despite challenging macro and Starbucks-specific operating environments. CAP reported 11% revenue growth after adjusting for 35 points of streamline activities and FX, with China revenue growth once again in the high teens on the same basis. Channel Development delivered 10% revenue growth after adjusting for 4 points of streamline activities and EMEA delivered 6% revenue growth excluding 4% of FX favorability. The bottom line is that we continue to gain share in virtually every market where we do business domestically and around the world, at the same time as we make meaningful progress against our commitments to deliver sustainable growth at scale.","Non-GAAP operating margin of 18.5% represented a decline of 230 basis points year-over-year primarily driven by 130 basis points from incremental investments related to the U.S. tax law change and estimated anti-bias training impacts. Product mix shift largely related to food as well as planned partner and digital investments also contributed to the decline.","I'll now take you through our Q3 operating performance by segment. The U.S. reported a 1% increase in comp growth driven by 2 points of growth in core beverages including espresso, tea and refreshers, and 1 point from food. This was offset by over 2 negative points related to softer than expected blended sales well below what we forecast for the quarter. Consistent with recent quarters, peak transactions volume was strong with softness continuing in the afternoon, primarily in Frappuccino sales.","Separately, I'd like to highlight that the estimated impact of anti-bias training to comps was slightly less than one-half point. Americas' non-GAAP operating margin declined 250 basis points to 21.9%, largely attributable to 150 basis point impact from U.S. tax law related investments and the estimated impact of the anti-bias training. Net of these items, our Q3 margin landed roughly where we originally forecast and showed improvement from Q2 levels.","Moving on to China-Asia-Pacific. CAP revenues exceeded $1 billion for the second straight quarter, reaching a record $1.2 billion in Q3. Japan revenues grew by 6% excluding two points of FX favorability. And Korea, our fifth largest global market, delivered system revenue growth in the mid-teens, driven by a 6% increase in system comps and contribution from net new stores. Noteworthy is that CAP grew non-GAAP operating income by 30% despite a 310 basis point decline in non-GAAP operating margins to 25.2%. The decline in operating margin was primarily due to a 280 basis point impact from consolidation of the East China business. Excluding the consolidation, CAP margin was down slightly to prior-year. CAP remains a huge growth opportunity for Starbucks both inside and outside of China, made even more so by the exciting longer term CPG and food service opportunities presented by the Nestl\u00e9 alliance.","Let's turn to EMEA. EMEA delivered roughly flat comp growth in Q3 in the face of continuing economic and competitive headwinds. System-wide comps, however, came in at a solid plus 3% in the period. EMEA's non-GAAP operating margin expanded by 310 basis points in Q3, driven primarily by strong performance from licensed stores. We remain encouraged by the improved performance in EMEA with both operating income growth and meaningful margin expansion, and convinced that the portfolio shift to licensing will result in further increases in profitability as we move into 2019.","On to Channel Development. Channel Development had a very strong Q3. Starbucks continued to outpace industry growth, adding another point of share in roast and ground to reach 13% dollar share and continuing to lead premium brands in the K-Cup coffee category with a 16% dollar share. Channel Development's non-GAAP operating margin was 42.7%, solid performance given the maturity of the coffee category and increased competition down the aisle.","As we close out fiscal 2018, most of our targets remain consistent with previous guidance, but I'd like to highlight a few specifics. We continue to expect consolidated revenue growth in the high single digits, excluding approximately two points of favorability from the East China acquisition and other streamline-driven activities. Full year comps will likely come in just below our 3% to 5% range and we expect Q4 to be at the lower end of this range. We remain on plan to open approximately 2,300 net new Starbucks stores globally with best in class operating margins in both company owned and licensed markets. We continue to anticipate a moderate decline in full year operating margin for both total company and the Americas compared to 2017 inclusive of the incremental investments we're making in our partners and digital initiatives following U.S. tax law reform and the impact of the anti-bias training. However, we now expect a slight year-over-year decline in operating margin in the Americas for Q4, reflecting somewhat lower than initially expected comp growth.","Within the CAP segment, we continue to expect operating margin to be down moderately in fiscal 2018 relative to last year, due to the consolidation of East China. Excluding this impact, we continue to expect CAP operating margin to be moderately higher year-over-year. We still expect EMEA's operating margin to be flat adjusted for FX compared to 2017. We still forecast revenue growth in the mid-single digits for Channel Development in fiscal 2018, excluding the impact of Tazo and the 2017 revenue deduction adjustments. And we continue to expect Channel Development operating margin to decline moderately in FY 2018 relative to the prior year, a result of increasingly competitive market conditions discussed on prior earnings calls.","As a refinement to our EPS guidance in June, we expect fiscal 2018 GAAP EPS in the range of $3.26 to $3.28 and non-GAAP EPS will be in the range of $2.40 to $2.42, up approximately 17% from last year. Importantly, this guidance factors in the full $0.03 impact of anti-bias training for U.S. partners, including the portion that carried over into Q4. These EPS estimates also assume that the pending Nestl\u00e9 transaction closes on or after the final day of fiscal 2018. We anticipate that the Nestl\u00e9 transaction could close as early as the end of August, which would result in a diluted EPS impact of $0.02 to $0.03 in FY 2018. I would remind you that we expect revenue and EPS to be negatively impacted in 2019 by two points to three points each as a result of this transaction, with a range around the final number driven primarily by the potential accounting treatment for the $7.2 billion upfront payment.","Finally, I want to talk a bit about G&A savings and the 1% of system sales reduction target we introduced last month. Roz will be leading this effort with my support, and this is a three-year goal for us, and we anticipate it to be somewhat front-end loaded with 35% to 45% of the savings occurring next fiscal year on a run rate basis. By way of background, we remain focused on improving both our operating efficiency and how we work, and plan to use a portion of the resulting savings to fuel investments for future growth. These will be thoughtful, high impact savings that speed up decision-making and enable us to focus our efforts on the largest growth opportunities. It is not just a cost-cutting exercise. Working with our outside consultants, we have already identified significant savings opportunities in areas such as improving spans and layers within our organization.","Before handing the call back to the operator for Q&A, I want to thank everyone for their support of my recent decision to retire. I will always be deeply appreciative to Kevin, Howard and the Starbucks board and the leadership team for their partnership during my seven-year tenure at Starbucks, and for their support in my decision. I am also deeply appreciative to the over 330,000 Starbucks partners around the world who wear the green apron. Over the past years I've also come to know most of you on today's call. I thank you for your engagement and your support of Starbucks and of me. I can say without equivocation that the best days for Starbucks lie ahead. With that, I'll turn the call back to the operator. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from Sharon Zackfia with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.","Sharon Zackfia - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hi, good afternoon. I guess a question on the development outlook for the Americas as you focus on the center and Southern portions of the country. Can you give us kind of some perspective on how those AUVs look versus the rest of the country?","And I know you mentioned they're lower cost, but I'm thinking maybe they're also lower revenues. Any perspective on what the new units might look like going forward versus maybe the class of 2017 or class of 2016?","Kevin Johnson - Starbucks Corp.","Sharon, this is Kevin. We'll have Roz talk a little bit about where we're focused on store builds, and then Scott will follow up on the part of your question around the economics.","Rosalind G. Brewer - Starbucks Corp.","So, first of all, if you just look at our quarterly revenues, four points of our revenue growth came from new stores and in that configuration is quite a bit of mid-America and Southern states, so we're already seeing that performance play through for us. So we're encouraged by what we're seeing with our current portfolio.","Going forward, we are focusing in that area. I will tell you that in areas like Seattle and Manhattan, while we're encouraged by the business that we have in those areas, we are putting less units in those two geographies, but at the same time they're highly dense areas with increased occupancy cost and increased labor spends in those areas. So we're already seeing the performance from our current portfolio that is already targeted towards middle America and the Southern parts of the states, so we're encouraged by what we're seeing and so we're going to continue that process.","Scott Maw - Starbucks Corp.","And I would add is we've moved towards more drive-thru. Roz referenced 80% or more drive-thrus. We've actually seen the AUVs accelerate over the past four or five years, so even as we've gone into some of those suburban areas the drive-thru format has about 25% to 30% more revenue than our typical in metro non-drive-thru format. So the weighting out of those drive-thrus are actually both quite high AUVs and really good profitability.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, thank you. I was hoping just with the amount of kind of puts and takes in G&A if there's a dollar amount that we could talk to, maybe in fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020, maybe even beyond as you think about, really, the potential of the business from an efficiency and effectiveness point of view. Because obviously there's a lot of different ways to look at this \u2013 percentage of system sales, percentage of revenue, per store basis, what have you? I was hoping if you could help, steer us just in terms of the actual dollar type of number that might be the right level of spend for Starbucks going forward.","Scott Maw - Starbucks Corp.","Yeah, thanks, John, it's Scott. Let me just try to narrow the range in a bit for you. We're literally in the middle of our annual planning process. So we'll come back in the fall and give you more specifics. But let me try to tighten in the range, because I know it's hard to model.","First of all, what we've talked about is one point of system sales. And just to roll forward system sales. The last time we talked about it was in our December 2016 Investor Day, and we said it's about $30 billion. So, if you grow that at the rate of revenue, you're somewhere in the mid-$30 billion, call it the $35 billion range. We'll be around a point of that building over three years. And what I said in my prepared remarks is we think 35% to 45% of that comes on a run rate basis in 2019. So the way that we'll \u2013 when we get into the fall, we'll take a look at fourth quarter exit rate of G&A as a percent of system sales. That will be our peg point. And then we'll roll forward three years to take 100 basis points or approximately 100 basis points out of that, with 35% to 45% of that coming in 2019.","So that should allow you to narrow it in a little bit. Obviously there is some range around that as we get into the specifics of exactly how quickly we can execute on some of these things, where the big opportunities lie. But that allows you to tighten up your modeling a bit, I think.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Bernstein with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great, thank you very much. I've just a question on China broadly. I know a few weeks back when you guided for the quarter, you were talking about maybe flat to modest negative comp. It seems like it came in down 2%. So, I'm wondering, maybe, if you could just talk about the trend through the quarter. And more importantly, I guess, just looking back over the past few quarters, it seems like it's been a fairly steady decline from the high-single digits to the mid-single digits to where we are today. So it would seem like there are some factors above and beyond maybe just the perfect storm that is the fiscal third quarter. Just wondering if maybe you could talk a little bit about the broader macro headwinds that perhaps China is seeing there, or just how you distinguish between what unit cannibalization might be versus maybe if there's some consumer pushback? Just wondering how you assess those two things to make sure the business is still as healthy as you think it is. Thank you.","Kevin Johnson - Starbucks Corp.","Yeah, Jeff, this is Kevin. I think we'll have Belinda talk a little bit about what she saw in the quarter. I think, we're \u2013 we don't think it's always helpful to go into trends within the quarter, but I think \u2013 let's give Belinda an opportunity to share with you a perspective of the health of the brand, the health of the business in China. Belinda?","Belinda Wong - Starbucks Corp.","Okay, hi, thank you, Jeff, for your question. First of all, delivery as a whole, it's becoming a lifestyle ritual in China. And consumer behaviors are changing. This is a trend we'll be addressing through Starbucks Delivery to complement our third-place in-store strategy.","Second is competitive landscape in China, which we'll also address through our Delivery services, as well as our growth agenda we shared during our Investor Day with our elevated Starbucks experience and the innovations that we do.","Third will be the higher than expected level of sales transfer that I shared before from existing stores to new stores. That may have an impact in the short-term. But for sure the right thing to do to expand our market share now and in the long run.","Don't forget operating in a developing coffee market, we need to continue to grow our presence through new stores. This means more than 75% of our growth comes from new store and we needed to do that because we're in a developing coffee market. We need to cultivate coffee culture, we need to share coffee with people who have never tried coffee. And our comp accounts for 25% of our growth. And we will continue to innovate and deliver meaningful and relevant experience to our customers to drive comp. But, again, growing greater market share in this market. So, I have no doubts that China will be back on track very soon in terms of our comp. So, thank you.","Kevin Johnson - Starbucks Corp.","Yeah, and Jeff let me just reinforce a couple of key points that I think are important \u2013 this is Kevin. First of all, as Belinda said and as I said in my comments, the market in China that we are in a market growth phase that is all about new store expansion. The fact that we're in roughly 130 to 140 cities and expanding into the next 100 cities over the next three years is critical. And the reason we grew transactions in the mid-teens in China is because of new store growth. And it is where \u2013 it is through that expansion that we're enabling the brand to not only deepen its engagement with customers in the cities that we're in but also to expand into new cities.","And so I think, as Belinda highlighted those \u2013 our stores are performing. Some of them are the most profitable stores in the world. The new ones we're building are the most \u2013 some of the most profitable stores in the world, and it is about store expansion. And so I just want to reinforce that point because that is the core strategy for China right now and it will be for the next several years.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Glass with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks very much. Your comp guidance if I'm reading this correctly for the fourth quarter is 3% or so, the low end of 3% to 5%, which, I guess, surprises me in the context of where you landed this quarter, and particularly in the U.S. So can you just talk about why you think that's a conservative or reasonable number?","Can you also just talk \u2013 I know you mentioned June was where you thought it was, is July a similar number?","And how much of that is the pricing overlap? In other words, is traffic improving in your business? Is that what's getting you more confident, or is that still an area of tension, and it's really just the price mix that's maybe benefiting comps right now?","Kevin Johnson - Starbucks Corp.","Yeah, well, let me just \u2013 I'll start, John, on the question and then I'll hand over to Roz to add a bit more on the mix of things that are driving it. But first of all, I commented that following the Oppenheimer comments the quarter unfolded as we anticipated, just reconfirming sort of the statements we made at Oppenheimer. I don't think it's helpful to get into intra-quarter trends because that I think confuses the issue.","So what gives us confidence? Well, you look back at this last quarter, Q3, when we had some very unusual things we had to navigate in the quarter. Certainly the situation in Philadelphia and the fact that we've closed all our stores for an afternoon \u2013 that had an impact. But also the fact that we delayed the launch of the spring\/summer marketing campaign by two weeks or so in that quarter. We lost some momentum, and since we then deployed that we clearly saw we were gaining momentum, and so that gives us some optimism in terms of what we're doing.","Second, our digital customer base has grown dramatically. Look, we've grown our active rewards members by 14% to 15.1 million, we've added 6 million of these digitally registered customers that we are now learning how to engage with and figuring out how to drive some more engagement with them. That combined with the pipeline of beverage innovation gives us confidence as we look forward and into this quarter.","Let me hand over to Roz to talk a little bit about \u2013 there was a question on pricing and attach and things that are driving some of the ticket there. And Roz, I'll let you comment on that and maybe Matt on pricing. But, Roz?","Rosalind G. Brewer - Starbucks Corp.","Yeah, sure, let me give a little bit more flavor to our comp performance. So first of all, I'll start off with, if you break down our comp, we've got two points of that coming from beverage and another point coming from food. So we're encouraged in terms of what we're seeing. All of our core categories except for Frappuccino grew in the quarter, both our core coffee beverages, our innovative new products such as Drafts and Refreshers, so we're seeing growth in every category. We're seeing food attachment from our breakfast sandwiches happening, where up to 22% of our portfolio is food, so we're seeing that have a nice impression on our ticket. We're still growing in morning peak, and that's our most important day-part, and we're still growing in the morning. And then lastly I'll tell you we're seeing strong performance of our new stores that we just talked about that we're placing in these markets of middle America and in the South.","So that gives us encouragement that we're on the right track. Just the isolation of moving transactions is our focus and we need to get those transactions through our beverage growth. And when Kevin talked about the afternoon day-part, it is a soft part of our business. The marketing campaign that we ran through the beginning of the spring is still ongoing. It's actually the largest media spend we've done in a while \u2013 consistent, focused on afternoons and absolutely focused on a new occasion in the afternoon with teas and refreshers. So we're going to maintain our plans to continue this work that we're doing because we're encouraged from what we're seeing right now.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Palmer with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks, good evening. I...","Kevin Johnson - Starbucks Corp.","David, you're breaking up. David, you're breaking up. Can you start over?","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yes. I wanted to ask a question about the U.S. business. It looks like the afternoon and beverage contribution to growth has been a particular problem. Could you talk about that? And given the fact that you're now seeing digital user growth resume, that takes off the table that as an issue. So I guess the question is, how much do you think the U.S. comp slowdown has been a beverage innovation problem versus other, not having a Cold Brew or a Teavana shake and tea? And how do you feel about the beverage innovation pipeline at this point? Thanks.","Kevin Johnson - Starbucks Corp.","Let me take sort of the first response to that, David, and then I'll hand it over to Roz to talk a little bit about the beverage innovation pipeline. First of all, the most important day-part for Starbucks is the morning day-part. And we are growing comp in the morning day-part. We're growing transactions in the morning day-part. The area that we've highlighted that we've had softness has been that afternoon from 2:00 on and then evenings from 4:00 PM on. So, when we look at this, the fact that the morning day-part that's growing is a very, very, very positive metric.","Number two, when I look at the beverage portfolio and I look at the core platforms, Coffee, Espresso, Tea and Refreshers, all of those are growing. And they're offsetting the softness we've had in blended. So all of a sudden, you start to intersect the issue around blended and afternoons has sort of been amplified in this quarter because this is the quarter of Frappuccinos. And so you put that together and I think much of that is sort of explained.","Now, as Roz mentioned, the campaign that we have for the afternoon and the cold beverages that we're driving around afternoon made, I think we're feeling good about that. Let me hand it over to Roz to talk a little bit about the pipeline of innovation.","Rosalind G. Brewer - Starbucks Corp.","Sure. So we actually feel pretty good about the velocity of innovation at Starbucks in terms of the beverage business. First of all, we're seeing a strong shift to Cold and we're playing directly in that space. Our mix is up to 50% with our cold mix of our beverages. And if you look at everything we focused on in terms of our newness, it has been in cold beverage.","In addition to the addition of our Blonde espresso at the beginning of the year, we're seeing our customers customize even their cold beverages with Blonde espresso. So focusing on innovation in core coffee and then innovation in blended with the Premium Frappuccino, we introduced three of those this quarter, and we're pleased with how those three are moving for us. And we've also customized with cold foam and we're getting momentum on refreshers and teas.","And then not only the innovation on beverages but in food. And so we introduced a new egg bite, Sous Vide Egg Bite this quarter. We're encouraged what we see there. And then when you combine that kind of innovation in food and beverage with what we're doing with the acceleration in digital, we're matching all the customer information that we're gathering with what their needs are.","One thing I will isolate is that our Cold Brew is really resonating with our male millennials. So, when we wrap our arms around our consumer-driven needs for the growth in our business and innovation, it sends us directly towards a cold platform and continuing to innovate in our core coffee business. So we actually feel pretty good about our beverage lineup and the innovation pipeline.","Operator","Your next question comes from Sara Senatore with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.","Sara Harkavy Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi, thank you. A question about the U.S. unit growth and then just a quick follow-up on China. In the U.S. you said, you're talking \u2013 you're testing a new approach to portfolio management. Is that with reference to the mix of company-operated versus licensed, or is it about how you evaluate stores more \u2013 perhaps more quickly and decide whether they're meeting their hurdle rates? Just trying to understand what that might \u2013 what implication that might have for store growth going forward.","And then on the China piece, I know you're seeing some cannibalization, but I'm also curious \u2013 I would assume there's a pretty steep maturity curve in China. So aren't you seeing any kind of offsetting comp lift from that?","Kevin Johnson - Starbucks Corp.","We'll have \u2013 Sara, let's have Roz take your first question on U.S. unit growth and optimizing the store portfolio and then Belinda will talk a little bit about China. So, Roz?","Rosalind G. Brewer - Starbucks Corp.","Yeah, so let me just clarify the point on store growth. So, we're still adding a significant number of stores on both our company-owned and our licensed units. And I will tell you what we're doing is looking very closely at managing the trade areas in terms of where we place stores. And then there's a second piece to that, Sara, that talks about the formats that we place. So I think you're aware that 80% of our portfolio going forward \u2013 actually approaching 90% now, is drive-thru. But we're also looking at exactly where those drive-thrus can complement an express unit or complement a cafe. So we're looking very surgically at where we place our units and being really smart about that, with the focus of the geography in middle America and the Southeast. And so you'll see that play out in our stores coming forward. And we are not slowing our growth in those concentrated areas.","Kevin Johnson - Starbucks Corp.","Belinda, do you want to talk a little bit about China?","Belinda Wong - Starbucks Corp.","Yes. Sara, hi, Belinda here. I assume you mean the specialty coffee market in China being mature or maturing. This is not the case at all. I think we shared the stats before on 300 cups in the U.S. and then 0.4 cup in China. And we're working hard to cultivate a coffee culture here. Even in tier 1 cities like Beijing and Shanghai. So there's plenty of room to grow. And with the middle class up-and-coming more and more people \u2013 our job is to make sure more and more people get to try what we love, which is coffee and sharing our passion. So there's plenty of room to grow.","John Culver - Starbucks Corp.","Hey, Sara, also, this is John, just to add to the discussion around China on the maturity curve, if you're talking about the new store growth. And when you look at our new stores, we track very closely how the new stores perform once we open them and through that first year and then as they enter the comp base we've got a very disciplined approach where we review that every single month.","As we shared previously, the store payback of the new stores is within a year of the opening. And as they enter the comp base, they enter the comp base at a very consistent historical level of the stores that are currently sitting in the comp base. So we feel very good about this maturity curve and the fact that it hasn't really shifted that much at all from an historical standpoint. And we feel very good about continuing to build out the store footprint based on the fact that our new store performance continues to exceed all the expectations. And the returns are very, very healthy in overall store level profitability of those stores, as well as the whole portfolio is very healthy. And that gives us optimism for the future. We talk about the importance of comp. That's clearly important. But at the end of the day, as Kevin shared, it is about new store growth right now, as we seed the market and develop this coffee culture.","Last quarter we grew revenue 17%. We grew transactions in the mid-teens. We continue to grow overall transactions in the marketplace, attracting new customers into our stores as well as continuing to elevate the frequency of our existing customers. And so we feel very good about that.","And then just one other point I would put on China is the work that we're doing on digital and the fact that we now have 6.7 million active MSR members, and when you break that down on a per-store basis, that's nearly double what we have on a per-store basis to what we have in the U.S. And you couple that with the work we've done with Alipay social gifting, with WeChat social gifting, we are building a very robust digital ecosystem. And then you add delivery on top of that, we see very long runway for growth for us in China for many years to come. And that's why we're still very optimistic and very strong belief in the growth plans and the strategy that we've built for the market going forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from Matthew DiFrisco with Guggenheim Securities. Please proceed with your question.","Matthew DiFrisco - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Thank you. My question is more with the U.S. I guess, just two-pronged here, looking at the expansion and targeting sort of middle America. I think for those of us who have covered the stock when you guys last closed down a large portion of stores, some of that was Howard identifying that the middle of the country might have seen some of the faster growth and that they weren't really espresso drinking, and the brand didn't resonate as well when you tried to more densely populate those areas with your stores. What's changed?","And then, I guess also looking at the comp, I guess you're one of the few restaurant companies that hasn't mentioned the word at all about value, and it does seem like value is what is driving the customer, whatever that means for each individual brand respectively. How are you addressing the value equation to the customer who is not the My Starbucks Rewards customer?","Kevin Johnson - Starbucks Corp.","Yeah, Matthew, this is Kevin I'll start and share a perspective and get some others to add. But first of all, what's changed in terms of the store performance in middle America? Well, apparently Americans in middle America like espresso beverages and our coffee because those stores are performing at higher AUVs and higher profitability than any other part of the country. And so I don't know what the experiment was back then, but it's working now.","And this is not a new thing. We've been doing this for the last couple of years and we're seeing great performance from those stores. We're using \u2013 as I outlined at Oppenheimer, we're using analytics to really look at the store, the number of stores per capita that we have in areas. We look at the demographics in those areas and we're using technology to help inform us where to go build these stores. And in since doing that, it's worked. So it's \u2013 I think the fact that just proven by the store performance we're getting on those new stores that we've been building throughout middle America and the South, they're performing well.","I think the other part, then, in terms of value, the core beverage platforms of coffee, espresso, tea, refreshers are all growing. The morning day-part is growing. When we think about the differentiators for Starbucks, we differentiate around a premium coffee, a premium experience, and we differentiate by doing custom handcrafted beverages at scale. And that is why our morning day-part just keeps growing. That is the core value proposition for our customers. And in that day-part we are growing, we're growing strong and we feel good about that. As Roz mentioned, we had \u2013 in the afternoon day-part we've had some softness in afternoon, and we've seen softness in the blended platform that we've been working to address.","I think, as I highlighted some of the consumer trends, this need state of convenience, we really have unlocked that I think in a way not only with Mobile Order and Pay, but with our drive-thrus and that's balancing then the experience we create in our stores around the third place around community. And so I think if we just look at both what we've learned over the last decade and the performance of the investments that we've made in those store formats, in those geographies, in our beverage platform, in the morning day-part, those things give us confidence that we're absolutely on the right path.","Scott Maw - Starbucks Corp.","And Matt, I would just add when Roz talked about our store growth, she said middle America and across the South. And the South is actually the bigger piece of that growth when I look at the numbers. So you're talking about Southern California, Texas, Arizona, the Southeast, Florida. These are markets with a lot of growth. And in addition to the middle part of the country, which is doing great as well, we're just seeing really strong performance in those markets with drive-thru. It's completely core to the move towards cold beverages and iced coffees. It's completely core to drive-thru and the suburban strategy that we have. And so I would just broaden the middle America part to definitely talk about the broad swath of the Southern U.S.","Operator","The last question comes from Matt McGinley with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.","Matthew Robert McGinley - Evercore Group LLC","Thank you. Kind of a quick point of \u2013 question about clarification on what you said, and then I have a question about China. In the guidance commentary, you noted a slight decline in the margin in the fourth quarter year-over-year. Was that driven by trends that you're experiencing already in July, or was that more of a general comment about fourth quarter relative to what you saw earlier in the year?","And then on China, Belinda, earlier in the year you noted that the China JV stores were not \u2013 that were not in the comp base were slightly below the stores that are in the comp base. Did that gap narrow as the year went on? Or when you experienced a slowdown in the stores in the comp base, did that \u2013 did they all kind of move in the same \u2013 in tandem, if you will?","Scott Maw - Starbucks Corp.","Yeah, my comment on the margin wasn't indicating anything in July. I think it's really just consistent with the guidance we gave last month around lower overall profitability both in the third and fourth quarter. And obviously we had hoped when we started the year that the fourth quarter margin would be roughly flat year-over-year, and we made good progress this quarter if you take out the anti-bias training and the tax investments. And we'll make good progress next quarter, but I'm just simply saying we're probably not going to quite get to flat, which was our initial guidance. So I was just sort of chewing that up.","And Belinda, do you want to handle the second part?","Belinda Wong - Starbucks Corp.","Sure. Hi, Matt. East China comp over the past few years has been somewhat below the rest of Mainland China, just as you said, due to the significant pace of store openings in that market and some other opportunities we're executing on. After East China, it's fully-owned company operated. That continues in FY 2018, and over time we expect the comps in these two pieces of the business to converge. But I'm happy to report that East China integration is progressing on track and the region is posting P&L performances in line with our expectations.","Operator","That was our last question today. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Shaw for closing remarks.","Tom Shaw - Starbucks Corp.","Yeah, thanks. And, for your planning purposes, please note our fourth quarter 2018 conference call has been tentatively scheduled for Thursday, November 1. In addition, we look forward to seeing many of you at our 2018 biennial Investor Day on Wednesday, December 12 in New York. Thanks again and have a great evening.","Operator","This concludes Starbucks Coffee Company third quarter fiscal year 2018 conference call. You may now disconnect."]}}
