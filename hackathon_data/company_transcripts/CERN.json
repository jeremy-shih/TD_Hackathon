Today's date is July 25, 2013, and this call is being recorded.","The company has asked me to remind you that various remarks made here today by Cerner's management about future expectations, plans, perspectives and prospects constitute forward-looking statements for the purpose of the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements.","Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements may be found under the heading Risk Factors under Item 1A in Cerner's Form 10-K, together with other reports that are furnished or to be filed with the SEC.","A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this earnings call can be found in the company's earnings release that was furnished to the SEC today and posted on the Investors section of cerner.com.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Marc Naughton, Chief Financial Officer of Cerner Corporation.","Marc G. Naughton","Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the call. I will lead off today with a review of the numbers. Zane Burke, Executive Vice President of our Client Organization, will follow me with sales highlights and marketplace trends. Mike Nill, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, will discuss operations and our works businesses. And Jeff Townsend, Executive Vice President and Chief of Staff, will discuss strategic initiatives and population health. Neal Patterson, our Chairman, CEO and President, will be available during Q&A.","Now I will turn to our results. We delivered very strong results overall in Q2, with revenue being the one slight exception as it was at the low end of our guidance range, after again being impacted by reduced levels of lower margin technology resale.","Our total bookings revenue in Q2 was $935 million, which is up 33% over Q2 of '12 and is an all-time high for a second quarter. Bookings margin in Q2 was $817 million or 87% of total bookings. Our bookings performance drove a 23% increase in total backlog over Q2 of '12 to $8 billion. Contract revenue backlog of $7.24 billion is 25% higher than a year ago. Support revenue backlog totaled $757 million, up 6% year-over-year.","Revenue in the quarter was $708 million, which is up 11% over Q2 of '12 and at the low end of our guidance range. Recall that we had widened our guidance range for Q2 to allow for the potential of continued low levels of technology resale. This did occur, but revenue was within our widened guidance range. Similar to Q1, the lower technology sales have limited impact on earnings. We do expect technology resale to increase in the second half of the year from current levels. But as we discussed last quarter, this is one of the least visible components of our business, so we will continue to use a wider guidance range. The revenue composition for Q2 was $201 million in system sales, $165 million in support and maintenance, $322 million in services and $20 million in reimbursed travel.","System sales revenue reflects a 3% increase over Q2 of '12, with strong growth in software and subscriptions being largely offset by the decline in technology resale. The strength of the high margin components of system sales is evident in the growth of our system sales margin dollars, which were up 36% year-over-year.","Moving to services. Total services revenue was up 17% compared to Q2 of '12, with strong growth in both managed services and professional services and increasing contributions from ITWorks and Revenue Cycle.","Moving to gross margin. Our gross margin for Q2 was 82.2%, which is up from 81.3% in Q1 '13 and 76.9% in Q2 of '12. The large year-over-year increase in gross margin percent was driven by the lower mix of technology resale, strong software sales and strong services margins. The strength in these areas is also reflected in strong year-over-year gross margin dollar growth of 19%.","Looking at revenue by geographic segment. Domestic revenue increased 10% compared to Q2 of last year, even with the decline in technology resale. Global revenue growth was strong at 17%.","Looking at operating spending. Our second quarter operating expenses were $404 million before share-based compensation expense of $11 million. This is a year-over-year increase of 17%, which is below the growth of our gross margin dollars, reflecting ongoing operating efficiencies.","Sales and client service expenses increased 16% compared to Q2 of '12, driven by an increase in revenue-generating associates in our services business.","Our investment in software development was up 12% compared to Q2 of '12. As we have discussed, we have been hiring in our R&D organization, as well as utilizing consultants for targeted development work, and we expect our R&D investments to continue growing. This will continue to be reflected in increased gross spending and increased capitalized software throughout the second half of 2013.","G&A expense increased 37% compared to Q2 of '12, driven by increased personnel expense related to our strong growth and higher amortization expense related to recent acquisitions in acquired intangibles.","Moving to operating margins. Our operating margin in Q2 is 25.1% before share-based compensation expense and was up 240 basis points compared to Q2 of '12. This was driven by a combination of ongoing operating efficiencies, the lower level of low margin technology revenue and strength in high margin areas I have discussed. We expect margin expansion to remain above 100 basis points for the year.","Moving to net earnings and EPS. Our GAAP net earnings in Q2 were $112.9 million or $0.32 per diluted share. GAAP net earnings included share-based compensation expense, which had a net impact on earnings of $6.7 million or $0.02 per diluted share. Adjusted net earnings were $119.6 million, and adjusted EPS was $0.34, which is up 17% compared to Q2 of '12. The Q2 tax rate for adjusted net earnings was 34%, which is in line with our expected effective tax rate.","Now move to our balance sheet. We ended Q2 with $1.5 billion of total cash and investments, which is flat compared to Q1. Total cash and investments include $969.5 million of cash and short-term investments and $514 million of highly rated corporate and government bonds with maturities less than 2 years. Our total debt, including capital lease obligations, is $182 million. Total receivables ended the quarter at $528 million, which is up $16 million from Q1. Our DSO in Q2 was 68 days, which is down from Q1 DSO of 69 days and 71 days in Q2 of '12.","Operating cash flow for the quarter was $177 million. Q2 capital expenditures were $86 million, and capitalized software was $44 million. Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures and capitalized software, was $47 million. Free cash flow was lower than recent levels due to higher CapEx, driven by investments in our cloud infrastructure, the build-out of our new campus and higher capitalized software. We expect capital expenditures to remain high in coming quarters, as we continue these important investments in our growth. Even at these levels of investment, we still expect to generate solid levels of free cash flow. We expect these investments to moderate by the second half of 2014 and for free cash flow to increase at that point.","Moving to capitalized software. The $44 million of capitalized software in Q2 represents 42% of the $103 million of total investments and development activities. Software amortization for the quarter was $23 million, resulting in net capitalization of $20 million or 20% of our total R&D investment. As I have indicated, we expect capitalized software to continue increasing in the second half of 2013, as we invest in key growth areas. Since much of the incremental development involves using third-party developers, we expect the growth in capitalization to be temporary. Similar to our overall CapEx outlook, we expect our capitalized software levels to flatten in 2014 and then decline in subsequent years.","Note that while we are increasing the dollar amount of software development cost capitalized, our total investment in R&D is growing by a higher amount, meaning that the net R&D expense on the income statement grew this quarter as it will throughout the rest of the year. We view this investment in development, combined with our share buyback and acquisitions, to be a good use of our capital.","Regarding our share buyback. In Q2, we've purchased $79 million worth of shares, bringing year-to-date repurchases to $142 million. We have purchased a total of 1.5 million shares pre-split, which is the equivalent of 3 million post-split so far this year. We have $28 million remaining from the $170 million that was authorized last December.","Now I'll go through Q3 and full year guidance. For Q3, we expect revenue between $740 million and $770 million, with the midpoint reflecting growth of 12% over Q3 of '12. This revenue guidance range accounts for a wider range of results in technology resale and reflects expected ongoing strength in other areas.","For the full year, we continue to expect revenue between $2.95 billion and $3.05 billion, reflecting 13% growth at the midpoint. Given the lower technology sales in Q1 and Q2, we are biased towards the lower end of this range.","We expect Q3 adjusted EPS before share-based compensation expense to be $0.35 to $0.36 per share, with the midpoint reflecting 8% growth -- 18% growth over Q3 '12 reported adjusted EPS.","For the full year, we expect adjusted EPS between $1.40 and $1.42, which is up from our prior guidance range of $1.39 to $1.42. The midpoint reflects 18% growth over our 2012 reported adjusted EPS and 21% growth when you adjust 2012 for our lower tax rate in Q2 and the gain on the investment sale we had in Q4.","Q3 guidance is based on total spending before share-based compensation expense of approximately $415 million to $425 million. Our estimate for the impact of share-based compensation expense is approximately $0.02 to $0.03 in Q3 and $0.08 to $0.09 for the full year.","Moving to bookings guidance. We expect bookings revenue in Q3 of $875 million to $925 million, with the midpoint reflecting 17% growth over Q3 of '12.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Zane.","Zane M. Burke","Thanks, Marc. Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll provide sales highlights and discuss marketplace trends. Starting with our results. Our bookings revenue in Q2 of $935 million is an all-time high for our second quarter and reflects 33% growth over Q2 2012. This increase was driven by strength across all our business models except for technology resale and included strong contributions from ITWorks and Revenue Cycle, which Mike will discuss.","Looking at other bookings metrics. We had 28 contracts over $5 million, including 14 over $10 million. The mix of long-term bookings was 34% in the quarter, which is slightly higher than historical levels due primarily to the strength in ITWorks and RevWorks.","Our new footprint activity was again very strong, with 30% of our bookings in the quarter coming from outside of our core Millennium install base, again, including wins against our primary competitor. In addition to ongoing competitiveness in the large hospital market, we also had strong results in the ambulatory space, where we had an all-time high level of bookings in Q2. This strength was driven by 6 competitive displacements of 3 different suppliers. Note that these ambulatory wins include both the clinical and Revenue Cycle, and our pipeline for both is very strong. We also had record results in smaller hospitals, with our CommunityWorks business adding several footprints during the quarter.","Another noteworthy area of strength this quarter was in the investor-owned market. Operationally, we brought the first 10 sites live for a large investor-owned client that just selected us in Q3 of last year for 19 sites. The ability to bring 10 hospitals live in just 10 months from contract execution is something I believe only Cerner can do, and its execution should position us well for future opportunities with this client. Our sales in the investor-owned market were also strong, with the highlight of being one of our largest clients selecting us to replace their existing hosting provider.","An area of emerging strength for Cerner that I'd like to highlight is the public sector. Like investor-owned, we think there are strategic and operational competencies that are important to compete in this space. Our proven scale, predictable results and budgets and ability to deliver value set us apart from others competing for this business. In Q2, we demonstrated our ability to compete in public sector business with success in opportunities ranging from behavioral health, to an Indian health services organization, to a very large state correctional health services organization that provides care to over 100,000 inmates. I believe our experience in this space positions us well for what we view is a growing public sector opportunity.","Our execution outside the U.S. was also good in Q2. Highlights include good activity in England, Canada, Australia and the Middle East and an expansion of our relationship with AMEOS Group in Germany.","Moving to general marketplace observations. We continue to see more separation between the 2 most successful companies and the rest, most of which continue to struggle with execution. This is evident in our ongoing success at winning new footprints, as well as activity in our pipeline.","Another industry observation is the operational and financial pressures on health care providers remains high. It is a challenge for them to keep up with Meaningful Use, health care reform, Value-Based Purchasing and other requirements, all while facing ongoing pressure on reimbursement. Our solutions and services are very well-aligned with helping our clients navigate these challenges, which is why we continue to have good results and a strong pipeline in what could otherwise be viewed as a challenging market.","In addition, providers are looking beyond their near-term challenges and increasing their focus on population health strategies to prepare for an expected industry shift to an at-risk model that incents ph] keeping people healthy. Our capabilities and population health, combined with the large investments we are making in new solutions and services, are creating competitive differentiation and positioning us for sustained growth beyond the current EMR and Meaningful Use era.","Finally, industry consolidation is continuing, with the biggest recent example being the announcement of Tenet purchasing Vanguard Health. This acquisition is another example where our large clients are being acquisitive to gain additional scale. As we have discussed, this is a positive trend for Cerner given our strong relationships with most of the largest health systems, which are also the most acquisitive.","In summary, the environment remains favorable for Cerner. We have a large pipeline of new footprint opportunities with only 1 primary competitor. Our solutions and services are well-aligned with what health care providers need both today and in the future, and industry trends are creating additional opportunities for Cerner.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike.","Michael R. Nill","Thanks, Zane. Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'm going to discuss Revenue Cycle and ITWorks and provide a midyear update on our corporate imperatives.","I'll start with Revenue Cycle. In Q2, we had very strong Revenue Cycle results that included another RevWorks client. The client we signed this quarter is a pediatric hospital that offers over 40 pediatric specialties and subspecialties and has had Cerner Solutions since 1991. This partnership marks a milestone for us, as it is our first pediatric hospital to choose RevWorks.","Like many of our long-term clients, the RevWorks alignment was viewed as a natural next step to continue driving value out of their investments. They're looking to strategically align with RevWorks in consideration of future regulatory requirements, financial predictability and desire for innovation and best practice Revenue Cycle operations. This selection, coupled with very large clients endorsing our Revenue Cycle solutions and services in recent quarters, reflects ongoing momentum in our Revenue Cycle business. This activity also represents early returns on the significant investments we have been making in our Revenue Cycle capabilities. Our pipeline for Revenue Cycle solutions and full RevWorks services is very strong, as the tighter [ph] link between clinical outcomes and Revenue Cycle continues to drive more clients to our integrated offering.","Q2 also included success within our ITWorks offering, as we signed a contract that represents a major expansion in relationship with a client that began using Cerner Solutions in 1989. This is our largest ITWorks client to date and is another example of how very long-term relationships can continue to expand in meaningful ways. The client has 3 hospitals with a total of more than 700 beds. Like our other ITWorks clients, their desire to strategically align with Cerner was based on a desire to keep up with current and future regulatory requirements, plans for continued growth and a desire for innovation in health and care.","As Zane discussed, our clients face ongoing pressures to address multiple industry requirements while also controlling costs. Our works offering provides a way for them to address these requirements, drive better performance and control those costs.","Now I'd like to provide a midyear update on our corporate imperatives in areas of R&D investment. As you know, our imperatives in R&D investments are focused on physician experience, population health and Revenue Cycle. Investment in these areas are strengthening our competitiveness while also setting us up for the next wave of growth.","I'll start with physician experience. We made very good progress in 2013 in enhancing our physician solutions for both inpatient and ambulatory settings. A major part of this effort has been PowerChart Touch, which is now generally available in the Apple store for use on the iPad. PowerChart Touch's fast, easy and smart solutions have been very well-received in the marketplace, and in May, PowerChart Touch received an award for Best Clinical Health Care Experience Application at the International User Experience Awards. This award, along with the record results Zane discussed, is good validation of our work. Going forward, we remain focused on building out applications with various specialties and creating seamless workflows across all devices.","Moving to population health. Progress this year includes advancing our Cloud platform and data analytics capabilities that are foundational to population health efforts. Also, our expanded partnership with Advocate Health Care is a tremendous step forward and is an exciting opportunity for us. Advocate is a thought leader regarding population health, so it means a great deal that they chose Cerner to partner to help develop the technology to manage the health and care of populations for which they have gone at risk.","We've also made good strides with Revenue Cycle. The primary indicator of this progress is a demand for our solutions and services, which has picked up substantially in recent quarters. Our work has improved our competitiveness, as having Revenue Cycle solutions tightly integrated into the clinical process is important to ensure proper reimbursement in the new value-based payment models. Going forward, we will continue to invest heavily in Revenue Cycle capabilities, including key differentiators like revenue analytics and care management.","In summary, while most of our competitors are bogged down with Meaningful Use and other regulatory requirements, we are investing heavily to position us for more market share gains and for long-term growth. We're seeing clients choose Cerner for the value we show today and for the fact that we have a vision that will sustain them in the future. We believe we are the only company in the industry making the investments in technologies, architectures and solutions that will meet the needs of our clients over the long haul. We are future-proofing our clients, and it's good for our business as well as theirs.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeffrey A. Townsend","Thanks, Mike. Today, I'm going to talk about the Primary Health network and provide an update on the work we are doing with Advocate Health Care.","I'll start with the Primary Health network, which is a pilot program we launched last month that connects incentives and aligns consumers and providers to facilitate improved health. The PHN involves the health retailer, a high-performance physician network and innovative employers. The key component of the network is the use of select retail locations to serve as access points for wellness screenings with a nurse. At these screenings, individuals will learn important elements about their health, receive tailored recommendations for becoming healthier and select a primary care physician that aligns with their health needs and preferences. Our Cerner wellness solutions and Healthe Intent platform provide the underlying technology for the program's wellness, condition management, education, performance analysis and reporting components.","We are pleased that the retail partner for this pilot is Walmart, which gives us the potential to have a significant impact on the health and wellness of communities, as 70% of America visits one of their stores every other week. Kansas City-based Hallmark Cards is the first of multiple employer participants for the pilot. Hallmark's employees and their spouses now have convenient ways to discover their health status and connect with highly engaged physicians in the community who have been specifically selected for them based on their individual preferences. With the Primary Health network, we are aiming to create an entirely new health care experience by engaging individuals with a team dedicated to their wellness and helping them create a medical home. Ultimately, this should lead to a community that delivers measurable, high-quality, evidence-based health services at a reasonable cost by aligning incentives with improved outcomes.","The PHN also can address access and capacity issues, drive referrals to primary care and create more revenue opportunities for those that shift to manage contracts or add-on services create value against total cost. We are already working on plans to expand the PHN to additional markets, and I will provide updates on our initial pilot and expansion plans on future calls.","As you know, we are also investing heavily in systems to help our providers manage the health of populations. While our investments are very broad, a focused area of investment is tied to our work with Advocate Health Care and the Advocate physician partners, as this work will lead to solutions being used at scale beginning next year.","As a quick background, recall that we began an initial collaboration with Advocate in April 2012 to create new data-driven predictive models designed to improve patient health outcomes and safety. One of the first outcomes of this partnership was the joint development of a predictive agent for readmissions that has demonstrated significant improvement and predictive power as compared to the majority of the existing models. A study highlighting this success was recently published in the Online Journal of Public Health Informatics.","Our relationship expanded this year to further advance clinical integration and population health management capabilities across the continuum of care for the 500,000 lives for which they have gone at risk. We are enabling them to identify who in their population meets criteria across 16 specific registries and 60 performance improvement scorecards, with parameters Advocate has created. As members needing care are identified, we will facilitate personalized interventions, enrollment and care management programs and ongoing monitoring to allow Advocate to keep people healthy. This work with Advocate is going at a fast pace and is very complex.","An example of the complexity is that we are aggregating normalizing data from 52 different data sources, including multiple EMRs, private and public payers, third-party billing and registration systems and physician specialty scorecards. This requires the ability to take both structured and unstructured data and run it through our Big Data engine using medical language processing, not just the more commonly used Natural Language Processing or NLP. This allows us to enhance the data and map it to a normalized standard to have a highly structured longitudinal record that enables all the real-time analytics I've discussed.","The level of interest by our clients in what we are doing with Advocate in the population health overall is very high. This was demonstrated last week when we hosted our first Population Health Summit, which drew 144 client attendees. Clients were able to network and learn from each other on other topics of population health management, readmission prevention, health information exchange, member engagement, patient-centered medical homes, continuum of care, analytics and quality measures. The summit validated the level of client interest and the direction we are going with our population health solutions.","In summary, I believe our approach to population health is differentiated in the marketplace. We believe many companies positioning themselves as suppliers of population health solutions underestimate the complexity, and none of them are addressing the population health opportunity with the comprehensive architectural approach that sets us apart.","Before turning the call over for questions, I'd like to highlight an announcement that was made yesterday by the CommonWell Health Alliance, that CPSIA and Sunquest Information Systems have joined as the newest members. They joined Allscripts, athenahealth, Cerner, Greenway Medical Technologies, McKesson and service provider RelayHealth in a collaborative effort focused on achieving interoperability and data liquidity on a national infrastructure. As we have stated, achieving data liquidity is a critical foundation for delivering better coordinated, more effective care, and we believe the addition of CPSI and Sunquest strengthen these efforts.","In addition to adding members, CommonWell also made significant progress recently at establishing a governance structure, developing services and planning for an upcoming pilot program.","With that, let's open up the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Charles Rhyee from Cowen and Company.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Marc, you're obviously taking advantage of being a consolidator in the market -- your customers are being the consolidator in the market. And you mentioned Tenet briefly here. Can you kind of -- I know this is a contract that you kind of took over the entire thing a couple of years ago. Can you maybe give us a sense on where you are actually with that client? And if I'm not mistaken, I think you already serve some of the Vanguard system. Can you kind of talk about the mix there for you? And sort of -- if that kind of transition's all over, when would you kind of think about discussions with Tenet about that?","Zane M. Burke","Charles, this is Zane. Just a couple of comments. We are still engaged in the middle of the rollout, a very successful rollout at the Tenet engagement they rolled out to a number of other facilities. They're in the 30s in terms of their facility counts that rolled Cerner out. So that's an active engagement that's still ongoing, and there's a lot of work to do there. Obviously, the Vanguard transaction hasn't been completed by Tenet, and we haven't had excessive dialogue about what that means for us. But that's a positive sign on that. There are about 8 of the 20 -- I believe 28 facilities of Vanguard are Cerner facilities today.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Great. And then maybe one follow-up. I mean, you were talking about the opportunities you have within your expanding relationship within your -- in your base here. But thinking more broadly, as the hospitals are getting impacted by sequestration and stuff, a couple of days ago, one of the IT service providers, which I think also implements some Cerner and Epic as well, kind of talked about sequestration having some delays on some systems development. It doesn't seem like it's really having an impact on you, but maybe you can kind of help us understand where some of the differences might be, what some of these service providers are seeing versus, I mean, what you're seeing.","Marc G. Naughton","This is Marc. The only one that I'm aware of that talked about the lack of the market, I think other reporting indicated that anybody they were laying off, they'd be happy to hire. So I think that was a very targeted view of the market. We continue to hire kids off campus and experienced people to -- for our implementation teams. Our business is as active as it has ever been. Our backlog in those projects is the biggest it's ever been. So we're certainly not seeing any lack of demand for those services due to anything that the government is putting out there. In fact, the more things the government puts out there, the more we see an interest in systems, given their ability to reduce cost while meeting all these new requirements.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dave Windley from Jefferies.","David H. Windley - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","I wanted to ask a couple of questions around population health. So your Advocate partnership, I believe, is moving very rapidly toward the system completion on that by the end of this year. So I'm curious about, one, the commercialization opportunity of that system or something akin to it. And would those 144 who attended your summit be the likely targets for that? And then on the cost side of things, would we see R&D tail off after that's complete?","Marc G. Naughton","Yes. Jeff, I'll let you maybe answer some of the Advocate questions. From a financial side, we clearly are focusing on getting a lot done in a short period of time relative to population health. It's part of our overall investment and IP that you're seeing hitting us on the capital side. That's not just limited to population health. Obviously, doing physicians and Revenue Cycle, which is a huge market potential for us going forward, are all things that we're working on. But those -- that really big push to get those projects out do tail off as we hit kind of the middle of 2014. So as we talked about in my script, the CapEx should reduce as we hit in 2014. But Jeff, do you have any comments relative to the summit and Advocate?","Jeffrey A. Townsend","Yes. On Advocate, the way we somewhat broadly look at it is, they're 1 or 2 eras ahead or cycles ahead of most of the marketplace. So the solution said that they're taking forward, and as I outlined with dozens of data sources and 16 registries, the rest of -- if I'm summarizing the attendees to that conference, all have initiatives at various stages, whether they are shared savings programs, they are attempting member engagement or they're just building data warehouses. So the advantage of Advocate is the ability for them to see what does it look like when you put this entire stack together and begin to coordinate comprehensively, versus at a component-based level. So we see them -- those other organizations as they continue to change their reimbursement contracts and take on more risk or launch broader ACO initiatives. We'll then fall in line and somewhat replicate or copy that Advocate roadmap.","David H. Windley - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","If I could ask one follow-up, Marc. On your new building build-out, when those are complete and you're moving people into those buildings, should we anticipate a spike in operating costs or the combination of operating costs and depreciation in the income statement? And when would that hit if we should?","Marc G. Naughton","Yes. We are building -- the first building of the 2 building complex campus is complete, and people are moving in there as we speak. The cost of moving is very low, because it's all basically taking people from Kansas City facilities and moving them just to a new facility. So for the most part, the expense isn't very high. And many times, it's the cost of the couple of cardboard boxes for them to put in their trunk to take over the new building, not that we're low-cost movers, but that is an approach that many of them take. So you won't see any big costs -- when the buildings are complete, they'll start depreciating, but that will be over a 50-year life. So...","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rob Jones with Goldman Sachs.","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I had a high-level question. If you look at a lot of the hospital and med tech manufacturers, it seems like hospitals might have cut back on CapEx broadly. Is that something you guys have noticed in the marketplace? And if so, are hospitals being more cautious around IT spending as well in your view? Or has it been more restricted to things linked closer to utilization?","Zane M. Burke","Rob, this is Zane. What we have seen is, certainly, people are being judicious about how they invest dollars, but that they use health care IT as one of the ways that they're actually going to drive costs out of their businesses. And so they're using that as a lever for that. They've also looked at, I think, a number of the activities around ITWorks and RevWorks that Mike talked about with you, where they're utilizing some of those services to help create more predictable cost models and actually drive better efficiencies and use their funds in other ways. So it's created quite a bit of opportunity for us.","Marc G. Naughton","Yes, this is Marc. Just the CFOs I talk with, many of them talk about from an MRI, from that type of CapEx standpoint that there was a race where I had to have the latest, greatest, most efficient. Now nobody's -- people aren't investing quite as much in that infrastructure. They work just fine. So many people aren't really investing -- needing to invest to keep up with the competitive environment relative to some of that hardware. So we can certainly see a differentiation, at least when I talk to people, about what's on their CapEx list, things that are going to help them take 20% out of their operating costs as opposed to, \"I'm trying to get the next new thing so that I can attract radiologists or stand alone.\"","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Makes sense. And then if I could just follow up. It seems like you guys have had some success in the public sector. Can you maybe just discuss the trends in that market specifically amongst those clients? And how are you thinking about the size of that overall opportunity?","Zane M. Burke","The trends have been -- there's actually funds there. We're seeing it, everything from, \"how do we manage the health status of the population?\" to -- everything up to the incarcerated folks. And so the gamut of public health is quite large, and there seems to be quite a bit of funding and even in decreasing public budgets that are out there. So we see it as a fairly significant opportunity, and we're the only ones in the industry that provide the continuum of care across all those different marketplaces where we can actually go hunt for dollars in those different markets.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Halper, Lazard Capital Markets.","Steven P. Halper - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Relative to the lower sales on tech resale, can you identify what areas within tech resale were below your plan? And as a follow-up, this is not the first time we've seen this. How, as a management team, can you sort of get a better handle on that component, even though it'll recognize in the bottom line impact as nominal?","Marc G. Naughton","Yes, this is Marc. Those are third-party resale items. They're not our items. Obviously, we have a very small inventory of things that we actually put out there such as Rx station cabinets, but -- and the [indiscernible] space has been probably the biggest impact for us. In 2012, we had a lot of sales. Those tend to be cyclical when you come out with a new model, then the cycle kind of flattens until the next new model comes out and then it picks back up. So that's impacted the total tech resale probably as much as anything. As a management team, we work as hard as we can, but when it is a third-party sales force that's doing the work, and because of potential competition in certain areas, they don't want to share their information relative to what their pipeline looks like and their timing. We really have to kind of fly blind a little bit on that. So we do our best relative to creating a guidance range that can take the low and the high. This quarter, we came in kind of at the low end of what we expected. We think that's going to slightly increase the rest of the year. And, obviously, we wouldn't want to create any expectations that we're higher than that because of the lack of visibility. So I think as a management team, we're doing everything we can to get a better view of it. We're continuing to roll out other opportunities in the hardware space, the device space, expanding our portfolio so that we can get more diversity, which will help us be able to predict a little bit more accurately. And Steve, as we've talked about for a long time, certainly, at the top line impacts, but given how that the revenue doesn't flow down to a great extent down to the earnings line, it's really just not something that we're overly concerned about. I think it's good revenue to get, it's part of our strategy of getting everything the client wants to buy coming through us, which we think will expand our opportunities as we move forward into these new areas. But from a business standpoint, I think we're doing exactly what we need to do and what we can do. And you just -- guys will just have to bear with us a little bit given some of the variance.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sean Wieland from Piper Jaffray.","Sean W. Wieland - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","So I look at your Q3 guidance and it implies revenues are going to have a pretty big ramp. Can you just talk about what is going to be driving that revenue growth in the fourth quarter and also the sustainability of that growth into next year?","Marc G. Naughton","Relative to the -- on the Q4 elements? Relative to the year, what the Q3 guidance is going to be?","Sean W. Wieland - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Yes.","Marc G. Naughton","Obviously, Q4 is, overall, our strongest quarter. I mean, that's the quarter that we always do well in. There's a lot of pent-up demand. We see a lot of opportunities in the marketplace that are going to be coming into our bookings that are going to create revenue opportunities. A lot of things are in our backlog that are going to continue to contribute to it. So I don't know if there's anything unique other than the success that usually comes with the fourth quarter driving that, which usually entails strong software and other things that are quick turnaround items, plus things that are building up in the backlog that will roll out. But there's nothing unique that I identify.","Sean W. Wieland - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay. And then a follow-up. Can you talk about -- I like the investments in the Cloud infrastructure. Is your population health management platform being employed in a multi-tenant environment? And what do you think about the multi-tenant environment for kind of the core Millennium? Do you see a time where you'll be deploying your inpatient solutions via the Cloud?","Michael R. Nill","This is Mike. Regarding population health, yes, the Cloud, I mean, basically, by its -- by design is a multi-tenant environment that provides us with the scalability that we need to support countries for this type of application. So regarding whether this will make its way into our existing solutions in the inpatient environment. If we start with PowerChart Touch. PowerChart Touch is being implemented in a Cloud-type architecture, and we're doing that to deliver the response time and speed that's required for those type of tablet applications. I think, over time, what we will find is we're not going to do a wholesale move of all of our current clinical applications into the Cloud. I think there will be some opportunities to provide some functions on an as-needed basis, but that will be a gradual evolution over time.","Marc G. Naughton","Sean, this is Marc. Just to -- not to step on Mike's toes here, but just to go back to your revenue question. Do keep in mind that when we are -- that based on the hardware we're seeing from a revenue perspective in Q4, that we've kind of indicated the low end of our annual guidance is more likely. And I think if you factor that in, you're not going to see a huge ramp in Q4 relative to what the revenue would look like. The difference in potential for that to be bigger would be if hardware recovered stronger. But we don't know that, that's something we're seeing on our radar today. So hopefully, that helps clarify it. Sorry.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dave Francis with JAAG Research.","David Francis","A couple of quick questions. First, Marc, on the systems sales margin, understanding that with the lack of hardware revenue pass-through there, that the margin is naturally going to be higher. It was exceptionally high this quarter. And I guess I'm wondering, what should we be looking for in terms of where does that level top out and what should we be expecting from a software margin perspective going forward for the company as you guys continue to push the envelope on that?","Marc G. Naughton","Well, relative to systems sales gross margin at 82.2%, it's up less than 100 basis points over Q1. So I think given the current state of our hardware sales, we're kind of looking that, that's probably the range that our gross margins are going to be in. So I don't know that there's -- that, that's historically high. Well, I have to go back and see how high that is. But certainly, it's strong, it's going to reflect lower hardware and it's going to reflect the continuing strong software that we've been seeing. So based on those -- the diversity of those margins that are contributing to gross margin, we think kind of what we see in the first 2 quarters should be what we continue to see for the year.","David Francis","Okay. And a quick follow-up. Relative to the activity that you've seen among the buyers and what your works service lines offer them relative to more efficient use of capital and what have you, are you expecting to see any kind of acceleration in terms of deals signed there? Or should we continue to be looking for just 1 or 2 bigger deals per quarter here over the next several quarters?","Marc G. Naughton","This is Marc. I think if you're going to say 1 or 2 deals a quarter would be an acceleration, we kind of have indicated that when we thought we kind of hit a good stride, we'd be doing 1 a quarter. We're getting pretty close to that. Is there an opportunity to expand on that? I think there is. Zane, what are your thoughts?","Zane M. Burke","We feel like there's great opportunity there, and I think you've hit it, Marc. I think we see continued demand for those type of services in our base, and I think there's an opportunity for some of that to accelerate.","Marc G. Naughton","Yes. I think the key is that as systems look to handle their costs and reduce their costs, our works businesses absolutely are in tune with that approach, because we're going to help them manage and actually probably reduce their overall spending on a like-for-like basis from what they're doing. So in that environment, we are getting more and more people looking at us for an option to help them drive the cost cuts that they need to remain competitive.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Larsen, Leerink Swann.","David Larsen - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Zane, can you talk briefly about these investments that have been made into the physician user experience? And can you talk about PowerWorks, how that product has evolved? And just in general terms, of the 45,000 docs that are currently your clients, are they all in PowerWorks or some of them on PowerChart? And then can you also just talk about Ascension Health and their decision to go with athena?","Zane M. Burke","David, you had a number of questions, so I'll see if I can answer those. If I miss one, please help me come back to it. But Cerner ambulatory, which is what we refer to our solution, we are leading with an integrated Cerner -- integrated solution. And so many of the wins over the last 24 months and this growth that we've had has been in our integrated environment. We continue to market and sell the PowerWorks environment, which is typically done for affiliated physicians, which is also the Cerner Millennium solution just in a hosted model. We've had great success actually in the Business Office Services and Revenue Cycle side, with our Business Office Services and our Millennium solution in the Revenue Cycle particular space. We've actually crossed the 50,000 physician mark for docs overall that are using some form of Cerner ambulatory solutions in that setting. As it relates to one of the competitors in this space and our client, obviously, Ascension is a significant client of Cerner's. It's very committed to the inpatient solution. My understanding is that particular arrangement is more of a hunting license within that organization and reflects that overall. So I like our competitive position against that particular competitor over the long term. And actually, one of our displacements was actually related to that environment and a number of competitive wins versus that particular supplier.","David Larsen - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Okay. That's very helpful. And then has there been recent new releases or new versions of PowerWorks that came out in 2013? And can you talk about maybe the functionality in those new versions relative to previous versions?","Zane M. Burke","So the functionality within Cerner Ambulatory and PowerChart, overall, we've had a number of enhancements in that regard over the last 24 months, 24 to 36 months, and is an absolute lead with -- for Cerner today and is really one of the best, is was actually the #1 black book ambulatory EHR out there. And so the enhancements that we've made to the solution overall from an ambulatory perspective have been extremely well-received by our clients, as well as the early returns around PowerChart Touch in the ambulatory environment, which is, that's the first venue which that application will hit as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Cherny, ISI Group.","Michael Cherny - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","So just digging in a little bit, you mentioned how long-term bookings number for the quarter was a little bit above the elevated level. I think you said 34% relative to where it's been previously. As you think about that as a percent of total bookings, particularly into the population health management push, which seems to be a little -- a combination of service and technology, maybe more service-oriented, how do you expect that trend to move over time? Are we more likely to see it closer to that mid-30s level? Or is that 25% to 30% range you've historically talked about the more likely level?","Marc G. Naughton","Yes. I mean, Michael, it's -- my crystal ball is not clear enough to know even exactly what the population health business model is going to be as it rolls out in its various venues to be able to kind of know how long-term those might be and where they're going to fall. So clearly, if it's a PMPM for an extended period of time, then that would be a longer-term booking. I think, certainly, in the near and medium term, that the 30% or so bookings being long-term reflects our overall growth in bookings and the fact that works businesses are really starting to gain momentum and starting to get some traction. So we'll certainly -- if that moves much off of the 30%, we'll talk to you about what we're seeing is moving that, if it's moving up or down. As the works businesses start clicking, if I get to the suggested 2 works deals a quarter and if I'm doing ITWorks and RevWorks, it could impact it. But we have such strong demand for all of our other existing solutions and our services and things that don't go into long-term and a lot of the new business that we're getting and we're signing up. Most of that is a short-term or at least not in our long-term bookings. So I think that the likelihood is that we'll stay in that same range for a while. And if we're going to see a movement out of that, we'll try to give you a heads up as to that. But in the near term, I don't see -- we'll get a nice balance for both elements of the portfolio or growing at a similar rate.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Greg Bolan, Sterne Agee.","Gregory T. Bolan - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","I wanted to ask kind of a quarterly ritual question, Marc, on uses of cash. Any update there as it relates to what you guys are thinking about?","Marc G. Naughton","Yes, Greg. I mean, today, obviously, we reported -- I'm talking about cash flow, how we had spend a lot of the cash flow and coming up with about $47 million of free cash flow. So we are certainly investing that cash flow that we're driving in the quarter in some of our infrastructure, obviously, from a building perspective, the infrastructure on the CapEx side relative to our population health and other initiatives and, certainly, on the stock buyback and on the R&D investments. So I think kind of on a quarterly basis, we've all got a big focus on investing back in the business. The $1.5 billion number we kind of hit, we've been at for a couple of quarters. So we're really investing the cash we've earned since then back in the business. We think that's the best path. We still are going to keep an eye on that $1.5 billion, keep an eye on the marketplace. We're always interested in things that can add to our portfolio without impacting our single architecture strategy. And a lot of the acquisitions you've seen us do in the last 1 or 2 years have been things, such as behavioral health, that has actually put us into some of these government markets that you can't even submit an RFP if you don't have that specific requirement. So I think we're going to continue looking at that, and we're comfortable with where we're at with cash now. We'll continue to look at stock buyback. Obviously, we have a little bit left to finish up our current one. But right now, I think we like what we're doing with our cash, and we're going to look at continuing to keep that $1.5 billion in our pocket for -- as we see opportunities develop.","Gregory T. Bolan - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Fair enough. And just kind of thinking about -- and I apologize if I missed it, if you made any comments on this, Marc. But just regard -- with regards to the pipeline and the magnitude of it, just kind of recalling sometime around this time last year, just how you felt about the pipeline going into the back half, specifically into the fourth quarter. Just wanted to see if maybe you could characterize, maybe qualify, if you would, where you are versus, say, historically just in terms of all-time high or close to it. Or how are you thinking -- or what does it look like at this point?","Zane M. Burke","This is Zane. We just completed our forecasting process where we actually go through and talk about the next 4 core pieces, and I can't say that it was an all-time high. And so we did see -- we have seen significant growth in the pipeline across all segments inclusive of our global segments and domestic as well.","Marc G. Naughton","This is Marc. The marketplace is as strong as we've seen it. The things that we're rolling out, the new businesses, RevWorks, ITWorks, are just exactly what certainly our clients are looking for. And I think we talked about some of the other competitors, clients starting to come back to the market. This forecast meeting we just had, '14 looks like the time when we're going to start seeing those come in more than a onesie-twosie fashion. So we like the market that we see certainly for the rest of the year and actually into the visibility we had in kind of the early part of '14.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gavin Weiss with JPMorgan.","Gavin Weiss - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","You mentioned the CommonWell announcement of a few new members there. What steps have been taken in this group today? And where do you see the real implications of this going forward?","Jeffrey A. Townsend","This is Jeff. As far as the group goes kind of since our HIMSS announcement, I'd say there's been 3 paths that the broad group has been working on together. One is to co-form the real entity, the governing principles around that entity and how it evolves over time. The second path would be on the pure technology itself. And so taking the library of existing standards that are out there and attempting to accelerate those that make sense to achieve that objective around that ID and to get that into the market more quickly, so how do you introduce new standard without it becoming almost another wave of Meaningful Use where the suppliers have to go do a lot of work back in their EMR and that delays adoption? So I think you'll see -- as we introduce the pilots, that will be probably one of the areas I'm probably most excited about and the work that's been done to date. The third category is to actually go pick those target markets that have in a community enough of a sampling of all the participants. And as I briefly said in my comments, I think we're down to 3 to 5 communities that we've honed in on to go bring this up in the near term. So my expectation is, over the next few months, you'll begin to actually see demonstrations of the solution and a more open platform that allows others to go adopt it more quickly.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Stockton from Wells Fargo.","Jamie Stockton - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I guess just real quick. Zane, you said that you guys have had a record quarter for ambulatory deals, all-time record, I think. Just -- it seems like you've had a couple of great years from an ambulatory standpoint. Can you talk about -- and maybe this is a question for Mike, I don't know. From an implementation standpoint, have you really hit the inflection point as far as getting those docs live? Or is that something that is still in front of us?","Zane M. Burke","This is Zane. Many of those are still in front of us. So we did have a number of physicians go live in the last -- in the first 6 months of the year. So I think we're -- we went live with about -- over 4,000 physicians since the beginning of the year, but we've added significant in excess of that. So we have opened a number of those to go live in front of us.","Jamie Stockton - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then maybe this one's for Mike. But the works deals, I would imagine that all of the effort that is going to go into ICD-10 is probably causing hospitals some stress on top of Meaningful Use. I was just curious if -- among the various topics that are driving the IT or the RevWorks deals, if ICD-10 is toward the top of the list. Or could that potentially accelerate some near-term opportunities from a works standpoint?","Zane M. Burke","This is Zane. Again, just in terms of the market opportunity for that, there is opportunity around ICD-10 services, but it's not the primary driver of either RevWorks or the ITWorks elements. The RevWorks side, many of them are preparing -- they're really thinking about, yes, ICD-10 is part of their first hurdle they have to get over, but they're really preparing for multiple hurdles as it relates to changes and what's going to occur in the reimbursement elements of this and in terms of really getting an updated Revenue Cycle solutions and processes around that. And the ITWorks piece is really much more around fixed predictable costs at a time when they have kind of an insatiable appetite for IT solutions and services.","Marc G. Naughton","Well, this is Marc. I wanted to thank everybody for being on the call today. We're very pleased with the results, and certainly, the activity that we see in the market going forward really is at an all-time high, as we've indicated. We are very focused on investing in our platform. And you're going to continue to see us use cash to do that for a targeted period of time that will end in 2014, where you'll see us go back to kind of traditional free cash flow levels that are near 100% of our net earnings. So I think we are doing the appropriate thing investing at it -- investing in it at a time when the market is there and when we think we know what the market is asking for. So we feel great about the business, and we look forward to having a chance to talk with you all later. Thank you very much.","Operator","This concludes today's conference.

Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements.

Cerner assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Marc Naughton, Chief Financial Officer of Cerner Corporation.","Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Thank you, Nicole. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the call. I'll lead off today with a review of the numbers. Zane Burke, our President, will follow me with results, highlights, and marketplace observations. And then Mike Nill, our Chief Operating Officer, will provide some operational highlights.","Now I will turn to our results. Q1 was a good start to 2017, with bookings, revenue, and earnings all at the high end of our guidance ranges. Starting with bookings, our bookings in Q1 was $1.25 billion, which reflects a 7% increase over Q1 of 2016. Our revenue backlog ended the quarter at $16.098 billion, which is up 10% from $14.615 billion a year ago.","Revenue in the quarter was $1.26 billion, which is up 11% over Q1 of 2016, driven by a strong growth in system sales and services. The revenue composition for Q1 was $320 million in system sales, $262 million in support and maintenance, $656 million in services, and $22 million in reimbursed travel.","System sales revenue for the quarter was up 14% compared to Q1 of 2016, then driven primarily by strong licensed software growth, as well as solid growth in technology resale. The higher level of software is reflected in the strong system sales margin percent of 68.6%, which is up 50 basis points over Q1 of 2016 and 150 basis points over Q4 of 2016. Moving to services, total services revenue, including professional and managed services, was up 11% compared to Q1 of 2016. Support and maintenance revenue increased 4% for the quarter, which is in line with our expectations.","Looking at revenue by geographic segment, domestic revenue increased 13% over the year-ago quarter to $1.13 billion and non-U.S. revenue declined 3% to $129 million. On non-U.S. revenue decline, note that currency fluctuations impacted revenue by about 2%, so revenue was basically flat on a constant currency basis. In addition, the primary driver of the lack of growth was a decline in non-U.S. technology resale.","Moving to gross margin, our gross margin for Q1 was 84.2% which is basically flat compared to a year ago and up a 130 basis points compared to Q4 of 2016.","Now I'll discuss spending, operating margin, and net earnings. For these items, we provide both GAAP and adjusted or non-GAAP results. The adjusted results exclude share-based compensation expense, share-based compensation permanent tax items, Health Services acquisition-related amortization, acquisition-related deferred revenue adjustments, and other acquisition-related adjustments which are detailed and reconciled to GAAP in our earnings release.","The adjustment for share-based compensation permanent tax items is a new adjustment this year to incorporate a new accounting standard adopted in Q1, which is designed to simplify accounting for share-based compensation. There is more information in our release, but we are basically reducing our adjusted earnings by the amount of the permanent tax benefit, so our results will be comparable to prior periods. In addition, not including this tax benefit should reduce significant swings in our adjusted tax rate that would occur if we did not adjust it out.","Looking at operating spending, our first-quarter GAAP operating expenses of $817 million were up 9% compared to $747 million in the year ago period. Adjusted operating expenses were $773 million, which is up 10% compared to Q1 of 2016. This growth was primarily driven by an increase in personnel expense related to revenue generating associates, which is reflected in the sales and client service expense line that increased 12%. Software development increased 9%, driven by non-cash items as we had $4 million less capitalized software and $8 million more amortization than Q1 of 2016. G&A expense was up 3%. Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles decreased by $1 million.","Moving to operating margins, our Q1 GAAP operating margin was 19.4% compared to 18.9% in the year-ago period. Our adjusted operating margin was 22.9% in Q1, which is essentially flat to the year-ago period and in line with previously communicated expectations.","Moving to net earnings and EPS, our GAAP net earnings in Q1 were $173 million or $0.52 per diluted share. Adjusted net earnings were $198 million and adjusted diluted EPS was $0.59, up 11% from $0.53 in Q1 of 2016. Our GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 29%. When excluding the share-based compensation permanent tax items, the Q1 tax rate was 31%, which is basically flat compared to a year ago. Note that we also had a $3.3 million write-down of a venture capital investment as reflected in the other income line.","Now move to our balance sheet. We ended Q1 with $609 million of total cash and investments, which is up from $466 million in Q4. Moving to debt, our total debt, including capital lease obligations, was $550 million, which is down slightly compared to Q4.","Total receivables ended the quarter at $986 million, which is up from $945 million in Q4. Our Q1 DSO was 71 days, which is up from 69 days in Q4 and down from 76 days in the year-ago period. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $304 million. Q1 capital expenditures were $88 million, and capitalized software was $71 million. Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less capital purchases and capitalized software development costs, was $144 million for the quarter.","Note that our operating cash flow reflects certain classification changes required by the previously mentioned new accounting standard adopted in Q1. For Q1 2017, this impact resulted in approximately $12 million more operating cash flow than under the prior accounting guidance. We have also recast 2016 cashless to reflect this change, which resulted in Q1 of 2016 operating cash flows increasing by $9 million over what was previously reported. Regarding free cash flow, we still expect to increase our free cash flow by at least $150 million under the prior classification method.","It also likely we will drive a similar increase under the new method, unless the tax impact of share-based compensation is materially lower in 2017. Either way, we expect strong free cash flow this year. Finally, you will see that we added a cash flow statement to our press release schedules.","Now I'll go through guidance. We expect revenue in Q2 to be between $1.265 billion and $1.335 billion, with the midpoint reflecting growth of 7% over Q2 of 2016. For the full year we continue to expect revenue between $5.1 billion and $5.3 billion, reflecting 8% growth over 2016 at the midpoint. We expect Q2 adjusted diluted EPS to be $0.60 to $0.62 per share, with a midpoint reflecting 5% growth over Q2 of 2016. For the full year, we still expect adjusted diluted EPS to be $2.44 to $2.56, with a midpoint reflecting 9% growth over 2016.","Moving to bookings guidance, we expect bookings revenue in Q2 of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion. The midpoint is basically flat compared to Q2 of 2016, which is our toughest comparable in 2016. We continue to expect bookings growth for the full year.","In summary, we feel like we've started the year on a solid note, and we have a good outlook for the rest of the year.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Zane.","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","Thanks, Marc. Good afternoon, everyone. Today I'll provide color on our results and make some marketplace observations. I'll start with bookings. As Marc mentioned earlier, our Q1 bookings of $1.25 billion reflects 7% growth over Q1 of 2016. This growth was achieved without a new Cerner ITWorks contract, which we indicated was our expectation when we provided guidance.","In total, 24% of bookings came from long-term contracts, which is flat compared to Q1 of 2016 but below the 30%-plus average for the past several years. As Mike will discuss, we remain confident this will be a good year for Works bookings, with stronger contributions expected to begin next quarter. The main highlight of the quarter was our competitiveness and volume of new footprints, as reflected in 37% of bookings coming from outside our core Millennium installed base.","This included multiple head-to-head wins against our primary competitor. A noteworthy example was being selected by a Top 100 health system located in a top 10 metropolitan area for a full suite of acute EHR, ambulatory and Revenue Cycle solutions. Additionally, we were selected by another organization in the Southeast that is one of the largest publicly owned health systems in the U.S. Finally, we continue to see our large health system clients move more of their sites to Cerner as they look to get off legacy systems and standardize on Millennium.","One client this quarter contracted to move 10 sites from a competitor's legacy system to Cerner Millennium. And we have many more sites that could be transitioned to Cerner in the future. As we have discussed, our health system clients still have a significant number of sites on competitors' legacy systems that represent future opportunities.","Overall, our competitiveness is as good as it's ever been. We believe our primary competitor continues to be in a more defensive stance as a result of numerous factors, including cost overruns, that have impacted their clients financially and become more widely known in the marketplace.","We also believe that our predictable total cost of ownership, contemporary architecture, ability to demonstrate value, and solid and strong population health capabilities position us to continue having success against this competitor and others.","Beyond our strength in new business, we also had good contribution from other growth areas, such as population health and Revenue Cycle, with both positioned to deliver strong double-digit growth for the year. In population health, despite the uncertainty of exactly when the broader shift from fee-for-service to value-based care will occur, there continues to be a high interest in our population health solutions as providers realize they need to begin preparing for the shift long before it occurs. Further, we are able to demonstrate the ability of the HealtheIntent Platform to help our clients optimize performance in their fee-for-service business models while they are also preparing for new reimbursement models.","In Revenue Cycle, the strength continues to be driven by both new EHR clients including Revenue Cycle with their purchase, as well as further penetrating our existing EHR base with our Revenue Cycle solutions. We are also seeing increased demand for Revenue Cycle services, including targeted projects, transition services, business office management, and full outsourcing.","We also had a solid quarter in smaller venues with our Ambulatory and CommunityWorks offerings. In Ambulatory, we had success with extending our solutions to the ambulatory facilities of our large health system clients, which led to the displacement of several different ambulatory competitors during the quarter. We also had another strong quarter in Ambulatory Business Office Services. In CommunityWorks, we had a solid quarter that included multiple \u2013 beating multiple niche competitors. Activity remains high and we have a very good outlook for the year.","Next, I'd like to provide a quick update on our project with the Department of Defense. As we've discussed, we had a successful first go-live earlier this year, and we remain on track for additional go-lives throughout the year. We are honored to be part of this project and we are very pleased with the early success, which is a result of great effort by the Department of Defense, Cerner, Leidos, and other partners.","This project is making Cerner better, and I believe it ultimately benefits all our clients and is leading to enhanced implementation processes, advancements in cyber security, and sometimes connected technologies. We remained very focused on continuing to deliver for the Department of Defense, which we believe will help prepare and position us for other opportunities.","Moving to our business outside the U.S., despite the flat revenue Mark mentioned, we had a strong start to the year from a bookings standpoint. The strength of bookings was broad-based with over 20% bookings growth in Canada, Australia, Germany, Belgium, and the UK. Of note were two significant academic systems, including our first large client in Belgium and a very significant academic system in Australia. Both were won after rigorous and highly competitive selection processes that included our primary competitor.","Now I'd like to provide some observations on the U.S. marketplace. As I discussed last quarter, while there are unknowns about the future of Obamacare and the timing of the shift to value-based care, we are not seeing this have a material impact on our results. I think it's important to step back from the noise and consider that the dialog around Obamacare and its Republican alternatives is mainly focused on access and insurance reform, not care delivery reform. There isn't much of a discussion around the cost of care delivery.","If not addressed, the cost implications of the baby boomers hitting retirement, increases in chronic conditions, and reimbursement being tied to volume will lead to our healthcare costs continuing to grow as a percent of GDP at an unsustainable rate. We continue to believe information technology is the single biggest lever to drive cost down and quality up. From a policy standpoint, we believe the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015, or MACRA, is an important step in the right direction.","Unlike meaningful use, which mandated EHR adoption without requiring proof of better outcomes, MACRA rewards providers who achieve better outcomes and penalizes providers who do not. As the payer for roughly 50% of the care in the U.S., the federal government can use their leverage to push towards value-based care, and now that the core system is mostly digital, they can demand the measurements that are needed to do this.","With the change in the administration, we are seeing a predictable review, but most policymakers seem confident that MACRA and the overall shift to value-based reimbursement will continue. In our view, based on the forces and pressures that drive healthcare spending, it's hard to imagine ignoring the power of shifting from fee-for-service to a value-based system inside a competitive marketplace. And we clearly believe Cerner can play an important role in this shift.","In summary, we believe we are well positioned in an active marketplace, with both near-term and long-term drivers of business opportunity for Cerner.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike.","Michael R. Nill - Cerner Corp.","Thanks, Zane. Good afternoon, everyone. Today I'm going to discuss ITWorks and some initiatives that are focused on driving operational efficiencies, while also improving our quality.","I'll start with ITWorks. As Zane mentioned, and as contemplated in our forecast, we didn't have a new ITWorks deal in Q1. However, we did have an existing client expand and extend their ITWorks contract. We also had good sales back into our ITWorks base, which is an important part of our ITWorks model. Despite a lack of recent new deals, the ITWorks value proposition is resonating with many of our clients as we look to control costs, achieve operational excellence, and maintain security across the enterprise.","Looking ahead, we believe \u2013 we still believe several of the opportunities we contemplated in 2016 will be closed in 2017, and we continue to add opportunities to our pipeline. In total, we believe 2017 could be a record year for ITWorks bookings.","Now I'd like to briefly discuss two examples of initiatives focused on driving quality and efficiency. The first example is our focus on clinician productivity and satisfaction. One of CERN's unique competitive advantages is our ability to leverage analytics to understand the user experience within our solutions. With a tool called Cerner Advance, we create the ability to measure the EHR efficiency of each clinician and benchmark them against peers by specialty and venue. This unparalleled ability allows us to proactively identify areas of opportunity, engage with our clients to create data-driven plans for improvement, and measure the impact of these changes. Over 8,000 users and 500 organizations have leveraged this capability to advance their organizations towards best practices that represent more effective and efficient utilization of our solutions.","Another example of our focus is making our systems continuously available. One measure of this has been our ability to provide four nines of availability through our leading hosting capabilities. Going beyond this, we are now able to achieve continuous availability even during a Millennium release upgrade. This is significant \u2013 this is a significant achievement, and we have already performed many release upgrades without incurring downtime.","This accomplishment takes us a step closer towards our goal of continuous delivery, which I discussed at our HIMSS Investor Meeting. Through continuous delivery, we expect to enable automatic deployment of updates and new innovations, which should significantly increase the rate of adoption, lower cost of ownership, and an improve or our speed to market.","In summary, we believe these advancements will create significant value for our clients and drive tremendous productivity increases throughout Cerner. We also believe the ability to quickly deliver solutions at a lower cost will become more important as the financial pressures increase for our clients, and our ability to do this will become a competitive advantage.","With that I'll turn the call to over questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of Eric Percher of Barclays. Your line is now open.","Eric Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you. And thank you for the cash flow statement, I think it's a welcome addition. A question relative to cash, strong cash flow this quarter, cash building on the balance sheet, we didn't see you in the market, although we've seen you in prior Q1s. Was there anything in the market that that precluded you from repurchasing shares, or is there any thought on timing of repurchase and\/or other cash activity this year?","Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Yeah, Eric, this is Marc. There wasn't anything the market precluding us from being in the market in the market, the timing \u2013 by the time we released Q1 and then we go into quite period for the end \u2013 when we released for the year, and then go to quiet period for Q1, it just made sense at this point that we stay on the sidelines. We still have $100 million of capacity available to us, and we would expect that to be increased appropriately as we go forward by the board. We certainly at a minimum expect to continue buybacks at a level to reduce any dilution or eliminate any dilution we get from issuing stock options, but there is nothing in the quarter other than just the timing of our quiet periods.","Eric Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Very good. And one question on op expense, the level of reduction you saw this quarter, does that feel sustainable throughout the year?","Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp.","I think \u2013 I mean, I think op expense is certainly consistent with the plan that we had. So I think our goal will be to continue to watch spending as we do, and continue to make sure that we are managing expenses. So I don't think \u2013 I think the future for us will be fairly consistent.","Eric Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah, hi. Thank you, and congratulations for a really good quarter. If you can just give us a little bit more detail, I think in the prepared remarks you talked about 37% of bookings outside core. So when you think about gaining share, is this mostly from some of your customers that have acquired other hospitals, or is this just a new customer base? And also if you can talk a little bit in more detail about where you're seeing the demand on ITWorks, I think you said you expect it to tick up in the second quarter, so if you can just provide a little bit more details on that?","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","Sure. So thanks for the questions, and thanks for the congratulations. The net new additions of 37%, reflects, when we say outside of our core Millennium installed base, basically is a new client setting. And a lot of the \u2013 we saw a demand across all segments of our business, so I noted a large IDN, I noted a large public entity, I noted the two outside the U.S. on the significant side, but we saw that across the community hospital marketplace, across the small marketplace. So, there was a \u2013 and that's kind of been a trend that we've seen for the last several quarters, has been a very active replacement market for our solutions, and we've seen that in terms of that percentage.","As it relates to the ITWorks opportunities, we are seeing more larger opportunities coming in the pipeline than we've seen, historically speaking. So, there is a there's both a higher number of opportunities as well as larger opportunities moving forward. So we're seeing the success that we've had in ITWorks from an execution perspective, now reflecting up, going up-market a bit in terms of the size of opportunity that we go after \u2013 we want to go after \u2013 that we're going after, and that there's a good acceptance for. And so as we look forward into the back half of the year, we see a number of opportunities, and they're of a bigger size than what we've seen historically.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","So, should we think about the back half really as kind of an inflection point for ITWorks?","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","I think what we're saying is, it's kind of we think we have an opportunity to have a record high for ITWorks, which means not only returning to our 2015 highs that we saw, but the opportunity to eclipse our 2015 bookings amounts, which would be a significant bump from where we were in 2016.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Charles Rhyee of Cowen & Company. Your line is now open.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great, thanks for taking the question. I just want to follow up on Ricky's question. In terms of this \u2013 in the ITWorks opportunities, then you talked about going up-market to some bigger opportunities. What are clients using currently? Are they outsourcing to other, more traditional tech companies? Can you give us a sense for that competitive landscape looks there?","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","Most of these are in-house situations, so they're not typically outsourced, but they're looking \u2013 as I mentioned last year, there were not the same impetus in terms of the measures and mandates from a government perspective that were driving people to complete ITWorks business last year. We saw activity and we saw interest in what we were doing, but we were having a hard time moving things through the pipeline.","What we're seeing as we move through the cycle for 2017 and beyond, is a focus on organizations looking at how can they make an impact with their own associates on their core business operations, which are truly about delivering medical care, and they're looking at things like the IT shop as the ways to enable that medical care, not part of their core business model. And so it's both the opportunity to move faster, it's also the execution success we've had at our existing ITWorks clients in terms \u2013 and our ability to actually move faster and get better outcomes, as well as an unpredictable cost model in the future. We're able to bake in some of those kinds of assurances around what happens in your forward model.","We've done hosting for quite some time, so you think about hosting and application management, and some of the other Works businesses that we have, and we've been doing that for a long time. ITWorks becomes an extension from which we're able to jump off of and take the rest of the client's business in a bigger and broader space. And we've earned the confidence over time in those areas, and that's allowing us to have a different dialog. But I think the change from prior year to this year is we're seeing them \u2013 we're seeing the activity move forward, and you can see that they're getting closer in the close cycle. And I really think that's a reflection of people preparing for the future and some of these other measures and mandates beginning to pile up that they need help with.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC","That's helpful. And if I could just follow up on a question on RevWorks. I know you guys talked a little bit about seeing increased demand on different types of RevCycle management, and you mentioned outsourcing \u2013 sort of full outsourcing. What is some of the demand interest in that part of the market? And sort of your receptivity, how much are you moving into that direction at this point? Thanks.","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","We have a couple of full outsourced clients today. What we are seeing is similar to the ITWorks space; people are looking for how do I, again, create scale, use Cerner scale in a different way? How do I lock in some of the cost elements as I move forward? And how do I manage through some of the changing reimbursement sides of this? And so we're actually seeing the activity pick up on the full outsourcing as we look forward, as well. And so good activity through the pipeline is really building on the RevWorks side.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Jones at Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Adam Noble - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks for the question. This is Adam Noble in for Bob. I just want to ask around population health, if you could give any updates around there on PMPM trends? And kind of the growth in risk-based lives in your platform? How have those trended? And thinking about the guidance, anything you could share around expectations for those for the course of the year?","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","Well, I don't think we are releasing the PMPM elements at this point. What I would say, obviously I noted double digit, I would say those were significant double digits. So we had great, for Q1, increase over our Q1 of 2016, and we're looking \u2013 for the year, we're looking at significant double digits for the year in terms of growth in that area.","Adam Noble - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got you. That makes a lot of sense. And thinking about the margins, I think Marc you mentioned on last quarter's call that you expected operating margins to be roughly flat year-over-year in 2017. Thinking about, what are kind of the main drivers from the 1Q baseline that you think will kind of push it back to that level, as we go through the year?","Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Well, in Q1 we were basically flat year-over-year, and I think the biggest impact for us is the non-cash spend that we're going to incur in 2017, the $70 million or so uptick in that expense. So I think as projected, we expect operating margins to be relatively flat, and they were in Q1, we kind of expect that to continue this year. Obviously, we're pleased with the top-line growth, which allows us to grow earnings even with not realizing a lot of leverage in this year.","That being said, we are not expecting us to have flat margins for the longer term. The business is designed to create leverage, and once we kind of get through some of the headwinds relative to some of the amortization of software that \u2013 we spent a lot of money on building new stuff, and as those come online, and the net (31:36) cap rate kind of declines, we should get to a point where we're back to looking at the 50 basis point to 100 basis point growth. I'm not sure if we get to the top of that range in 2018, but certainly, as we start rolling forward, there is \u2013 the model has leverage in it, and we would expect to see margins grow, but in the near term, I think flat remains our expectation.","Adam Noble - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thanks for the questions.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Larsen of Leerink. Your line is now open.","David M. Larsen - Leerink Swann & Co.","Hi. Congratulations on a good quarter. Can you talk a bit about the VA and also the DoD, how are things progressing with the DoD, and any update on the VA's process? Thanks.","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","Thanks, David. So, the \u2013 I'll start with the DoD dialog. Obviously, I mentioned in my prepared comments, we had the first go-live, it's gone extremely well. The DoD has been a fantastic client to work with, and we are on track for the remaining three pilots as we come through the summer, for the year, and that is the initial proof-of-concept element for the DoD. And our objective is, along with our partners, is to put our head down and deliver and have it continue to go very well, and we think that positions us well for other opportunities as they come about.","As you are likely aware, the VA has issued an RFI for \u2013 to basically see what elements are out there in the commercial space, they have contracted with certain third parties to help do that review, and really make a determination as to whether they look at a commercially available off-the-shelf system, or COTS system, or stay with their Vista solution today. They could go back into \u2013 so, anything beyond that is speculation.","David M. Larsen - Leerink Swann & Co.","Okay, great. And then on the ambulatory side, who are you taking share from? Are you taking share, and how about like web-based vendors, such as Athena, I mean do you take share from them, just report (33:53) any thoughts around that?","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","So we're taking share from all competitors, and we had another strong ambulatory quarter where we're taking share across all the competition.","David M. Larsen - Leerink Swann & Co.","Okay, great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mohan Naidu of Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.","Mohan Naidu - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Thanks for taking my questions. Marc, quickly on the tech resale, you noted that you saw a strong tech resale quarter this year. Any particular areas you are seeing the strength in, and also do you see this becoming a tailwind in this year versus 2016, which I think was not such a great year?","Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Yeah, no, I think for the first time, tech resale feels like it's going to meet or perhaps slightly exceed our expectations, and that certainly was some of the upside that we had in this quarter. It's really broadly both hardware and third-party software, which is the key components of the things that we resell. But both of those did well this quarter. Certainly from my perspective, nice to have tech resale. As we've talked about in the past, talked about continuing to kind of reduce our expectations of what we thought tech resale was going to do, and the ability this quarter for them to come in at a number above what we were expecting, hasn't happened for a while. So we're definitely, we're excited about that.","Mohan Naidu - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Got it. Maybe quickly on the bookings. So this quarter, without an ITWorks deal, you guys were pretty strong in bookings growth. I hear you guys talking about the strength in ITWorks pipeline and confidence in closing them. Do you need some of these deals to close to get a bookings growth for the full year?","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","I mean, when we do our forecasting and for the annual, we obviously take into account all the transactions that are out there. For the most part, ITWorks, based on the difficulty in exactly forecasting the timing, are fairly risk-weighted down. So I don't know that I would absolutely say we've got to go deliver a bunch of ITWorks deals in order to get growth. Clearly, this quarter we delivered growth, with really not a lot of help from ITWorks. Q2, we're also not expecting a whole lot of help from ITWorks, with most of it coming kind of in the second half.","So, I think that \u2013 as we go forward, I think that we certainly have some nice pipeline, we certainly expect that to contribute, but I think it's not dependent on delivering a bunch of ITWorks deals.","Mohan Naidu - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","That's great. Congrats on a great start to the year.","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Cherny of UBS. Your line is now open.","[06P7T1-E Michael Cherny]Afternoon, guys. I want to echo the congratulations on a nice start to the year.","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","Thank you.","[06P7T1-E Michael Cherny]Thinking more about the competitive dynamic in hospital, you had really strong performance outside your core base. As you think about the discussions being had, I know you talked about DC, but relative to what hospitals are going through and the uncertainty of ACA, relative to also just general financial pressures, how do the discussions change when you go into those large rip-and-replaces about ROI? What ROI are you able to show these customers that can prove that they can take whatever, their tens, hundreds of millions of dollars that now looks like it's wasted, and move your way? I'm just trying to see how the discussion shifts in an environment where they don't have funding backing them up, and it's all based primarily on value proposition, if they ask for anything else from you?","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","Great question. So it's interesting. Each client has its own unique element, so there's not a total way \u2013 simple way to overly generalize, but I'll give you two examples. One we highlighted was the client that added the 10 additional sites, so they had Cerner in a reasonably sized chunk of their business, and they were looking to add to the portfolio. And what they're doing there, the justification is actually, we can consolidate our business for them, they can consolidate on a single platform, and there is more things to do, but they're actually seeing a hard ROI around the Cerner solution set and the capabilities that we have.","And so we have implemented a number of value creation, either offices or opportunities with our clients, and almost every new business opportunity has an ROI analysis around it, and that's part of our charter that we work together with the clients around that ROI. And really what clients are trying to do, in the case that I mentioned of the 10 space, that's one where they're trying to standardize their operations and reduce costs overall. At the same time, they have revenue enhancements from the software that we provide, so it's a double positive for them.","In a core, if you just think about a standalone organization, it's really \u2013 they're trying to do twofold. They're trying to prepare for the future, so they need a solid foundational system that will allow them to be flexible as they move forward, and give them as much comfort about the systems they're on, because as I mentioned previously, over half of the systems out there are not on a currently marketed solution. And so you have a lot of legacy cleanup that needs to occur. In addition to that, the ROI that we're able to provide, based on the Cerner solutions and it's unique to what we do, it helps those business cases move forward. So it's kind of \u2013 the conversation is really about the foundational elements as you move forward, as well as our \u2013 the ability to pay for it along the way.","[06P7T1-E Michael Cherny]Great. I'll let \u2013 I'll jump back in the queue. Thanks.","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Garen Sarafian of Citigroup. Your line is now open.","Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Good afternoon, guys, and again, congrats on a nice start to the year. Maybe specifically more on RevWorks, but you made some favorable comments in the prepared remarks Zane, but you guys have been very confident on the ITWorks portion of the business. So could you remind us what the assumptions were for RevWorks deals for this year, and just a little bit more detail as to what it needs to pick RevWorks up in the back half of the year as well?","Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Yeah, this is Marc. RevWorks being the all-encompassing all-outsourcing element, we haven't really made any overly strong expectations of that for 2017. What we're seeing some good strength in is our back office \u2013 our business office services, our back office, all of the incremental services that we provide for the revenue function that isn't full outsourcing. There is a lot of interest in that, that business is actually doing very well. So, in that environment, we're not \u2013 we're certainly working with clients as they work their way into deciding whether they want to fully outsource on the Revenue Cycle.","But I think certainly the interim services that we're doing is a little bit like the hosting business for an ITWorks client, it gets them some familiarity with how we do things, some comfort level in our skill sets. And I think that's what we're focusing on for the most part on the Revenue Cycle. Once again, working with one of our premier clients, is of significant size and delivering a great experience and an example through them that we can then take to the industry. But I think certainly as we look our bookings opportunities, ITWorks and the number and size of opportunities is a much closer opportunity to us than RevWorks. Zane?","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","One element that we have seen, which is why I referenced it in the prepared comments, is the pipeline for full outsourcing is something that we are seeing. We are seeing an activity and interest in the pipeline. And so I would look at that as, not necessarily a significant element to contribute to 2017, but as we move beyond that time period and into the \u2013 over the long term, I think it provides some really great long-term opportunities. Some things that we've done on an individual basis is, every new business opportunity that sells Revenue Cycle today has some proportion of a revenues \u2013 of a RevWorks services offering. So we get people started on our offerings. And I think that's proving to be a really great model for creation of businesses in the future, and we're seeing some of that play through in the pipeline.","Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got it. So, but for 2017, it's meeting your modest expectations to date, three quarters in?","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","Yeah, it's doing well on the business office services level, and we don't have any big expectations for the bigger deals.","Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got it.","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","I would say it's an upside opportunity for us as we move forward.","Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay, that's very helpful. And then a quick follow-up was, at Investor Day I thought that there was some commentary on selecting a CRM partner to fulfill I think it was a variety of front-end activities and some patient outreach, I think, so could you elaborate on where you are in that process? And I guess more importantly, what will that allow you to do, or do better, and where would we see the impact of that partnership in the financials?","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","So this is Zane. I think there's nothing really to discuss at this point in time, and so when there is we'll let ...","Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Fair enough.","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","... people know on that side, and I think your question will \u2013 we can address more appropriately when we get to that point.","Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Fair enough. Thanks again.","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sandy Draper of SunTrust. Your line is now open.","Sandy Y. Draper - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thanks very much. Just a quick question, I'm not sure Marc if you have a way to sort of encapsulate this. But I'm just thinking about the bookings revenue, and \u2013 versus \u2013 and really more on the software side. I'm thinking about the mix between recurring software and one-time software. Is that coming in fairly consistently? I can't remember off the top of my head what you talked about in terms of that at the Investor Day in 2016, but just how to think about sort of, are we continuing to see the shift, and how dramatic is the shift going towards recurring software versus the one-time software? Any commentary or color around that would be really appreciated. Thanks.","Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Yeah. Well, I think we talked about, of our licensed software, about 30% of it is SaaS. So I think that's a data point relative to the licensed software. I'd also point out that it's not really a shift. We continue to sell one-time software, continue to sell licenses, that's actually \u2013 that's the bulk of our business, doing that. But what we are seeing is that the additive elements of our business, the IT that we are selling as a service or on a subscription basis, is continuing to ramp up. That number as the revenue number continues to be strong, and the percent of that from \u2013 that's recurring in nature, we expect that to continue to ramp up as well.","So, I think that's, for us broadly you've got the \u2013 Millennium's a license, HealtheIntent is primarily the SaaS-based, along with some of the Cerner Works and the ambulatory cloud solutions that we offer. But key for us is, it's great business, but it isn't \u2013 we're not shifting models, it's additive to our business.","Sandy Y. Draper - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. That's really helpful. So, just to sort of summarize that you're growing that, but you're not \u2013 there's not a focus on transitioning it, and you're not thinking of each year growing the SaaS and shrinking the other personally (46:34), it's just how things shake out, and right now it looks to be fairly consistent because you're doing well on the one-time software side?","Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Correct.","Sandy Y. Draper - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Stockton of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Jamie Stockton - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi, yeah. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe a couple of quick ones for Zane, as a follow-up to I think Ricky's questions earlier. Could you just give us a ballpark for the number of facilities that are not on Millennium, that your existing clients currently own today? I think in the past you've thrown out a number around 300, is it still around there? And then the second one, international, yeah FX was a headwind during the quarter, it sounds like maybe tech resale was weak there, but can you just kind of paint a picture for us of what you think that international business is going to do over the next two or three years? Can we see it reaccelerate, maybe a mid-teens growth rate, because it seems like it's still a relatively small piece of your business?","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","Right. First, I'll start with \u2013 Jamie, I'll start with the first piece. The number of actually opportunities has actually grown, because we continue to add more clients, and so we have more clients as part \u2013 so even though we've taken elements out, like the 10 sites this quarter, we continue to add additional clients, and we've added more clients in the last eight quarters than any time in history of the company. And so you look at a couple of \u2013 we have some really significant opportunities with many of our largest clients in that side, and that's \u2013 and they've been nothing, but net acquirers, also, over this time. So when we talked about the 300, I would just tell you, it's in excess of that number at this point in time, and has actually continued to grow as an opportunity size for us.","On the international business, we believe that that business will grow, that as there's been a slow economic recovery, and we're encouraged actually by the bookings results, it hasn't necessarily shown up on the income statement yet to date. And so I think there's a good opportunity, I've spent a fair amount of my time in the global market outside the U.S., and I think it's a \u2013 it represents a growth opportunity for us over the mid-range and long-range term. And I think you're going to \u2013 the front, early indicator of that is both obviously, the pipeline is very strong, and so our global pipeline is at an all-time high, our bookings were very solid for the quarter from global, it just didn't translate to the income statement at this point.","Jamie Stockton - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. That's great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sean Wieland of Piper Jaffray. Your line is still open.","Sean W. Wieland - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Hi, thanks, and so just to follow up on Jamie's question, I don't think I heard the answer that \u2013 can you quantify the opportunity that you've got, of health system customers that still have a significant number of sites on legacy systems?","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","We don't...","Sean W. Wieland - Piper Jaffray & Co.","... is there are a dollar value, you can assign to that?","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","Yeah, Sean, we're not going to assign a dollar value for it. I mean, it's a variety of sizes of places, there's a variety of things that go into it, but the fact that an existing client that already has our footprint, and we have that number of facilities to which we have the opportunity to extend, it's part of our normal business. It's not \u2013 we don't see that as upside to the business, that's part of our normal approach and a normal view of the world as we look and do our forecasting, but we can't really give you a dollar number as to what that means. Sorry.","Sean W. Wieland - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Okay. No problem. How about \u2013 on ITWorks? So what I'm hearing is that it seems like the dry spell is coming to an end, maybe not by the second quarter, but certainly into the second half. But what I haven't heard is some specific factors, either internal to Cerner or external in the market, that's going to cause this, what appears to be healthy pipeline of ITWorks deals, convert into \u2013 or prospects convert into deals?","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","Yeah. So, I may not have eloquently said it, but what I would tell you is that the factors that are changing is the \u2013 a little bit of the unsettledness around what happens in the future actually helps us in this space, as well as some of the government regulations that were on pause for 2016, which come into play in 2017. There's a number of factors that really impact what I think was a kind of a pause for 2016. So I think really the factors that were there previously that had fueled good growth in the ITWorks business, I think is really more of a return to the pre-2016 era of, you have measures and mandates from government. You've got increased concern over costs. You have increased focus on: I need \u2013 I should focus my associates on things that matter. So as a health system, I'm going to focus my people on the pieces that really matter, which is providing care, and thinking about how I make money in a future of healthcare in that environment.","I really think 2016 was a bit of a pause, because margins were actually pretty good across our client base. There was no measures and mandates, no meaningful use element in 2016. And so, you just didn't have those same factors, that we're kind of back to where we were in 2015 from that perspective. So I really look at it and say, 2017 is more of the normal, where we thought we would be; what we missed was 2016 being a pause.","Sean W. Wieland - Piper Jaffray & Co.","All right. That's helpful. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Gillmor of Robert Baird. Your line is now open.","Matthew D. Gillmor - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hey, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask a follow-up on the revenue performance. It seems like licensed software was the other key driver relative to expectations. Just curious if there was any additional commentary you could provide, were there any particularly large deals that came through, or was it more broad-based? And then also from a product mix standpoint on licensed software, was there more contribution from the RevCycle software or more on the EHR?","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","This is Zane. So, I think it's broad-based elements. We didn't have any single transaction that drove licensed software in a significant way, it was actually the volume of transactions; the amount of new business wins were significant. Revenue Cycle was significant in all of those elements, both from an installed base as well as our new business opportunity.","But I'll actually say, we got a little bit of bump on our new business side from a licensed software perspective. And having some of those larger opportunities, and winning at those larger opportunities, you tend to have a little bit bigger software pieces. So the ones that I mentioned were more significant, but I think that's reflective of what we see in the marketplace. But there was not any single transaction that made a big difference there.","Michael R. Nill - Cerner Corp.","And, it's still broad-based, still significant sales back into the base. But really no one solution or no specific groups of solutions were notably bigger than the others.","Matthew D. Gillmor - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Got it. Thanks for taking the question.","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Garro of William Blair & Company. Your line is now open.","Jeff R. Garro - William Blair & Co. LLC","Good afternoon, guys and thanks for taking the question. I wanted to touch on Mike's discussion on Cerner Advance and continuous availability. If I'm interpreting that correctly, it seems tied to cloud capabilities and remote hosting. So maybe you could update us on the overall penetration of hosting services, and how we should think about whether clients are adopting hosting so that they can take advantage of these additional capabilities, or if they are adopting hosting on a standalone value proposition, and then discovering everything else that they can do to their benefit?","Michael R. Nill - Cerner Corp.","So this is Mike. Actually, they are related topics, but there are some distinctions between the two as well. Cerner Advance was really developed to allow us to capture data at a very granular level about the use of our system, and then through our analytics, we can then drive back, in across the entire client base, recommendations for improving the use and effectiveness of our solutions.","Now if you tie that to \u2013 and that advantage can be realized whether you're hosting \u2013 whether we're hosting the system for them or not. But if we look at our hosting capabilities today, probably 75% to 80% of our clients run out of our data center, and all new deals are within that model. And you are correct that we do have an advantage when we run those systems, we have the ability to keep our clients current, refresh their software more easily with less effort, and allow them to drive the value more quickly.","So it doesn't necessarily have to be cloud-based, it's just a fact that now by operating within our environment we can do things that maybe wouldn't be \u2013 they couldn't do on their own. So it is a huge advantage that we leverage significantly.","Jeff R. Garro - William Blair & Co. LLC","Great, and if I can squeeze one in for Marc, wanted to ask if there's any update to metrics you've given before on revenue visibility, like the percentage growth needed from bookings for the year or amount of revenue for the remainder of the year coming from backlog that enhances your visibility on the forward outlook?","Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Yeah. Usually that's a \u2013 those are data points, Jeff, that we provide at the beginning of the year to kind of give you a sense when we're providing an annual guidance, we don't update those throughout the year. Obviously when you get \u2013 go from a 12-month view to a 90-day view, your visibility is a higher percent than we would have talked about coming from backlog earlier, but we don't \u2013 we do not update those during the year.","Jeff R. Garro - William Blair & Co. LLC","No problem. Thanks for taking the questions, guys.","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","Sure. Why don't we take one more question?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Donald Hooker of KeyBanc. Your line is now open.","Donald H. Hooker - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Great, good afternoon. I was curious when you talk about large ITWorks in the pipeline, if you could help kind of size what that means, and in terms of \u2013 this might be a tough question to answer, because I know it will range widely, but what is the typical run rate \u2013 revenue run rate of a \"large\" ITWorks contract?","Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp.","This is Marc. It's really hard to give you an average, because we have 25 clients now, and they even range within their universe, and that is probably 25 clients that are kind of at the lower end. I mean, if you were looking kind of what our current clients in that \u2013 in our current range is, it's probably $20 million a year, which includes not only their ITWorks components, but all the revenue that's coming from that client, which would be licensed software, support, all the elements, because we combine all those. Once an ITWorks deal is done, the ITWorks team owns that client regardless where the revenue is coming from. So, that gives you \u2013 kind of gives you a sense of what's in the current base.","As we look forward, you have some that are that size, you have some that could be five times that size. So the opportunity, when we talk about bigger ones, we're talking about multiple \u2013 opportunities that could be multiples bigger from an annual revenue standpoint, when you do this all-inclusive view. So that's \u2013 for us that's kind of the next step, once we've gotten the standalone or smaller clients, trying to move it upscale. And as Zane said, the current environment of people focusing on cost is making them consider doing an outsourcing, where they might not have before. Once again, why the industry really doesn't have a history of outsourcing. We're not going in to compete against an existing outsourcer.","Donald H. Hooker - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","And when you win these deals, it takes time for that revenue to kick in, I understand. How late this year is a sort of a cut-off for deals sort of impacting 2018, as we start thinking about ITWorks possibly rebounding in 2018?","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","Yeah, this is Zane. I'd say there is \u2013 there are implications in the current quarter of signing, so you do see positive earnings and revenue from ITWorks in the quarter they sign. Obviously it depends on what point in the quarter that has does happen. But it's more of a run rate that's begun once that opportunity is completed.","Michael R. Nill - Cerner Corp.","Usually these deals you sign and rebadge simultaneously, because it's all part of a ...","Donald H. Hooker - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay.","Michael R. Nill - Cerner Corp.","... communication process. So really the month you sign it, is the first month of that sequential revenue comes. So, you can \u2013 if you sign stuff in Q2 and Q3, it will have a fairly full Q impact beginning in the next quarter.","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","Right.","Donald H.

Welcome to Cerner Corporation's first quarter 2015 conference call. Today's date is May 7, 2015, and this call is being recorded.","The company has asked me to remind you that various remarks made here today constitute forward-looking statements, including without limitation those regarding projections of future revenues or earnings, operating margins, operating expenses, product development, new markets or prospects for the company's solutions, and plans and expectations related to the acquisition and integration of the Siemens Health Services business.

A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this earnings call can be found in the company's earnings release, which was furnished to the SEC today and posted to the Investor section of cerner.com.","At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Marc Naughton, Chief Financial Officer of Cerner Corporation.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Thank you, Steve.","Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the call. I'll lead off today with a review of the numbers. Zane Burke, our President, will follow me with results, highlights, and marketplace observations. Mike Nill, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, will discuss operations. Neal Patterson, our Chairman and CEO, will join us for Q&A.","Now I will turn to our results. Overall, while revenue was below our expectations, we had a solid quarter highlighted by very strong bookings and our outlook remains positive. Our bookings revenue in Q1 was $1.2 billion, which is an all-time high and reflects 32% growth over Q1 of 2014, driven by strong growth in traditional Cerner bookings with minimal bookings contribution from Health Services. Our revenue backlog ended the quarter at $13 billion, which is up from $9.2 billion a year ago and reflects the strong bookings in Q1 and the inclusion of backlog from Health Services.","Revenue in the quarter was $996 million, which is up 27% over Q1 of 2014. Total revenue for Cerner was approximately $820 million with the remaining $176 million attributable to Health Services. The total is approximately $50 million below our guidance range with the shortfall roughly equally split between Cerner and Health Services. On the Cerner side, the higher percentage of the record bookings that came from long-term contracts meant a lower percentage of items that generated in quarter revenue.","Additionally, services in reimbursed travel was lower than expected. On the Health Services side, part of the shortfall was due to the $12.5 million adjustment to earnings for deferred revenue not being reflected in revenue as we had assumed in our guidance. However, since we decided not to report a non-GAAP revenue metric, our top line guidance was off by that amount. This difference in Health Services will continue and it's factored into our new full year revenue guidance along with slightly lower run rate for the total revenue that reflects the Q1 shortfall.","It is important to note that our Q1 adjusted earnings results were not impacted by the lower revenue and our annual guidance for adjusted earnings remains the same. The revenue composition for Q1 was $259 million in system sales, $229 million in support and maintenance, $490 million in services, and $18 million in reimbursed travel.","System sales revenue reflected 26% increase over Q1 of 2014, with the growth mainly driven by an increase in subscriptions, which is where the addition of Health Services had the biggest impact. Q1 system sales margin dollars grew 19% over the year-ago period. Our system sales margin percent of 64.7% was down from 68.5% in Q1 of 2014 and up from 63.6% in Q4 of 2014. The decline year-over-year reflects lower tech resale margins.","Moving to services, total services revenue including professional and managed services was up 28% compared to Q1 of 2014 but saw the growth in Cerner services augmented by the addition of Health Services. Support and maintenance revenue increased 31% over Q1 of 2014, reflecting solid growth in core support and maintenance and the addition of Health Services.","Looking at revenue by geographic segment, domestic revenue increased 25% over the year ago quarter to $871 million and global revenue grew 44% to $126 million, with both of the growth rates augmented by the addition of Health Services. Health Services had a slightly higher mix of global revenue to Cerner's historic levels. So the addition of Health Services had a bigger impact on global revenue, but our existing global businesses also had a strong performance.","Moving to gross margin. Our gross margin for Q1 was 83.1%, which is down slightly compared to 83.5% in Q1 of 2014, reflecting the lower technology resale margins and a slightly lower gross margin from Health Services.","Looking at operating spending, our first quarter operating expenses before share-based compensation expense and acquisition-related adjustments were $591 million, which is up 28% compared to adjusted Q1 2014 operating expenses.","Since we've already integrated many components of Health Services, we don't have an exact breakout of operating expense between Cerner and Health Services. But we estimate that Cerner operating expenses grew in the mid-single-digit range and the rest of the growth is the addition of Health Services. The total year-over-year growth for each expense category was 23% for sales and client service, 41% for software development and 33% for G&A.","Moving to operating margins, our operating margin before share-based compensation expense and acquisition-related adjustments was 23.7% in Q1. This is down 90 basis points, compared to Q1 of 2014, reflecting the incorporation of Health Services.","Given we achieved our earnings on lower revenue this quarter, the operating margin percent with Health Services incorporated into our results is higher than we originally projected. This is largely due to lower core Cerner expense growth, offsetting the lower core revenue growth.","We expect higher core Cerner revenue growth for the rest of the year, but still expect the full year to be below original projections. This is expected to continue being offset by a lower expense growth. So, we will expect to drive the same level of earnings with a combination of lower revenue and unchanged earnings leading to a higher core operating margin percent.","In total, this means we expect our combined operating margin to only go down approximately 100 basis points to 150 basis points for the year, versus an original expectation that it would go down over 200 basis points with the addition of Health Services.","Moving to net earnings and EPS, our GAAP net earnings in Q1 were $111 million or $0.32 per diluted share. Adjusted net earnings were $157 million and adjusted EPS was $0.45, which is up 22% compared to Q1 of 2014.","Adjusted net earnings and diluted earnings per share exclude share-based compensation expense which reduced first quarter 2015 net earnings and diluted earnings per share by $11 million and $0.03 respectively. Adjusted net earnings and diluted earnings per share also reflect adjustments related to the acquisition of Health Services, including amortization of intangibles, which reduced net earnings and diluted earnings per share by $10 million and $0.03 respectively; a deferred revenue adjustment, which reduced net earnings and diluted earnings per share by $8 million and $0.02 respectively; and other acquisition related adjustments, which reduced net earnings and diluted earnings per share by $17 million and $0.05 respectively.","The Q1 tax rate for adjusted net earnings was 33.6%, which is in line with our expected effective tax rate. For the remainder of 2015, we expect our effective tax rate to be in the 33% to 34% range.","Now, I'd like to preview a non-recurring expense we expect to incur in Q2. We've recently offered a Voluntary Separation Plan or VSP to eligible associates. Generally, the VSP was made available to U.S. associates who meet a minimum level of combined age and tenure. The VSP was offered to both Cerner and Health Services associates, and the percent accepting has been roughly equal across both groups. There were some positions such as executive officers and certain critical roles that were excluded from being eligible for business continuity purposes.","Associates who elect to participate in the VSP will receive financial benefits commensurate with their tenure and position along with vacation payout and medical benefits. The acceptance period for associates electing to participate in the VSP ends later this month. Based on levels of acceptance, we currently estimate a net of tax charge of approximately $35 million in Q2 for the VSP and related costs.","This completely voluntary program will have a small impact on our total head count as the eligible associates have accepted the offer only represent about 2% of total associates. While a portion of these positions will be backfilled, we believe we will be able to fill many of the positions with existing associates, which should create efficiencies in the future, also creating career growth opportunities for our associates.","Now, move to our balance sheet. We ended Q1 with $889 million of total cash and investments, which is down $763 million from $1.65 billion in Q4, mainly driven by a $1.37 billion purchase of Siemens Health Services and partially offset by $500 million of debt that we issued earlier this year and added to cash and investments. Our total debt including capital lease obligations is $626 million, up from $130 million in Q4 due to the new debt.","Total receivables at the end of the quarter was $941 million, which is up $268 million from Q4 driven by strong sales in the quarter. Our DSO in Q1 was 79 days, which compares to DSO of 66 days in Q4 and 66 days in the year ago quarter. The increase was driven by higher accounts receivable which is largely due to adding Health Services and the lower revenue this quarter. We expect DSO to be closer to historical levels in future quarters.","Operating cash flow for the quarter was $214 million. Q1 capital expenditures were $82 million and capitalized software was $63 million. Free cash flow defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures and capitalized software was $69 million for the quarter.","Moving to capitalized software, the $63 million of capitalized software in Q1 represents 39% of $161 million of total investment in development activities. Software amortization for the quarter was $29 million, resulting in net capitalization of $34 million or 21% of our total R&D investment.","We still expect to continue generating solid free cash flow this year with operating cash flow growth partially offsetting an expected increase in capital expenditures tied to beginning construction of a new campus and capital expenditures related to our Health Services business. Note that the cash flow impact of the VSP will primarily impact Q2 and reduce overall free cash flow for the year.","Now, I'll go to Q2 and full-year 2015 guidance. For Q2 we expect revenue between $1.175 billion and $1.225 billion, with the midpoint reflecting growth of 41% over Q2 of 2014. For the full year we expect revenue between $4.65 billion and $4.8 billion. This is lower than our prior guidance due to the lower revenue in Q1 and expectation for about $1 billion of Health Services revenue for the year instead of our previous expectation of $1.1 billion, which is largely due to the deferred revenue adjustment not impacting the revenue line. This is still 39% growth at the midpoint, and reflects an expectation for higher growth in Q1, of course from core Cerner for the rest of the year.","The lower revenue is not expected to impact our earnings in Q2 or for the year. For Q2, we expect adjusted earnings before share-based compensation and acquisition-related adjustments to be $0.51 to $0.52 per share with the midpoint reflecting 29% growth over Q2 2014 adjusted EPS. For the full year, we expect adjusted EPS before share-based compensation and acquisition-related adjustments to be $2.07 to $2.15, which is up from a previous range of $2.05 to $2.15, and reflects 28% growth at the midpoint. Our estimate for the impact of share-based compensation expense is approximately $0.03 to $0.04 in Q2 and $0.14 to $0.16 for the full year.","Moving to bookings guidance. We expect bookings revenue in Q2 of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion, with the midpoint reflecting 16% growth over Q2 of 2014. We expect our strong Q1 bookings and Q2 outlook to contribute to better core top line growth as we move through the year. But keep in mind that Q4 has a tough comparable due to the extra week in Q4 of 2014.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Zane.","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","Thanks, Marc. Good afternoon, everyone.","Today, I'll provide color on our results and make some marketplace observations.","I'll start with our results. Our bookings revenue in Q1 of $1.2 billion reflects very strong growth of 32% over Q1 2014. Bookings this quarter included a high level of large contracts with 24 contracts over $5 million, including 19 over $10 million. We also had strong contribution from long-term bookings with an ITWorks contract and an expansion of existing RevWorks relationship. This led to long-term bookings making up 37% of the total, which is approximately 5% higher than normal.","Even adjusting out the higher term, long-term bookings contribution, our bookings were very strong, and bookings would still be at the high end of our guidance. As Marc discussed, our strong bookings didn't convert to higher revenue this quarter, but it does position us for higher future growth.","A highlight of the quarter was strong competitiveness, which resulted in 34% of our bookings coming from outside of our core Millennium install base. As I discussed during our Investment Community Meeting at HIMSS, our pipeline is very strong, and we are well positioned for new business this year and beyond.","I believe we still have a multi-year period ahead of us where we will \u2013 there will be opportunities to win new footprints as organizations look to replace legacy systems and align with a strategic supplier.","There is also a meaningful opportunity to expand our footprints within our client base as many of our large clients still have several non-Cerner facilities and are looking to consolidate on a single system. The ongoing acquisition activity in the marketplace plays to our advantage as well, because it is being led by our clients.","We are already off to a good start with migrating Health Services clients to Millennium, and this activity is bringing along sales of other solutions, such as Population Health and Ambulatory.","My view of our opportunities was reinforced at HIMSS, where we interact with more than $5 billion of pipeline including many new EMR replacement opportunities. In addition to strong new business activity, the dominant themes at HIMSS aligned very well with Cerner's strengths. Our complete vision and strong capabilities in Population Health coupled with our commitment to interoperability and an open EMR were clearly on display and well received.","Regarding interoperability, we were pleased with the level of progress that was on display during the conference, most notably, CommonWell member expansion to over 70% of the acute EMR market being represented.","Now, I'll briefly discuss a few key areas of our business, starting with Population Health. Our Population Health organization had a strong start to the year. We continue to have success with selling Population Health solutions to clients ranging from small hospitals to IDNs, to counties and states. Population Health solutions are now part of most new EMR contracts. And as I mentioned, have been added to migration contracts for Health Services clients converting to Millennium.","Overall, I believe our differentiation in Population Health is becoming clearer. We're quickly separating ourselves from other offerings with our ability to aggregate and normalize clinical, financial and claims data across multiple systems and bring real-time information into the workflow.","Another key differentiator is results. Our early adopter clients such as Advocate Health Care are getting value out of the system and are vocal about the fact that they view HealtheIntent as a platform that improves our ability to operate in an environment in which they're taking on more risk.","Moving to our revenue cycle business, we had a good first quarter and have a strong outlook for the year. Revenue cycle continues to be an important component of EMR replacement opportunities and the strength of our integrated revenue cycle offering is contributing to our success at gaining new footprints. We're also continuing to increase penetration of our revenue cycle solutions and our client base in both acute and ambulatory venues as our clients look to move to a single platform. We are still early in this opportunity and expect many more of our large clients to move to our revenue cycle solutions now that we have more proof points among our large clients.","On the RevWorks Services side of our business, we expanded our relationship with an existing RevWorks client based on success we've had so far. I'm pleased with how we've executed on our initial RevWorks relationships and we're achieving results I believe will be compelling to other prospects.","For example, Adventist Health, Northern California region has achieved a $27 million increase in revenue, a 21% decrease in AR days, and all of their sites are over 100% of the cash targets. These types of results reflect the strength of both our revenue cycle solutions and our RevWorks services offerings and create compelling reasons for new prospects to consider our revenue cycle solutions and services.","Moving to the ambulatory market, where we had a strong Q1. Noteworthy activity in Q1 included continued displacements of key competitors, including the displacement of the ambulatory solutions of our primary competitor at 29 ambulatory facilities, a strong start at selling ambulatory solutions into the Health Services base, including standalone sales and being included as part of acute care migrations to Millennium and continued strength in our ambulatory Business Office Services.","Regarding Business Office Services, I'd like to highlight that business because I think success there is not widely known. We currently have ambulatory Business Office Services clients across 45 specialties in 39 states. Our clients range from single physician practices up to large IDNs where we have RevWorks relationships that include ambulatory Business Office Services.","As we've gained traction in this space, we're identifying more opportunities to displace a cloud competitor's Business Office Services by proving our offering is more effective. For example, we are able to show in many cases, our Business Office Services are more than 20% less than our competitor's cloud offering primarily because they require the client to maintain a staff of approximately three times what our offering requires.","In addition, many of these larger and more sophisticated clients are facing several challenges with our competitor's solution, such as having 50% to 60% of the claims requiring manual intervention, because they don't fit the cloud configuration. I believe that we will keep doing well in this Business Office Services space as we continue to gain positive proof points with our clients and as awareness broadens about the true costs and challenges associated with our cloud competitor.","Outside the U.S. we had a strong Q1. Total revenue growth was 44%, consisting of strong organic growth and the addition of Health Services. Strong performance in the UK was a big driver of our organic growth as we continued to have success gaining new footprints and expanding relationships with clients as they transitioned out of the national program.","One of the reasons, we continue to do well in the market is that our clients are getting value out of the solutions. A great example of this was documented when the Health and Social Care Information Center did a benefits deep dive of the Cerner Millennium implementation at Barts Health NHS Trust, which is the largest hospital trust in England.","In this review, they concluded Barts is achieving significant clinical and operational benefits in areas where Cerner Millennium is installed. This and other proof points that we have in the UK market position us very well relative to our less established competitors.","Broadly we remain optimistic about our ability to get good contributions from global for the rest of the decade and this opportunity is enhanced by the complementary global business of Health Services.","With that, I will turn the call over to Mike.","Michael R. Nill - Cerner Corp.","Thanks, Zane. Good afternoon, everyone.","Today, I'm going to discuss ITWorks and provide some comments on our initial go-lives with Intermountain Healthcare.","I'll start with ITWorks. In the first quarter, we established a new ITWorks relationship and also expanded an existing ITWorks relationship. Our new ITWorks client is a 410 bed community hospital with 29 ambulatory locations. Similar to many of our ITWorks clients, taking over IT operations is only a part of the new contract.","For example, as Zane discussed, we will be displacing our primary competitor in the ambulatory facilities. We'll also be doing an optimization project for the client's Millennium system at the hospital and implementing population health and revenue cycle solutions.","In a memo to all system employees, the CEO of our client highlighted the strategic nature of the ITWorks engagement by saying, \"We believe it's the best approach to ensure we meet our long-term strategic objectives of our organization, while continuing to provide the highest level of care to our patients in an era of incredibly fast moving changes in healthcare information technology and increasing regulatory requirements.\"","As I indicated on our last call, our ITWorks pipeline is strong as many provider organizations face pressure to control costs, improve quality and keep up with regulatory requirements. In Q1, our results are a good start, and I expect continued success throughout the year.","Now, I'd like to make a few comments on our initial go-lives at two Intermountain Healthcare hospitals and 24 clinics. The go-lives occurred just 15 months after we signed the contract which is extremely fast when you consider the majority of projects of similar scope take more than twice as long. When fully deployed project iCentra will be at 22 hospitals and more than 180 clinics. It will include nearly 80 solutions across EHR, practice management and revenue cycle and the system will have over 320 role profiles, 354 clinical workflow models and 372 financial workflow models. This is the first Cerner project to make use of our new Agile development methodology, a model that represents a departure from the industry standard waterfall implementation approach.","In the Agile model, physicians and other end users participate in the system build and design and never go more than six weeks without an opportunity to see, use and get feedback on the system prior to go-live. This approach has been a big success and we believe there are benefits that will extend beyond the go-live. It has a potential to support elements of a learning health system, something that has been elusive in healthcare.","Another key element of this project is incorporation of Intermountain's Care Process Models and clinical process guidelines which have helped its clinicians achieve high quality care and lower overall costs for many years.","Before iCentra, these were mostly paper documents, now they are all part of the digital workflows that are used every day.","In summary, we believe our work with Intermountain combined with the work we are doing with other strategic client partners is resulting in a new generation of systems. We are leading the transition in the industry away from systems that are simply transactional or used for the purpose of meeting regulatory requirements.","We are creating intelligent systems designed and meet the complex needs of providers across the spectrum of healthcare, coordinating care at any time, any place, use intelligence to inform decisions at the highest standards and connecting all of the individuals they serve seamlessly into that process.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to questions.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Steve, we do have any questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","You do. And your first question is coming from the line of Michael Cherny from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Michael A. Cherny - Evercore ISI","Good afternoon, guys and thanks for all the details. So Marc, I just want to dive in a little bit on the Cerner core a bit. You talked about the fact that you had a $50 million shortfall versus your guidance about 50-50 split between the core and the Cerner Health Services business. If I think about the core, how much of the shortfall was items that you've had historically like the \u2013 some of the third-party tech resale versus I know you had a really strong booking \u2013 long term bookings number. Was there anything else that surprised you in terms of why that number missed that you haven't seen in the past I guess?","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Well I think the one-time revenue was slightly lower than we expected, much of that was from tech resale, which obviously means you don't get chunk of revenue but it doesn't really impact earnings very much. The other piece was services and travel was lower. Some of the services related to just contract signing timeframes and project start dates that were a little bit later than we expected. So we didn't start turning that revenues spigot on as early in the quarter as we felt we would and that also impact the reimbursed travel, usually reimbursed travel is a number that I pay very little attention to other than managing it from an expense standpoint, because it's zero revenue or zero margin. But that one was actually significantly lower than we would have projected as we came into the quarter.","So I don't know, there was no real surprises and as we look out for the rest of the year Q2 through Q4, we get back on track for the most part and I think delivering more according to what we're planning and forecasting.","Michael A. Cherny - Evercore ISI","And I know in the past you have given a software number. Did you give a software growth number in the quarter specifically on software?","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","I don't think I did and I don't know that I've got one in front of me. So I apologize.","Michael A. Cherny - Evercore ISI","But nothing outside the norm in terms of software growth, still was fairly solid, I assume, if those were the only ones...?","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","No, it was really kind of if you went through each \u2013 all of the line items, it was primarily the services side of just getting stuff kicked off because once you get it kicked off, the revenue kind of streams across the quarters as you go forward, so you don't get a one-time bump, but if you don't kick it off really \u2013 and that was just, it was just the environment without specific dates driving clients to start those projects. Some of those can fall a little bit later than we would have projected. The mix, there was nothing major in the mix, still strong software. Just a little \u2013 probably weaker tech resale and lower margin on the tech resale we did get.","Michael A. Cherny - Evercore ISI","Thanks, that's helpful, Marc.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of George Hill from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Unknown Speaker","Hi, it's actually Steven on for George Hill. Calling to ask about \u2013 our question is on the strong number of kind of the larger contracts in the quarter. I was wondering what was driving that?","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","This is Zane. We had a number of very large new business opportunities as well as existing extensions in our core base and so very strong. The new business was 34% of total bookings as I've mentioned in our prepared remarks. Those come along, those tend to be larger contracts in the initial booking period and so that drove much of that, along with a couple of the extension of the RevWorks business and the large ITWorks that we had in the quarter.","Unknown Speaker","Okay, thank you. That's helpful.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah, hi, good afternoon. You talk about the contract with Intermountain and really kind of like a new way of doing business. So when you think about kind of like other health system that are similar in size, can you just kind of like share with us how kind of like that pipeline is looking and do you need to kind of like first implement all the 22 hospitals of Intermountain or should we expect to see a deal, kind of like that looks at that type of intelligent systems before that?","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","This is Marc. Relative to Intermountain, with our first go-live, I think that once we get the second set turned on, I think we'll have proof points for people that are interested in going and seeing what that model system, if you will, looks like. But I don't know that it's going to significantly impact the timing of opportunities that are out there of size.","Interestingly enough, it directly impacts one of the bigger opportunities, which is DoD that's out there and that we're working with Intermountain on relative to the model system that we're going to implement there. But the timing of those projects and the turn on dates really are separate concept. A lot what Intermountain helps us with when we talk is their concept and their approach and embedding the content to make the healthcare more effective, and to actually help manage the health of the population.","So a lot of what they are doing is from a kind of a sales perspective is just sharing that message. And then as we do go-lives, we'll be able to show it live and up and running, but given the first one is going live, given the next set coming, given the projects staying in good shape, the timing of when it goes doesn't preclude us from pursuing those opportunities.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay and on the DoD contract, can you just update us on the timing?","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","Sure. This is Zane. Obviously, it's in the government's hand in terms of where they are. Our understanding is that they are looking to make a decision for the first phase of that work at the end of the second quarter \u2013 end of our second quarter at this point in time. They've held pretty true to their timelines for the most part and this has been a pretty effective procurement process so we'd anticipate that they will continue along that path of hitting their timeline and it might be probably the end of second quarter, but it could go into the early third quarter.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And then lastly on Population Health, I am not sure if you said that in the prepared remarks. When we look at kind of like your new contracts, what percent of your new contracts have kind of like a Population Health feature to them? And how should we think about kind of like what is an average Population Health deal in terms of revenue contribution?","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","This is Zane. I'll start and let Marc finish as it relates to the composition. Most all of our new EMR business has some Population Health as a part of that, and we would include things like registries as a part of a core solution set and as a part of the key differentiators as we move forward, because it's our ability to get the data back into the clinicians' workflow at the point-of-care in near real-time is the key differentiator between us and all other competitors. And so, you see that as one of the core elements as what we do. So nearly all of the new business has that related to that.","It's \u2013 I will set Marc up for the second piece of that. It tends to be a smaller portion up front. So it's not a significant portion of the contract bookings in that it typically is that kind of what I call starter set for Population Health around registries and really sets up the footprint for Pop Health and the opportunity to go back and sell back into the base over time.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Yeah and that's exactly right, Zane. Most of the economics that we expect on a per member, per month basis are in the future for some of those. We put in the platform there's some revenue related to that initial work. But for the most part, and a lot of their initial projects are pilot in nature, so even when it goes live and goes on a PMPM basis, you don't have quite so many of them.","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","And traditionally we have talked about Population Health as being about 14% of total revenue and you can typically think about bookings being similar in that space.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you. That's very helpful.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of David Larsen from Leerink. Please go ahead, sir.","David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC","Hey guys, congratulations on a good quarter. Zane, can you talk a little bit more about the different components within Population Health? So just maybe what exactly is a patient registry? And then above and beyond patient registries, can you talk about some of the sort of I guess more advanced features and components that might be reimbursed on like say PMPM basis? And how relevant are those? How many clients do you have in those types of solutions? Thanks.","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","The patient registry is really that provides the ability for the clinician to understand what the disease state is of that person and run the protocols for that particular scenario. And it's a very normal part of a particularly ambulatory process.","The PMPM portions will come up for \u2013 will come up in the future. Kind of the next pieces you will see us around is in the enterprise data warehouse elements and we're seeing client uptake on that side, that has a \u2013 that does have some PMPM elements to it. We have a number of offerings that will come out throughout the year as we move to programs and to some other areas and those are all PMPM basis.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Probably the next big one coming out is care management.","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","Care management.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","That's a key element. So once you've identified through your registries the people that are high risk, then how do you go manage their care in an effective manner. So, those are the two. Keep in mind, while each of the solutions that we put on this platform which we expect to be certainly in the double-digit range all have the PMPM factors, that PMPM price may vary based on the importance of those solutions and certainly doing the registries and the care management are two of the key components to that architecture.","David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC","Great, thanks a lot.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Sure.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of David Francis from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","David Francis - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi, thanks for taking the questions. Marc, can you talk a little bit about looking at the backlog? What are dynamics of your backlog conversion capabilities? Specifically, what kind of levers do you guys have available to either throttle up or throttle down conversion of backlog into revenue?","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Well, for most part, having a big backlog gives you good visibility, but a lot of the visibility we have in our backlog doesn't \u2013 isn't one that you are going to throttle up or down a whole lot. A lot of it is hours worked based on the project activity that's going on. So a lot of services, a lot of the backlog is a \u2013 you're going to pay me X amount a month for a 10-year period.","So a lot of it is less subject to going and changing relative to a revenue outlook. So when we go into a quarter and start looking at revenue sort of in a quarter like this, you're really looking primarily at things that are more near term revenue that can impact your level of revenue for that quarter. But you've got other \u2013 everything else, basically subscription, support, all those elements are coming out of backlog, but there are not a lot of levers that we can go move. I can't take a six month services project and take six times the number of people and go work for one month really fast to drive that revenue out.","David Francis - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Right. And that makes sense. Let me ask it a different way. How much of the backlog would you say is related to projects or contracts that are currently in process versus those that are for future periods then? Or is that just not the right way to look at it?","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","You're kind of asking what is backlog going to contribute to the next period?","David Francis - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Well just trying to see how much visibility one has near term versus long term relative to the ten quarters or so of revenue that are represented in backlog today?","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Yeah and I think if you weight the backlog, certainly it weights toward current. I mean you'd look at an average life it might be three and a half years. But there is a higher percentage of that that occurs in the first 12 months relative to the overall 10 years plus potential of the backlog. So I think we've got \u2013 when we go into a quarter, there is probably 85% to 90% of the revenue is visible coming out of that backlog. So maybe that's a good answer to you. If I look at the full year from today, kind of out 12 months, that's probably 75% because there will be things that get in the backlog that help me feed those out-quarter P&Ls, but when I go into this next quarter, I'm at about 85% to 90%. So, pretty, pretty high correlations. So that's why a little bit \u2013 we don't normally have a lower revenue quarter.","David Francis - RBC Capital Markets LLC","I get that. And that's helpful. Thank you. And then one follow-up, as it relates to the $100 million, yeah $100 million or so shortfall that you are looking for at Siemens, it looks like just doing the math, about half of that is the deferred revenue shift out and then the other half is just kind of what's coming out of the business, is that the right way to look at it?","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Yeah. That's exactly right, Dave.","David Francis - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Sure.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Garen Sarafian of Citi Research. Please go ahead.","Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. One is just a clarification, I think you sort of started to touch on it in the prior question. So the shortfall was 50-50 split and it was \u2013 from the Cerner side it came from tech resales, and services, and travel that got off to a slower start. So for the remaining three quarters, I'm just trying to figure out what is the assumption of the mix in terms of it coming from Health Services versus core legacy Cerner?","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Well, I think when you talk about the \u2013 from our perspective we would have always indicated that we'd expect to grow Cerner revenue at kind of basically low double digit rate. So say 10%. So based on our number, that's kind of what we would have expected, we were below that in Q1, but we expect to get closer to that as we go through Q2 to the end of the quarter, probably high single-digits for ending the year in total.","So, if you're looking at that for Cerner, then kind of you can do the math and just subtract and come up with what the HS is. We look at HS to deliver for this year right about $1 billion of revenue. And so that's \u2013 that was the number that Dave was asking about relative to \u2013 originally we were looking about $1.1 billion. So there's $100 million just on the HS side for the full year. Half of that is deferred revenue being \u2013 not being in the revenue line and then half of it is just tweaking the revenue projections for the rest of the year for them.","Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay, that's useful. And then moving to the international side, you mentioned top line growth of 44% all in, could you break that out as to what portion was legacy Cerner and specifically on UK, I think you mentioned momentum as clients move from government systems. So, just trying to get a better idea of how to think about it, where do you think you are in terms of building momentum in that area? And how long will this outsized opportunity last, do you think, just to help us out? Thanks.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Well, I think from a bookings perspective, certainly UK, as trusts are transitioning out of the government program, we had a very strong performance. Part of the reason we had good performance in the larger contracts was we had three UK contracts that qualified as over $10 million, so those trusts coming out and purchasing.","Globally there is a focus on healthcare and on technology and it's really trying to match up the available resources and spending in each country relative to being able to go . (43:18.) Since 2008 and 2009 that's been fairly light. We're starting to see that rebound, starting to see more interest certainly in Continental Europe.","I think certainly bringing Siemens into the fold has solidified us as a very credible and key choice in the European markets and there are still country-wide procurements that are ongoing as we speak that we have a much better positioning for because of that acquisition. But I think we still see a lot of opportunity globally. I think even if you go outside Europe and start looking at North America, I think Canada is probably as good an opportunity in the next 12 months as we've seen for quite some time.","So kind of \u2013 we're starting to see a little bit of a mirror in our overall pipeline, which is the strongest we've ever seen as we go in through 2015 that we're starting to see some good strength in targeted areas globally.","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","This is Zane. In fact, every piece of our pipeline picked up in terms \u2013 across our business, our install business, our core client development U.S. business and our global marketplace, and as Marc described, we have a number of opportunities across elements outside the U.S. as well as unprecedented activity that we've seen in the U.S. in terms of number of decisions. We see approximately 50% more decisions in the U.S. than we've seen \u2013 than we saw all of last year in 2014.","The level of activity is \u2013 presentations and demos are at all-time highs, well over 50% increase year-over-year. So the activity levels across the business have picked up quite a bit. And so from a bookings perspective and looking forward, we are as optimistic as we've ever been about the growth of the business and health of that.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","To give you a sense on global, just our bookings growth was double digit year-over-year in our global markets, which is a very good strength and consistent with our strong growth in the U.S.","Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Great, thanks again.","Operator","And your next question is from the line of Steve Halper from FBR. Please go ahead.","Steve P. Halper - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Yeah, hi. So, just a couple of questions. First you mentioned some project timeframes slipping, which led to lower service revenues. Have those picked up yet in line with your expectation?","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Yeah, it wasn't really slipping as much as just the start of those projects, Steve, especially with a lot of new contracts getting signed. Depending on the projects, we can start some of those projects that are right landing for projects, we'll start some of them even early in the process just to start the revenue stream going. For this period, we didn't really have as much of that as we often do relative to getting that revenue stream started in the quarter.","Once it gets started, which those are starting as we speak, then the revenue stream continues and delivers \u2013 starts delivering a very predictable stream out of the backlog, but in the quarter signed, there is an element especially when you have the level of bookings that we had and the level of new clients that we had that the project starts did not align exactly with some of our \u2013 some of our modeling, which is somewhat of an art as opposed to a science, but that's primarily what we saw in Q1, that's why we really don't see it in Q2 because now they're in the backlog and we're covered for that.","Steve P. Halper - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Right. And then relative to the deferred revenue from Health Services...","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Yes.","Steve P. Halper - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","...shouldn't have that been reflected in the original guidance?","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Well we \u2013 that deferred revenue was a number that we included in our revenue guidance as we at that point thought we would be reflecting it as revenue and the income in an adjusted income statement. We decided it would be clearer to just have adjustments to a net earnings line, which means that we didn't have an adjusted earnings or a non-GAAP revenue number \u2013 well, we do we have a non-GAAP earnings number. And since it didn't go in that number, it's not reported as revenue and it's not \u2013 it's a difference between what we would have had in our head when we provided guidance and the number that got delivered.","Steve P. Halper - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Right, so it's a little apples to oranges comparison?","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Yeah it's just \u2013 right, it's a number that we thought would be in there and isn't. But it doesn't really impact the result.","Steve P. Halper - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Right. And lastly just as a follow up on Health Services. You're past the HIMSS conference. We're a couple of months in. Can you characterize any conversations that you've had with the Health Service clients about conversion to Millennium new sales into that base? Any sort of color you can give us around the progression there?","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","Sure, Steve. This is Zane. We had three clients that actually made decisions in the first quarter to go from a Siemens legacy \u2013 Health Services legacy solution to a Cerner Millennium full EHR decision, which was a very, very good uptick.","We had a number of Health Services clients that added Cerner solutions to the mix, so ambulatory, population health, surgery. We saw a number of elements where those Health Services clients picked up and made some decisions to complete the portfolio. So I was very pleased with the performance in the first quarter and the start that we have in that space.","We're also working with those same clients. There are many of them that want to continue on the journey of the Soarian solutions or on a combined strategy of Cerner on the clinical and Soarian or other legacy solutions on the financial side and we're supportive of those and the reception has been very good.","We hosted a breakfast at HIMSS for a number of those clients and it was very well received and well attended. And so, I am very pleased with the clients' perspective of how we are performing and the receptivity to Cerner as the custodian of the legacy solutions as well as those that are moving forward with the Cerner Millennium and other solution set. So it's been very, very positive.","Steve P. Halper - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Right. And just one follow-up. So obviously those discussions with those three clients were already underway, but since the acquisition was announced or closed, did that process speed up because of the acquisition?","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","It did. They moved very quickly. So a couple of those actually moved very quickly to make a decision to move forward with us. And I think some of the \u2013 we did not have a lot of bookings contribution from the Health Services business itself and which I think makes sense as you had some of that client base waiting to see how the transition would occur and what in fact happened. And so then I would anticipate a better contribution from the pure Health Services clients themselves on the more legacy solutions, as we move forward. But the contribution was very minimal in the first quarter.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Yeah, Steve, this is Marc, just a couple of data points. I think actually when we look at bookings going forward in the guidance that we give, we are assuming a pretty minimal contribution from HS bookings just because we think a lot of \u2013 we just don't think that they're \u2013 as they are still ramping up and they are still working through the clients, a lot of the clients are going to make decisions, those are going to be buying Millennium solutions or some form or fashion, as Zane talked about.","So I think that we don't really \u2013 are not looking for a great \u2013 much of an impact at all from HS bookings for this actually full year. But the one thing that strikes me on HS is that, we kind of have a strategy of running those two companies kind of parallel. We didn't want to distract those organizations \u2013 either organization.","We're coming together a lot faster than I would have expected and it's a smooth transition. The client side is almost \u2013 we just had our Q2 forecast meeting a week ago and it's pretty amazing how seamless it feels that we're talking as one company, looking at all of the opportunities across both sides, and I think that's one of the reasons that as we look out and try to track the numbers, we are really focusing on kind of the one big number rather than trying to come up with artificial breakdowns between HS and Cerner, because we are getting together more quickly than I would have expected, which is actually great given that it's being done pretty seamlessly. So just thought I'd throw that in for quality.","Steve P. Halper - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Yeah, thank you so much.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dave Windley from Jefferies. Please go ahead.","David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC","Hey, thanks for taking the question. Marc, I thought I understood this but now I'm confused. On the deferred revenue, your answer to Steve there talking about it not being in the revenue because your \u2013 it sounds like you're basically saying you're presenting it differently than you had originally anticipated doing. But do I understand it correctly that the absence of that revenue, so treating it as deferred instead of running it through the revenue line, does have a bottom line impact, does it not?","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","No. It doesn't. The difference was that I knew that there was a number for deferred revenue that under GAAP you wouldn't recognize but as an adjusted item and given that it was in the run rate our expectation was we would recognize it.","The difference is \u2013 so the number was always going to be in the earnings line, the difference really is presentation. When we guided revenue prior to the quarter, I would have put that $12.5 million in my revenue number that I guided to. The results that we presented don't have it in the revenue number, they have it as a separate line adjusting that earning.","So it still has the same impact on earnings. There's no change but from a presentation standpoint, revenue that we talk about today is $12.5 million less than what I thought it would have been when we did our guidance. So that...","David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC","Okay.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","And that continues.","David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC","Sorry. In the paragraph on the front of the press release where it does say the deferred revenue which reduced net earnings and diluted earnings per share, is that something different?","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Well, that is relative to GAAP net earnings. Not including in that deferred revenue resulted in a lower GAAP number. So our adjusted earnings statement basically takes the GAAP number as a starting point and that was reduced by the deferred revenue and then adds that deferred revenue item back to get to the adjusted earnings which we think is a more \u2013 a better indicator to investors of the performance of the company.","David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC","Okay, fine. Thanks, sorry for that. So moving on to more important question. The expansions of, I guess the longer term contracts, which is a good number in the quarter, and the expansions of longer term contracts, I'm curious on those Works situations where you get those expansions, what are the triggers for those? Are those situations where the client was piloting in part of their enterprise, or where they've acquired something, and the acquired facility needs that expansion? What drives an existing client to expand rather than taking it enterprise wide to begin with?","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","This is Zane. It's a number of considerations. Oftentimes, it's acquisition activity. So they've made an acquisition who had a competitor's EMR and they've not yet gotten to that rollout. In some cases, there were decisions to pilot those decisions \u2013 that EMR and get a certain set up and running. And you often see that in the investor owned segment where they start with a subset of their hospitals and will decide based on success to continue to rollout. And we see that happening at a number of our investor-owned clients.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","I think relative to some of the expansions on a Works deal, those are \u2013 some of those will be based on, some clients do have a smaller starting point. Some clients start with a certain term and say, we like this, we like how this is going. So we're going to expand the term of our license, so it's adding years. And keep in mind, each of these Works businesses can have different flavors, right. We can go anywhere from a full Works business to maybe they only had AMS and some other support services that they signed up for and then they signed up for the Works.","So, an expansion usually can either mean they've acquired more facilities and those are going to fall in under the original contract to support, could be the length, the term, or could be an expansion of the actual services that they want us to have.","Keep in mind, we've talked about that this year, we think we are seeing a lot of ITWorks opportunities. So as you are kind of thinking on a revenue growth perspective, those add $7 million to $10 million on an annual basis, and if we can get to the point where we are signing four or five of those in a year or more, then that's a good opportunity to expand the top line as well.","David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Thanks. And my last question, I think a quick one. But at the HIMSS Analyst Day, you talked about five Soarian clients making the decision to shift over to Millennium and Zane, I think you just said three during the first quarter, and so I just wanted to make sure I was understanding the two numbers correctly, and perhaps you could update, has there been any subsequent decision to what we heard at the Analyst Day? Thanks.","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","Sorry about that. So there were one of those had three hospitals that were kind of three individual buying decisions that I have, in my head, have rolled that into one. So the five is an accurate element of that, but principally driven by one. So those \u2013 that's still the same as you think about where we were from HIMSS previously.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Yeah. And for the most part, we expect there to be migrations as we go, it's not a metric that we're going to kind of track every quarter, but I think it was from Dick's comments at HIMSS and our comments today, it's noteworthy that it's within 60 days of closing, we still have five basically transactions with three clients \u2013 with three basic clients, that made the decision to go with Cerner and do the migration very quickly. So that was more of a data point. We expect once again there will be over time a very good chunk of their base will migrate to Cerner solutions in some form or another.","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","Right, we're still seeing very good activity in the transition space.","David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC","Excellent. Thank you.","Operator","And your next question is from the line of Sean Wieland from Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Sean W. Wieland - Piper Jaffray & Co","Hi, thanks very much. So, this quarter and last quarter you've talked about the expanded pipeline in the hospital market. Can you just talk a little bit about the close rate that you're seeing in that pipeline and what, if any, is the sense of urgency that these customers have in making a decision?","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","Great question, Sean. It is different than it was in a meaningful use era, where the timelines were really forced by the government related to the meaningful use thesis. So we are seeing some variability in the close rates of those decisions and the ability to accurately forecast some of the timing of that. The level of activity is unprecedented, but the close rate does have some variability as we move forward.","There are compelling elements as people look to the future. They know that they have to have a contemporary solution set, and so the more at risk dollars that they have around readmissions and so the more that their revenue is at risk, so as they look forward, they have a number of mandates from the government and from the payer side around their risk elements. And so, they need to go move forward, it's a matter of how much pain can they \u2013 will they allow themselves to be inflicted upon before they move to a more contemporary system. And so that really is the key driver of the close rate of that. But we've got a very extensive forecast methodology that we continue to utilize and has really helped us to take the variability out of the business and that discipline is what we utilize to run and reforecast our business every quarter for the following four quarters.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Yeah, this is Marc. The nice part is having a big pipeline and lots of activity means, we can apply risks to closure, and so if something moves out, there's usually something else that is taking its place. So, pipeline makes \u2013 increases your forecast ability even in an environment where there isn't a special \u2013 a particular date that is driving closure to contract.","Sean W. Wieland - Piper Jaffray & Co","Thank you. And then also another question, last quarter I think my notes say you had 11 competitive displacements in the ambulatory space, how many of those do you have live now?","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Yeah, I'd have to go do the research to figure that out, obviously if they are PowerWorks clients, very likely they're up and running, but I think for the most part, those displacements are likely going to be the other solutions that will have a normal project standpoint.","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","Typically in an integrated ambulatory model, which most of those displacements are around, you're looking at 15 month cycle for most of those types of situations.","Sean W. Wieland - Piper Jaffray & Co","Got it. Thank you so much.","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","Thank you.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Why don't we take one more question?","Operator","And your next question is from the line of Robert Jones from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Unknown Speaker","Thanks and good afternoon. It's actually Stefan calling in for Bob. Just wanted to follow up on the comments around the strong pipeline more broadly. I was hoping you can share your thoughts around what you're seeing with regard to overall client CapEx budgets or improving utilization. Is there an improving backdrop of ACA volume driven improvements that's driving increased activity?","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","This is Zane. Obviously, our business is impacted by the health of our clients and many of our clients have seen a large amount of volume increase. And so that obviously is a positive element around that. And then those clients that have better reimbursement scenarios in certain states that have received some of the Medicaid additional dollars there, bottom lines have been positively impacted.","I won't say that that's driving additional spending behavior because fundamentally what our clients are looking at is the future to both survive and then thrive. And so these are core decisions that the clients need to make and so while their financial health will have an impact on our business overall, making the investments in these types of systems is actually crucial for their survival long term and the ability to thrive. So I don't think that it's going to have an immediate near term impact so much as it has a \u2013 it's good when our clients are doing well.","Unknown Speaker","Great. Thanks for the question.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","I want to thank everyone for joining the call. We appreciate the attention, especially given all the activity that was occurring at 3:30 today. So know that we appreciate your attention and we're certainly pleased with the strong results we had this quarter. And we look forward to talking to you again very soon.

Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Thank you, Caleigh. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the call. I'll lead off today with a review of the numbers. Zane Burke, our President, will follow me with results highlights and marketplace observations. Mike Nill, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, will discuss the operations. Neal Patterson, our Chairman and CEO, will join us for Q&A.","Now I'll turn to our results. Similar to last quarter, we delivered results that are mostly in line with our expectation with the expectation of revenue. While we are disappointed that we are below our guided levels of revenue, our continued levels of strong bookings and positive outlook set up a good second half of year.","Our bookings revenue in Q2 was $1.29 billion, which is an all-time high and reflects 20% growth over Q2 of 2014, including record amounts of new business activity. Our revenue backlog ended the quarter at $13.3 billion, which is up [from] $9.7 billion a year ago, and reflects the strong bookings in Q2 as well as the inclusion of backlog from Health Services.","Revenue in the quarter was $1.13 billion, which is up 32% over Q2 of 2014 and includes approximately $260 million of Health Services. The total is approximately $50 million below our guidance range, with approximately $40 million of shortfall related to core Cerner and $10 million attributable to Health Services.","On the Cerner side, the lower revenue and resulting low single-digit growth is related to several factors. Some are in-quarter dynamics. Some are unique items in the prior-year period that drove 20% growth and created a tough comparable, and some are items that we didn't accurately forecast.","The first factor is lower growth in services, which is primarily because of a year-over-year decrease in third-party services. Recall that in Q2 of 2014 we had a revenue over-attainment of more than $20 million that was largely related to higher third-party services and reimbursed travel. We are using less third-party services this year, and travel revenue excluding Health Services was down approximately 50% year over year. Just adjusting for these two items brings Cerner's core growth from approximately 2% to 5%. As you know, third-party services are lower margin and reimbursed travel is zero margin, so this lower revenue had little impact on our profitability.","Another factor that has impacted our services revenue is we limited hiring in the months leading up to and the initial months after the close of our Health Services acquisition. Our forecasting model did not fully reflect this. We're now ramping up hiring to meet the strong demand reflected in the year-to-date bookings and our forecast, which will drive stronger services revenues growth. Both the impact of the additional resources as well as the impact of additional opportunities we see for the Works businesses will primarily be toward the end of the year and in 2016.","An additional factor impacting revenues and our bookings this quarter included a higher percentage from long-term contracts, resulting in a lower percentage of items that generated in-quarter revenue.","Finally, relative to Health Services, recurring revenue is tracking as we had forecasted, but non-recurring revenue came in lower than expected. While we're having ongoing success converting Health Services clients to Millennium, there is a portion of their base that is sitting tight during the transition, which has impacted the rate at which they make add-on purchases for things like lower-margin hardware. Otherwise, everything we are tracking for Health Services is at or ahead of our expectations.","Now I'll quickly go through the total revenue composition for Q2. Total system sales revenue was $315 million. Support and maintenance was $255 million. Services was $538 million, and reimbursed travel was $18 million. System sales revenue reflects a 34% increase over Q2 of 2014, with the growth mainly driven by an increase in subscriptions, which is where the addition of Health Services has had the biggest impact, as well as growth in licensed software. Our system sales margin percentage was 64.3%, which is down slightly from 65.3% in Q2 of 2014 and 64.7% in Q1. The decline was driven by lower tech resale margins.","Moving to services, total services revenue, including professional and managed services, was up 30% compared to Q2 of 2014, mainly driven by the addition of Health Services as well as growth in core Cerner managed services.","Support and maintenance revenue increased 45% over Q2 of 2014, reflecting solid growth in core support and maintenance and the addition of Health Services.","Looking at revenue by geographic segment, domestic revenue increased 30% over the year-ago quarter to $995 million, driven largely by the addition of Health Services. And global revenue grew 54% to $131 million, with good growth in core global revenue being augmented by the addition of Health Services.","Moving to gross margin, our gross margin for Q2 was 82.9%, which is up from 80.9% in Q2 of 2014, with the improved margin reflecting the lower level of third-party services and reimbursed travel.","Looking at operating spending, our second quarter non-GAAP operating expenses, which excludes share-based compensation expense, voluntary separation plan expense, and acquisition-related adjustments, were $661 million, which is up 37% compared to adjusted Q2 2014 operating expenses. This growth was primarily driven by the addition of Health Services business.","The total year-over-year growth for each expense category on a non-GAAP basis was: 32% for sales and client service; 42% for software development; 61% for G&A; and a 3% decline in amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, which is a new expense line we added this quarter. Note that this line is $25 million on our GAAP income statement and $3 million in our non-GAAP results since we are excluding amortization related to Health Services.","Moving to operating margins, our operating margin before share-based compensation expense, voluntary separation expense, and acquisition-related adjustments was 24.2% in Q2. This is essentially flat compared to Q2 of 2014 and up 50 basis points from last quarter.","Similar to Q1, we achieved our second quarter earnings on lower revenue, resulting in a higher operating margin percent than we originally projected. We expect this dynamic to continue for the rest of the year, with lower revenue being offset by lower expenses, resulting in no change to our earnings outlook and a higher operating margin percent than we originally projected. We now expect our non-GAAP operating margin for the year to be close to 2014 levels. This compares to an original expectation that it would go down approximately 200 basis points with the addition of Health Services.","Moving to net earnings and EPS, our GAAP net earnings in Q2 were $115 million or $0.33 per diluted share. Adjusted net earnings were $183 million and adjusted EPS was $0.52, which is up 30% compared to Q2 of 2014. Adjusted net earnings exclude share-based compensation expense, which had a net impact on GAAP earnings of $14 million or $0.04 per diluted share; as well as the voluntary separation plan expense, which had a net impact on GAAP earnings of $28 million or $0.08 per diluted share.","Adjusted net earnings also reflect adjustments related to Cerner's acquisition of Health Services, including Health Services acquisition-related amortization, which reduced GAAP net earnings and diluted earnings per share by $14 million and $0.04 respectively; other acquisition related adjustments, which reduced GAAP net earnings and diluted earnings per share by $6 million and $0.01 respectively; and the acquisition-related deferred revenue adjustment, which was not included in GAAP net earnings but increases adjusted net earnings and diluted earnings per share by $6 million and $0.02 respectively.","The Q2 tax rate for adjusted net earnings was 33%, which is in our expected range of 33% to 34%.","Now I'll move to our balance sheet. We ended Q2 with $857 million of total cash and investments, which is down slightly from $889 million in Q1 due to our negative free cash flow, which I'll discuss in a minute. Our total debt including capital lease obligations is $623 million.","Total receivables ended the quarter at $1 billion, which is up $63 million from Q1. Our Q2 DSO was 81 days compared to 79 days in Q1 and 66 days in the year-ago quarter. The higher DSO is primarily a function of the lower revenue in the quarter and some delayed billings for Health Services clients as we transition to our systems. As we move through the year, we expect DSO to come down as revenue increases and we get Health Services billings caught up.","Operating cash flow for the quarter was $109 million, down from $214 million in Q1, due mainly to the voluntary separation plan expense and lower collections related to delayed billings. Q2 capital expenditures were $85 million, and capitalized software was $70 million. Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures and capitalized software, was negative $46 million for the quarter, driven by a combination of lower operating cash flow and higher capital spending.","Looking ahead, we expect operating cash flow to increase in coming quarters as the voluntary separation plan and acquisition-related expenses decline and we improve DSO. Some of the increased operating cash flow will be offset by capital expenditures tied to construction of our new campus and Health Services capital expenditures. We still expect free cash flow to improve meaningfully.","Now I'll go through Q3 and full-year 2015 guidance. For Q3 we expect revenue between $1.15 billion and $1.2 billion, with the midpoint reflecting growth of 40% over Q3 of 2014. For the full year we expect revenue between $4.475 billion and $4.575 billion, with the midpoint reflecting 33% growth over ast year. This is lower than our prior guidance due to lower revenue in Q2 and also factors in the lower year-to-date run rate. As I indicated, the lower revenue is not expected to impact our earnings in Q3 (11:20) year.","For Q3, we expect adjusted EPS before share-based compensation, voluntary separation plan expense, and acquisition-related adjustments to be $0.54 to $0.55 per share, with the midpoint reflecting 30% growth over Q3 2014 adjusted EPS. For the full year, we expect adjusted EPS before share-based compensation, voluntary separation plan expense, and acquisition-related adjustments to be $2.09 to $2.15, which is up from our previous range of $2.07 to $2.15, and reflects 28% growth at the midpoint. Our estimate for the impact of share-based compensation expense is approximately $0.03 to $0.04 in Q3 and $0.14 to $0.15 for the full year.","Moving to bookings guidance, we expect bookings revenue in Q3 of $1.35 billion to $1.45 billion, with the midpoint reflecting 27% growth over Q3 of 2014.","In summary, while we're disappointed that revenue was below our guidance, we're very pleased with our bookings results and outlook. Importantly, we believe we have appropriately adjusted our revenue guidance to factor in the lower first half revenue and run rate.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Zane.","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","Thanks, Marc. Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll provide color on our results and make some marketplace observations.","I'll start with our results. Our bookings revenue in Q2 of $1.29 billion reflects strong growth of 20% over Q2 2014. Bookings this quarter include an all-time high level of large contracts, with 38 contracts over $5 million, including 23 over $10 million. We also had strong contributions from long-term bookings with a large ITWorks contract and an expansion of an existing ITWorks relationship. This led to long-term bookings making up 35% of total, which is a few percent higher than normal.","The main highlight of the quarter was that we signed a record number of new footprints, both in terms of number and dollars. This resulted in 34% of our bookings coming from outside our core Millennium installed base. This success reflects our strong competitiveness and the continued large opportunity for competitive displacements. Our wins span many market segments, including IDNs, regional hospitals, children's hospitals, community hospitals, state behavioral health, ambulatory surgery centers, and physician groups.","We're also continuing to sign Health Services clients to migrate to Millennium. These clients range from community hospitals selecting our CommunityWorks offering to large IDNs. And we continue to see cross-sell activity for solutions like Population Health and ambulatory.","While not part of Q2, I'd like to highlight a significant win for Cerner that was announced today. We were recently selected by Baptist Health South Florida, a leading healthcare organization in the region, to implement Cerner Millennium and HealtheIntent across their seven hospitals and over 50 outpatient facilities. Baptist Health is recognized as a national leader in quality, safety, and patient satisfaction. And they're looking to Cerner solutions to optimize the physician experience, improve quality of care, and support their efforts to improve patient experience. In addition, they expect to leverage our enterprise-wide solutions and HealtheIntent platform to advance their goal of improving care coordination and reducing the cost of care.","This recent win combined with our record level of new footprints in Q2 is evidence of strong momentum we have in the marketplace. Looking forward, we believe we can build on this momentum, and we remain bullish on new footprint opportunities. Our positive outlook is based on a very large and active pipeline and all-time high levels of new business activity, such as demos, reference calls and visits, and vision center visits. We continue to believe we have a multi-year opportunity to expand our client base, as about half of the market is on a legacy system and we think will need to be replaced.","One observation about the buyer in today's market is they are very focused on the predictability of costs and transparency of the total cost of ownership, and we believe this is something that plays to our strength. We believe our ability to offer fixed-fee pricing on implementations because of our automation tools and implementation methodologies is a competitive differentiator. We also differentiate in our ability to provide services ranging from remote hosting to taking over an entire IT department, which can make our clients' total costs much more transparent and predictable.","In addition, I believe we have credibility in the industry because of our track record for delivering value. And this credibility is bolstered by our large presence in investor-owned systems that are known for making ROI-based decisions. These clients, along with many of our other large IDNs, represent some of the largest healthcare IT deployments in the industry.","I think it is worth noting that our ability to deliver value, on time and on budget projects is a meaningful differentiator relative to our primary competitor, who has a long list of making headlines when the significant cost of deploying and maintaining their system is cited as a key reason for job loss, financial challenges, and debt rating downgrades.","Another marketplace observation is that openness, interoperability, and population health capabilities are becoming more important. This also benefits Cerner because of our longtime commitment to interoperability and open standards and our robust HealtheIntent cloud platform for population health. We continued to expand the presence of HealtheIntent across our client base, and the number of opportunities outside of our base is growing.","Moving to our revenue cycle business, we had a good second quarter. All of our new EMR footprints in Q2 included revenue cycle, which supports what we have been saying about the market looking to buy integrated systems. Revenue cycle is an important component of almost all deals in our pipeline. In addition, we are gaining momentum in our existing installed base, with several clients selecting us to replace their legacy revenue cycle systems in favor of an integrated system. Based on these trends and the growing pipeline for related services, I expect revenue cycle to continue contributing to our growth for years to come.","Moving to the ambulatory market, where we had an all-time high level of bookings in Q2, the bookings were driven by success at displacing our key competitors, both by expanding our solutions to the ambulatory venues of our acute care clients and as part of new business footprints. In addition, we are continuing to have success selling ambulatory solutions into the Health Services base. Finally, we continue to gain momentum in ambulatory business office services and expect there to be additional sites where we displace the cloud business office services offering of a certain cloud competitor because of our ability to demonstrate better service and value.","We also had a record bookings quarter in the small hospital market, driven by a combination of traditional new footprints, extensions to our health system clients, and Health Services migrations.","Outside of the U.S., we had a good Q2, with total revenue growth of 54%, consisting of good organic growth and the addition of Health Services. The organic growth was primarily driven by strength in the UK and the Middle East. We are also off to a good start at integrating the global components of Health Services. We now have a presence in more than 30 countries, and believe we are well positioned for our global business to be a good contributor to our growth over the next decade.","Before turning the call over to Mike, I'd like to comment on the recent announcement on the Defense Healthcare Management System Modernization project, referred to as DHMSM. We are pleased that last week the Department of Defense announced its decision to award the contract to Leidos, Inc. As you know, the Leidos partnership for Defense Health includes Cerner as the core EHR supplier.","We are honored, humbled, and excited to be part of a team that won what we believe was the most objective and comprehensive evaluation of technology platforms and solutions ever conducted. We now have the opportunity for the Cerner suite of integrated solutions to replace the DoD's legacy health IT systems in its 55 hospitals and more than 350 clinics worldwide, as well as in ships, submarines, and other locations in the theater of military operations. We are pleased to be partners with Leidos, Accenture, Henry Schein, and a number of small business partners in making this important transition for our military health system and its 9.6 million beneficiaries. Intermountain Healthcare is also a strategic partner and is providing clinical governance of solutions and workflow.","The partnership is fully prepared to meet the staffing requirements of DHMSM, and our globally deployed team stands ready to support the DoD and DHMSM mission. We believe this is a positive development for our clients, and they should have confidence that Cerner will continue to execute to meet all our current and future commitments.","As many of you saw in the announcement, Leidos was awarded a contract for $4.3 billion over 10 years, consisting of a two-year initial ordering period, two to three-year option period, and another two-year option period.","We're not able to comment on Cerner's portion of this, but note that we do not expect this to have a material impact on bookings, revenue, or earnings in the near term since the project will have several phases and will start with a small initial rollout.","I know many of you also saw an $11 billion figure cited in regard to the contract before it was announced. As noted in the DoD's press release, this estimate is now approximately $9 billion and represents the total estimated program cost over 18 years, not the value of the contract awarded.","In summary, we believe the selection by the Department of Defense reflects positively on the achievements of Cerner, our partners, and all our clients. The Department of Defense is already in the Cerner family as a lab client, and we're excited to expand our relationship.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike.","Michael R. Nill - Cerner Corp.","Thanks, Zane. Good afternoon, everyone. Today I'm going to discuss ITWorks and provide an update on our relationship with the University of Missouri.","In the second quarter we established a new ITWorks relationship and also expanded an existing ITWorks relationship. Our new ITWorks client is Catholic Health Initiatives, and this relationship was announced in July. CHI selected ITWorks to improve continuity of care across 47 hospitals and multiple clinic settings, and Cerner will assume operational and administrative responsibilities for CHS's IT at its facilities in multiple states that use Cerner Millennium. This will include current and future implementations, upgrades, enhancements, optimization, application and operational management, and support of the system and clinical service desk support.","CHI has been a client for more than 12 years, and this will tighten our alliance and support of CHI's vision of pioneering models to enhance patient care, safety, and clinical outcomes. The tighter alignment will also help accelerate the implementation of the latest technology advances available.","The second ITWorks agreement I'd like to discuss is the expansion of our relationship with the University of Missouri Healthcare. MU has been a Cerner client since 1996, and we formed the Tiger Institute for Health Innovation with them in 2009. The Tiger Institute has produced a number of innovations to transform the delivery of care. Examples include e-visit technology, integrating calculators into the EHR, and developing a consumer-facing mental health app. This year the Tiger Institute launched OpenNotes, a function that gives patients access to their clinical notes through the MU Healthe patient portal.","MU Health has also achieved multiple healthcare IT successes, including HIMSS Stage 7, being the first academic medical center to meaningful use Stage 2, and being designated \"Most Wired\" by the AHA each of the past four years.","Going forward, the Tiger Institute will focus on redefining patient engagement through mobile healthcare, developing a population health strategy and network to better position MU Healthcare to lower costs while improving the health of Missourians, increasing the role of healthcare IT and academic medical research, helping transition to value-based payment models, and developing a Tiger Institute Value Creation Office to identify cost savings opportunity. The University of Missouri was one of the first ITWorks clients and institute relationships, and we're very pleased with what we've accomplished together as it demonstrates the power of close alignment with our clients.","With that, I'll turn the call over to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Eric Percher with Barclays. Your line is now open.","Eric R. Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you. Just to start, Marc, as you were talking through the Health Services business, you mentioned that non-recurring revenue was running a little lower on those that are sitting tight. I'm not sure I quite caught that dynamic. Would you mind walking through that?","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Sure. For clients that are not immediately looking to go transition to Cerner Millennium and make the switch, they are not putting in a lot of new solutions from HS into their environment. They're holding pat with their hand. That's impacting some of the services that we see normally from HS. It's certainly impacting what their normal hardware and third-party sales would be. So those clients don't want to invest in the current infrastructure if they think they're going to switch to Cerner because many of them when they switch to Cerner will go to our hosted methodology, and they won't need these computers and the hardware that they'd normally be buying.","So we expect that as people decide what their timeframe for moving is that we will see that free up, and people will say I've got a three-year window or whatever the window is I need to make these purchases, and we'll see that start bouncing back. But as we look at that business, the one thing that's lower is these add-on type sales into the base that surround their existing platforms. People are waiting to get their go-forward decision before they continue to make those incremental investments.","Eric R. Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc.","That's helpful. And my follow-up would be, as you think about the op margin and now that you won't have the 200 basis point impact, how much of that is attributable to mix versus actions that you've taken on expense?","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","I think that's a good point. When you look at the results for this quarter, clearly I think our software \u2013 licensed software was one of the strongest revenue quarters we've ever seen. So that obviously brings with it higher margin. It doesn't contribute as much to revenue growth but it certainly contributes to earnings growth. So I think from a mix perspective, we saw that. We're continuing to certainly on the HS side, the lower tech resale elements with lower margin help overall margins, don't help the revenue so much. And I think just the activity around the acquisition and thoroughly reviewing not only HS spending but Cerner spending to make sure we were appropriately investing was good for the business. So I think that's overall given us a little bit of a tailwind from the expense side.","So it is a mix to some extent, but there are some real savings on the spending side that we've incurred. Part of it even is in the services business, where we are just starting to ramp up hiring now to meet the 2015 bookings demand that we saw in the first half and that we expect to see in the second half.","Eric R. Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, great. Thank you.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Charles Rhyee with Cowen & Company. Your line is now open.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thanks for taking the question. Marc, first on the revenue here, obviously you talked about less third-party in the quarter than you expected, and now you're going to ramp up the hiring. Was there something that changed that made you realize that you needed to do more of the hiring that you didn't anticipate earlier? What was the signal to you that we didn't really have enough people for the demand?","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","I think we're certainly meeting all of the demand relative to project work and implementation work. Part of it was a desire to make sure that we thoroughly had a chance to review all of the HS service resources, decide what we need to stay in that business, what we could convert to doing Millennium work. I think that probably the services business we didn't address as much might have been some of the optional non-implementation work that we often see and often get signed and executed within a quarter, but I think that was prudent as we went through.","I think I would certainly take it on me as probably not having the resource element reflected as accurately in our forecasting model as I should have, so although a bit of a lower revenue being a little bit lower than guidance, it's just on that. We've adjusted that going forward so that the rest of the year we feel very confident on the revenue guidance that we've provided. But it's not getting to these new projects as much as it is some of the ancillary service activities we get.","And then third-party, we really like to minimize how much we use third-party services. We had a lot of meaningful use activity in the year-ago quarter, lots of work going on, and that's why you saw the much higher third-party and the much higher travel revenue that came through the P&L.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC","That's helpful. And then as a follow-up, obviously you highlighted revenue cycle management as an important area. Can you talk about how you feel about your capabilities in this regard internally? And you have obviously a lot of cash on the balance sheet. Is there any thoughts to deploy that to add to your capacity there \u2013 capabilities there? Thanks.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","From the revenue cycle, I think we're very happy with where we are relative to the solutions that we have out there and relative to certainly the initial RevWorks and revenue cycle activities. As we've talked about in the past, we can do anything from a full outsourcing of the revenue cycle, which we call RevWorks, to business office to just assisting with providing the solution that is state of the art relative to revenue cycle.","So as far as deploying our capital in some type of an acquisition that would be in that space, I think we're very happy with where we're at right now, and I think we're doing the normal Cerner strategy of developing, spending our capital on R&D and taking the market share right now a client at a time.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Donald Hooker with KeyBanc. Your line is now open.","Donald H. Hooker - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hey, good afternoon. So it seems like this ITWorks business is doing very well. You gave some numbers for last year, it did well, and it seems like you keep landing nice deals there. I keep wondering in my mind whether ITWorks is perhaps somewhat of a leading indicator as well of the business for you. Is it the case where people adopt the ITWorks service and then you can really sell more product to them, or is it a lagging indicator where it's a culmination of a relationship with a client?","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","This is Marc. ITWorks usually tends to be later in the life cycle of the client. It's really an indicator that the client has decided to go all-in Cerner and that they are going to replace every ancillary system they have with Cerner. They want to do it as quickly as possible. They want to do it with people that really know how to go operate in that environment. That's usually where we see the ITWorks activity occurring.","Certainly as we have more and more experience, more and more clients that we can show as examples of how that's worked, it is getting to be something that our client base is developing a higher level of interest. They want to make sure that they can get their costs managed well and that they can be certainly predictable. And ITWorks lets them make their costs in the IT space highly predictable relative to running their system. So it really is, although when they sign up for ITWorks, there certainly is follow-on solutions as they switch out those ancillaries as they occur. But really once they go into ITWorks, there's follow-on business. But that's really almost not necessarily the culmination of the relationship. But at that point, we are pretty sticky in their environment, and switching from that is very, very difficult, and certainly we don't give them any reason to want to switch. That is in certainly the ITWorks opportunity.","We see RevWorks starting to be able to follow in that same line. As we get through ICD-10, we think that the desire for many systems to get out of the revenue collection business and outsource the revenue cycle is going to continue to build. And we think actually when we look at how do we grow our revenue in the future, we think those Works businesses are certainly big opportunities because each ITWorks business is at least $7 million to $10 million a year of additional revenue, and some of them will be more than that. Our pipeline for the next 12 months on the Works business is pretty strong.","Donald H. Hooker - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Got you, and then one other one and I'll hop off. You all mentioned that you had strong growth in the smaller hospital segment. I guess I'm thinking here of the CommunityWorks offering. I also had heard anecdotes that that's moving into larger \u2013 that offering is successfully selling into larger hospital settings. Is that true? Are you seeing more traction of CommunityWorks in larger hospitals than you had seen before, or it is still predominately the small hospitals?","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","This is Zane. It's still a predominately small hospital offering. What we have seen are certain large clients that want to create part of their networks and use the CommunityWorks model in some of those critical access connector facilities. So if you've heard about that in some of the larger organizations, it may be part of their feeder systems as they look to create more network in their own areas.","Donald H. Hooker - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","And did you say how many sites you have live on that service? Can you share that?","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","I know what the number is.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","I don't know if I've got that number right offhand, but I bet I can get it before we finish the call.","Donald H. Hooker - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay, thank you very much.","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","This is Zane. We have 90 sites that are contracted. Not all of those are live at this point in time.","Donald H. Hooker - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Cherny with Evercore. Your line is now open.","Michael Aaron Cherny - Evercore ISI","Good morning \u2013 or afternoon, sorry, long day. Going back to the DoD contract, it's been less than a week since you and Leidos and your partnership were awarded that contract. Have you heard from any of your customers or potential prospects already in terms of what this means in terms of the way they view you? I assume some of your key customers \u2013 obviously Intermountain is thrilled to see it \u2013 but any other feedback from the field? I know you talked about the implementation and the resources you're going to have to make sure this contract is executed on plan. But I'm curious more to the upside if people view this in the market in terms of further validating just how successful you've been.","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","This is Zane. Clearly our clients are actually very excited for the win. We've seen a lot of very positive momentum from them, and really I do expect it to have a positive impact as we look forward to some of the competitive environments. And as you look at where we come out of Q2 with our best win rate, with the highest number of new footprints in our history, and then you add to that the selection by the DoD and our announcement today on Baptist South Florida, you get a flavor for what's happening in the marketplace that the momentum is clearly on our side. And so I do think that's a big positive.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Michael, this is Marc. I think certainly it is pretty near term, but we had a lot of momentum going. This merely continues that strong momentum. I think it certainly was a process that was more rigorous than any we've ever seen, and to win is a big accomplishment. And I think as you look at our Q3 bookings guidance, which is up significantly, you're seeing not only our existing momentum, but our belief that this will help us close business as soon as Q3.","Michael Aaron Cherny - Evercore ISI","Got it. Thanks, that's helpful, and then just one question too. Long-term bookings percent in total has been spiking up. I know we talked a bit about the Works deals. Is there any change in some of the long-term bookings you have in terms of how they are being recognized? Are you seeing any elongation or potential shortening of some of the bookings that have gone to that number versus maybe two years, three years, four years ago?","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","No, we're using the same approach. It's just a lot \u2013 the deal mix just happened to have more of the 10-year deals as a component of it relative to the traditional 30% or so that we've seen in the past. It comes and goes depending on what the deal is.","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","This is Zane. Principally we had two very large Works deals in the last two quarters, which is also a bigger indicator in the mix of how those were. So given the size of those two big items, that had some impact on the percentage size of that.","Michael Aaron Cherny - Evercore ISI","Got it. I guess it helps for the visibility long term. So thanks, guys.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Halper with FBR. Your line is now open.","Steven P. Halper - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Hi. So if you think about the revenue miss from the first quarter and you have the second [quarter] revenue disappointment this year, and so now you're telling us that you scrubbed those numbers, and now the guidance is \u2013 you feel really confident in that. But could you tell us what didn't happen or what changed from one quarter to the next? I'm just trying to understand what's at work here.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Steve, it's a great question. Clearly as we went into Q2 and prepared talk to you guys last time, services is primarily the focus for us relative from a revenue perspective. Licensed software is doing well. Other elements are doing well. We are seeing some lower tech resale, certainly from HS and a little bit from us, which is impacting revenue, but the lion's share of it is related to services. Some of that, as I indicated, as we went through in more detail this quarter and we reviewed our forecasting process, I think there was something in those forecasts that gave us a bigger number than it should have. And that included including more third-party because third-party is something we have a little hard time getting visibility to because it's not necessarily \u2013 while it's coming out of backlog, it's not necessarily something that's coming out of our resources, so it's a little bit of a different model. So I think services clearly missed their forecast in this period.","And I think just in the quarter, there were a couple of deals that would have contributed some decent sized revenue to the quarter, not necessarily high-margin revenue, but some revenue that didn't happen in the quarter that we would have forecasted from a revenue perspective. But at this point, I think there's nothing in the business that is causing us to miss our guidance. I think it's more the guidance was probably higher than it should have been when we went into last quarter. We've now adjusted it.","I feel very confident, as you know, and you could expect to beat this really hard since we closed the quarter and prior to that to understand it well. And I'm pretty confident that we've got good numbers out there for you going forward. And I'm pretty confident that that services business bounces back as we continue to ride the momentum in 2015, continue to add to our services personnel, and have that pipeline of Works businesses that we think will contribute pretty significantly likely to the 2016 revenue number. So definitely take it as my bad on the guidance variance to date, but I'm not going to have a my-bad next quarter.","Steven P. Halper - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","And just quickly, the Baptist deal was not in the quarter bookings?","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","That's correct. That was a Q3 signing.","Steven P. Halper - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Okay. And CapEx expectation for the rest of the year around the new campus?","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","As we go forward, you're going to see us obviously spending more than we did in 2014. As you see on the cash flow, you see us having periods where we invested capital heavily. So if you go back to 2012, we had 100%; we delivered free cash flow at 100% of net income. In 2013, we bumped up CapEx significantly, and that went down to 34%. Last year we had less CapEx. This year, we're going to have strong CapEx. So we're looking at building CapEx priced somewhere in the $150 million range. So it will be pretty strong in our other capital expenditures. Including HS, it will be up from last year.","But as we roll forward and we get the first phase of the campus completed, you should see us starting to bounce back from a free cash flow perspective. We got hit pretty hard this quarter from just a working capital perspective of probably $100 million of working capital. On the balance sheet, I just went negative relative to operating cash flow. That will reverse as we go forward plus my expectation as we roll forward into 2016 and 2017, you see us getting working ROI closer to getting to our goal of net income equaling free cash flow.","Steven P. Halper - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","And what was the $150 million number that you just put out there?","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","That was basically building CapEx.","Steven P. Halper - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Okay.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","A rough estimate of what we will probably spend because right now the last half of this year will be a pretty intensive investment relative to our buildings.","Steven P. Halper - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of George Hill with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey, good afternoon, guys, and thanks for taking the question. Marc, I think I'm going to want to drill into the services revenue shortfall a little bit more too. If we look at from where the guidance originally came out in February to where we are now, it's almost a $0.5 billion negative revision at the revenue line. Can you talk to us a little bit more about where those services revenues lines get sprinkled on the income statement? Is any of it in system sales, or is it all just in that services sub-line under support, maintenance, and services? And then if a lot of this is tied to third parties, that seems like a real big move relative to the size of what we expected the income statement line there to look like for the year. I guess can you give us some examples functionally of what's going on that's pushing that line around in a pretty significant direction?","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","I'd be happy to do the math on the $0.5 billion number, but I think the key is relative to, compared to the year-ago quarter, when we had a bunch of third parties getting to the meaningful use projects, that we are not doing that as much. That is harder for us to forecast and we did not do a very effective job of putting into our forecast the significantly reduced number. So that was probably $20 million in the year-ago quarter. We are lower than that this quarter. So that's a pretty big change relative to the total.","I think part of the difference you talked about when you're going back to the revenue line, you've got to go back to last quarter when we talked about the Health Services deferred revenue. It was about $100 million. So there are other elements than GS Services if you're going to step back for revenue discussions we've had in the last 12 months.","But from a services perspective, the key for us is forecasting accurately based on our backlog that's got to be delivered and the resources we have available to go deliver that, and we did not do that as effectively in Q2 as we should have. We've now gone through that forecast with a fine-toothed comb. So from a business perspective, it's pretty logical that with less third-party, that revenue is not going to be there. We're going to deliver the services from our own personnel, and we're adding to that personnel line every day certainly with a lot of the college hires coming out of schools that will hit us basically Q2 \u2013 Q3. Those are the resources that we need to go out and deliver the work that Zane and his team are delivering for us. So that will drive out the revenue that we've got projected.","We're up against a very difficult comp relative to 2014 when we grew revenue 17%. So you've got to back of your mind at least keep that present because if you look at it two years, we still are growing revenue relatively good on average. In addition, as we roll into next year, because of what we see or at least what I see in the opportunities from the Works businesses and with the ramp-up of services opportunities from a delivery perspective, we should still be talking about being able to deliver double-digit growth in 2016. Obviously, it's early to talk about that. We haven't given you any guidance to that, but I believe it is laying out in a way that some of these Works deals could be a significant tailwind for us to get that double-digit revenue growth.","George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Then maybe asked another way, it sounds like is this a capacity issue on you guys end? Do you guys just not have the service capacity to...","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","No, no, we have plenty of people to go address the work. The key is the implementation work that we're working on primarily now is that which was signed in 2014. We've seen a lot more activity in 2015. We're ramping up, so when those projects get to the point where they need resources, we'll be absolutely ready to go deliver those. But from a revenue standpoint, because of preparing for HS to come onboard, we're being very careful about over-hiring. There are certain optional services around elements that are not related to implementation that we didn't necessarily go after. That work is always going to be there. We can go pick that up at a later time, but we wanted to make sure that we didn't hire a bunch of people relative to the work that was going to be able to be out there.","When you look at services, you also have a little bit of an HS element that just because of the transition that they are not as efficient as we would normally have our services people be from an availability standpoint. So those are all factors into it. At this point, I think we've got the right number out there. We feel very confident in it. We're delivering on projects as we believe we should be delivering, and we are not resource constrained relative to the business.","George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, all right. I appreciate the color. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Daniels with William Blair. Your line is now open.","Jeffrey R. Garro - William Blair & Co. LLC","Good afternoon, guys. It's Jeff Garro in for Ryan. I wanted to ask about the better profitability. Previously, you've talked about margins declining this year because of Health Services, but now they're looking flattish year over year. So does that mean we should expect less of a lift in 2016, or should intermediate-term margin targets be moving up?","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","I think at this point we probably need to digest. And obviously when we get to Q3, we'll give you our first view of what 2016 looks like. Certainly we like the fact that our margins are trending higher; that we didn't have the negative that we anticipated with Health Services. But I think relative to 2016, it's a little early for us to give you a good view as to what that number is going to be. Our expectation obviously with Health Services was that once we set the baseline that we would be migrating them toward our margins, which should allow for margin improvement. So that would be my expectation, but at this point it's a little early to quantify it.","Jeffrey R. Garro - William Blair & Co. LLC","That's fair. And then just to follow up on that, though it does seem like on the expense side of things, both in terms of Health Services and Cerner, you're doing well to take a close look at the business and manage those expenses. And how does that offset potential shifts in the business mix where maybe some of these services are going to come back in 2016; and the Works businesses, how those are going to mix in with the rest of the business model? And if there's anything from an accounting perspective that we should think about in terms of longer-term margins, that would be helpful as well.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Most of the hiring that you could expect us to do will be on people that are revenue producing. And for the most part, our services businesses have a contribution margin in excess of 30%. So given our current operating margins, those people coming on and delivering revenue is going to be accretive to our operating margins. So I think that when you see us increasing spending, it will be in revenue producing areas.","The Works businesses are a little bit unique in that for the most part I'm taking over an existing workforce. So I don't have to ramp up internally my resources to be able to handle that work. For the most part, I bring in a team that is already doing that work, and I have a core group of people at Cerner that can add some of that initial initiation of that client as part of their normal workflow. So that's easier from a resourcing perspective because once they come on, they're instantly workforce in place, the revenue and the expenses driven immediately without having to \u2013 for us to do any resourcing.","Jeffrey R. Garro - William Blair & Co. LLC","Great, thanks for taking the questions, guys.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Gillmor with Robert W. Baird. Your line is now open.","Matthew D. Gillmor - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Hey, thanks and thanks for taking the questions. I just have a couple quick clarifications. Marc, you provided some commentary around the DSO trends. Can you maybe give us a little more detail on the delayed billings you mentioned? And also, do you anticipate DSOs can get back down to the mid-60-days range, or should we be thinking about a higher long-term target?","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","I think the key just on the billings was \u2013 the hardest part of some of the acquisition work is getting bills out to the clients and making sure the bills are right so that they can get paid. I think if you look at our receivables, you'll see that there was a pretty significant increase in those receivables. So I think we did a good job as we closed out Q2 of getting bills out, but you've got to get the bills out before you can start getting paid. So that was a key focus for us. And I think that's \u2013 now that those bills are flowing that we should start seeing the cash come in. And that will impact the receivables by reducing it, which would obviously will help our DSO number.","As far as the \u2013 what is the optimum DSO number, 66 days was a pretty \u2013 when you're selling into healthcare, which is a traditionally slow pay industry, 66 days was a pretty low number. I'm not willing to say that that's not the number that we should be targeting and shooting for, but we'll certainly be looking at it carefully as we go forward. And once we start getting the trend down, we should get a better view as to if there should be a different expectation of getting down to that. But I think anything from around 70 days is probably a pretty good target for us to be shooting for.","Matthew D. Gillmor - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay, great. And then I just wanted to add one follow-up on the DoD contract. I know you haven't provided a lot of details around this, and I understand the sensitivity, but can you maybe give us a sense in terms of timing for when you'll be able to discuss the financial implications in more detail?","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","This is Zane. It's still in the procurement stage, so there are still pieces of that. So I would anticipate it will be over the next 30 days to 90 days depending on what the rest of the procedures look like as part of that.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","As soon as we're able to, we'll...","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","We'll let you know.","Matthew D. Gillmor - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay, thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Nicholas Jansen with Raymond James. Your line is now open.","Nicholas M. Jansen - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Most of my questions have been asked, but I just want to get a little bit more detail surrounding the better margin performance in context of the synergies from the HS transaction thus far. I understand the mix component, but just wanted to get a sense of are we pulling forward synergies, which are driving better margins, or are the synergies tracking as expected and we should think about that building as previously communicated through 2017? Thanks.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","I think our prior communication relative to what we think HS does in 2017 is still on track. I don't know that \u2013 as I said, HS is doing a good job of delivering just based on our expectations, except for the add-on sales into their base. So I think they are on track, and we would expect them to deliver the 2017 synergies that we've discussed.","Nicholas M. Jansen - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","And then my last question would be in terms of the gross R&D spend. Obviously, you guys have spent a lot of money when you factor in capitalized development costs and things along those lines. I wanted to get a sense of how you guys measure return on that investment. Certainly it's ballooned over the years and it's paying dividends through strong bookings growth. But I wanted to get a better sense of your ultimate view on R&D dollars and maybe when we could see that number potentially start to level off a little bit to drive faster earnings growth. Thanks.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","This is Marc. As we've moved forward certainly over the last three and four years, we've become even more convinced that acquiring technology is not an effective strategy relative to the complex systems that we're developing. So we have decided we're going to invest the dollars that we might spend on acquisitions, invest that in R&D and building the capacity.","As a finance guy, trying to compute an ROI on broad R&D, if someone's got a good way of doing that, let me know. I think for me it's been a matter of faith that we need to invest in it. We certainly have a rigorous process by which we examine hundreds of projects and then decide which one of them is going to get the resourcing to get the work done. And a component of that is the expected economic return we think that that's going to drive. So there is an ROI component, but I think our strategy so far has proven very effective to build it ourselves to incorporating the Millennium and HealtheIntent platforms. And that's probably more a focus of ours than deciding based on each project what the ROI is. It's such a big view of the world we have relative to R&D that trying to segment out a single solution would be difficult. Zane?","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","I would just look at this and say I think we see so much opportunity out there in the future that we're going to just continue to invest in R&D and develop the solutions because the future outlook is incredibly bright. And as we look forward, we're continuing to invest for the future of the company, and we'll continue to make those investments.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","And that being said, certainly we are investing a lot of money in R&D. and it would be logical to me that the increase in R&D spend grows at a slower rate than the growth of revenue. So there should be based on the size of that number leverage in the future. But we are right now in an environment where we are highly competitive, lots of business activity, and we're going to invest to meet that opportunity.","Nicholas M. Jansen - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thanks for the questions.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Stockton with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Why don't we make this the last question?","Jamie J. Stockton - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","All right, Marc. I'll sneak in the last question.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Absolutely, Jamie. Go ahead.","Jamie J. Stockton - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Just an easy one. And you may have already touched on this and I missed it, but we've seen the longer term portion of bookings elevated for a couple quarters here. Should we view this mid-30% range as the new reality? You guys have a good opportunity on the Works front, not only I would assume within your customer base, but the Siemens base as well. You're obviously looking for a very healthy bookings number in the third quarter. Could you just touch on that please?","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","It still is pretty quarter dependent, and lot of it's driven by there are large Works deal that's going to occur. So I think we talked about can we get to a point where we've got a good sized Works deal every quarter on a pretty consistent basis? If we got to that point, would we get into the mid-30s relative to percent from long term? I expect our non-long-term bookings to continue to grow as well. So I don't know that I'm at a point where I think 35% is the number that is going to be the standard going forward. I'd say let's see what's the percentage in Q3, and then we'll revisit that.","Jamie J. Stockton - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay, thank you.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Sure. I want to thank everyone for joining the call today. We appreciate your attendance, and we look forward to talking to you in the next days and months. Thanks for your attention.

At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Marc Naughton, Chief Financial Officer of Cerner Corporation.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Thank you, Lilliana. Good afternoon everyone and welcome to the call. I will lead off today with a review of the numbers. Zane Burke, our President, will follow me with results, highlights and marketplace observations and then Mike Nill, our Chief Operating Officer will provide some operational highlights.","Now I will turn to our results. Q1 was a solid start to the year. Bookings, earnings, and cash flow were in our targeted ranges. Revenue was slightly below our targeted range, but our full-year outlook remains intact.","Our bookings revenue in Q1 was $1.17 billion, which is 2% lower than Q1 of 2015 in total, but reflects strong growth of 18% when you exclude long-term bookings. As we indicated, Q1 2015 included an all-time high level of long-term bookings at 37%, creating a tough comparable, and this quarter had a very low level of 24%. While this difference led to total bookings being basically flat, the strong growth in our non long-term bookings reflects ongoing strong demand and new footprints, which Zane will discuss. In addition, we have a strong pipeline for Works deals, so we expect the mix of long-term booking to normalize as we move though the year, which will benefit overall bookings.","Our revenue backlog ended the quarter at $14.6 billion, which is up 12% from $13 billion a year ago. Revenue in the quarter was $1.14 billion, which is up 14% over Q1 2015, but $12 million below our guidance range due primarily to lower hardware sales.","The revenue composition for Q1 was $279 million in system sales, $251 million in support and maintenance, $589 million in services, and $19 million in reimbursed travel.","System sales revenue for the quarter was up 8% compared to Q1 of 2015 with growth in software and subscriptions offsetting a large decline in hardware. The lower hardware is reflected in the strong system sales margin percent of 68.1%, which is up over 300 basis points year-over-year. The lower than projected hardware revenue led to total revenue being slightly below our guidance range. While it is disappointing to be slightly below our guidance range, I believe the growth in software and the return to strong growth in services revenue is more indicative of our core business trends.","Moving to services, total services revenue, including professional and managed services, was up 20% compared to Q1 of 2015. This is in line with our expectation and reflects good execution by our services organization. Support and maintenance revenue increased 10% over Q1 of 2015.","Looking at revenue by geographic segment, domestic revenue increased 15% over the year ago quarter to $1.005 billion and global revenue grew 6% to $133 million.","Moving to gross margin, our gross margin for Q1 was 84.6%, which is up from 83.1% in Q1 of 2015, reflecting the lower mix of hardware as well as strong levels of service. Looking at operating spending, our first quarter non-GAAP operating expenses, which includes share-based compensation expense and acquisition related adjustments were $701 million, which is up 19%, compared to adjusted Q1 2015 operating expenses.","This growth was primarily driven by growth in personnel expenses related to revenue generating associates, higher non-cash expenses and having an extra month of Health Services expense in Q1 2016 as compared to Q1 2015. The total year-over-year growth for each expense category in Q1 on a non-GAAP basis was 22% for sales and client service, 4% for software development, and 25% for G&A. Amortization of acquisition related intangibles was basically flat.","Moving to operating margins. Our operating margin before share-based compensation expense and acquisition related adjustments was 23.0% in Q1, which is down slightly from 23.7% in the year ago period. As previously indicated, we expect margin expansion to be limited in 2016 due in part to growth in non-cash expenses. As we laid out at HIMSS, we believe we can expand margins 50 to 100 basis points annually after 2016.","Moving to net earnings and EPS, our GAAP net earnings in Q1 were $150 million or $0.43 per diluted share. Adjusted net earnings were $182 million and adjusted diluted EPS was $0.53, which is up 18% compared to Q1 of 2015.","Adjusted net earnings exclude share-based compensation expense which had a net impact on GAAP earnings of $13.4 million or $0.04 per diluted share. Adjusted net earnings also reflect adjustments related to Cerner's acquisition of Health Services, including Health Services' acquisition related amortization, which reduced GAAP net earnings and diluted earnings per share by $13 million and $0.04 respectively; other acquisition-related adjustments, which reduced GAAP net earnings and diluted earnings per share by $2 million and $0.01 respectively; and the acquisition-related deferred revenue adjustment which is not included in GAAP net earnings, but increased adjusted net earnings and diluted earnings per share by $4 million and $0.01 respectively.","The Q1 tax rate for adjusted net earnings was 31%, which is slightly lower than our expected range of 32% to 33%.","Now, I'll move to our balance sheet. We ended Q1 with $707 million of total cash and investments, which is up slightly from $686 million in Q4, with most of our free cash flow being used to repurchase shares. During the quarter, we executed $150 million out of the $300 million stock repurchase program authorized in March of this year, repurchasing 2.8 million shares at an average price of $53.45.","Moving to debt, our total debt including capital lease obligations is $595 million, which is down slightly compared to Q4. Total receivables ended the quarter at $942 million which is down $92 million from Q4. Our Q1 DSO was 76 days, which is an improvement of 4 days compared to Q4 and in line with our expectations.","Operating cash flow for the quarter was very strong at $327 million, which is second only to our all-time high of $353 million in Q4. Q1 capital expenditures were $99 million and capitalized software was $75 million. Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures and capitalized software, was $152 million for the quarter, driven by strong operating cash flow. As previously indicated, we expect capital expenditures to increase in 2016, primarily due to construction of a new campus. We still expect to generate solid free cash flow with growth in operating cash flow offsetting the increase in capital expenditures.","Now I'll go through Q2 and full-year 2016 guidance. For Q2, we expect revenue between $1.175 billion and $1.25 billion, with the midpoint reflecting growth of 8% over Q2 of 2015. Note that we have widened our guidance range to provide cushion, given we were below our Q1 guidance due to the hardware. Also we expect revenue growth to be higher in Q3, which is an easier comparable period in Q2. For the full year, we continue to expect revenue between $4.9 billion and $5.1 billion, reflecting 13% growth over 2015 at the midpoint.","We expect Q2 adjusted EPS before share-based compensation and acquisition related adjustments to be $0.56 to $0.58 per share, with the midpoint reflecting 10% growth over Q2 2015 adjusted EPS. For the full year, we continue to expect adjusted EPS before share-based compensation and acquisition related adjustments to be $2.30 to $2.40, with the midpoint reflecting 11% growth over 2015. Our estimate for the impact of share-based compensation expense is approximately $0.04 in Q2 and between $0.16 and $0.17 for the full year.","Moving to bookings guidance, we expect bookings revenue in Q2 of $1.35 billion to $1.48 billion, with the midpoint reflecting 10% growth over Q2 of 2015. With that, I'll turn the call over to Zane.","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","Thanks, Marc. Good afternoon everyone. Today I'll provide color on our results and make some marketplace observations, starting with bookings. As Marc indicated, our total bookings were basically flat compared to the year ago quarter, but our non long-term bookings grew at 18% and we expect long-term bookings to continue to increase as we move through the year. Bookings this year included a strong level of large contracts with 43 contracts over $5 million, including 18 over $10 million.","Regarding long-term bookings contributions, we did have solid hosting bookings, and a small ITWorks contract, but the total percent from long-term bookings was just 24% compared to approximately 30% to 31% in recent years. This was not a surprise to us as we had indicated our guidance assumed a lower-level of long-term bookings, and our total bookings are within our guidance range. Going forward, our pipeline for Works deals is strong, so I expect more contribution from long-term bookings in future quarters.","Now I'll discuss the drivers of the strong growth in non long-term bookings. The main highlight of the quarter was our continued success at gaining new clients. In Q1, 36% of our bookings came from outside our core Millennium installed base, driven by an all-time high win rate against our primary competitor.","As I've discussed, we believe we are much more effective against our primary competitor for several reasons, including significant improvements in our solutions in recent years, predictable delivery capabilities, lower cost of ownership, ability to deliver value and our population health and open platform capabilities. In addition, we believe the heightened awareness of our primary competitor's higher cost of ownership, lack of system openness and limited population health capabilities have contributed to us being more effective against them.","Looking ahead, our pipeline for new business continues to grow and other leading indicators such as reference activities are at all-time highs. With one major installed base facing a sunsetting of their solution and another with over three fourths of their base on legacy platforms, we expect the replacement market to remain strong over the next two to three years. Our view of the replacement market and overall opportunity to grow our business was also validated at HIMSS. This year we interfaced with clients and prospects representing over $8 billion of pipeline, which is an increase of 40% compared to last year. The EHR replacement market continued to be a large part of these conversations, but we also had a high volume of discussions with existing and new clients about other solutions and services such as Revenue Cycle, ambulatory, population health and our Works businesses.","Another highlight of the quarter was the strength of our Revenue Cycle business. As Michael discussed, we continue to have a very high percent of new clients include Revenue Cycle with their EHR purchase and more of our existing clients, including some of our largest, choosing to move to Cerner Revenue Cycle.","Moving to the ambulatory market, where we had a very good Q1 with strength in ambulatory EHR, practice management and business office services. This included some of our largest IDN investor-owned clients choosing Cerner's clinical and Revenue Cycle solutions for their ambulatory settings. We also continue to see a high attach rate for ambulatory when Health Services clients are migrating to Millennium. As we look to the rest of the year, there are many more opportunities to sell ambulatory solutions to the practices affiliated with our major health system clients.","In addition, we're starting to see more opportunities at large standalone practices where some of the best-of-breed suppliers continue to falter. We also had a strong quarter in the small hospital market and our cloud-based CommunityWorks offering. Bookings from CommunityWorks were a record for a first quarter and it included a combination of standalone opportunities and Health Services migrations.","Now I'd like to provide a quick update on the Department of Defense project. HIMSS proved to be a great opportunity to highlight the progress made by the Leidos Partnership for Defense Health. We had a completely full house for all showings of a demonstration that highlighted the functionality of the DoD's model system including some military-specific workflows, first-responder applications, mass vaccinations and theater synchronizations. We remain on track for pilot sites to go live late this year.","Moving to Health Services, we continue to have success at migrating Health Services clients to Millennium and remain ahead of our original expectations for migrations. Operationally and financially, we remain on track with the objectives we established when we did the acquisition. As I said before, we are pleased with how Cerner and Health Services teams have come together and I'm impressed with how quickly Health Services associates have been able to add value in key areas of our business.","Outside of the US, we had a solid quarter, but most non-US markets continue to grow slower than our US businesses. In Q1, our global revenue grew 6%, driven largely by the extra month of Health Services, compared to Q1 of 2015. Longer term, we remain positive on our global growth opportunity and believe this business will pick up as global economies strengthen. In addition, we believe global markets represent a significant opportunity for population health solutions and our recently announced population health contract with Wirral Health Partners in the UK is a good example.","On that note, I will now discuss our overall population health business. The HealtheIntent platform is increasingly becoming a differentiator when we compete for new EHR business and also represents a major business opportunity inside and outside our installed base. In Q1, most of our new footprints included population health solutions and I believe our population health capabilities are contributing to our increased success against our primary competitor. In addition, the pipeline of our existing clients looking at HealtheIntent remains strong.","As I've discussed, health systems are increasingly being asked to live in two worlds, a future state driven by reimbursement models aligned to risk and quality outcomes, and a current state where fee-for-service is still the predominant model. We believe HealtheIntent can help our clients compete more effectively on quality and efficiency in today's environment, and also prepare them to more actively engage and manage populations in the future state. As a result, it is proving to be very attractive, even to clients who aren't going directly at risk today.","Additionally, the shift away from traditional fee-for-service is gaining momentum. Most of you are already aware of the plan CMS laid out last year to shift 50% of Medicare payments to value-based payment models by the end of 2018 and tie most of their remaining traditional fee-for-service payments to quality measures. More recently, CMS announced the Comprehensive Primary Care Plus model, which is yet another push towards more fee-for-value payment models","that directly incent proactive population health management. There are other reimbursement programs targeted at areas like joint replacement and chronic care management that are contributing to the demand for our population health solutions.","In summary, there is a significant amount of change occurring in healthcare, and this change is creating meaningful opportunity for Cerner. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike.","Michael R. Nill - Cerner Corp.","Thanks, Zane. Good afternoon, everyone. I want to start by building on some of Zane's comments on HealtheIntent by providing some perspective about its scope and scale. We began building HealtheIntent platform in 2012. In September of 2013, we made on time delivery of HealtheRegistries, the first solution on the platform. We've rapidly expanded the number of solutions and data sources connected to HealtheIntent. We now have six core solutions with 10 more planned by the end of the decade, and have connected nearly 300 data sources for more than 80 unique systems, ranging from EHRs to insurance claim feeds, to device data, to open source environmental data.","HealtheIntent has already become a very large platform. It currently has 5.5 petabytes of data, 59 million persons, and it's performing more than 100,000 processing jobs daily across activated clients, giving them access to near real-time data. It's supports the automation of personalized plans for care and programmable intelligence and enables strategic payer and provider network management that is informed by analytics and research.","Like Cerner Millennium, HealtheIntent is a platform that enables a family of solutions. The solutions are complementary to the function of the EHR and device platforms and they have the potential to create a lot of value and the maturity of the platform introduction of solutions are working out well with the timing of the market. We believe HealtheIntent is unmatched in its scope and scale and that it will continue to win out over many of the best-of-breed niche solutions that we compete against today, much like our Millennium platform has proven to be superior in the EHR market.","Moving to Revenue Cycle, as Zane indicated, we had a very strong quarter. We had record bookings driven by a high attach rate of Revenue Cycle in new EHR business and existing EHR clients choosing to add revenue cycle. In addition, we had good contributions from RevWorks Extended Business Office services, which are shorter engagements than full Rev Cycle for things like staff augmentation, business office management, transition services and other targeted projects.","One highlight during the quarter was Universal Health Services, one of the largest hospital management companies in the nation, selecting Cerner's Millennium Revenue Cycle solutions. Combined with their existing Cerner clinical solutions, this will create a clinically-driven revenue cycle system, which we believe is the best approach in the way almost all health systems are looking to go.","Our Revenue Cycle pipeline is very strong with more IDNs and investor-owned clients expected to move to our Revenue Cycle solutions. In addition, Revenue Cycle is part of almost every new client opportunity and our pipeline for new clients is also very strong as Zane discussed. In summary, our investments and execution in the Revenue Cycle space have led to much stronger competitiveness, contributed meaningfully to our growth and created a substantial pipeline of opportunities going forward.","To close, I'd like to comment on the recent increase in headlines related to IT security in healthcare. We take security very seriously and invest heavily in protecting information in our systems. This has resulted in a good track record of protection for our clients' data. This increase in industry issues has related to security, and recognition by our clients that we have a strong competency in security and it's contributing to increased opportunities for a remote hosting business.","In addition, we believe the industry focus on security could increase opportunities for ITWorks relationships as our clients look for health and securing information beyond their Cerner solutions. With that, I'd like to turn the call over for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And our first question comes from the line of Eric Percher with Barclays. Your line is now open.","Eric Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you. Marc, I appreciate your comment about service and software being indicative of the long-term trend. As you think through your forecast for the year, could you walk us through some of maybe the, what is most predictable versus where you have the most variability. Obviously you're calling for long-term or ITWorks deals this year, but can you kind of line up which areas are most predictable and whether, and how you feel about that service and software going forward?","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Sure. I mean we started the year talking about the fact that that our backlog had a significant amount of 2016 revenue in it, that 79% of the revenue for the year was going to be coming out of backlog. And actually based on what we saw in the first quarter, that backlog is generating the revenue that we've expected, and as you know through last year services was as issue that we were dealing with. This year services is on track. We've added a lot of people to that organization last year, all revenue producing the associates, and I think they are delivering. They are generating their backlog and they are delivering that backlog as we expected.","The thing that hit us this quarter is that 21% that is going to come from current quarter bookings. And most of those feed into the system sales line on the income statement. So when you look at the system sales line, the growth there was pretty low and primarily driven through lower hardware, and as we kind of go through, we think for the year and the remaining quarters, we think hardware will kind of bounce back to the levels that we expected.","But we were clearly short in Q1. The business is out there. We certainly as we forecasted saw deals, some of which kind of moved out and will help us achieve our targets in Q2, Q4 on the hardware side. But I think relative to our highly visible revenue, all of those elements of the business are really hitting on all cylinders at this point.","I think it's important to know when you kind of look at our revenue growth too, really it's helpful, and I know it's harder because with HS now becoming more and more part of our overall revenue, and we're not really even able to break out separately. But I think if you look at kind of revenue growth for Q1, and if you take out basically, look at Q4 of HS revenue, which is in the $240 million, $245 million range, really Q1 was about a 10% overall revenue growth.","And I think that's more indicative of the organic growth of the company, assuming that HS, Health Services, basically stays kind of flat on a revenue basis and it was similar to what Q4 was. I think you're going to see Q2 to be growth in the 12% organic range. And you'll see that continuing to increase, helping drive our overall growth for the year in the 13% revenue range. So I'm not excited that we didn't hit our revenue guidance this quarter, but the fact that it was related to hardware, which is a little bit harder to forecast, comes in and out in the same quarter, doesn't concern me relative to the rest of my business.","Eric Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Right. And with respect to those long-term bookings you're indicating for the year, is that a requirement of meeting the Q2 bookings target or can you get there even if those are not until later in the year?","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Yeah. I mean right now our expectations is that the Works business is really kind of our second half phenomenon more than Q2. We expect to start getting back to more than 24% of our bookings coming from long-term, but it's not going to get up to 37%. We think it will start recovering to be more in the 30% to 32% range that we've seen, but it doesn't have to do anything heroic. It just has to be more the normal course. And we knew coming into Q1 that we really weren't set up with any large Works deals, and that's why we previewed it with everyone.","Eric Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you for that detail.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Sure.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Steve Halper with FBR. Your line is now open.","Steve P. Halper - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","So, just to get into the revenue shortfall, what sort of hardware revenue didn't materialize as expected? And over the years, it's been pretty difficult for you to forecast that number. This is not the first time it's happened. So why is that?","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Well, because it tends to be a replacement right Steve. So, it's not something, there is no bridge on fire, no building that's burning that they have to replace immediately. So we had of the shortfall, the $15 million to $20 million that was kind of a shortfall for hardware, a good chunk of that was large clients who host themselves that were going to do large-scale replacements of computers, so hardware.","Another component of it was slightly lower device resale, but that was actually a smaller component. A lot of it was large hardware deals that likely will happen later in the year, but those clients for whatever reason pushed off renewing, updating their infrastructure for some period of time. It is something that they have flexibility on. Those machines continue to work, so that's why it's a little bit harder to tie down the exact period it's going to be.","As you saw in our guidance for next quarter, I mean we took the bottom end of our guidance down $25 million to make sure that we meet our guidance range for revenue next quarter. And a lot of that was just to say, if hardware is going to be harder to forecast using our traditional approach to doing that, which is about the only way that we can really do it, we're going to bake that in until we see that hardware start recovering. Certainly, I expect it as we move through the year to get back on track and deliver the quarterly numbers that we projected and planned. But Q1 was short and I don't know that we end up making that up during the year.","Steve P. Halper - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Right. And as you think about the hardware delays, over the course of time is there anything that you've been able to read into a customer when they push off a hardware upgrade or is it simply just like you said, nothing is on fire here, and they can put that off?","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","Yeah, Steve this is Zane. There is nothing to read into those particular pieces. They're typically not tied to large new business transactions, not tied to significant upgrades in the solutions and additional solutions they're buying. They're typically purchased on a different cycle. So they are kind of, they run their own, they kind of run their own process, et cetera. So I just don't think there is anything to read into the rest of the elements.","Steve P. Halper - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of David Larsen with Leerink Partners. Your line is now open.","David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC","Hi. Can you please talk a bit about the patient accounting solution within Millennium. Roughly how many customers do you have on that product? What sort of investments have been made into it? And what are your thoughts around Soarian's patient accounting solution? Could that potentially be the go-forward strategy in some cases? Thanks.","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","David, this is Zane. We have hundreds of Millennium patient accounting clients on the acute side and thousands on the ambulatory side, and so lots of progress over the years in that side. It is a significant investment for Cerner in terms of where we're putting research and development as we continue to develop what we're doing, both acute ambulatory and across the entire continuum of care. So Revenue Cycle is a big focus for us. Soarian is a go-forward strategy, but it's only as it relates to standalone business. It is actually something that was, Soarian was architected to be a standalone patient accounting solution. About 25% of the market still looks for standalone patient accounting solutions. Soarian is doing financials is very strong, very solid. We'll continue to develop that out for that marketplace, but in an integrated basis Millennium patient accounting, Millennium Clinicals are the go-forward strategy on a integrated basis.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Yeah, and this is Marc. I think it's important to note that almost probably every deal we sold in the last 12 months that's been new for EMR and EHR has had Millennium Revenue Cycle included in it, because people want that enterprise view. Our Millennium only works with our Millennium Clinicals, but our expectation is over time, all of our clients will eventually go to that enterprise system. When you look, when relative to the numbers that Zane had, they're pretty accurate, hundreds of hospitals, thousands of clinics. It's a contemporary solution in a time when there aren't that many of them that are contemporary and it's enterprise, so it's the two things the market's looking for.","David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay. And then, Marc, I think if I heard you correctly, organic growth in the quarter was 10% for revenue?","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Yeah. Once again, we don't have a precise number for Health Services to give you, but basically if you kind of factor in the $240 million, $245 million that was in Q4 for Health Services and roll that for, assume that was the same amount in Q1, the Cerner revenue component of Q1 grew about 10%.","David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks very much.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Sure.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Dave Francis with RBC Capital. Your line is now open.","Dave Francis - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi, good afternoon, guys. Keeping on the theme of Revenue Cycle, can you talk a little bit from a macro perspective, what's going on in the marketplace that is driving this focus on Revenue Cycle for you guys? What's changed from or what you have done internally from a product and solution offering perspective to become more competitive on that front? And talk a little bit about what happened with the Universal Health solution to kind of drive their decision to unify the solution on your platform?","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","Sure. This is Zane. So from a new business perspective, I'm going to cut, Dave; I'm going to take your multi-part question in parts. So from a what's driving the marketplace, overall marketplace trends, from a new business perspective, most everyone wants an integrated clinical and financial system together. And as you think about a go-forward strategy to prepare for bundled payments, to prepare for really the at-risk models, all the things that are occurring, people are looking for those integrated clinicals and financials. And that's frankly the same thing that's driving the marketplace trend in our own installed base, is those organizations want to get prepared for the future and have that sound foundational revenue cycle solutions that matches their clinical systems from an integrated perspective.","So that's one of the marketplace elements. Additionally, you have a number of bases that are being sunsetted. So there's, obviously there's one large installed base being sunsetted. We've got another installed base that's on a legacy solution and has to be migrated and brought to a current platform. And so, those are driving a lot of the kind of the macro-level marketplace trends. And it's pretty logical, as you think we're in a post ICD-10 era, that there was some pent-up demand for Revenue Cycle in that side. So I think there is kind of those elements as it relates to that.","From our perspective, we've invested significantly over the last several years in Revenue Cycle from a solution and services point of view, and being able to have that demonstration of that functionality live in our clients has been very beneficial for us. And that, as we continue to drive across the other continuum of care and our vision of one bill across the continuum of care, I think that is a strong vision that clients are looking for and as they think in the future that that will work towards that.","I think the UHS conversation is really, there's \u2013 they've been a long-term Health Services client. They've been long-term, on the financial side, they've been a long-term Cerner client on the clinical side. And so putting those together in that same construct of having strong foundational solutions from an integrated perspective, acute and ambulatory as they move forward is important to their clinical integration strategy. And so \u2013 and then they also have some expertise from a billing perspective that we really like working with those folks and that's a big positive for our teams as well, because we've done a lot of work on the services and process side. So, I feel really good about where we are and the progress we're making and the trend line and trajectory for Rev Cycle.","Dave Francis - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of George Hill with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah, good afternoon, guys, and thanks for taking the questions. I guess, Zane, I'll start with do you guys see anything in any of the kind of numerous CMS demonstration projects that are expected to roll out over the next year or two I guess that particularly excites or worries you as it relates to the market opportunity, if any of these were to be adopted more broadly?","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","We're really excited about, the at-risk piece just drives the need for more population health solutions. And take that buzzword out, you just need to have access to the data of that person and that patient, no matter where they are in the continuum of care, and you got to have mechanisms to be able to track it moving forward.","The more need for data liquidity across the continuum of care, the more need for a solution like HealtheIntent. And so almost every single one of the initiatives has a big value there. There is also a number of state-driven initiatives, so whether it's New York DSRIP program, you look at Kansas, a number of Medicaid initiatives. We see a big demand in markets where we haven't participated in the past, where we see great opportunities for us to participate. So I think the state and local governments will be additional areas of focus for us and you'll see future announcements in both, in those areas and opening up Cerner into more customer where we haven't participated in the past.","So all of those are big drivers for IT and for both core foundational EMRs, because you have to have the solid strong foundational plumbing to succeed in the future world. And then you've got to have the tools to be able to track the information no matter where they are, whether it's a Cerner EMR or whether it's claims data, or whether it's PBM data, all those types, whether it's federal databases themselves. All that needs to come together into a way which people can track the information, no matter where the person goes, and really enhance the ability to manage risk in a better way. So, all of this makes me feel really good about the future.","George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. And, Marc, just kind of a quick follow-up for you is as it relates to the R&D line, I thought we were expecting to see a big step-up in Q1 as there was a bunch of capitalized R&D that was going to flow through that line in Q1. I guess have we not started to amortize the capitalized portion yet? I guess is there a product that we haven't gone live with yet or is it showing up at another line item?","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Well, I think you did see a step-up in Q1, but I think our capped rate also was a little bit higher because we're working on a lot of new stuff. So the capitalization rate was slightly higher in the quarter as well. So, I think the net-net effect was that you saw a slight year-over-year increase in the R&D spend. So the amortization that upticked was offset a little bit by a little bit higher capitalization.","George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Yeah. I guess I just should have said versus my model. Okay. All right. Thank you very much.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Yes.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Mohan Naidu with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.","Mohan Naidu - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thanks for taking my questions. Marc, maybe a quick one on the tech resale. In the last few years, we've seen a decline in the mix of tech resale revenues as the overall revenues. If you look at your internal models, how much are you still baking in for 2016?","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","For revenue from basically tech resale which is primarily hardware...","Mohan Naidu - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Right.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","And also the resale of other third-party software. I mean, relative to our total number, it's \u2013 I mean 5%, 6% of revenue. It's a fairly small number. I think if you look at our slides that we provided at HIMSS, tech resale was probably $330 million in total. So I think if that gives you a sense, we don't expect that to grow. But in our world that $330 million is just \u2013 is ripe for the taking because we have those client relationships. We know who to go to, and we know when they're looking to go acquire that. While we don't make a whole lot of money on the hardware so that one doesn't hit the revenue, it doesn't really have much of bottom-line impact. Selling that, the solutions and third-party software has more margin.","So the reality is in this quarter, when we were actually below tech resale revenue, we hit our margin number, because of the margin we were driving out of the third-party software and the higher margins that comes with. So, but it's not a growing part of our business, but we expect it to kind of continue to drive out at least that kind of level of revenue. And since it's, for us, the dollars that we get from the people that work on that small team probably are the highest dollars we drive out of any associate in the company. So it's worth the effort that we spend on it. It's not going to be a material driver of the business and that's one reason why being short that number in Q1 is not very concerning to me.","Mohan Naidu - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. That's fair enough. And maybe, Zane, for you, on the small hospital you said you saw a record number of deals in Q1. What's really happening in that marketplace? I thought there was a slowdown in the market in the last year, year and a half. Now it seems to be that that market seems to be picking up, back up again?","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","Yeah. Our experience has been that market has been very, very strong for the past couple years and then continues to, our outlook for that is very good, so the activity levels are very high. And so there is a few things going on there. It all comes back to all healthcare, no matter if it's big or small deserves a highly robust clinical foundational system by which that to do business. And so those smaller organizations need very robust systems to operate in this environment. They need the same types of systems that the largest organizations need. And what you're seeing there is there's a lack of capabilities by some of the smaller providers to provide that type of deep clinical skills and functionality. So as we look forward, we continue to see that being a very good market. It was obviously a record for our CommunityWorks business and as we look through the rest of the year, we anticipate it to be very, very strong.","Mohan Naidu - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","All right. You don't do Revenue Cycle in that market yet?","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","We do. Actually it is a full Revenue Cycle and ERP and clinicals.","Mohan Naidu - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay, got it. Thank you.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","One of the strengths for us in that market is we offer a heck of a solution and capabilities because of our CommunityWorks approach to hosting the technology that allows those level of institutions to be able to afford it. And when you compare us to what the other people that are in that marketplace for the most part, we are so much better on the technology side, I think that helps drive our success.","Mohan Naidu - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","All right. Thanks a lot, Marc and Zane.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Sean Wieland with Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open.","Sean W. Wieland - Piper Jaffray & Co","Thank you very much. So you talked about a higher attachment rate of Revenue Cycle, pop health and ambulatory. Can you give us a sense of how much of a lift you get on a deal size relative to a standalone clinicals deal when you do those attachments?","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","We talked about the attachment principally around the Health Services side, but you're absolutely right. The attachment belongs also in the new business side for ambulatory and pop health and Rev Cycle. You'll see percent, particularly if there is ambulatory involved you're talking about a 30% uplift when you see the full spectrum of those. Often what happens in the initial new business activities is it's the population health is kind of a small starter kit. So it'll allow us to build upon that over the long run.","Sean W. Wieland - Piper Jaffray & Co","Okay. And you had two large services contracts that were delayed from Q4, if I remember right. Were either of those in the Q1 bookings?","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","They were not. Our expectation coming in, and I think maybe some of our conversation was that we had one deal that it will happen later in the quarter. We had a partial or component of another one that did hit Q1, but not at the size that was originally contemplated. We expect that to be more and certainly once again no material ITWorks deals in the quarter.","Sean W. Wieland - Piper Jaffray & Co","Okay. And then the expected growth in the Works deals you said in the back half of the year. Are those leaning towards RevWorks or ITWorks?","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Right now ITWorks is the bigger population. As you'll recall, we kind of slowed down on the RevWorks side relative to letting ICD-10 play out, focusing on Adventist and really working to make that a premier place to show our skills. So I think that right now, ITWorks is primarily the thing that's showing up on the list, and I think it's even some of the stuff that Mike talked about relative just to our capabilities, our ability to do security. All the things that we experienced and have worked for here are things and skills outside of just running your health information platform that our clients are looking for. So they're looking to extend their capabilities by having us do that activity.","Sean W. Wieland - Piper Jaffray & Co","All right. That's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Jamie Stockton with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Jamie J. Stockton - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just a follow-up on what George was asking earlier on pop health. I think, Mike said that you've got six core solutions that you're out there with today and there are 10 that are kind of on the horizon between now and the end of the decade. A couple of things, could you talk about with the typical deal that you're singing today, how many of those six solutions are they taking up front? And then maybe as a follow-up to that, is there something within those incremental 10 that you've got on the horizon that you're working on from a development standpoint, where you say, man, once we get that out of the door, that will really be a positive catalyst for our effort in this area? Thanks.","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","Sure. This is Zane. Typically in a new business situation, there will be two small, well I'll say almost pilot-like population health elements. And we can grow with, even in those two segments, because they'll be for a smaller portion of their population, They may say, gosh, I've got a shared savings plan. I've got something I'm actually actively managing a population. It's a small population, I want to see that. But often it's thing such as registries, so just kind of even having the diabetic registry. So there will be small elements which gets the framework in place, which is really important for us, because it creates that framework up front which allows us to add on at a lower cost as we move forward and really scale out.","And so often what you will see is, these kind of small pilots and small starters with one or two solutions and then growing forward. Our existing clients are taking more of the solutions that are generally available, but very similar to this. They are taking a more practical approach to whatever lives that they have at risk or conditions that they want to manage and creating a framework to grow that over time. So we can grow exponentially, both within the solution set itself, because we'll add more population to that, as well as we'll add more capabilities and functionality which creates additional sales opportunities for us.","And so for me, it's I'm just anxious to really have an opportunity to provide that full scale, enterprise-wide solution set which is our vision and what many of our clients are purchasing. And really it'll take a lot of the noise out from some of these small niche pop health players that are out there.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","This is Marc. I think if I was going to pick, care management is kind of something that I think is really critical. When we have a niche company make an inroad into one of our clients, we're out there with it, but we need to refine our content. We need to improve that. We need to make that world class. When we hit that, that to me is a little bit of a tipping point of that's really population health. And so I think you do that. You add to the registry, data analytics, the warehouse capabilities that we've already delivered. And we are already in a market out there. We have those solutions out there, but I think we're continuing to develop that to be able to be the lead solution that really helps turn the tide on increasing the population that sits today. Because right now as Zane said, it's usually a smaller population, which from a booking purpose means it's a smaller booking for us.","Jamie J. Stockton - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Marc, if care management is one of the areas that you feel like is going to be a tipping point, is it just going to be in a technology-focused way or do you feel like the health systems are really looking for someone that they can lean on to also provide that care manager on an outsourced basis?","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","This is Zane. There's clearly large service opportunities associated with population health and there is an opportunity to go provide additional services similar to what we've done in other parts of our business to help clients scale. And I think the interesting part is I think there will be \u2013 I think many of us think of population health at some of these large organizations. I think you even think about some really small organizations, they can actually get their hands around that smaller population and really understand the full continuum of care and really can go after it in a different way. There's going to be lot of the clients that actually also need a lot of help with the services and the care management. So you absolutely point out a great point that that's going to be there.","Jamie J. Stockton - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","And the next question comes from the line of Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thanks for the questions. Actually, just wanted to stick with population health and I guess, first say congrats on the Centra deal. I thought it was interesting that in the Centra announcement, it mentioned HealtheIntent would not only be used as the major pop health platform or tool for the health system, but also for their health plan. I was wondering if maybe you could just walk through specifically what you will be providing on the health plan side. And then from a economic or business model standpoint, how does this deal compare to prior or other HealtheIntent contracts that you've signed?","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","Well, this is Zane. I'm not going to comment on the specifics of the Centra economics, but Centra is a fine organization and they have a number of \u2013 there a fully clinical integrated model in Central Virginia that has a health plan and they are actively seeking taking on risk in their geography and they put a model together to do that. And what we're doing at the plan was really helping them get access to all the data that they need, no matter where it is, and they will take the full capabilities of HealtheIntent over time as we deliver them.","So they're absolutely an organization that has bought into the vision of the enterprise-wide scale. And so, we will deliver additional capabilities, which will help at both, at not just the IDN level but really at the plan level to help them manage that risk in a better way. And I think they're doing in a smart intelligent way, which is swim towards the risk and take the first dollar coverage and that's what we're helping them do. And so they purchased what we had generally available with their commitment to us over the long term is to roll out things as we release them.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Thanks so much.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Garen Sarafian with Citigroup. Your line is now open.","Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. First a clarification question. On the wider than normal revenue guidance range where Marc, you said it was broader by about $25 million on the low end, I believe. So was that solely due to the unpredictability in system sales and for no other reason? Did I understand that right?","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Yes. Yeah. I mean basically it's hardware and the rest of our business, I was very comfortable with us being where we'd kind of projected and where our range would have landed at a midpoint. But given this quarter, and given how those deals are now moving around a little bit from a timing perspective, I thought it was prudent to go ahead and lower the bottom end of the range for \u2013 just to take into account hardware potential differences from our projections.","Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Got it, useful. And then my follow-up is after UHS, which I thought was a strategically significant win, since some of the feedback that we've received just from the community, is just seeing more data points on scale implementation of your Millennium Rev Cycle solution. So I'm wondering how long does is it take for a large client for you to be able to sell that, sell this or help this win sell other clients? And has it happened? I think it was about like a month ago, so maybe did this directly lead to additional sales you wouldn't have gotten otherwise? Or if there is any additional color there, would be helpful.","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","This is Zane. I think it's continued momentum, positive momentum on the Revenue Cycle side. So, we've had a number of clients that have made a number of very large IDNs that have actually, that have made a Cerner Revenue Cycle decision. I think you look at the UHS decision as, especially when you add the investor-owned side, that adds to the IASIS footprint. I think you look forward to some other announcements in the investor-owned segment around Revenue Cycle. I think that's a strong statement about how solid the solution set is. And so, all of those help, and the ability to have those come online and be fully referenceable, it makes it even better.","Our work at Intermountain has been very strong; Via Christi has been very good. So those types of references have helped the Revenue Cycle side out, and the more that we add to that, the more it will lend itself to the credibility side of what we're doing around Rev Cycle. So all of those ideas are incremental positive. I think it's a strong statement from the investor-owned side, the number of clients that are signing on.","Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Why don't we take one more question.","Operator","Okay. And our next question comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah. Hi, good evening. Couple of questions. First of all, you might have addressed it and I missed it. But when I look at the trend report, 24% of the contract dollars are from long-term contracts and this is kind of like I think the lowest I've seen. So just kind of like what's driving it?","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Yeah. Ricky, this is Marc. We kind of previewed coming into this quarter that we didn't expect to see ITWorks deals of any size and that's what happened. So a lot of those long-term larger deals are what drives the long-term bookings and makes that kind of usually a kind of the low 30s percent. When you compare that with the 37% we had in the year ago quarter, which was heavy on some of the long-term, it was you really kind of have a significant mix difference. So that's the primary reason we didn't have those long-term bookings.","When you take out the long-term component for the year-ago quarter and this quarter, you actually saw about 18% growth in non-long-term bookings. So and that's more reflective of kind of the overall business. We do expect those ITWorks deals to start hitting the bookings as we kind of move through the year. But Q1, we knew was going to be a little bit light, and that's why we previewed our bookings was going to be relatively flat was our estimate, but that we will grow bookings obviously as we go through the year, which our Q2, the 10% growth at the midpoint reflects.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And then when we talk about replacement opportunity, obviously 36% of clients, new clients and that's \u2013 we've been kind of like this kind of like trending up in the last two years. You talk about kind of like a pipeline, right, of $8 billion. But what is the typical value of a replacement client? Because I'm assuming that the typical replacement client value now is probably smaller than what it was kind of like as a greenfield four or five years ago. So, can you just give us kind of like a sense of what goes into that $8 billion opportunity?","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","This is Zane. So the $8 billion was specifically reflecting the pipeline we touched at HIMSS. Our pipeline is significantly larger than that. We don't disclose that number, other than to say that it's continued to grow. So as we've harvested the pipeline, we've actually continued to grow that pipeline. But the $8 billion is specific to the HIMSS element. The mix of business in there is highly dependent on the size of the organization that signs. And so which has been, there has been a blend of that. There is the large regional players are very active in the market. The investor-owned segment has been very active. And so kind of across the different segments. And I think you just have to look at the gross numbers given the pipeline is growing, the business activity is very, very strong.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","And I think, this is Marc, I think as you see the number of large deals we signed, those are good, continue to have good numbers there. A replacement deal means they're going to buy everything. So that makes it a bigger deal. They're going to buy Rev Cycle. They're going to buy all the clinicals. They're going to buy probably lab. They're going to buy almost everything they got something of in their organization. Whether it's from a single supplier or not, they're going to have to buy all that. So those transactions actually tend to be pretty large relative to those organizations. So, once again, varies by size of the organization and end users and number of facilities, but it's why the replacement market is very attractive for us.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And then one last one on pop health. I know, Marc, you mentioned that the booking value could be smaller just because of the modular component, kind of like you start with care management. But what's the average length of the pop health deals?","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","To date, most of them have been kind of pilots. So they might be three to five years in length. So it's once again usually a single, one or two of the solutions for a pilot period. So, a little bit different than we expect the long-term approach to that to be. But that's why they really haven't had an impact on our bookings to date.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. Okay. Thank you.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","All right. Well, I want thank everyone for being on the call. We see our Q1 results as a solid start to the year. Our pipeline continues to reflect significant market opportunity, and we are continuing to invest heavily in the innovation of solutions and services that will create future value for our clients. So with that, I'll bid you good day. Thanks so much.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes today's program. You may now disconnect.

Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Thank you, Carmen. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the call. I'll start with a review of our numbers; John Peterzalek, our Chief Client Officer, will follow me with results highlights and marketplace observations; and then Brent Shafer, our Chairman and CEO, will provide closing comments.","Turning to our results, we had a solid Q3 with all key metrics within our guidance ranges. Revenue was at the low end of our guidance range primarily due to lower-than-expected software and technology resale which was largely offset by reduced expenses. The Q3 lower level of software is expected to also impact Q4, leaving our earnings outlook for Q4 below consensus estimates. I would note that our full year outlook remains within our previously provided full year guidance range.","Our bookings in Q3 were $1.588 billion, which reflects a 43% increase over $1.111 billion in Q3 of 2017. Q3 of last year was our lowest bookings quarter, so it was an easy comparable, but our year-to-date bookings growth of 19% is also strong. We ended the quarter with a revenue backlog of $14.7 billion, which is down from $14.79 billion in Q2.","Recall that beginning in 2018, our backlog calculation under the new revenue standard excludes revenue potentially impacted by contract termination clauses. Most government contracts have standard termination clauses. And as I mentioned before, some of our long-term contracts also have them. In our experience, clients rarely exercise this option. So this doesn't change our total long-term revenue opportunity; it just reduces the calculation of backlog.","Moving to revenue which was $1.34 billion in Q3. This is up 5% over Q3 of 2017 and, as I mentioned, at the lower end of our guidance range due to a lower-than-anticipated level of licensed software and technology resale.","I'll now go through the business model detail and year-over-year growth compared to Q3 of 2017. Licensed software revenue was $140 million, down 3% primarily due to lower-than-forecasted licensed software bookings in the quarter. This is in part due to the lower level of predictability related to fewer regulatory deadlines as we have discussed in the past. Technology resale increased 6% to $60 million, but was below our forecast.","Subscriptions revenue was $79 million in Q3 of 2018, down from $123 million in Q3 of 2017. As we have discussed, subscriptions were impacted by our adoption of the new revenue standard which reduced subscription backlog and led to us classifying a portion of subscription revenue as support. Professional services revenue grew 14% to $257 million, driven largely by growth in our Works businesses.","Managed services increased 15% to $302 million, driven by strong year-to-date bookings. Support and maintenance was up 5% to $278 million, reflecting our expected low single-digit growth plus the previously discussed impact of the new revenue standard. And finally, reimbursed travel was $24 million which is flat year-over-year.","Looking at revenue by geographic segment, domestic revenue was up 5% from the year-ago quarter at $1.188 billion and non-U.S. revenue of $152 million increased 7% from the year-ago quarter. Moving to gross margin, our gross margin for Q3 was 82.8%, which is up from 82.5% in Q2 of 2018 and down from 84.1% a year ago.","Now I'll discuss spending, operating margin and net earnings. For these items, we provide both GAAP and adjusted or non-GAAP results. The adjusted results exclude share-based compensation expense, share-based compensation permanent tax items, acquisition-related adjustments and other adjustments all is detailed and reconciled to GAAP in our earnings release.","Looking at operating spending, our third quarter GAAP operating expenses of $903 million were up 9% compared to $825 million in the year-ago period. Adjusted operating expenses were up 9% compared to Q3 of 2017. Looking at the line items, sales and client service expense increased 9% over Q3 of 2017. This increase was primarily driven by an increase in personnel expense related to our services business.","Sales and client service was down 4% compared to Q2 of 2018. This was driven largely by lower variable compensation related to the lower software in Q3 and our slightly lowered outlook for the year. Software development expense increased 12%, driven by 5% increase in gross R&D, a 20% increase in amortization, and slightly lower capitalized software. G&A expense was up 10% and amortization of acquisition-related intangibles decreased 53% year-over-year.","Moving to operating margins, our GAAP operating margin was 15.5% compared to 19.4% in the year-ago period; and our adjusted operating margin was 19.2%, down from 23.1%. The year-over-year decline in operating margin is consistent with our guidance which reflects items we have discussed, including the higher growth of non-cash expenses, investments in our Works businesses, and our increased mix of Works revenue.","We continue to believe that many of these factors are temporary in nature. We are also continuing work related to our profitable growth imperative that includes looking for ways to operate more efficiently. As we finish this work and finalize our 2019 and long-term plan, we expect to provide an updated view of our margin expansion opportunities.","Moving to net earnings and EPS, our GAAP net earnings in Q3 were $169 million or $0.51 per diluted share compared to $0.52 in Q3 of 2017. Adjusted net earnings in Q3 were $209 million and adjusted diluted EPS was $0.63 compared to $0.61 in Q3 of 2017. Our GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 21%, our non-GAAP tax rate was also 21%, similar to our year-to-date tax rate. Note that for Q4 2018 and next year, we expect our tax rate to be closer to 22%.","Now, move to our balance sheet. We ended Q3 with $814 million of cash and short-term investments, which is down from $886 million in Q2 of 2018, with our free cash flow being offset by our $266 million investment in Lumeris' parent company and $58 million of share repurchases. We currently have $582 million of remaining authorization under our repurchase program.","Moving to debt, our total debt including capital lease obligations was unchanged from last quarter at $441 million. Total receivables ended the quarter at $1.211 billion, up from $1.152 billion in Q2 of 2018. Our Q3 DSO was 82 days which is up from 77 days in Q2 of 2018, 73 days in the year-ago period. The increase in DSO was mostly related to the timing of collecting a small number of large receivable balances. We expect DSO to return to the 70s in Q4.","Operating cash flow for the quarter was $338 million. Q3 capital expenditures were $117 million and capitalized software was $66 million. Free cash flow defined as operating cash flow less capital purchases and capitalized software development costs was $155 million for the quarter. This brings year-to-date free cash flow to $532 million, which is up 9% compared to last year. We continue to expect growth in operating cash flow for the year to more than offset the increase in capital expenditures, leading to another year of strong free cash flow.","Now, I'll go through guidance. We expect revenue in Q4 to be between $1.37 billion and $1.42 billion. The midpoint of this range reflects growth of 6% over Q4 of 2017, and would bring full year 2018 revenue to $5.396 billion, which reflects 5% growth over 2017 and is above the midpoint of our previously provided full year guidance range. We expect Q4 adjusted diluted EPS to be $0.62 to $0.64 per share. The midpoint of this range is 9% higher than Q4 of 2017, and would bring full year 2018 EPS to $2.46 which reflects 3% growth over 2017.","We understand that while this puts us in our guidance range for the year, it is below consensus expectations for the quarter which were aligned with the midpoint of our previously provided full year guidance. The main reason our Q4 guidance is slightly lower is that the lower software bookings in Q3 also impact future quarters and the expense benefits that we had in Q3 that offset the lower software are not expected in Q4.","Moving to bookings guidance, we expect bookings revenue in Q4 of $1.85 billion to $2.05 billion. The midpoint of this range reflects a 16% decrease compared to our record high bookings of $2.329 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017, but it would bring full year 2018 bookings to $6.711 billion which reflects growth of 6% over 2017.","Moving to 2019. Historically, we have provided a preliminary outlook for the next year on our third quarter call. This outlook has always been based on a high level plan since our detailed plan is never finalized until after we have ended the year and completed a bottoms-up plan that includes backlog from our Q4 results and our most current sales forecast. For the past two years, when we finalized our plan and provided guidance on our fourth quarter call, we've had to adjust our outlook. This is not something we like doing, given our focus on delivering against expectations we set.","In addition, the process we are undergoing to create our plan is more involved this year. As you know, Brent has kicked off a series of work streams focused on client experience, innovation and profitable growth; all of which are informing our planning process. Brent is also very focused on us delivering against expectations. I believe the result will be a solid, strategically-focused plan, but we are not at a point to provide a useful preliminary outlook for 2019. We will, as usual, provide 2019 guidance on our Q4 earnings call.","Please don't take this change, from providing a preliminary view on our Q3 call, as a sign that we expect our outlook to be poor. While there are some challenges in the near-term environment that we've discussed, we still believe we can deliver solid revenue and earnings growth next year. We just want our guidance to be based on a more complete plan.","As we mentioned, we're also working on a three-year strategic plan. We expect to use this, combined with our 2019 plan, as a basis for a more detailed discussion on our investor meeting during HIMSS, which we plan to have on the morning of February 13. At that time, we will share more detail on our views and expectations for long-term growth, margin expansion, cash flow and capital allocation.","With that, I'll turn the call over to John.","John T. Peterzalek - Cerner Corp.","Thanks, Marc. Good afternoon, everyone. Today I'll provide comments on my new role and then I'll cover Q3 results and the current marketplace environment. As you know, Zane Burke will be stepping down effective November 2. I'd like to thank Zane for his 22 years of contributions to our clients, the industry, and Cerner. With this transition, I am privileged to assume his responsibilities as Chief Client Officer, which is a new role and a title that reflects our increased emphasis on the success of our clients.","As a 15-year Cerner associate with 30-plus years in the industry, I've spent most of my career working with clients in sales, delivery and the ongoing relationships in health care around the world. As a leadership team, we'll continue to reinforce our client-first philosophy at Cerner. This means we will double down on our efforts to put our clients' success at the center of everything we do and ensure that we consistently deliver value. This is a critical component of maintaining Cerner's growth and success, and I believe this focus will allow us to continue playing a key role in the transformation of health care.","With that, I'll turn to discussing Q3 results. Our results for the quarter were solid with the exception of the lower technology resale and software and its impact on revenue in the quarter and our Q4 earnings outlook. As Marc indicated, we grew our bookings 43% in Q3 and our year-to-date bookings growth is 19%. In Q3, the percent of bookings coming from long-term contracts was in a normal range at 34%, including the addition of an ITWorks client.","We also had a good quarter from a new business standpoint, with 30% of bookings coming from outside our core Millennium installed base. Bookings included broad contributions from large hospitals, community hospitals, and ambulatory venues. In addition, we continue to have good contributions from our key growth areas with Population Health, Revenue Cycle, and ITWorks, all having solid quarters.","Regarding Population Health, I wanted to provide an update on the relationship with Lumeris which we announced last quarter. As you recall, we are launching an EHR-agnostic offering with Lumeris called Maestro Advantage that will be designed to help health systems set up and manage Medicare Advantage plans and provided sponsored health plans. Additionally, Lumeris is adopting HealtheIntent as the platform for its clinical methodology and advanced analytics.","Since we announced our collaboration in July, we have been focused on mobilizing our joint Cerner and Lumeris teams, launching our joint development efforts and kicking off our roadshow activity across a targeted list of prospective clients. We have visited with over a dozen prospective clients that are either evaluating the launch of a Medicare Advantage contract or beginning with an intermediate step of optimizing multi-payer arrangements.","We also touched many of our clients during our Cerner Health Conference. The feedback we received has been very positive. I like to share a few observations from these initial interactions. Our clients are all at different stages of experience with value-based payments. Many have had modest success with upside-only agreements such as an Accountable Care Organization or Medicare Shared Savings Programs. They are now considering expansions into contracts where they can capture a more significant portion of the premium dollar through value they provide through care delivery.","Next, Medicare Advantage has emerged as an attractive opportunity for leading health systems to expand their value-based care programs. Our rapidly-growing senior population, lower churn and higher premiums are all contributing forces that make MA a desirable option.","Finally, our clients have also acknowledged the importance of change management and hiring experienced partners. We believe the combination of technology-enabled services and strong operational expertise that Maestro Advantage brings, makes for a compelling solution. While we're still early in our journey, we are pleased with how our clients have responded and look forward to continuing to update you on our progress.","Next, I'd like to provide an update on our federal business, starting with the Department of Defense MHS GENESIS project. We recently kicked off our broader deployment by beginning implementations at four additional sites. We believe these sites will benefit from the optimization efforts that followed our initial go-lives. Also, it is worth noting that one of our initial sites has already achieved HIMSS Level 6, which is further evidence of the progress made since we went live last year.","Moving to the Department of Veterans Affairs, after signing the contract in Q2, activity continued as expected with three more task orders signing in Q3. These task orders, along with the work that began after the first set of task orders, kept us on track to steadily ramp our work on the project as we finish 2018 and move into 2019. The first major project milestone will be in 2020, when initial sites are scheduled to go-live. Moving to our business outside the U.S., we had another solid quarter with 7% revenue growth. This was driven by good results in the U.K., Sweden, the Middle East, and Canada.","Before turning the call over to Brent, I'd like to provide some comments about the marketplace and how we are looking at our growth potential. As we discussed, we operate in an environment where providers are financially challenged and don't always have a high sense of urgency to make purchase decision due to fewer regulatory deadlines and incentives. However, there is a counterforce in that, in that value-driven solutions do carry a sense of urgency and our solutions and services align with many of the challenges faced by providers to create value. As a result, we believe we have several sources of growth that position us to deliver solid results in this environment.","Our federal business is clearly an important foundation to this growth. With the DoD beginning to ramp and the VA now getting started, we have visibility to solid growth contributions for several years. Execution on these projects will be key, given the importance not only to Cerner, but also to our active and retired service members.","In the HR marketplace, replacement opportunities remain and we continue to do well competing for new business, although many of the opportunities are smaller with less software. Beyond new footprint opportunities, our large existing footprints represent meaningful whitespace for us to cross sell our solutions and services. We continue to believe that Revenue Cycle, ITWorks and Population Health can contribute significantly to our growth.","While Population Health is still in an early stage and has ramped slower than we initially projected, we remain confident we'll become a large contributor to growth in coming years. We believe that HealtheIntent is unmatched in depth and breadth and that our path to adding meaningful services contributions to our Population Health revenue is now defined with our Lumeris collaboration.","Finally, our non-U.S. business continues to grow and it represents an earlier-stage EHR market opportunity than the U.S., as well as an opportunity for nearly all the other solutions and services I've discussed.","In summary, I believe Cerner is well positioned to deliver solid results in the coming years, as we have solutions and tech-enabled services that align with the needs of our end markets. Health care is still in the initial stages of getting value out of the digitization that has occurred over the past decade, and we believe we are in a great position to play a significant role in helping health care stakeholders move towards a more efficient and higher-quality system of care.","With that, I'll turn it over to Brent.","Brent Shafer - Cerner Corp.","Thanks a lot, John. Good afternoon, everyone. John, I think, did a very good job describing the significance of his new role and the marketplace dynamics that we're experiencing. John's perspective has been instrumental in our leadership team's analysis of the complex health care environment we're in and the development of strategies for more closely aligning with our clients and increasing our responsiveness to their needs.","As a result, operational and client-facing teams are becoming joined at the hip. This feels good internally and we believe this is the difference our clients will notice as we move into 2019. I also wanted to take a moment and thank John and congratulate him on this well-deserved recognition for the new role he's been playing. I'd also like to echo John's thank you to Zane for his distinguished service to Cerner over the years.","Now, I'd like to share more detail on our client-centric focus. As you know, we recently hosted thousands of clients at our annual Cerner Health Conference. During my presentation, I made several commitments to our clients that define our framework for delivering value in this era. These commitments are an expression of the strategic planning work I've referenced in prior calls, and I'd like to touch on them briefly today.","The first commitment is that we will relentlessly advance our clients' success. This commitment is the frame for every other decision we make. There's a real focus on disciplined execution. If we obsessively focus on making our clients successful, we can't go wrong.","Our next commitment is to imagine, design and implement intelligent health networks. Health care delivery organizations are facing tremendous challenges in their environment from primary care shortages, to demographic-driven differences, to shifts in policy and payment methods. The provision of care is increasingly moving out of high acuity settings and into the community. Lower acuity prevention and intervention strategies are becoming critically important to payers and consumers.","And for our clients, it's all about the network they can build within their ZIP codes to reach people where they are and deliver meaningful care and prevention strategies. We see a big strategic opportunity in helping our clients build networks that can be activated to improve care across the full continuum, and we believe our HealtheIntent platform and our Lumeris collaboration will be key enablers of the strategy and commitment.","The third commitment is to make better health care experiences and outcomes our duty. We see an opportunity to focus on improving health care experiences and outcomes, both for the patients and consumers seeking a healthier life and for the providers who are overwhelmed by a new world of evidence-based compliance.","The fourth and final commitment is that we will become the partner of choice for health care innovation. Our experience over multiple decades in building intelligent digital platforms make Cerner a natural home for powerful innovation and partnerships. We love to build things and we're not going to stop. But the open era ahead is also full of opportunities to partner with clients and companies, to create even more value by working together.","Ultimately, as we execute on these commitments and deliver value for our clients, I expected to fuel a transformation for Cerner. We're creating an operating model that's designed to support innovation at scale, which we believe will lead to ongoing value creation for our clients and will be central to us delivering profitable growth and creating shareholder value.","And I'd like to turn it over to the operator for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question comes from Steven Valiquette with Barclays.","Steve J. Valiquette - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. Just quickly, so you're not providing guidance today for 2019; we all know that now obviously. But you did previously talk about a focus on margin expansion for 2019, and that is still part of a meaningful part of the investment thesis for some investors for next year. So I guess, I'm just curious to see if you're able to at least confirm that margin expansion is still part of your focus for the company in 2019. Thanks.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Yeah. This is Marc. I mean, clearly we talked about margin expansion as part of our focus beyond 2019 as well. I think as we look at kind of the numbers that are out there, particularly the consensus number that's out there, I think if you apply an operating margin to get to that model, you're probably looking at well over 100 basis points of margin expansion which is way beyond the 30 to 60 points that we thought (00:26:28) kind of what is in our purview for an annual growth level.","Once again, I want to be careful about talking about 2019 until we get a much better view, but we clearly expect to continue expanding margins. I talked about us being able to grow revenue and grow earnings next year and that we would see solid growth for the company. But I think it certainly is part of our plan. We've got a lot of strategic growth in front of us. We want to be able to find that growth. We'd like to take existing spend and go fund that new opportunities, and I think that's going to be a part of our focus as we land 2019.","Certainly, 2019 continues to have the headwind of significant increase in non-cash expenses. And so, those are \u2013 while they're not increasing as much as they did in 2018, they still are going to grow up in 2019. So I think that's something that we're going to factor into our plan as well. But once again, the 30 to 60 basis points we've talked about is certainly our overall goal, and where we can fit into that range as we look into 2019, we'll be able to share with you once we land our plan.","Steve J. Valiquette - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah. Hi. Good afternoon. Just going back to your prepared remarks where you talk about the replacement opportunity where you see some smaller opportunities, can you talk a little bit about what has changed this year that impact your views on the replacement market? And also if you can just give us some more color on the bookings this quarter? What came from kind of like new clients and new opportunities versus expansion of long-term contracts? Thank you.","John T. Peterzalek - Cerner Corp.","Ricky, thanks for the question. This is John. I can talk about the replacement market in general, and Marc can share if he wants to share on the bookings side. But I'm not sure anything's changed on the replacement market. And we're seeing that replacement market is an active market. My comment about smaller deals, I would view more to new business opportunities that we have and haven't (00:28:50) necessarily made a selection or are making a selection or transition to a new platform.","So the replacement market is still active and strong. And as I've mentioned in my comments, the new business market remains strong as well. The only difference is, in new business they tend to be smaller entities which come with smaller bookings and smaller software, which we discussed. But I feel very good about both the replacement market and the new business market in the U.S.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Yeah. Ricky, this is Marc. I think our percent from new was similar to what we've seen is around 30%, which is kind of consistent with what we've seen. I would echo John's comments that really the market continues to be the market we've seen coming into the year. It's an active market, some of the opportunities are smaller, but it's a market that our pipeline would indicate is going to continue into 2019.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","And some of your competitors are struggling this year. Are you seeing more RFP activities as a result of that?","John T. Peterzalek - Cerner Corp.","I would say, back to \u2013 I see a very consistent level of RFPs and in the spaces where the RFPs come out, which we've crossed a little over in that conversation into outside of the U.S., where the procurement is largely RFP based, but all procurements generally have some component of RFP. But I don't see a change in the volume and we are working every day very diligently to respond to RFPs; we don't have a lack of volume there.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Ross Muken with Evercore ISI.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","Hey, guys. So maybe, what in your mind would it take for there to be a return to sort of growth in the licensed software line sort of above the corporate average, which would obviously help in terms of your margin expansion goal? Because it seems like a lot of the revenue growth this year is coming from some of your lower margin segments, and so that's obviously hard to offset on the expense line. So just give us the picture of that transition of what gets that growth rate back if we're not seeing a big change in sort of the replacement market.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Yeah. This is Marc. We continue to see opportunities on that replacement market side. But from a licensed perspective, clearly we've kind of indicated that the government opportunities we have, as those task orders get signed, some of those tax orders will include chunks of software. So, that certainly is \u2013 maybe something that not everybody's fully considering as far as an opportunity in a market that is beyond the replacement market. It's kind of a brand new market, if you will.","So, the software opportunities on the federal side and government side are pretty significant. When you combine that with the replacement market side we see and selling back into our base of new innovations we create, we think that gives us a pretty good runway to get us to where our HealtheIntent platform is starting to kick off more of the SaaS business and more of our licenses recurring business that hits the top line with the higher margin. So I think probably \u2013 when you asked the question, I think the government business may be the one that is not getting the full view as far as the impact it can have relative to software.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","And just two other quick things. So one, Marc, can you give us what the ASC 605 revenue growth is for the year or what we've seen so far just so we know apples to apples? And then secondarily, on the balance sheet, the free cash flow obviously is coming in a bit. You don't have a lot of leverage, I guess, how are you thinking after Lumeris just about capital allocation into kind of next year and prioritizing repurchases versus tuck-in M&A?","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Yeah. I mean, relative to ASC 605, I don't know that I have that number right off the top of my head to tell you what that impact is for the year. I think it'll be \u2013 we've disclosed that on a quarterly basis in the Q. I would also kind of indicate that, when you look at the disclosures that are in the Q relative to ASC 605 versus ASC 606, the new revenue standard, you have to take into account that that basically takes whatever new contracts get signed, looks at the specific language in those contracts and then applies the old rules and the new rules.","In the ASC 606 era, our contracts are different. There's flexibility in that era that we're taking advantage of, that our clients appreciate. That doesn't change the revenue recognition that is appropriate. And so, we apply those contract terms. ASC 605; one of the issues with ASC 605 was, you could have $0.01 in a contract that could result in making the revenue deferred for an indefinite amount of time. So when you see a comparison between ASC 605 and ASC 606, we could have continued contracting under our old methodology and our old terms and there wouldn't be any difference in new contracts between ASC 605 and ASC 606 or there would be a very small difference.","So, I think trying to focus on ASC 605 to ASC 606 at least as far as the disclosures that are required, isn't a very valuable exercise. It's a little bit like trying to look at the current backlog that we have under ASC 606 versus ASC 605. There is a lot of contracts, as we mentioned in my prepared comments, that have cancellation clauses in them, don't get triggered. But they're in there; and since they're in there, they don't get included in backlog. And that's hundreds of millions of dollars of revenue in the next 12 months that's not sitting in our backlog today.","So, once again trying to look at the backlog number and get a good sense of what's going to happen to the company is difficult. Overall, we're still going to drive out in a 12-month period over 80% of our revenue out of backlog. Trying to figure that out from looking at the ASC 606 backlog number, will be a little bit challenging.","I think from a capital allocation standpoint, we'll visit this more deeply when we do our HIMSS presentation. But I think it's pretty consistent with what you've seen us recently talk about is, we continue to want to do share buybacks, certainly to offset dilution and potentially at a slightly higher level than that. I think our Lumeris is a great example of us leveraging the balance sheet for an opportunity to make an investment that we think gets us to a future growth opportunity more quickly than we'd be able to do it on our own. I think that's going to be something you'll see us incorporate as part of our going forward capital allocation strategy. But more to come on that when we talk to you guys in February.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from George Hill with RBC.","George Hill - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Good afternoon, guys, and thanks for taking the call. I guess, Marc, kind of on the Q3 bleeding into Q4 software weakness, I guess how long should we expect that to drag on under the new accounting standard? Like how long does the short \u2013 I guess, does the weakness in the short-term software bookings and software revenue recognition, how long \u2013 what is the duration of that weakness that we should expect to see in the income statement?","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Well, I think you've got \u2013 to the extent that some of that license gets deferred, it obviously doesn't hit the current quarter, but it will hit future quarters. So it actually will, at some point, benefit a future period more than it would if the revenue would come in sooner. For Q3, some of the issue was just lower software sales. So, that doesn't get made up from an accounting standpoint or from a rollout standpoint; that gets made up by going and taking those transactions that are still in the pipeline and getting them to get across the line and drive in that software sale and, therefore, the software revenue from it.","So, the key point we were making relative to Q4 and lower Q3 bookings is, under ASC 606 there is a bigger percentage of the revenue that is not recognized currently in the quarter. More of that gets pushed out to later quarters and to some \u2013 so if that number is lower in Q3, the amount that gets pushed out to Q4 is also lower and impacts us. And then obviously on the spend side, there was benefits in Q3 that we got because of our \u2013 from the incentive comp side and adjusting for the lower full year outlook that won't be repeated in Q4.","George Hill - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And maybe a quick kind of follow up for John. I guess, how do we think about \u2013 there's the couple of pending rules with the government right now on interoperability and data blocking. I guess, if they go through particularly the data blocking one, how do we think about which kind of subsegments get advantaged or disadvantaged by these regulatory changes?","And I think about things like the interface business that I know has historically been like a lucrative small submarket for Cerner. I guess, maybe just talk about maybe the interface segment of the business. Is that something that you see is at risk, given proposed regulatory changes and just whatever's happening there?","John T. Peterzalek - Cerner Corp.","My first reaction would be not really at risk, because interoperability and interfacing are kind of two different things. And we've been on record many times as saying that we view the interoperability as a right. That data blocking or not being interoperable is \u2013 cannot be; they have to be interoperable and sharing data between the entities and we'll continue to do that.","So to answer your first part of your question, I think we're really strong if those legislations come through and they will. There will be more interoperability regulations coming, whether it's now or later. I think we're really well positioned at \u2013 frankly, have been leaders around interoperability. But I think what we do on the interfaces is different and there'll always be a need for interfaces between systems and technical systems and those type of things. So I don't see that as a huge threat.","George Hill - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. I appreciate the color. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Matthew Gillmor with Robert Baird.","Matthew D. Gillmor - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hey, thanks for the question. I wanted to come back to the software bookings for the quarter and you've mentioned that as one of the main drivers to the lower margins for the back half. But can you tell us what solution categories were softer or were there specific deals that slipped, that'll come back? Or do you think it was just more of the lack of regulatory pressure that's making it less predictable?","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","This is Marc. Clearly, from a regulatory timeline perspective, yeah, there isn't anything that's forcing clients to go get deals done. And I think that \u2013 Q3 traditionally has been a lower software quarter and I think we saw that more this quarter than we might have had in prior years. So I think that's the impact. As John said, the market's still active. There's still software out there to go get. We just didn't get much of it in Q3. Certainly, we expect to get some more software on Q4, which is usually our indication (00:40:46) our history to do that, but it's not going to offset some of the Q3 shortfall.","Matthew D. Gillmor - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. And then maybe asking about the VA contribution to revenue and how that hits, like based on the task orders it seems like there's maybe $500 million of bookings so far from the first task orders. Can you give us any sense for how that flows into revenue? Is that a multiyear thing or will we see the bulk of it in 2018 and 2019?","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Yeah, the way the revenue flows in from those contracts varies. Primarily, it's percent of completion for the most part. A lot of it is services oriented. So, that flows in basically as the work gets done. So some of those task orders can be longer term, some of them are relatively shorter term. So, it'll vary with the task order.","I mean, our practices \u2013 we're not going to refer to a specific client and provide revenue numbers that come from that specific client. So to the extent that you've got a sense of what the bookings are and kind of what the total opportunity is, that probably flow out. It could be anywhere from 12 to 24 months depending on what the specific task order is looking at.","The government yearly contracts and \u2013 while the overall opportunity is $10 billion, the task order is usually contracted for in shorter period chunks that can be somewhere in that time period. But it will vary by task order, so by trying to broadly apply a certain timeframe to a certain bookings number, is going to be a little problematic to pick a quarter of what the revenue contribution is.","We kind of talked about, over time we expect somewhere in the 2022 timeframe that continue being successful in that area that we could have task orders that would derive $1 billion of annual revenue. But the path up there is not going to necessarily be linear. So there'll be \u2013 especially at the start when you do a lot of preliminary work at some of your initial sites that there is good work, but it's limited to a few sites; and therefore, not spread across many sites which would drive a higher level of revenue. So, that's \u2013 hopefully that gives you a little bit of color, but we're not going to give you precise numbers to any of our clients' contribution to our revenue.","Matthew D. Gillmor - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from David Larsen with Leerink.","David Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC","Hi. Can you talk a little bit more about Population Health management and your deal with Lumeris? When can you increase your PMPM rate and when can you start providing deeper services? Because it seems to me like that's really the future of where healthcare IT is moving. Thanks.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Sure, David. This is Marc. I'll just take a shot at the Lumeris, certainly, we absolutely believe it is an area of Population Health, kind of combines value-based care and all the elements that are hitting health care today that we think is a huge opportunity for us. As we said, the last quarter the actual financial impact on us is going to be fairly limited early on, because most of the work that's going to be done is initial work with clients, maybe doing some surveys and doing some initial consulting work, as they look to see if they are ready to set up plans.","And by the time a client or a provider decides that they're going to set up a plan, you probably \u2013 year and a half, two years down the road, they're going to set up the plan, they're going to have an initial group of members, that membership will then grow. So as we said, it's probably a three, four-year timeframe before you're going to see anything meaningful being contributed financially by that business.","But during that time, we're spending a lot of time talking to our clients, prospecting, making sure they understand what we're going to have available, and then working with Lumeris on leveraging the HealtheIntent platform to be the platform that basically empowers M&A efforts. So all is part of our plan, but it's not a quick impact on the financial statement. This is an investment in the future that we think will pay off handsomely once it gets to fruition.","David Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay. And then, in three or four years what could your PMPM collect rate be, $15, $20 any sense for that?","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Yeah. David, we talked a little bit about the fact that just selling tools is probably a $3 to $4 type PMPM. But if we can add in a set of services from a technology, care management, other areas that we think are things that we could provide from a service that leverages the technology. Once again, we don't like to get into the service business that doesn't leverage technology, that the potential to get to somewhere around $15-plus PMPM is certainly very reasonable. And that's \u2013 given your other $3 to $4 PMPM being able to deliver something that's four to five times from that same membership base, is very attractive.","David Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC","Thanks very much.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Jamie Stockton with Wells Fargo.","Jamie Stockton - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good evening. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess maybe just on the software revenue during the quarter and bookings, can you give us any more color on the type of software that maybe you saw a little softness in? Was it clinical? You've made a couple of comments about there aren't necessarily regulatory drivers right now, or was it on the Revenue Cycle side? Maybe were there not mega deals in the quarter \u2013 this quarter maybe like you saw last quarter? Just any color there would be great.","John T. Peterzalek - Cerner Corp.","This is John, and I think if you look at our software mix itself, there isn't one thing. I think it was purely a volume thing that \u2013 we still sell across all of our software components, whether they are clinical or outside of the clinical or those types of things, anything that carry software. There wasn't a particular weakness in any area and it was just an issue of not as many larger things coming through.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Yeah. Jamie, once again, this is pretty \u2013 is an area where things are going to be lumpy. And Q3 is traditionally where the lumpiness usually hits and getting deals done is more challenging. And there isn't usually the incentive from a fiscal year's perspective on the client that gets something accomplished.","So I think as much as anything, as I look at the tea leaves at the end, that's kind of what hit us. There wasn't any lack of desire on any of the solutions we offer, and I think our pipeline definitely shows the activity in it that would indicate there is a lot of interest in people coming to market and looking to go buy software.","John T. Peterzalek - Cerner Corp.","Yeah. And if you look at our software pipeline, the software pipeline is broad. And so, frankly, I'm optimistic about whether to keep working on the software side. We have a lot of innovations available, we create new innovations, literally, every day; and our pipeline shows there is a demand for it.","Jamie Stockton - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. That's great. Just maybe one other question on the bookings outlook for Q4. I know it's down year-over-year, but you had a very difficult comp. It's still a very high number on an absolute basis. I think last quarter you guys said that you had a number of ITWorks deals that were in the pipeline. Is that maybe a decent building block for the confidence in the bookings number that you guided for in Q4?","John T. Peterzalek - Cerner Corp.","I think the confidence number in Q4 comes from \u2013 we have a series of relatively large items that we've been working on for quite a while that are come to land (00:49:09) in Q4. So, it's a little bit of the services side. It's a little bit of some larger things that have worked their way through the process that would double land in the quarter. So I think it's just a good strong quarter as we have a lot of times in Q4 as things build up through the year, but nothing in particularly other than some larger items that are coming to rest.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Yeah. Jamie, I think \u2013 as you indicate, while it's down year-over-year, it will be, if we deliver it, the second highest quarter in the history of the company as you intimated. And I think the mix will probably be very similar to what you normally see in a strong quarter. So I don't think there's going to be anything that's driving that number higher or changing the mix and ratio kind of long term and not long term.","Jamie Stockton - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Jeff Garro with William Blair.","Jeff R. Garro - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask about the long-term margin outlook and maybe more specifically progress on ITWorks and RevWorks on the cost side, whether you have any insight into the \u2013 if the profitability of those businesses has grown through this year or been weighed down a little bit by investments? And how we should think about the longer-term margin expansion potential of those businesses with growth and added scale?","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Yeah. This is Marc. We talked earlier in the year about certainly making an investment in our Revenue Cycle, RevWorks outsourcing that we were hiring people in Kansas City to basically kind of jumpstart our local billing office there. I think we're up to almost 500 people in that effort at this point. So, that's going along well. I think we're \u2013 so that clearly was a drag on that business' earnings.","That business margin basically expands as we are able to get those clients to fully utilize both from the clinicians side as well as the billing side, the Cerner software allows them to clinically drive that billing. And I think that is a clear element that's going to, over the long term, allow us to grow margins of that business. So I said, we don't like to be in a services business that isn't going to have a technology impact where we can drive better margins. And I think you'll see that in that business; that business is pretty young. Clearly, we just rebadged all the people and our (00:51:50) largest client and really made a big addition to that workforce in this year. So it is early, it's an investment phase for that.","From an ITWorks standpoint, the services component of that is still in the single-digit margins. But when you combine all of the elements of an ITWorks client which is additional software that gets sold into them, the support, all of the other elements that occur, those clients are 40% margin clients. So, they're already contributing significantly. Our goal there is to continue to grow above the 30-plus we already have today and to be able to centralize those functions and gain that leverage by having a single source of support for a lot of these systems that those clients are running.","So, it's early on. I mean when we talk about margin expansion long term for the opportunity and how you continue \u2013 how do you keep growing margins driving 30, 60 basis points on an annual basis, those things right now are more anchors against that than they are contributing towards it. Ideally in next couple of years, we'll see that start moving where we'll start incrementing up those margins and allowing them to be incrementing up to our total margins. But right now, those are investment phases (00:53:09) to some extent and they eventually will be drivers of our margin growth, but certainly in the out years.","Jeff R. Garro - William Blair & Co. LLC","Great. That's very helpful. And then one more question if I could. I want to ask about HealtheIntent and specifically your progress selling HealtheIntent outside the Millennium base and to non-health system provider clients and just kind of where those efforts fit in your priorities?","John T. Peterzalek - Cerner Corp.","This is John. Actually, it's a large priority to get outside of the volume base as we've mentioned multiple times that the \u2013 one of the \u2013 not only is HealtheIntent obviously strong within our current client base, but by design it's EHR-agnostic, it can work in many different environments.","And I think we've had a reasonable success in going outside of a core Millennium client and it is a high priority to us. It's expansion into an area that's new greenfield for us and \u2013 not only on the provider side, but maybe in what we have is non-traditional clients, on the payer side and those type of things. So, I think it's a very powerful platform to get outside of our current client base and have some opportunities out there.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","And we see it as key certainly in states as well, because I think that's probably one of the \u2013 certainly in the Medicaid area where HealtheIntent can be a valuable tool for states, as they look to manage those fairly diverse populations.","Jeff R. Garro - William Blair & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks for taking the questions.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Stephanie Demko with Citi.","Stephanie J. Demko - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hey, guys. Thank you for taking my questions. Just continue on the thought of expanding outside your current client base and given your large data stores, have you ever looked at some initiatives on data monetization and how that can maybe impact the margin model?","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Yeah. This is Marc. Certainly, data is like the magic elixir that everyone thinks has huge independent value, and there certainly is some truth to that. But I think that it's how you're going to use that data, and in the medical world you have to have the right to use that data. So, we spent a lot of time with our clients preparing them and making them capable to use that data to better manage the health of that patient, to better manage them when they are in an episodic condition within the hospital. That's the key data use. And we certainly have some business relative to de-identify data and using that in a broader context.","But it's still early. We still think there is an opportunity to use that data and create more of a business, but there is a lot of regulatory limitations as to what you can do with medical data today. And so, I think anybody that's talking about medical data and is not paying attention to what those limitations are, can be overstating what some of \u2013 at least near-term opportunities are. I think the opportunity to get past some of those limitations, to get universal consents, that is something that eventually is going to make that data valuable. But today, near-term, that's not a focus that I can see.","Stephanie J. Demko - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Understood. Understood. I want to follow-up on the DoD blast from the past (00:56:41) there. But one of your counterparts on that mentioned this morning that the GENESIS ramp was seeing some elongation this year. Could you talk if you're seeing sort of similar cadence or if this is kind of a one-off vendor-specific issue?","John T. Peterzalek - Cerner Corp.","Was the question that you're seeing some delay on the GENESIS side? I didn't get the whole question (00:56:26).","Stephanie J. Demko - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Leidos has been saying that they're seeing some elongation there (00:56:30) similar or if that is just a one-off?","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","This is Marc. From our standpoint, we've implemented the first four, we've actually been authorized to go to the next four. So, in our view that project is moving along well and is on track. So it may be another supplier-specific issue, but for us the DoD is a great client and they want to move forward quickly and we are moving along.","John T. Peterzalek - Cerner Corp.","Our four live sites are going as planned. They are in the optimization mode as planned and the authorization for four more. We're off and running and should see go-lives there in early 2020, I believe, the date is. So, we believe and we're backing on that that we're making \u2013 we were on target what we've been asked to do and what we committed to do.","Stephanie J. Demko - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","All right. Awesome to hear. Thank you, guys.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Charles Rhyee with Cowen.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC","Yeah. Hey, thanks for taking the question. Hey, I just wanted to maybe clarify something around the VA as well, as well as DoD. If I recall correctly, with DoD, all the software-related bookings went to you and then the rest was sort of divvied up with Leidos being sort of the prime contractor. I know the VA is a little bit more flipped here, but I know you mentioned earlier that (00:57:55) think about licensed software in the future coming from the government side. Are any of those revenues shared with sort of your partners going forward on the VA side, or is that all still coming back to Cerner?","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Yeah. No, that all comes back to Cerner both from the VA, the DoD were a sub, (00:58:15) Leidos is the prime, so all the dollars go to Leidos. And then they contract with us and we receive the value for the license and other components that we are asked to provide there. For the VA, all the revenue flows through us and we then payout our third-party partners. But that means all the software license stays with us as well.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. And have you \u2013 and I can't recall if you have given sort of the splits in terms of what we should expect from you guys to keep in terms of the \u2013 on the VA side. I think you've given some kind of basic parameters, but wondered if you could share anything more there.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Yeah. At this point, it's still early to tell for the long term exactly how much of the work we will perform and how much our partners will perform. I mean, we threw out a 50-50 split at some point just to try to do math, but I think that's still to be determined. We're pretty early in that process. And with the task orders given, a lot of them are initial \u2013 a lot of that work is work we're doing, but some of our partners are doing part of it as well. But once it really cranks up, we're still a little early on deciding exactly what share that we'll perform and what share our partners will perform.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. And just one follow up, you talked about 2022, we could be looking at about $1 billion a year in terms of work. If we were trying to model that out a little bit, should we think of it more as a linear ramp or would you say it's still kind of small next year and even maybe 2020 and then ramps kind of quickly into 2022? Thanks.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Yeah. I think the ramp-up of VA, as we said, is not necessarily going to be linear. It could be a little bit lumpy depending on what work is being done, kind of slower start. And then once it gets up to scale, there's a lot to go do. So you'll have multiple projects going on, so that ramp can be probably more back-end loaded than just front-end loaded.","Why don't we...","Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Yeah.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Why don't we take one more call. Thanks, Charles.","Operator","Thank you. And our last question comes from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks for sneaking me in. Most of the stuff on the quarter has been asked and answered. I guess just if I think back to CHC, Brent, I know you made some comments around reprioritizing some of the R&D initiatives longer term and talking about wanting to focus in on making bigger R&D bets. So just wanted to follow up there and see if maybe you'd be willing to share a little bit more on what areas, in particular, you are excited about funding.","And then just more for clarity, should we think about the reprioritization of R&D over time as an overall lower spend, or is this just kind of a reallocation of where dollars are actually spent in R&D? And thanks so much.","Brent Shafer - Cerner Corp.","Yeah. Thanks for your question, Bob. We are kind of right in the thick of it as we speak. In fact, just had a two-day session with kind of our top 50 leaders today and we've got about eight weeks \u2013 eight to nine weeks of grinding through the details in front of us. But there's kind of two pieces. One is the efficiency of the spend and making clear choices to get maximum return, because given the breadth of our portfolio and the variety of things we touch, one of the concerns is if you put just a little bit on everything, do you really maximize your returns?","And so, it's really looking at making good choices on the areas that have best return; and in many cases, best return in the next couple of years in line with the strategic direction we're starting to outline here. So, we'll certainly share more detail with you as we get through that, but we're in the thick of it right now. But hopefully, (01:02:44)","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Yeah. I would just indicate that relative to total R&D, it's not our expectation to reduce our R&D spend. We have a lot of opportunities. This is a sector and we're in a position where we have \u2013 the issue we have is trying to pick which opportunities we think are going to be the big bets. So, our expectation is continued spending on R&D. But as Brent said, we want to be very thoughtful. If things aren't going to become $100 million businesses then let's refocus what we're spending in that space and put it in things where we think it can go to that size.","So with that, I thank everybody for the questions and I turn it over to Brent for closing.","Brent Shafer - Cerner Corp.","Yeah. Maybe just a couple comments. One, I think is significant given that what we announced at CHC, but we saw bipartisan legislation passed today on opioids which is amazing in and of itself to see bipartisan legislation. But it was signed today, and for those of you that follow CHC, we announced an opioid toolkit. And that is really about improved state database access and predictive analytics for high-risk patients and advanced clinical decision support for opioid prescribing. And we know how deep and broad this crisis is and how much it's impacting the country. So, we really think that's a great example of how technology can be leveraged to help providers with a real need in our country.","And I appreciate your time today, and I want just to reinforce that we're very focused on setting attainable expectations and then delivering on them. And we remain absolutely focused on significant long-term opportunities that are in front of us. I mentioned I had the opportunity to spend two full days with our, basically top 50 leaders in the business. And coming out of that really looking at some of our opportunities is just really encouraging about where we're positioned and the opportunities ahead. And we think we have a real significant opportunity to play a meaningful role in the transformation of health care.","And I think, for us at Cerner, recognizing that as we look at our portfolio and our investment plans, just some transformation of our own that we need to do to make sure we're positioned well for the opportunities in front of us \u2013 and that's what we've been referring to. And I mentioned it briefly, but part of that work is creating an operating model that is really designed to support innovation at scale, as we are at scale now and want to continue to scale. So having a consistent approach to that as we continue to grow is real important. And that's all about delivering ongoing value creation to our clients and will be very central to us, delivering profitable growth and creating shareholder value.","So thanks very much for joining us and have a great evening.","Operator","And with that, ladies and gentlemen, we thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes the program, and you may all disconnect. Have a wonderful day."],"4956":["Cerner (NASDAQ:CERN) Q4 2013 Earnings Call February  4, 2014  4:30 PM ET","Executives","Marc G.

Naughton","Thank you, Breanna. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the call. I'll lead off today with a review of the numbers. Zane Burke, our President, will follow me with the results highlights and marketplace trends. Neal Patterson, our Chairman and CEO, will be available during Q&A. Mike Nill, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, and Jeff Townsend, Executive Vice President and Chief of Staff, are at client events, but look forward to catching up with you at our Investment Community Meeting on February 25.","Now I will turn to our results. We delivered very good results in the fourth quarter and for the full year 2013. Our total bookings revenue in Q4 was $1.11 billion, which is an all-time high and reflects 9% growth over our previous record results in Q4 of '12. Bookings margin in Q4 was $975 million or 88% of total bookings. For the full year, bookings revenue was $3.77 billion, up 20% over 2012. Our bookings performance drove a 23% increase in total backlog to $8.91 billion. Contract revenue backlog of $8.13 billion is 24% higher than a year ago. Support revenue backlog of $786 million is up 6% year-over-year.","Revenue in the quarter was $795 million, which was up 12% over Q4 of '12. The revenue composition for Q4 was $246 million in system sales, $170 million in support and maintenance, $361 million in services and $18 million in reimbursed travel.","For the full year, revenue grew 9% to $2.91 billion over a tough comparable in 2012 when revenue grew 21%.","System sales revenue reflects a 2% drop from Q4 of '12, which had grown 14% over the prior year, and a 6% decrease for the full year of 2013 due to continued declines in technology resale revenue.","Q4 system sales margin dollars, however, still grew 13% over the year-ago period and full-year system sales margin dollars grew 15%, reflecting continued strong levels of high-margin system sales components like software and subscriptions. We are now through our toughest comparable periods for technology resale and we expect it to return to growth in 2014.","Moving to services. Total services revenue was up 24%, compared to Q4 of '12, and 21% for the full year, with strong growth in managed services and professional services and continued increasing contributions from ITWorks and RevWorks. Support and maintenance revenue increased 11% over Q4 of '12 and 10% for the full year.","Looking at revenue by geographic segment, domestic revenue increased 12% for the quarter and 9% for the full year. Global revenue was up 8% for the quarter and 11% for the full year.","As a preview to the annual update of our detailed business model that we'll provide at our Investment Community Meeting on February 25, I'd like to provide you with the total revenue and growth by business model for the full year 2013.","Licensed software grew 12% to $388 million; technology resale was down 33% to $263 million, but as previously discussed, this decline had a little impact on our gross margin dollars; subscriptions and transactions increased 19% to $197 million; professional services revenue grew 24% to $851 million; managed services increased 15% to $479 million; support and maintenance was up 10% to $662 million; and reimbursed travel was $70 million, which is up 27%.","Moving to gross margin. Our gross margin for Q4 was 82.1%, which is up from 78.4% in Q4 of '12, reflecting record software levels and a lower mix of technology resale. For the full year, gross margin was 82.3%, which is up 510 basis points compared to 77.2% in 2012, also reflecting record software and lower technology resale. Gross margin dollar growth for the year was 16%, which compares to revenue growth of 9%, with the difference in growth rates reflecting the decline in low margin technology resale. With the toughest comparable periods for technology resale behind us, we expect the gross margin fluctuation to moderate as the technology resale resumes contributing to revenue growth. This should also result in our revenue gross margin dollar growth rates being more aligned.","Looking at operating spending. Our fourth quarter operating expenses were $450 million before share-based compensation expense and the settlement charge. This is a year-over-year increase of 16%, which is below the 17% growth of our gross margin dollars, reflecting ongoing leverage. For the full year, operating expenses before share-based compensation expense and the settlement charge were up 15% to $1.66 billion. This compares to gross margin dollar growth for the year of 16%.","Sales and client service expenses increased 16%, compared to Q4 of '12, and 15% for the full year, driven by an increase in revenue-generating associates in our services businesses.","Our investment in software development was up 17%, compared to Q4 of '12, and 12% for the full year. As previously discussed, the growth in software development is due to increased focus on investing in growth initiatives, and we expect this growth to moderate later this year.","G&A expense increased 17%, compared to Q4 of '12, and 24% for the full year, driven by increased personnel expense related to our strong growth and a higher amortization expense related to recent acquisitions and acquired intangibles. We expect growth in G&A expense to be more in line with overall growth in 2014.","Moving to operating margins. Our operating margin in Q4 was 25.6% before share-based compensation expense and the settlement charge, and was up 160 basis points compared to Q4 of '12. For the full year, operating margins increased 220 basis points to 25.1%. This was driven by a combination of ongoing operating efficiencies, the decline in lower margin technology revenue and strength in software. Going forward, our plan reflects continued margin expansion, albeit at lower levels than 2013, since we expect technology resale to resume growing. We expect approximately 100 basis points of margin expansion, with higher or lower levels possible depending on mix. As in the past, we will focus on delivering predictable levels of gross margin and earnings growth, which has not materially impacted if we have fluctuations in technology resale.","Moving to net earnings and EPS. Our GAAP net earnings in Q4 were $60 million or $0.17 per diluted share. GAAP net earnings include share-based compensation expense, which had an impact on earnings of $9 million or $0.03 per diluted share and the settlement charge, which had a net impact of $68 million or $0.19.","Adjusted net earnings were $137 million and adjusted EPS was $0.39, which is up 16% compared to Q4 of '12. For the year, adjusted net earnings were $497 million and adjusted EPS was $1.41, which is up 18% from 2012.","The Q4 tax rate for adjusted net earnings was 34%, which is in line with our expected effective tax rate. For 2014, we expect our effective tax rate to remain within 50 to 100 basis points of 34%.","Now I'll move to our balance sheet. We ended Q4 with $1.43 billion of total cash and investments, compared to $1.5 billion in Q3. Total cash and investments include $879 million of cash and short-term investments and $555 million of highly rated corporate and government bonds with maturities less than 2 years. Our total debt, including capital lease obligations, is $166 million. Total receivables ended the quarter at $583 million, which is up $54 million from Q3 and driven by strong sales in the quarter. Our DSO in Q4 was 67 days, which is similar to Q3 DSO of 66 days and down from 74 days in Q4 of '12. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $141 million. Q4 capital expenditures were $134 million and capitalized software was $49 million. Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures and capitalized software, was negative $42 million for the quarter due to the settlement charge, as well as continued higher capital expenditures, which included a $43 million land purchase that was announced during Q4.","For the full year, operating cash flow decreased 2% to $696 million, primarily due to the settlement charge. Free cash flow for the year was $168 million, with capital expenditures of $353 million and capitalized software of $175 million. Free cash flow is lower than 2012 due to higher capital investments tied to our cloud infrastructure, higher spending on land and facilities to support our growth, higher capitalized software related to investment in our growth initiatives and the settlement charge.","Looking at capitalized software, the $49 million of capitalized software in Q4 represents 42% of $116 million of total investment in development activities. Software amortization for the quarter was $25 million, resulting in a net capitalization of $23 million or 20% of our total R&D investment.","For 2014, we expect stronger free cash flow, driven by growth in operating cash flow, a decline in capital expenditures and flat-to-slightly-higher capitalized software. For capital expenditures, we expect them to average $65 million to $70 million per quarter, versus nearly $90 million in 2013.","For capitalized software, we expect it to be in the mid-$40 million range throughout the year, which will lead to being flat or slightly higher than 2013. This reflects a reduction in the use of third-party developers, which we slightly offset by an increase in our own developers.","I'd also like to note that we announced in December that our Board of Directors approved another stock repurchase program, authorizing the repurchase of up to 217 million of common stock. Like our last repurchase program, this one is targeted at offsetting dilution from options.","Now I'll go through Q1 and full-year 2014 guidance. For Q1, we expect revenue between $770 million and $810 million, with the midpoint reflecting growth of 16% over Q1 of '13. For the full year, we expect revenue between $3.2 billion and $3.4 billion, reflecting 13% growth at the midpoint. We expect Q1 adjusted EPS before share-based compensation expense to be $0.36 to $0.37 per share, with the midpoint reflecting 11% growth over Q1 '13 reported adjusted EPS and 14% growth when you consider the $0.01 benefit we have from lower taxes in Q1 of '13. This range is slightly lower than the Q1 consensus, which may have factored in growth off the Q1 '13 EPS that included the tax benefit. Consensus for the remaining quarters and the full year is within our full year guidance.","Q1 guidance is based on total spending before share-based compensation expense of approximately $455 million to $465 million. For the full year, we expect adjusted EPS between $1.62 and $1.67, with the midpoint reflecting 17% growth. Our estimate for the impact of share-based compensation expense is approximately $0.03 in Q1 and $0.11 to $0.12 for the full year.","Moving to bookings guidance. We expect bookings revenue in Q1 of $860 million to $930 million, with the midpoint reflecting a 12% growth over our strong Q1 '13 bookings.","In summary, we are pleased with our results in 2013, which was the year in which we were able to deliver good results, while also investing heavily in our future growth. With that, I'll turn the call over to Zane.","Zane M. Burke","Thanks, Marc. Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll provide Q4 and full year result highlights and discuss marketplace trends.","Starting with our results. Our bookings revenue in Q4 of $1.11 billion is an all-time high and reflects 9% growth over Q4 2012, which is our previous all-time high. Our full year bookings of $3.77 billion reflect 20% growth over 2012. This is particularly impressive when you consider we achieved this growth despite the large decline in technology resale.","For the quarter, we had 25 contracts over $5 million, including 16 over $10 million, driven by strength both inside and outside our install base. For the year, we had record level of contracts in both categories, with 101 contracts over $5 million and 57 over $10 million.","The mix of long-term bookings was 29% in the quarter. For the year, 32% of our contracts were long term compared to 31% last year.","Looking at our pipeline. We had a double-digit increase in 2013, even with nearly $4 billion of bookings coming out of it during the year. This positions us well for continued bookings growth.","A major highlight of our quarter and year was our continued success at gaining market share. This is reflected in the 39% of bookings in the quarter and 31% for the whole year, coming from outside our core Millennium install base. For the year, our total bookings outside of our base grew 24% and exceeded $1 billion for the first time.","We continue to have significant opportunities to gain share, as I believe that at least half of the market will evaluate if they are going with the right supplier over the next several years. These decisions are disproportionately going to Cerner and our primary competitor, and we believe our position against them continues to improve. This is apparent with our win rate, which has doubled over the past 3 years.","A major highlight of our competitiveness in 2013 was Intermountain Healthcare selection of Cerner. This selection and several other signature domestic and global wins over our primary competitor in 2013 have been noticed across the industry and are having a positive impact on our positioning. It is clear that investments in physician experience and Revenue Cycle are paying off and allowing our leading capabilities and vision for population health to carry more weight in the selection process. Our modern architecture and commitment to being open is also contributing to our positive momentum.","Now I'll cover some specific areas that contributed to our strong Q4 and full-year results. I'll start with ITWorks, which had a great year, including a new contract in the fourth quarter. Our new ITWorks client is a regional medical center with 2 hospitals that had gone live with over 50 solutions in 2012. The ITWorks alignment will focus on optimizing user experience and shifting routine, predictable work to Cerner Centers in Kansas City to free the client to focus on providing care.","Financial results for ITWorks were excellent in 2013, with both bookings and revenue growing over 40%. With ongoing pressures on our client spending, our offering is very compelling because we help them control spending, while getting more done and achieving a higher level of quality. This is evident in the fact that 100% of our ITWorks clients are reference-able, 100% have attested for Meaningful Use and 80% are HIMSS EMR adoption level 6 or 7. As a result of our value proposition and ongoing pressures on our clients, our pipeline is very strong, and I expect 2014 to be another great year.","Revenue Cycle also had a great year, with revenue growth of almost 50% driven by Revenue Cycle solutions and services and full RevWorks services for both inpatient and outpatient venues. Our execution in Revenue Cycle is evident in progress made at our largest RevWorks client, Adventist Health, who recently reported initial improvements as a result of the implementation, including cash collections at 103% of target, a 5.5% decrease in accounts receivable and a decline in accounts receivable aged over 90 days. These are encouraging signs and further validation of the focus we have put into our Revenue Cycle solutions and services is paying off.","The outlook for our Revenue Cycle business remains positive, as revenue and costs are top of mind for all providers, and the importance of Revenue Cycle being integrated with clinical solutions continued to increase as the industry shifts to at-risk models.","Another factor is health care is the only major sector in our economy that doesn't have a true costing system, and we believe that our work with Intermountain Healthcare to build an activity-based costing system will further our differentiation.","Our Population Health Organization also delivered strong results, with revenue growth of more than 20%, driven by demand for HIE, Enterprise Data Warehouse and Clinical Process Optimization. These solutions are foundational to our broader population health strategy, which we're advancing through the build-out of our cloud-based Healthe Intent platform. Our progress on this front was excellent. We achieved a major milestone last year by releasing our Healthe Intent Smart Registry solution just 7 months from contract signing. Healthe Intent Smart Registry is a cloud-based EMR agnostic solution that provides the capability to stratify patient populations based on risk, conditions and attributed physicians. In addition, the registries enable care managers to quickly determine what key quality measures specific to the designated condition of the patient have been met. Advocate Health went live with this solution in January, and everything is going well. We look forward to providing more details on this in our Investment Community Meeting at HIMSS in Orlando.","Moving to the ambulatory space where we had an outstanding Q4 and record year that included the following highlights: we had over 40% growth in bookings; 18 signature displacements of our key competitors; the signing of our largest ambulatory business office services contract; 5 new global footprints; and a total of more than 16,000 providers signed during the year. Clearly, it was a great year for our ambulatory business and I attribute this to the investments we made in our solutions and the ongoing trend of our clients wanting an integrated inpatient and outpatient solution.","We also had a record year of success with smaller hospitals, adding 20 CommunityWorks clients during the year, bringing our total to 66 clients. We are competing very effectively against the traditional suppliers in the small hospital space, and our recent recognition as best-in-class community HIS validates the strength of our offering and positions us for ongoing success.","Another highlight this year was the success at providing non-Cerner EMR clients solutions and services to help them with future stages of Meaningful Use in their population health strategies. In Q3, we were selected by a mid-sized health system with no existing Cerner Solutions to provide them with Health Information Exchange, Community Patient Index, Patient Portal and Enterprise Master Patient Index solutions to wrap multiple existing non-Cerner inpatient and outpatient solutions. In Q4, the client added our Enterprise Data Warehouse and we expect them to add our new Healthe Intent Smart Registry solution soon.","We also sold HIE to a 600-bed hospital that uses our primary competitor's EMR, as they found that our primary competitor was unable to effectively connect to other systems.","In addition, we sold our iBus connectivity platform to a client that uses our primary competitor's EMR.","These examples are evidence that our strategy of building EMR agnostic solution and device platforms is working and making our addressable market much bigger.","Outside of the U.S., we had a solid quarter and year, with 8% growth in Q4 and 11% growth for the full year. This growth was driven by contributions from the Middle East, Canada, Australia, France and Latin America. Looking at 2014, we have a good outlook for all of these regions, in addition to a strong pipeline in the U.K.","In the Middle East, we have made good progress on our work for the Saudi Ministry of Health and we are in pace for a 500-bed pilot site to be our fastest-ever global go-live. We believe a successful go-live in record time will serve as a major proof point that will help position us for more business in Saudi and the entire region.","Now I'll cover a few more marketplace observations. In the provider space, the focus remains on cost and quality in anticipation of an expected industry shift to an at-risk model that incents keeping people healthy. The financial pressures are coupled with a long list of priorities around Meaningful Use, ICD-10, health care reform and Value-Based Purchasing. Specific areas of focus on our clients' radar in 2014 will be Revenue Cycle, HIE, analytics and patient engagement. Our solution and services are very well-aligned with helping our clients address these immediate needs and their long-term challenges.","Another observation is that industry consolidation is continuing as providers look to attain scale. This is a trend that favors Cerner, as our clients are the most active and, in my opinion, the best-positioned to be successful over the long term. Cerner clients accounted for 61% of the buying activity in 2013, and these acquisitions create more than 100 sites into which we can potentially extend our Cerner footprint. This is more than 4x the number of sites acquired by clients of our primary competitor. Our Q4 bookings included an earlier turn on this trend as one of our large clients purchased solutions and services for hospitals they acquired earlier in the year.","In summary, 2013 was a great year that included strong growth and many records, and we are well-positioned to continue delivering good results in 2014.","With that, I'll turn the call over for questions. Breanna?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Dave Windley with Jefferies.","David H. Windley - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","So I guess I wanted to focus on the Advocate population health platform that you've been working on diligently this year and what parts of that or to what extent do you believe you'll be able to commercialize that to your broader client base as you move into 2014?","Zane M. Burke","Dave, this is Zane, thanks for the question. We feel very good that this solution is ready for the marketplace. And, in fact, we have quite a pipeline built for that as we look into 2014.","David H. Windley - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Care to put a number on that?","Marc G. Naughton","This is Marc. We wouldn't quantify what that is. But clearly, we've already, in '13, sold some of the Smart Registries to, not only Cerner clients, but non-Cerner clients. So the strategy of having an agnostic platform that can go outside of our base is paying off. And I think as Advocate starts generating results from their go-live in January, that the momentum for that solution is going to pick up. Keep in mind, this is just the first of our platform on which we will build a multitude of different solutions, Smart Registry is being one of the first.","David H. Windley - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Sure. Marc, if I could follow-up. On the CapEx, you talked last quarter and again in your prepared remarks today that investments are expected to go down. Can you help us, from a free cash flow standpoint, understand how long that lower level of investment can be sustained? In other words, the investment that you've made in 2013 can support growth for how long, i.e. beyond 2014?","Marc G. Naughton","Well, I think, certainly, the -- we've doubled down in '13 relative to capitalized software and relative to building CapEx and capital expenditures on our cloud platform and other initiatives. I think the building CapEx, obviously, gives us a little bit of time to move forward. So you can look at '14, that's an area that you'll see a much lower number. Keep in mind, in Q4 of '13, we actually acquired a 230-acre track that we will be able to grow as we need to grow additional buildings for -- at a campus that is near our Innovation Campus, but that will be based on the need and timing. Kansas campus comes fully online the end of this month. So that should hold us for a little while. So you won't see us having to put a bunch of money into land or CapEx for buildings. Our capital expenditures for the business will stay relatively flat year-over-year. And, actually, our software, we expect to be relatively flat. So the big benefit will be a significant reduction in the building CapEx to the point where the free cash flow for '14 should be significantly higher. I don't know that I'd go so far to say that it's going to double, but it will be a significant increase over this year just because of the increase in operating cash flow we expect and the decrease in building CapEx. We can expect to continue to be able to ramp-up in '15, with a goal that, as you look at free cash flow as a percent of net income that we can go from this year, which will certainly kind of in the mid-30s to getting between 50% and 60% next year and then 70% in '15, ideally continuing to ramp up to where we bring free cash flow up to the level of net income on an equal basis. And, I think, we'd do that without having to disrupt our growth and continue to invest in things we want to invest in.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Larsen with Leerink.","David Larsen - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Zane, I think you mentioned at one point in your prepared comments that maybe up to 50% of hospitals could be seeking a new solution or, potentially, a new vendor. Can you just maybe give a little more color around that? And then also, congratulations in the community market. I mean, is there a certain pricing mechanism you guys are using? How can these hospitals, these smaller hospitals, afford Cerner?","Zane M. Burke","Sure. I'm going to do the second one first -- second question first around the CommunityWorks model. We've been able to create a model, which scaled down to critical access in small hospitals by essentially delivering in a combined Tenet domain. And it's a prepackaged offering, full-services offering that is off the shelf and gets great robust functionality to a market that typically does not get the kind of robustness that we have. And so our offering is much richer and deeper than those can typically expect in that marketplace and we're able to do that in a manner that's cost-efficient for them and is profitable for us. So that's -- it's been very effective and worked out very well for all of us. As it relates to the market comments, we see that there are a number of clients that continue to look at the marketplace. They may have made decisions in the past that they're looking at in the future having to undo. And that really relates to all the measures and mandates that are coming at them and making sure that they have a platform that will scale to the future changes as they evolve. And I've discussed this on calls for the last several quarters that we see that trend and we see that continuing. As we look forward, we see a number of large opportunities in the pipeline that reflect that type of scenario.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Cherny with ISI Group.","Michael Cherny - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","So I wanted to go back to the comment you guys made. Seems like the last, I don't know, a couple years, the competitive win rate you guys have had versus the other large competitor that you've called out, seems to be going up, seems to be doing better, specifically versus them on a head-to-head basis versus maybe the period before that. As you talk about how the competitive win rate has gone up, what's -- I guess, versus them head-to-head, what have been the key differentiating factors have been? Robustness of population health management tools? Has it been some of the investments you've made in the software development feature functionality? I guess, maybe just to get a bigger sense of why you are beating them more than you did in the past.","Zane M. Burke","Sure. This is Zane. Our investments in physician usability, our focus on fast, easy, smart, as it relates to our physician -- to the physician community, in particular; our focus on Revenue Cycle solutions and having clinically driven Revenue Cycle and having those proof points in the marketplace, are coming together well for us. And then it allows you to get to the dialogue of the future vision pieces around, first off, around the performance improvement that we can drive and deliver value today and we'll work with our clients to drive and deliver that value and then look at their future around managing their -- the population health. And our vision around population health and, frankly, our delivery in a short range of what we've been able to do in that space, as well as the continuum of care and having solutions across all the continuum of care. And there's also a desire for a company that has an open standards-based and transparent approach. And Cerner has clearly differentiated itself as the open, transparent and interoperable company, where our principal competitor is exactly the opposite of that. And there's a definite need for that in the marketplace and a desire for that.","Michael Cherny - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Just one last quicker question. When you talked about the 61% of the M&A that was done over last year involving Cerner customers, is there any way you could frame what the potential opportunity could be from those acquired hospitals if you were to assume that they were all, over time, going to convert? Just give a sense of the magnitude of how big that could potentially be?","Zane M. Burke","I don't have a number detail at this point and I may be providing some additional color at the upcoming conference at HIMSS, but what I can tell you is, given that we're in 17 of the top 30 largest organizations as the principal EMR provider, we have significant opportunity in the white space in a number of acquired spaces, as well as our solutions in white space around, in particular, ambulatory, Revenue Cycle and population health, and so having those footprints are critically important. We may provide some additional color around that at HIMSS.","Marc G. Naughton","Yes. This is Marc. I would just add that even a these acquisitions get made, it will vary as to whether they acquirer decides to quickly replace all of their hospital technology or takes a tack of I want to do the larger hospitals but I'm going to wait for some of the smaller hospitals and do them at a later date. So it doesn't necessarily bring with it a large 12-month activity of new business. But clearly, over time, our expectation is that those clients will eventually move a significant portion of those acquired hospitals over to Cerner, which kind of gives us a nice annuity, if you will, of potential future business.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of George Hill with Deutsche Bank.","George Hill - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I guess, Zane, I'll start with you. If we think about the population health management opportunity, 2 quick questions. Recognizing it is early in the sales cycle, I'll ask, is it -- are population health bookings and is population health business tracking to Cerner's expectations kind of above or below? And Part B of that question is, from a functionality perspective, what hasn't Cerner developed or what don't you have in your bag yet that you'd like to have in the bag?","Zane M. Burke","Well, I'll start, George, with the first part. I would say it's tracking at our expectations. And we've, actually, in addition to Advocate, kicked off 3 other client projects in that area. And so we have to anticipate the uptick to go well as we see more and more proof points in that space. There's a number of areas that you'll see additional features and functions and major modules past the Smart Registry's conversations. So whether it's additional scorecards for payers, whether it's some of the additional Web services that we'll add in that space, some of the quality measurements that we'll be doing, there's a number of things that you'll see us rolling out even -- and then those I mentioned would be in 2014. And there's much -- many, many things to go do in this space. So this is a multiyear rollout for population health.","George Hill - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then maybe a quick follow-up for Marc. Just with respect to 2014, we talked about tech resale. Should we expect tech resale to reaccelerate or just be flat in '14? And I guess any chance you would give us the contribution from Intermountain, the bookings in the quarter?","Marc G. Naughton","The -- addressing your technology resale question, our expectation is now that we've kind of level set and gotten rid of the 2012 bolus, if you will, that we would -- we'd continue to introduce new devices and new connectivity and continue to get uptake on those devices and, especially, the connectivity even in shops that are automated with our biggest competitor. They are buying our iBus and our connectivity engines because they clearly see us as the way to go pull their device infrastructure together, and that capability doesn't exist on the other side. So I think that we would expect it to grow, for tech resale to grow, to kind of grow at a rate that our overall revenue is growing. And based on that overall revenue growth, I think that it shouldn't, therefore, be skewing gross margins, operating margins, either way, because as long as it is growing at the same level, I think that's pretty -- that would be pretty effective. I think on Intermountain, we haven't talked about the bookings level. Obviously, our client contracts are confidential, but I think I've seen the analyst estimates that put it kind of in the 100, 125, 135 range. I think those are reasonable estimates for the base deal. We certainly look forward to doing more things with Intermountain in the future, but I think that's a reasonable -- those are not unreasonable projections.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Halper with FBR.","Steven P. Halper - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Just one housekeeping question. Marc, what's the implied or assumed tax rate for 2014 in the guidance?","Marc G. Naughton","Range is around 34%.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Eric Coldwell with Robert W. Baird.","Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I guess the main thing I'm looking at is with that -- with those comments, are you seeing client purchasing orders picking up or getting client commentary that lends you confidence or is it more just macro what you're seeing with the connectivity engines and iBus and things of that sort of that you mentioned? And then perhaps as a follow-up to that, targeting operating margin expansion around 100% -- 100 basis points, I'm curious what influenced, if any, the RCM HIE analytics and patient engagement focus you talked about for 2014 has on that margin profile, i.e. is that still an investment phase, so it's somewhat margin-dilutive? Or are those lines, in aggregate, similar to the firm averages?","Zane M. Burke","Eric, this is Zane. I will comment on the technology resale, in particular, that you're speaking about around the iBus connectivity and the CareAware. I think what we're saying is that continues -- we think we'll have continued uptick, the pure tech resale, the resale of low-margin devices and hardware we think would be flat to slightly up in that space. So we're seeing continued good activity. We have not seen any issues around any kind of negative elements around that. On the business model side of that, the HIE, the patient engagement and the device -- and, I'm sorry, the Enterprise Data Warehouse, those are fairly high-margin business for us. So that's bundled, typically, in an ASP model, Software-as-a-Service model, all of those types of offerings. And those carry a bundled high-margin rate that includes services, software and hosting as one basic element.","Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Got it. So is there -- perhaps as a follow-on, that's very helpful. With those solutions you just referenced having a high-margin rate, for a margin being up 100 bps, which is still admirable, are there other areas, legacy areas, that perhaps you're seeing less margin expansion than perhaps in the past?","Marc G. Naughton","Eric, this is Marc. I don't know that there's anything, I think, across our business -- we'll certainly, at the HIMSS meeting, investor meeting on February 25, kind of go through and disclose all of the business model that we've briefly touched today and give you a sense of what those margins look like. But we see good trends across all of those, even with the services business, which, obviously, is now a very big business, but is able to, to the extent there is a low-component element of some of the Works businesses, still be able cover that and continue to see growth the overall margins of those businesses. So I think that there's nothing that we're seeing -- the basic, for us is -- the 100 bps is more a target. It certainly, if you look at our guidance, is kind of the answer you would get looking at our guidance. We think there's still opportunity to get synergies and to get efficiencies in the business, but we are going to continue investing in R&D and other things that we're not going to get as much leverage as you might have seen us get in the past. So that's probably the area that in the past you would have seen us getting more leverage. In this time period, we're not getting the leverage from that, we're really getting leverage from growing the business, and that's about 100 bps.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Actually, Marc, just a follow-on. You just mentioned the R&D investments. Obviously, I think we are operating in the assumption that some of the R&D investments moderate in the back half of this year. And, I guess, how should we be thinking about capital allocation if I think about -- you mentioned that the authorization being up again. Just wondering, as we get into the back half of '14, any comment you have around capital allocation will be helpful.","Marc G. Naughton","I mean, relative to '14 and our expectations for the year, we'll look to continue to kind of spend about the same amount on R&D, from a capitalized perspective, as we did in 2013. It will be -- certainly, our plan right now is very close to that. We're going to see a tailing off of some of the third-party components of that as we go through the year and they complete their tasks. But we will also add some associates into that pool to -- for continued long-term development. So that will stay pretty flat. I think, as we look out to '15, you might see a slight reduction in there, but pretty nominal. I mean R&D is our lifeblood. There are a lot of opportunities ahead of us in health care and population health. And given the environment, given the lack of attractive targets from an acquisition standpoint, given that, that's not really our strategy, we're going to invest in the business and the way you're going to see us invest in the business, it's primarily going to be through that line. But it should be remain a fairly constant number, certainly, through '14 with a slight reduction in '15 on the R&D side.","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. Got it. And then I guess just this might be something we'll have to wait for HIMSS for. But just of your core EMR clients, could you give us any sense on the penetration within that base as it relates to RevWorks and maybe ITWorks? And then on the back of that, any kind of run rate you'd be willing to give us as far as what RevWorks and what ITWorks, separately, are generating at this point?","Marc G. Naughton","Well, I think -- this is Marc. The -- given that we have barely double digits in ITWorks and less than double digits in RevWorks, and we certainly have probably 350 places that we could go talk to and, certainly, at least over 200 conversations with people who probably would be interested in these services, not to mention going into the ambulatory business office side, which is a great business that we have made great inroads into. I think there's a lot of white space for us. I think we've talked about getting to a point where we can get a rhythm of certainly doing an ITWorks every quarter, doing a RevWorks every other quarter and then, over time, perhaps getting to a point where we can do 6 to 8 ITWorks a year, with RevWorks coming one a quarter. And I think we certainly see the opportunity out there, the need is out there, there's a -- health care is focused on reducing operating expenses. These Works businesses, over time, will certainly contain those expenses and they all have efficiency targets on how we can -- that we can drive down over -- their operating costs as they move forward. So everything we see would indicate that those -- that our clients are going to want to take up those offerings and we're very happy with where we're at. We would argue that we're ahead of where we thought we would be on ITWorks on launching these types of businesses. And we think that it's just a matter of time before they become somewhat like our hosting business where you have a vast majority of your client base taking it up.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Daniels with William Blair.","Ryan Daniels - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Zane, a quick one for you. One of the numbers that stood out in your commentary was the 39% of bookings in Q4 coming from outside of the core Millennium base. I think that's a record, both percentage and absolute dollars. So hoping you can shine a little more color on what's driving that, if it's truly just competitive replacements, rip and replace, or if it's really more of these EHR overlays that you're talking about with data warehousing and some of the other initiatives like HIEs?","Zane M. Burke","It is absolutely the EHR rip and replace platform.","Ryan Daniels - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And then...","Zane M. Burke","The HIE and some of the other pieces are, on a percentage basis, are fairly nominal at this particular point.","Ryan Daniels - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. And then a lot of discussion on population health, and I am curious if when you look at that market and the opportunities you're seeing today, is it really true greenfield opportunities where they haven't made investments or is it going out there and seeing entities that have invested a lot in these point solutions that have been on the market for a number of years and wanting to do a more integrated or comprehensive solution with you?","Zane M. Burke","Well, I think, Ryan, you've gone to where we'll go to and is going to, which is people are looking at and are beginning to say there were piece parts, much like the old days of the niche markets when people would buy best-of-breed. And so I think there has been a historic best-of-breed for certain functions within organizations but clients are beginning to think or just beginning to think more holistically about what the future looks like in that space. So it's still, I would say, it's still a niche buyer from a buyer perspective. It's still a niche market, but the more progressive clients are beginning to think about what this will evolve to. And so, in some cases, it's a greenfield. And in some cases it's a replacement of some of those niche providers. So it just kind of depends on the maturity level and how far along the organization's journey is on the population health.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sean Wieland with Piper Jaffray.","Sean W. Wieland - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","I'd like to know how the ICD-10 go-live October 1 is factored into your outlook for the year? Do you think it's a headwind or a tailwind? And specifically, when you're in your Revenue Cycle business, when are we so close to that date that hospitals go into lockdown mode and don't want to touch anything?","Zane M. Burke","Well, Sean, I think I would tell you it's probably a no wind at this point, it's neither a headwind or a tailwind at this point. It's really -- while I think it's going to be a significant event from an execution perspective from our clients, which we've been preparing our clients for, for the last year plus to get ready, and I do think there will be a lot of execution work. It does not appear to be having any impact on our clients' buying cycles and is not reflecting itself in any of our forecast or pipelines at this point. We do see a fair amount of activity in the Revenue Cycle space as clients begin to look past the ICD-10 cutover and begin to think about their futures and what they need to go do in that space. So I would say it's beginning to be almost be back -- it will be back to normal, if you will. So whatever -- if there was a headwind, it was buried in the last time period and we wouldn't really see that as a result -- in our results. I would look at it and say, \"That has -- really, is beginning to remove itself as clients begin to think past that in their strategic planning and begin to plan for the future.\"","Marc G. Naughton","This is Marc. It's not unusual for our clients to have projects in front of them, and especially on the Rev Cycle side, after ICD-10 is highlighting their current state of solutions in that space. And for them to start on the next track of, okay, what's -- when I get through ICD-10 cutover, I need to go in and do something on my Rev Cycle solutions. So I'm actually going to get into a buying mode, currently, as opposed to waiting until my projects are done. Most of the people we are dealing within the C suiters, that's just work to go do for them. Sure, it's work, it's very hard work and our clients are going to be very focused on it. We don't underestimate the impact. But from a purchasing side, we've been querying our teams and our sales executives, do they see anything that where ICD-10 is interfering in any of their ongoing pipeline discussions, and the answer was, no. Because we have the same question, is that going to impact 2014? And at this point, we don't see any impact.","Sean W. Wieland - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","An unrelated follow-up. Last quarter you talked about mobile and an agreement you had -- you put in place with Apple. Any update there on how you're leveraging mobile to enhance physician experience?","Zane M. Burke","We've continued to roll out to some of our early adopters some of the technology. And we continue to see good progress on that side. But no other substantive rollouts. So continued progress. We should be able to update you some in that area as well at the HIMSS.","Marc G. Naughton","Yes. Sean, it's clearly -- it gives us an advantage to be able to sell the device direct without the cost of connecting to a network. But once again, it follows our strategy of we're going to connect to the device that is most often used by the health care provider, and this just gives us one more avenue to that. We're very pleased with our position. We're having active discussions. But obviously, still a fairly new agreement for us.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Zane, I think I heard you say that there is strong growth in the ambulatory bookings in the fourth quarter, with 18 signature accounts that were displacements. Can you help us to understand if these were driven more by docs wanting to choose a new EMR or was this more of the hospital client driving affiliated physician decisions?","Zane M. Burke","Lisa, it's a mixture of both. So it is both of those scenarios. But, in many cases, it's the -- the organizations wanting an integrated solution. And then our solution is very appealing and is second to none in the ambulatory marketplace. And so it's a driver of the business. And so you're seeing a combination of both.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Is there a way to quantify how big that opportunity is? I mean, clearly, you have a lot of very large hospital systems that are buying physician practices and driving what their decision is going to be around EMR. Is there any number we can put around that from an opportunity perspective?","Zane M. Burke","Well, it's tricky because I can tell you that about 70% of our clients have some sort of Cerner ambulatory footprint, but the number of physician in each -- physicians in each one of those organizations, there's a lot of white space as it relates to those organizations that we have a singular footprint, because they'll have many other connections with, perhaps, existing EMRs today. And so I don't have a ready number for that type of model. What's positive is the progress we've made in terms of the number of clients that have created a Cerner ambulatory footprint has grown dramatically. And so that gives us a good foothold and our success in there in that space will give us lots of opportunity to continue to grow.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. Great. And then my second question just would be around -- would be for Marc, and the bookings in the first quarter. Just looking at 7% to 16% growth. Can you maybe just talk about the variables on each end, what would cause it to be on the lower end versus on the upper end? Is it single deals that you see in the marketplace and how much comfort you have, especially at the upper end of that range?","Marc G. Naughton","Lisa, I mean, normally, we go, as we always have, we go through our forecasting process where we review all the deals and we just get our best view of what the opportunities look like. And that's what we certainly base our forecast on. Whether being at one end of range or the other likely means did deal grow larger as we were moving forward, did we risk down a couple of deals and then both of them come through in that same quarter, do we have a Works deal that comes into that quarter that we might not have expected that we had a different time? So there's a variety of things. I mean we're signing thousands of contracts in a quarter anymore. So there's nothing -- our range that we provide is our best estimate based on the information we have. And it's a range because it's as much art as it is a science. So I think that's the best answer I'd give. I can't tell you that which end of the range is more likely at this time. We're working through the quarter as we always work. And we -- our goal is to provide you a range and that we think the bookings are going to be in. And when we exceed that top of that range, that means some things came into the quarter that either got bigger, or in this environment, there's things that come in very quickly and the business gets done with a very short cycle, especially with existing clients. So unfortunately, that's the best I can do to -- on comfort there.","Operator","And your last question comes from the line of Donald Hooker with KeyBanc.","Donald Hooker - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","So I wanted to ask you about the managed services line, which is something that has been a big driver for you guys for many years, and it looks like it's continuing to kind of be a double-digit driver. What keeps that growing? Is there -- and what percentage of that is international at this point? I think you said it looks like it's about 15% growth year-over-year in managed services.","Marc G. Naughton","Yes. This is Marc. The international component today is fairly small. It's kind of just getting to get some traction. We do -- we co-locate data centers in-country for those -- for hosting into various countries, because a lot of them don't let their data go across their boundaries. But there's a much lower level of infrastructure investment than there is in the U.S. A lot of the uptake is that many of the new clients that get signed opt to do managed services with their initial contract. So there's that component. As our existing clients that are hosted do have acquisitions and expand their scope, that scope expansion not only applies to software and implementation services and all those other elements, it applies to their hosting infrastructure as well. So very few of our clients are just staying static and not growing. So that business naturally grows and then, obviously, the new clients that opt to do managed services immediately add to that number as well. So that's why we're able to see growth, both in the base and with new clients there.","Neal L. Patterson","Okay. So this is Neal, why don't I just wrap up here. So 2013, we just basically wrapped that. It was a good year. So as an entrepreneur and we're at the start of the kitchen table, the -- having $1 billion in bookings in 1 quarter certainly impresses me. You all know what we do is very hard, complex and at times can be very ambiguous, your questions kind of support that. I think we all know that we have -- Cerner has plenty of things to improve. And while we are doing very good, we could have -- we could be doing better. And I assure you, as a team, we are focused very much on being better. We're also very focused on being better whereas we focus on being better in the present, we also instinctively want to basically skate to where the puck is going. The population health investments that we are making, we do certainly believe that they -- that is -- that will be, by the end of the decade, a lot of health care organizations being responsible for the health of their population and their business models will have changed. I don't think we are quite at that trigger point. When the U.S. figures out an alternative to fee-for-service, that will be -- the market will move in a fairly significant way, it will be a major market at that point. So we expect to help facilitate that move and be there when it happens. So broadly, we think health care will change significantly over the rest of this decade. We think information technology is the biggest lever to implement change in health care. And we think we can -- we will be involved in significantly redefining how health care works. So we're going to continue to be bold. We'll see you at HIMSS in the very near future. Thank you very much. Have a good evening."],"5069":["Cerner Corporation (NASDAQ:CERN) Q4 2018 Earnings Conference Call February  5, 2019  4:30 PM ET","Company Participants","David Brent Shafer - Chairman & CEO","John Peterzalek - Chief Client Officer","Marc Naughton - Executive VP & CFO","Conference Call Participants","Sean Dodge - Jefferies","Michael Cherny - Bank of America","Donald Hooker - KeyBanc","Eric Percher - Nephron Research","Jeff Garro - William Blair","Mohan Naidu - Oppenheimer","David Grossman - Stifel","Steve Halper - Cantor Fitzgerald","Sandy Draper - SunTrust","Jamie Stockton - Wells Fargo","Matthew Gillmor - Robert Baird","Steven Valiquette - Barclays","Charles Rhyee - Cowen","Operator","Welcome to Cerner Corporation's Fourth Quarter 2018 Conference Call. Today's date is February 5, 2019, and this call is being recorded.","The company has asked me to remind you that various remarks made here today constitute forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, those regarding the projections of future revenues or earnings; operating margins; operating and capital expenses; bookings; new solution; services and offering development; capital allocation plans; and future business outlook, including new markets or prospects for the company's solutions and services. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements.","Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements may be found under Item 1A in Cerner's Form 10-K, together with the company's other filings. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this earnings call can be found in the company's earnings release, which was furnished to the SEC today and posted on the Investors section of cerner.com. Cerner assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information except as required by law.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Brent Shafer, Chairman and CEO of Cerner Corporation.","David Brent Shafer","Thank you, Carmen. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the call. Today, I'm going to provide reflections on my first year at Cerner, and discuss steps we are taking to position ourselves for long-term profitable growth. I'll then have our Chief Financial Officer, Marc Naughton, cover the numbers; and John Peterzalek, our Chief Client Officer, provide marketplace observations.","I'd like to begin with some observations for my first year. This past Friday marked my 1-year anniversary at Cerner. It's been an eventful and important 12 months. I spent a great deal of time learning the business, talking to clients, partners, the financial community, and of course, Cerner associates.","A clear takeaway from these conversations is the optimism around Cerner's role in having a positive impact on health care. Clients have been eager to get feedback on how Cerner Solutions are advancing their businesses, along with urging us to go faster because of our importance to them.","Partners are pleased working with our platforms. And the culture around associate base -- our Cerner associate base, is linked to relentless innovation. These assessments have bolstered my confidence that Cerner is well positioned to deliver profitable growth. I fully expect Cerner to continue its legacy as a growth company and innovator in health care.","As an overall leadership team, we have also focused on assessing market opportunities, listening to clients, reviewing our internal processes and evaluating our profitability and capital allocation strategy. You heard me on the last earnings call talk about four commitments that define our framework for delivering value.","To reiterate, one, we must relentlessly advance our client's success; two, imagine, design, and implement intelligent health networks; three, focus on better health care experiences and outcomes; and four, become the partner of choice for health care innovation.","In order to deliver on these commitments, I've worked with the team to create a better structure and improved processes. This work has led to a refined operating model that we'll discuss next week at HIMSS. It's my belief that we can reduce complexity for our clients and make it easier to do business with Cerner.","I also believe we can innovate faster and more efficiently so clients can quickly adopt new solutions. By aligning resources around client focus and efficient delivery of innovation, I expect the business to operate more cost effectively, and have more predictable results, and improved profitability.","I want to highlight today's announcement that we plan to initiate a dividend. This decision is a significant milestone in Cerner's journey and illustrates our confidence in delivering strong operating performance and free cash flow generation. Marc will give the specifics, but this decision underscores our commitment to delivering shareholder value.","We had a solid fourth quarter with all key metrics within our guidance ranges, except for revenue, which was slightly below guidance, primarily due to lower-than-expected technology resale. Given the lower margin profile of technology resale, the quarterly revenue shortfall had very little impact on earnings, which were in line with expectations. For all of 2018, our revenue and EPS were both in the full year guidance ranges we provided in our Q1 earnings call, and we delivered solid bookings growth.","While we did deliver our full year guidance ranges, I'm aware that our results included a decline in operating earnings. This is not something we expect to continue, and I believe the structure and process changes we are making will help make Cerner more focused and efficient, which should allow us to increase our predictability and profitability over time.","In summary, while we still have a lot of do, I am pleased with the progress we made as a leadership team in the past year. I believe we have the right mix of people, processes and strategies to drive long-term financial success. I look forward to seeing many of you next week at HIMSS.","And now I'll turn the call to Marc.","Marc Naughton","Thanks, Brent. Good morning, everyone. I'm going to cover our results and guidance. I'll start with bookings, which were $1.96 billion in Q4. This is above the midpoint of our guidance range. This is the second-highest bookings quarter in our history, behind the $2.329 billion in Q4 of '17, which included several uniquely large contracts, and have grown 62% over the prior fourth quarter. Full year bookings were $6.721 billion, which is up 6% over $6.325 billion in 2017.","We ended the quarter with a revenue backlog of $15.25 billion, which is up from $14.7 billion in Q3. As we've indicated, our backlog calculation under the new revenue standard excludes revenue potentially impacted by contract termination clauses. In our experience, clients rarely exercise this option, so this doesn't change our total long-term revenue opportunity. It just reduces the calculation of backlog.","You'll see in our 10-K filing that we've supplemented our backlog disclosure by adding the amount of revenue we expect from contracts that are not included in the backlog calculation. For 2019, when you combine the 29% of our backlog we expect to recognize, with an additional $525 million expected from contracts not included in backlog, the total is approximately 85% of the midpoint of our revenue guidance.","Revenue in the quarter was $1.366 billion, up 4% over Q4 of '17, and as I mentioned, just below our guidance range of $1.37 billion to $1.42 billion. The shortfall in Q4 was primarily due to lower-than-expected levels of technology resale, which was down 42% compared to Q4 of '17. Total revenue for the year was $5.366 billion, reflecting growth of 4% over 2017.","I'll now go through the business model detail and year-over-year growth compared to Q4 '17 and full year 2017. Licensed software revenue in Q4 was $166 million, down 2% against the solid Q4 '17. Full year licensed software revenue of $614 million was $2 million higher than 2017, or basically flat, with growth in SaaS offsetting declines in traditional software.","As we discussed, the smaller nature of the remaining EHR replacement market reduces our traditional software opportunity, but we do expect SaaS to continue growing and eventually become the majority of software revenue, which should reduce volatility over time.","Technology resale decreased 42% in Q4 to $46 million and was well below our forecast. Full year technology resale revenue was $245 million, down 10% year-over-year. The weakness relative to our forecast in Q4 was largely due to transactions pushing. We're also beginning to see more of our third-party suppliers transition to subscription and SaaS models, which did impact the sublicense software portion of technology resale revenue in 2018.","Subscription revenue was $87 million in Q4, down from $115 million in Q4 '17. As we have discussed throughout the year, subscriptions were impacted by our adoption of the new revenue standard, reducing subscription backlog and classifying a portion of subscription revenue as support.","Full year subscription revenue was $326 million, down from $469 million in 2017. With a full year of the transition to the new revenue standard behind us, we expect the subscription business model to return to solid growth in 2019.","Professional services grew, in Q4, 17%, to $466 million, driven largely by growth in our Works businesses. Full year professional services revenue grew 14% to $1.811 billion. Managed services increased 14% to $299 million in Q4, driven by strong bookings throughout the year. Full year managed services revenue was $1.155 billion, an increase of 10% over 2017.","Support and maintenance was up 6% to $277 million in Q4, and full year revenues grew 7% to $1.18 billion, both reflecting our expected low single-digit growth, plus the previously discussed impact of the new revenue standard. And finally, reimbursed travel in Q4 was $24 million, down $4 million from the year ago quarter. Full year reimbursed travel revenue was $97 million, down 4% year-over-year.","Looking at revenue by geographic segment. Domestic revenue was up 4% with the year -- from the year ago quarter at $1.205 billion. And non-U.S. revenue of $161 million was up $1 million from the year ago quarter. For the full year, domestic revenue grew 3%, and non-U.S. revenue grew 12%.","Moving to gross margin. Our gross margin for Q4 was 82.6%, down slightly from 82.8% in Q3 of '18 and flat year-over-year. Full year gross margin of 82.5% is down from 83.4% in 2017, driven by higher third-party service costs.","Now discuss spending, operating margin, and net earnings. For these items, we provide both GAAP and adjusted or non-GAAP results. The adjusted results exclude share-based compensation expense, share-based compensation permanent tax items, acquisition-related adjustments and allowance on a noncurrent asset, the impact of U.S. tax reform and other adjustments, all as detailed and reconciled to GAAP in our earnings release.","Looking at operating spending. Our fourth quarter GAAP operating expenses of $965 million were up 11% compared to $866 million in the year-ago period. Full year GAAP operating expenses was $3.654 billion, up 10%, from $3.328 billion in 2017. Note that in Q4, we recognized a pretax charge of $45 million to provide an allowance against a noncurrent receivable with Fujitsu Services Limited that is in other assets on our balance sheet.","As some of you will recall, Fujitsu's contract as the prime contractor in the National Health Service initiative to automate clinical processes and digitize medical records in the southern region of England was terminated in the second quarter of 2008 by the NHS. This led to our subcontract being terminated.","We continue to be in dispute regarding the amounts due as a result of such termination, but we determined in the fourth quarter that our chances of a favorable resolution have been reduced based on the outcome of the alternative dispute resolution procedures provided for our subcontract.","Note that our subcontract with Fujitsu was terminated, Cerner went on successfully to deliver in the southern region, as well as the London region with another prime contract, and the U.K. remains a strong and active market for us today.","Turning to adjusted operating expenses, they were up 7% compared to Q4 of '17, and 9% for the full year. Looking at the line items for Q4. Sales and client service expense increased 6% over Q4 of '17, primarily driven by an increase in personnel expense related to our services business.","Software development expense increased 12% over Q4 of '17, driven by a 7% increase in gross R&D, and 17% increase in amortization, and flat capitalized software. G&A expense was up 5%, and amortization of acquisition-related intangibles decreased $1 million year-over-year.","Moving to operating margins. Our GAAP operating margin in Q4 was 12% compared to 16.7% in the year-ago period, largely due to the $45 million in allowance I discussed. Our adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 18.7%, down from 20.5% in Q4 of '17, consistent with our guidance for the quarter.","Our GAAP operating margin for the full year 2018 was 14.4% compared to 18.7% in 2017. Our full year adjusted operating margin was 18.8%, which is down from 22.4% last year.","As we have discussed, 2018 was impacted by lower-than-anticipated licensed software revenue, higher growth of noncash expenses, investments in our Works businesses and an increased mix of Works revenue. We continue to believe that many of these factors are temporary in nature, and our 2019 guidance reflects our expectation that our operating margins stabilize at approximately 19%.","This could vary based on revenue mix, but we do not expect margin compression like we've experienced in the past few years. Longer term, we believe adjustments we are making to our operating model and the focus on profitable growth will position us for additional margin expansion.","Now I'd like to preview an expense we expect to occur -- incur, in Q2. As we discussed throughout 2018, we've been working to identify opportunities to operate more efficiently and innovative scale. One outcome of that analysis was a recent announcement of a voluntary separation plan or VSP. Generally, the VSP is available to U.S. associates who meet a minimum level of combined age and tenure with certain critical roles excluded for business continuity purposes.","Associates who would like to participate in the VSP will receive financial benefits commensurate with their tenure and position, along with vacation payout and medical benefits. At this point, we do not have a firm estimate for the charge because the acceptance period ends later this month. But we anticipate less than 3% of our total associates will separate as part of this program.","While a portion of these positions will be backfilled, we believe we will be able to fill many of the positions with existing associates, which should create efficiencies in the future, while also creating career growth opportunities for our associates.","Moving to net earnings and EPS. Our GAAP net earnings Q4 were $131 million or $0.40 per diluted share compared to $1 in Q4 '17. For the full year, GAAP net earnings were $630 million or $1.89 per diluted share.","Adjusted net earnings in Q4 were $208 million, and adjusted diluted EPS was $0.63 compared to $0.58 in Q4 of '17. For the full year, adjusted net earnings were $819 million, and adjusted diluted EPS was $2.45, up 3% from 2017.","Our GAAP tax rate was 24% for the quarter and 21% for the year. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 21% for the quarter and year. For 2019, we expect our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates to be closer to 22%.","Now move to our balance sheet. We ended Q4 with $775 million of cash and short-term investments, which is down from $814 million in Q3 of '18, with our free cash flow being offset by $298 million in share repurchases. For the year, we repurchased 11.2 million of shares for $644 million at an average price of $57.65. We currently have $283 million of remaining authorization under our repurchase program.","Moving to debt. Our total debt was up $3 million from last quarter to $444 million. Total receivables ended the quarter at $1.183 billion, down from $1.211 billion in Q3 of '18. Our Q4 DSO was 79 days, which is down from 82 days in Q3 of '18, and up from 72 days in the year-ago period.","Operating cash flow for the quarter was $407 million, Q4 capital expenditures were $141 million and capitalized software was $65 million. Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less capital purchases and capitalized software development cost, was $201 million for the quarter.","For the full year, operating cash flow was $1.454 billion, capital expenditures were $447 million, and capitalized software was $274 million. Full year free cash flow was $733 million, which is $62 million higher than 2017.","For 2019, we expect limited growth in our operating cash flow because we benefited in 2018 from a tax refund that offset most of our cash tax payments. This year, we expect to have more cash outflow for tax, and our cash flow will be impacted by our VSP payouts.","On the capital side, we expected increase in capital expenditures of more than $75 million in 2019, primarily to support our facilities requirements, including the peak year spend on a phase at our Innovation Campus.","Due to a combination of these two factors, we expect free cash flow to decline in 2019, but we still expect it to be solid. In 2020, we expect to return to normal operating cash flow growth and a meaningful decline in capital expenditures to lead a strong free cash flow.","Now I'd like to discuss our capital allocation. As noted in our press release, subject to declaration by our board, we plan to initiate a $0.15 per share quarterly cash dividend, with the first payment expected sometime in the third quarter. On annualized basis, this represents a yield of just over 1% based on our current stock price at a payout ratio of 24% of 2018 adjusted net earnings.","Investing in innovation to fuel growth has been Cerner's core strategy since inception. This will not change, and we are confident that meaningful growth opportunities exist, and that we are making the right investments to deliver good, long-term growth. We are now at a point where we believe we can invest in this growth whilst also enhancing shareholder value with a dividend and continued share repurchases.","We have several objectives we are looking to accomplish with our broader capital allocation strategy. First, we want to provide current income to existing shareholders, while also increasing the attractiveness of Cerner to a wider investor base.","Second, we expect to continue using free cash flow for share repurchases to offset dilution from equity compensation and do additional repurchases as deemed appropriate. Third, we want to have flexibility to make other investments in growth, including relationships like Lumeris or strategic acquisitions that complement our organic growth investments.","Given our very strong balance sheet and expected strong cash flow, we believe we are in a comfortable position to do all these things with free cash flow, while still maintaining flexibility to use debt for larger, strategic opportunities.","We also believe adding a dividend to our capital allocation approach will put a discipline and focus on free cash flow generation, which is something we also plan to incorporate to our variable compensation plans as part of broader changes that we believe will increase alignment with shareholders.","In summary, we have put a lot of thought in our capital allocation approach and listened to feedback from many of you, and we believe this approach is the best interest of our shareholders.","Now I'll go through the guidance. We expect revenue in Q1 to be between $1.365 billion and $1.415 billion. The midpoint of this range reflects growth of 8% over Q1 of '18.","For the full year, we expect revenue between $5.65 billion and $5.85 billion, with a $5.75 billion midpoint, reflecting 7% growth over 2018. We expect Q1 adjusted diluted EPS to be $0.60 to $0.62 per share. The midpoint of this range is 5% higher than Q1 of '18.","For the full year, we expect adjusted diluted EPS to be $2.57 to $2.67, with a $2.62 midpoint, reflecting 7% growth over 2018. The midpoint of this range is $0.06 below consensus. We expect about half of that is -- if consensus had a tax rate closer to our 2018 tax rate of 21%, and we expect to rate around 22%, with the rest likely being a slight difference in margins.","Moving to bookings guidance. We expect bookings revenue in Q1 of $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion. The midpoint of this range reflects a 14% decrease compared to the first quarter of 2018. Note that the first quarter of 2018 had a much higher-than-normal level of large long-term bookings, and we expect a much lower level in Q1 of this year.","The combination of these two factors is the driver of the expected year-over-year decline in bookings, as the midpoint of our guidance range would reflect growth in bookings if you exclude the long-term portion. There are several large, long-term deals forecasted throughout the year, and we expect this mix to normalize as the year progresses.","Before I wrap up, I'd like to remind you about our Annual Investment Community Meeting at HIMSS next Wednesday, February 13. If you plan to attend and have not registered, please do so through the link at the top of the Investors section at cerner.com. If are unable to attend in person, there will also be a webcast available at the same location, both live and archived.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to John.","John Peterzalek","Thanks, Marc. Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll cover Q4 and full year results and discuss the marketplace.","I'll start with our bookings results. As Marc mentioned, Q4 bookings did decline compared to the all-time high in Q4 2017, but they were still our second highest level ever. Multiple large transactions contributed to the strength of our bookings, including 6 contracts that were greater than $75 million.","These large contracts included significant solution in services expansions with existing clients and new Cerner Millennium footprints in both U.S. and non-U.S. marketplace. In addition to the contributions from larger hospitals, our CommunityWorks and ambulatory businesses both had record full year bookings.","Looking at the mix of new business. 30% of bookings in Q4 came from outside our core Cerner Millennium installed base. The percent of bookings coming from long-term contracts in the quarter was 38%, and included the addition of a Cerner ITWorks client and a RevWorks expansion.","As Marc discussed, we are expecting a lower level of long-term deals in Q1, but we have a solid forecast for the year, and the overall market remains attractive. The activities reflected in our strong pipeline, which is at near record levels.","2018 was also a strong year for our key growth areas, with revenue cycle, HealtheIntent population health solutions, and Cerner ITWorks all growing revenue more than 20%.","In population health, we are continuing to make early progress in our launch of our EHR-agnostic offering with Lumeris called Maestro Advantage. Maestro Advantage is designed to help health systems set up and manage provider-sponsored Medicare Advantage plans and enable population health services organizations to manage a portfolio of value-based reimbursement arrangements. We've continued to have strong interest in this offering.","In addition, we had a joint client go-live in the beginning of this year that is a long-time HealtheIntent client that chose Lumeris because of our plans to operate as an integrated offering. This client launched a Medicare Advantage Plan in 2019, with first year enrollment exceeding client target expectations.","For their initial launch, they are using the Lumeris platform for their new MA planned benefits administration and leveraging HealtheIntent for their population health management and provider performance technology platform, with complete migration to HealtheIntent for the combined Maestro Advantage platform when its available. Further, we expect to sign a client outside of our EHR installed base for Maestro Advantage in the first half of the year.","Next, I'd like to provide an update on our federal business. Starting with the Department of Defense, MHS GENESIS project. We are continuing our work on the second wave of sites, and the project is going as planned. Similarly, our work with the Department of Veterans Affairs has continued as planned since signing the initial contract in Q2 and additional past quarters in Q3.","We remain on track to steadily ramp our work on the projects as we go through the year. The first major project milestone will be in 2020 when initial sites are scheduled to go-live. As a related note, the government shutdown did not have a material impact on our DoD or VA projects.","Moving to our business outside of the U.S. Our revenue for the quarter was flat versus the tough comparable in Q4 of 2017, but up 12% for the full year. From a bookings standpoint, the highlight of the fourth quarter was winning our second major region in Sweden after signing our first region in Q1 of '18. Both of these were competitive wins against our primary competitor.","Now I'd like to discuss the marketplace and our approach to aligning with shifts that are occurring. There are several macro drivers that are shaping the way we align with our clients and think about our long-term growth.","First, provider consolidation continues to increase with transacted deal revenue doubling on a year-over-year basis, and primary and specialty practices owned by health systems nearing 50% for those key service lines. This consolidation, focused within discreet metropolitan areas, has driven higher levels of technology variance, with some health systems having 10-plus disparate EMRs across its own and affiliated assets.","As the size and scale of these health networks grows, consolidators are looking for technology and services to increase near-term fee-for-service revenue and enable emerging fee-for-value opportunities to include episode management and provider-sponsored plans.","To better align with these trends, we made some adjustments in 2018 in how we align with the marketplace. This included creating a separate group focused on large clients that are driving much of the industry consolidation. Our focus is making sure these clients have the best of Cerner and to enable them to pursue their growth strategies.","In some cases, this means we help them rapidly deploy Cerner's EHR across acquired sites that are using another EHR. For others, our strategy of using HealtheIntent as the single source of truth across a system with multiple EHRs may make more sense.","We're also making more changes this year as part of the adjustments to our operating model Brent discussed. The changes primarily evolve around streamlining how we sell to different solution categories and client types to make it easier for existing clients to work with us and create more focus on opportunities outside of Cerner's core EHR installed base.","Before turning the call over to questions, I've wanted to highlight an industry milestone that Cerner played a key role in our membership in CommonWell Health Alliance. Recall that CommonWell is an open, not-for-profit industry consortium that we cofounded with other health care IT firms to enable secure, nationwide interoperability.","In November of 2018, CommonWell announced general availability of its connection to care quality, another national interoperability framework. This connection allows CommonWell and quality-enabling health care providers to bilaterally exchange data through improved care coordination and delivery.","This is a significant milestone on a path to achieving true, nationwide interoperability, and making health data available to individuals and providers regardless of where care occurs. We are proud to have played a role in this accomplishment and plan to remain a leading advocate for interoperability and its vital role to health care.","With that, I'll turn the call over to the moderator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Sean Dodge with Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Sean Dodge","Good afternoon. Thanks. Maybe, Brent, your comments at the very beginning of the call around a focus on more efficient, cost-effective innovation. Cerner certainly spends a lot of money on R&D. I'm curious to hear any updated thoughts you have around the longer-term trajectory of spending there.","The mention of an emphasis on efficiency, is that something where you think you can hold spending flat and drive some operating leverage out of it in the future? Or is there even a possibility to reduce some of that spending with efficiencies and innovation to deliver, maybe, some of those savings to margins?","David Brent Shafer","Thanks for your comment. Really, the focus is on efficiencies in our approach and getting more from the total spend that we have through better processes, better management, looking for ways to ensure we're not duplicating work, et cetera. So there's a couple of key components to this.","One is around concentrating operations so that they're effective, things get scaled into market as quickly as possible, with 2 areas where we're really focusing on growth by concentrating resources in those: one, around kind of an incubator concept where we get early-stage ideas ready to scale, scale them through operations, et cetera, take them to market faster; the other area is really focusing some resources on the strategic growth areas that are outside the core EMR or EHR market. So the answer is doing more with the resources we have, making them more productive.","Sean Dodge","Okay. That's helpful. And then, on VA and margins, Marc, before, you mentioned some of the VA task orders can include bigger chunks of software and then, of course, those being nice tailwinds to margins.","Can you characterize for us -- I guess I'm not asking you to quantify the VA revenue expected in '19, but rather, frame for us if there's a lot of these kind of bigger software chunks from VA relative to maybe what you'd expect in subsequent years. Is this a big VA software year or not?","Marc Naughton","Yes. This is Marc. If you recall, the VA, as prime, we are on a percent of completion contract method of recognizing the revenue from the VA. So you basically put all the revenue from the VA, software, services, third-party, all into a bucket, and you recognize that bucket basically as you perform services.","So they're really, in the VA, Sean, is not one -- you don't have the lumpiness or the chunks of revenue that come from a stand-alone software deal that you would get in our normal business. So it will all be part of that overall profitability.","So it goes into us calculating kind of a projected margin from that business, including third parties of 20% to 25% based on kind of a 50-50 split of work being done by us and work being done by third parties. So there won't be a lumpiness to it relative to the software that will be based on when the activity occur relative to working down that contract.","Sean Dodge","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Cherny with Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Michael Cherny","Good afternoon. And thank you for taking the question. Tying back a little bit into the original question on R&D, but thinking about comprehensively, Brent, as you've taken your first year in the business, especially coming from a much larger organization, can you point out some of the things that, as a company or what you've seen from Cerner, that you think is really prudent investing in areas where you have seen some specific returns, whether that's some of that R&D incubation?","And then, especially going forward, and I apologize if I'm getting ahead of next week, but with a more moderate growth rate for the industry, how you think about that sales and client service business line item within the model.","David Brent Shafer","Yes. Well, we have a rich history of innovation, and as a lot of great work that's been going. I think one of the things that came out of talking with associates, and clients, and just kind of looking at where we are, is we've gotten to a scale where efficient deployment of resources and so on, we started to get in our own way, I think, as we've gotten big.","So fundamentally, what we've tried to do is to look at standard ways of operating, finding efficiencies, eliminating duplication and organizational structures so that we can get the early-stage ideas to a point that they can be scaled to the whole market quickly.","And so that's the focus. And we'll continue to invest in innovation. I think there's a strong pipeline of things that we can bring to market, but getting them to scale quickly and getting them to revenue quickly for us is the emphasis with these moves. And we'll go into more detailed kind of -- the approach, next week.","Michael Cherny","Okay. And then, just one follow-up question, maybe for John. You talked about a very, very strong pipeline. Yet, at the same time, also talking about the replacement market slowing down. What constitutes that pipeline qualitatively? What are people looking to buy?","John Peterzalek","Well, the pipeline that we have is consistent with what we've had and the approach there in the past. So you'll see expansion into what we'll call the peripheral of the core, whether it's clinician communication, whether it's population health, management and other things that make a health system more efficient in our core client base.","And you'll see the mix very similar to what we had before. In terms of the replacement market, you're seeing the same phenomena that we've also had for the last few years, which is the total number of opportunities are declining that are out in the market as each one signs. But the number we work on every year has been really consistent.","So we remain very active in the replacement market, and we see that being consistent in the near future as well. That the number we work on every year will remain constant, while the total number of opportunities become fewer.","Michael Cherny","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Donald Hooker with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.","Donald Hooker","Great. You mentioned -- I think you mentioned in your prepared remarks, you all mentioned, talked about an ITWorks deal. This had been an area of high growth, and it seems -- felt like I've sort of hit a wall maybe about a year ago, and growth there stopped. And it seems like it's starting to pick up there.","Can you talk about the marketplace for ITWorks? There's large IT outsourcing arrangements and how we should think about that over the next year or so? How much of that is in your pipeline?","John Peterzalek","Yes. This is John again. We actually have considerable opportunities in ITWorks. If you look at some of the pressures that our provider clients are facing in terms of having to do more with less, having those efficiency gains, is we actually have a tremendous value proposition about doing more and being able to bring all that Cerner has to bear, which is broader than just software and those type of things.","So the interest remains strong. I would say that some of the lumpiness you'd see is primarily because these are large transactions and very complex from both the client side and the Cerner side. So I think part of it is just timing. It's -- while we've done a really good job, I think, of predicting when these things will close, the complexities make them less predictable than some of our other solutions and offerings. But the demand out there is still very strong.","Donald Hooker","How many ITWorks contracts do you have currently?","John Peterzalek","We are north of 30. I think we're at 32 right now.","Donald Hooker","Okay. And then, maybe one last question. You're kind of on this theme of outsourcing around the revenue cycle. I think, over the past year, you guys have highlighted some investments you've made in shared service infrastructure, I think, with Adventist and maybe some others in Kansas City that kind of scale out a revenue cycle outsourcing sort of capability. Where are you with that? And again, how do we think about that? That's also been an area where, I think, there's a lot of growth that sort of slowed. How do we think about that kind of going forward in the pipeline?","John Peterzalek","Yes. The -- to address the specific on the Kansas City service center you've talked about, it's primarily as we transitioned the Adventist workforce in, and that's going on schedule as planned. In terms of the pipeline, the opportunities out there, I think, are pretty broad, as well as, again, as our provider clients are looking at ways to focus on our core business.","They're looking at ways to outsource or take some of the burden of some of the process-oriented things off their plate. And we have lots of opportunities out there to go get. And we've been putting them in our service center as well. So we get a big leverage out of what we're doing in Kansas City as well as doing some on-site stuff that can leverage the same processes.","So I'm very optimistic that you'll continue to see that grow. They have some of the complexities that I mentioned with ITWorks because they tend to be large -- larger opportunities and those type of things that kind of make them less predictable, but the opportunities are there.","Marc Naughton","Yes. Don, this is Marc. We have over 600 people that we've hired in Kansas City. And keep in mind, that was an investment we made during the year, one of the reasons that we've readjusted our targets as we went -- guided at the end of Q1. And those will take over some of the responsibilities from some of our existing clients that were -- '18 and part of '19 is really the transition where we move that work into our billing center. It does allow us to pursue additional back-office activities. And keep in mind that back-office versus a pure outsourcing is a higher-margin outsourcing business for us. So that's one of the reasons we wanted to create that center in Kansas City.","Donald Hooker","Okay, great. I\u2019ll see you all next week.","Marc Naughton","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Eric Percher with Nephron Research. Your line is now open.","Eric Percher","Thank you The dividend, I think, you called it a milestone, represents a pretty material change relative to the Board's historic approach. I'd love to hear your view on what the key determinant was or is. And how does the targeted -- or how is the payout today -- how does it compare to what you think the target may be over time? Isn't this what you would like to target? Or is it indicative of a greater payout target over time?","Marc Naughton","Yes. This is Marc. On the relative -- the dividend and our capital allocation review, I think, certainly, once you go out with the dividend, your expectation is you're going to increase the dollar amount of that dividend on an annual basis. And certainly, as a growth company, that would be our expectation. We talked to a lot of investors, a lot of shareholders as to what -- as we looked at our capital allocation strategies.","And I think the -- while people were appreciative of the stock repurchases, we heard the opportunity to lay in a dividend, especially when you look at the S&P 500 that have similar qualities to our company, about 80% of them are paying a dividend. It does open up another -- a shareholder base that traditionally hasn't been able to buy our stock.","And we think it enhances the shareholder return that our shareholders can get. Given our strong free cash flow, the ability to do that, plus pulling in the -- being able to do targeted repurchases and still fund the opportunities that we think from a strategic growth perspective, it just seemed like a good time in the life cycle of the company to lay in that program.","Eric Percher","That's great to hear. And did you say that there is an element that you will bring into compensation? And as you're doing that, have you thought at all about bringing a measure of bookings or revenue like some of the technology peers in your proxy comparison group do in their compensation plans?","Marc Naughton","Yes. Right now, we are looking at adjusting what our -- currently, senior management team here is focused primarily on EPS from an incentive compensation basis, at least for the current and the cash. I think as we roll into '19, you'll see us looking at adding revenue and free cash flow as part of a triumvirate of 3 metrics that we'll look to incent people on.","So it's kind of broadened the view. We have a lot of metrics to go deeper into the organization. There are a lot of cash collection targets. There are a lot of things that, within the organization, support each one of those. But traditionally, we've kind of let EPS stand-in for the overall shareholder view of the company and what we're incenting senior leadership on. I think you'll see us split that among 2 or 3 factors to take into account just exactly what you said.","Operator","Our next question is from Jeff Garro with William Blair.","Jeff Garro","Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I want to ask about the international opportunity and recognizing that the full year growth was faster than the corporate average. And you had some really nice wins throughout the year. So wanted to get your comments on the international pipeline positioning abroad, and expectations to grow that piece of the business faster than the corporate average going forward.","John Peterzalek","Yes. This is John. The international or outside the U.S. pipeline looks strong, and the great thing about outside the U.S. is they tend to come in big chunks that we buy -- that we'll be purchasing either at a state level, a province level, a region level, as opposed to an individual health system level. So they come with large pieces of business and broader than just EHR.","They generally -- we'll cover some sort of social aspect to it as well as a population health or population health management aspect of it as well. So you'll see us do very similar to, I think, what we did in Sweden, which is we'll want to establish a core in a region or state, and then use that leverage to expand beyond that. And there are several opportunities to do that, not only in countries where we are, but potential new countries coming in as well.","Jeff Garro","Great. And then, just as a follow-up. You mentioned potential new countries. Any particular regions that you could call out?","John Peterzalek","Probably not right now as some of them are in pre-RFP stages. But we've got a pretty good beat on what's likely to come out over the next 1, 2, and 3 years.","Operator","Our next question is from Mohan Naidu with Oppenheimer.","Mohan Naidu","Marc, two questions. First on the subscription revenue. As you anniversary the new revenue standard, what kind of growth should we see? I think, right now, it's hard to see the true growth because of the comps.","Marc Naughton","Yes. You kind of see a decline in the number as we went into '18 with the impact of 606. I think once we get -- have the '18 numbers landed, which we do, then you'll start to see more normalized comparables going forward. So I think as you kind of look to 2019, one of the reasons we feel good about looking at a guidance that gives us kind of a midpoint of a 7% top line growth after a year which we grew 4%, is that we expect subscriptions to grow over their current level, and probably, certainly, at least double-digit growth compared to where they're at.","We're getting a lot of uptake on some of our transaction activity that goes into subscriptions. And we actually had good subscription bookings in 2018, which go into the backlog, and then we'll feed the revenue as we roll forward. I think that a key element as we talk about 2019, and just want to stress, is that we have 85% visibility into that revenue number as we come out of the year when you look at our backlog and our contracted revenue, which isn't included in backlog.","And that's the highest we've seen. So I think that's, in our mind, as we look at the numbers, supports why you can be a 4% growth last year and go to a 7% on -- at the midpoint in 2019.","Mohan Naidu","I think you touched on the backlog coverage. That was going to be my second question. So with 85%, I mean, it's better than what you had last year or this time at 82%. But it looks like, optically, it's much better than 85% comparison because you don't have this new contract or revenue in the backlog. Is that fair?","Marc Naughton","Well, I think if you do the math in the 10-K, it will give you the data to do that. But I think we gave you the data today that if you take the backlog number times what we expect to roll out in 12 months, and then, you add the non-contracted backlog, which I think is about $525 million for next year, some of those 2 things add up to about 85% of what our revenue is for 2019. So it does include the contracted revenue and reflects all of those elements.","Operator","Our next question is from David Grossman with Stifel.","David Grossman","So Marc, you mentioned in your prepared remarks, the various factors leading to a flat margin assumption for next year. Can you just quickly review those? I don't know if I caught them all. And perhaps, outline the relative orders of magnitude in terms of impact year-over-year? And I assume the VA contract is a year-over-year margin help. In terms of the Works business though, is that portfolio going to yield better margins year-over-year, in 2019?","Marc Naughton","Yes. I think the key when you're looking at is during 2018, we had a lot of services margin, and a lot of that was related to really, really strong Works bookings that we had in '18 at the end of '17. A lot of that is in the ITWorks and the RevWorks side of the business, which in the initial phases of those contracts, are very low margin.","They're single digit. And so, when a significant chunk of new revenues coming in at that level, and obviously, '19 will be even larger as more of those kick in for a full year, that's going to have an impact that makes growing margins more difficult. I think, certainly, we look to get a little bit of an uptick in licensed software, but a component of that and an ever-growing component of that is the SaaS software. And that's not 90% margins.","That's more like 50% margins because of the need to host a lot of that. So a lot of the margin view depends on what the mix is going to be. So while we don't expect an expansion in 2019, we also don't expect a decline, which would be -- reverse the trend that we've seen in the last few years. I think on the spend side, you're still getting hit, although not quite as much in '18.","But in '19, you're still getting hit with an amortization and depreciation impact from a noncash expense that's going to be an increase that you have to do. And Brent indicated, we want to be more efficient on how we deliver our R&D. But that's not a number that's going go down because we are an industry that has a lot of opportunity.","We're still going to invest organically even with our -- the strategic growth views that we're having. So I think, next year, you probably are going to see, certainly this year, the R&D was growing faster than revenue. I think that may continue next year as well.","So certainly, we'll talk to you more about it at HIMSS relative to kind of some of the views we have relative to growing margin. But I think the focus for us is to grow revenue. We are a growth company. We're paying a dividend, but we are a growth company.","But we need to grow earnings at a faster rate than we're growing revenue. And '19, we're probably going to be relatively similar, with a goal that going forward, we're able to grow earnings at a faster level. Obviously, meaning that we're going to have some level of margin expansion.","David Grossman","And I'm sorry if you've mentioned this, but does the amortization or depreciation then start rolling off in 2020?","Marc Naughton","It starts equalizing, so you don't have the year-over-year increases that we've been seeing in the last 2 years or so.","Operator","Our next question is from Steve Halper with Cantor Fitzgerald.","Steve Halper","In previous commentary, you talked about the VA getting to $1 billion of revenue over the next 4 years. Is that still a safe assumption?","Marc Naughton","Yes. I think it depends on when the task orders come through and there's pace of the project. But basically, that's kind of the trajectory that the project plan is on.","Steve Halper","Right. And recognizing that you recognize revenues on a percentage of completion, how are costs -- are those being expensed as incurred?","Marc Naughton","No. Under percent of completion, you're taking all of the dollars that are going to get brought in from revenue. All the costs get laid up in that. And then, when you recognize the dollar of revenue, you recognize the percent of expense. So basically, Steve, assuming that you're getting 20% to 25% overall margins from that revenue dollar, that's pretty consistent margin that you see coming into the P&L when that revenue comes in.","Steve Halper","Okay. I just wanted to make sure if there was some element of VA cost in that 2019 number. Did you make -- is there an assumption that the VA contributes revenue in 2019 or not?","Marc Naughton","Yes. Yes. That would be -- certainly, VA contributed some revenue in 2018, and that revenue goes up in 2019.","Operator","Our next question is from Sandy Draper with SunTrust.","Sandy Draper","Just a couple of quick ones. Marc, did you -- I know you still have the share repurchase. Did you mention -- is there any share repurchase explicitly in the guidance? Or does the guidance exclude the share repurchases?","Marc Naughton","I think, for the most part, it'd be consistent with our prior activities, which tends to be that we repurchase at an amount that offsets dilution. So if you're looking at outstanding shares to model, it'd be basically relatively flat.","Sandy Draper","Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then, I'm not sure if I quite caught it or understood, I think it was John's comments about the first quarter bookings. It sounds like you expect traditional bookings to be up year-over-year, but all the decline to be driven by long-term bookings. Is that correct? I'm just trying to make sure I've got that. And then, thinking about how that sort of flows through the rest of the year, but it sounds like with a couple of big deals, you expect long-term bookings may actually grow even though they're going to be down materially in the first quarter.","Marc Naughton","Yes. The long-term bookings aren't forecasted in Q1, as we said. And the pipeline for the remainder of 2019 in terms of long-term bookings looks very positive.","David Brent Shafer","Yes. Sandy, I think when we look at it, if you factor kind of take long-term out of the equation, the non long-term looks to be -- to growing in Q1.","Operator","Our next question is from Jamie Stockton with Wells Fargo.","Jamie Stockton","Maybe just a quick follow-up to Steve's on the VA kind of revenue assumptions. I think that to get to that $1 billion that he referenced 4 years out, you guys kind of talked about maybe $250 million this year, $500 million next year, $750 million, and then, $1 billion. I know it's probably impossible to predict with that level of accuracy, given that you're dealing with the government here. But is that generally the cadence that people should still be thinking about?","Marc Naughton","Yes. Jamie, as you said, it's hard to exactly model what it looks like. I think what we've kind of said is that if it's a 4-year growth to $1 billion, without being too precise, if you just model it kind of going -- it won't go in a straight line at that ramp rate. But if that's what you model, I think you're not going to be that far off.","Operator","Our next question is from Matthew Gillmor with Robert Baird.","Matthew Gillmor","Just had one follow-up on the capital allocation. You talked about the dividend. I thought the commentary around the acquisition was maybe new as well. So just wanted to confirm that you're, perhaps, more open to M&A. And if we heard that right, sort of what are the areas of particular focus?","Marc Naughton","Yes. This is Marc. One of the things that -- topics when Brent came aboard that he wanted us to focus on was let's relook capital allocation. You guys have a really strong balance sheet. Seems like we need to be applying that into the business. So I think it is a little bit of a change. We've gone -- certainly, in the past, had much more of a mantra of we're going to build it ourselves. And I think that's been very effective for us.","But as we get in more of the HealtheIntent platform, that agnostic platform, it opens our ability to do some targeted niche acquisitions that can be quickly brought in to that architecture, and therefore, delivered to our clients in a pretty efficient, cloud-based manner. So it definitely is a little bit of a change in what our approach is going to be. It's a little hard to target exactly what that's going to be.","We are still kind of at the -- doing a process where we're reviewing a lot of different opportunities. I think it's safe to say that the majority will be focused, either on things that can supplement our HealtheIntent platform or be implemented through use of that, or some type of an opportunity that helps us in our government business or others that help us in some other new opportunities that we think there's opportunity -- that we see the chance to grow, such as networks.","The Lumeris investment was very much focused on being able to grow networks and be able to assist our clients in doing that. And I think that's -- Lumeris is a great opportunity there. But I think there are other tangential opportunities that might be well suited to some type of an M&A. Or certainly, we can also look at partnerships because that may be a more effective vehicle in many cases.","David Brent Shafer","Yes. This is Brent. I'm just going to add to that. One of the things we have gone through in the last -- in recent months, is really putting a portfolio review in place and looking at, one, how do we become more efficient with the organic growth, getting solutions to market quickly, et cetera, on the spend, and what situations does it make sense to partner. There's just so much to go after. And what are the criteria for partnership? How do we use that effectively or build on the legacy partnerships we have? And then, the third would be selective M&A, as Marc described, that are a niche and adjacency that fits well with our overall strategy that is just logical to make that move rather than to build it ourselves.","Operator","Our next question is from Steven Valiquette with Barclays.","Steven Valiquette","Yes. I guess, for me, I also have yet another question here on the 2019 revenue guidance. This kind of relates a little bit more to the alternative breakdown of your revenues when you categorize it by the ITWorks, rev cycle, pop health, Global, and core EHR. And I know you gave those -- the 2018 numbers at HIMSS. But really just within the new revenue guidance, just curious, should we still maybe expect, let's call it, double-digit revenue growth for the four faster growth categories within this alternative revenue breakdown to offset what's likely going to be more flattish revenue trends in core EHR to hit the 2019 revenue growth guidance? And maybe the only quick follow-up on this would be when you were just talking about maybe adding another $250 million of VA res in 2019, I assume would most of that fall into the core EHR category? Or would it be spread across all these categories?","Marc Naughton","Yes. I think the, traditionally, in the way we presented core through last HIMSS update, core would include federal. And I think, certainly, federal is one place where we expect to see some significant growth. So I wouldn't -- if your question relates to hey, is a lot of the growth going to be Works businesses that are low margin, I don't think that's necessarily the case.","I think we're going to get some growth from our core business, which includes federal. And just as a -- I don't give a spoiler alert, but that's -- I think the core is going to include that. We may want to give you a view of what federal looks like in a longer-term view as well. But I think the -- when you look at 2019 revenue growth, you really seek kind of a contribution from almost all of the elements of the business because you're going to see -- when you look at the 7% midpoint growth, I think you're going to see tech resale is going to rebound. So there's going to be a bump-up there.","That's not real high margin. There'll be some license bump from basically a flat growth period. So there'll be a little bit of margin expansion there. Subscriptions will be up. Services will grow and probably more of the value-added services as opposed to the Works businesses services.","So and even, probably growth in hosting as well, which is as you know, pretty high-margin stuff. So I think there are opportunities that don't -- for broad growth across the business. But at the end of the day, you've also got some growth in expenses. And so you're going to end up, basically, with relatively flat margins.","But I think, yes, the growth isn't just coming from one piece of the business. As John said, there's pretty good demand in the marketplace. We have a good pipeline, and we're going to, I believe, see contributions from kind of every element on the income statement.","Operator","And our last question is from Charles Rhyee with Cowen.","Charles Rhyee","Just, Marc, just wanted to clarify just a couple of points as it relates to the guidance here. I get the revenue piece. So when we think about the EPS range, and just to bring together a few people's questions before. We see these sort of assuming share count relatively flat to this year because we're always assuming the share buybacks related to dilution.","And then, if we assume a 22% tax rate in terms of other interest income, should we be thinking about similar to this past year? Or now that we're paying the dividend, maybe something a little bit less? And then, when I put all those things together, it sounds like earlier, you're saying that puts and takes, relatively, should be looking at a flat up margin year-over-year. Is that correct? Or when we think about the range here, going to be more a little bit down a little bit? Just want piece all those things together.","Marc Naughton","Yes. That's probably a lot to cover. But the -- I think relative to up margins, I think our indication is, hey, because of some of the noncash headwinds that our guidance would stay kind of relatively flat. I think that's pretty fair. I think, from a share count perspective, just assuming that we're going to offset dilution, is probably the best assumption. Relative to interest income, I think our commentary relative to free cash flow is something you'd want to consider that free cash flow will be $100 million less in 2019. So that will impact interest income. That probably won't be a material difference. But I think that's -- if you're doing modeling, those are the things that we said that I would factor into those elements.","Charles Rhyee","And would you -- does your share -- obviously, we're putting the dividend now, and I think that -- I think people look at that favorably. But you still generate still a lot of cash on top of that. And it sounds like the message here is we want to be -- I won't use the words aggressive, but more expansive in terms of how we think about deploying capital to things like larger share buybacks such as that.","Marc Naughton","Sure. As we went through our capital allocation analysis, we felt that from a dividend perspective, starting a recurring dividend that we continue to work to grow as earnings grow, I think made the most sense. I think I would much rather leverage my balance sheet and my excess cash on investing back in the business. And so I think that's what you'll see us do with the excess cash. We are -- have strong cash flow, but we want to invest in this business and take advantage of the opportunities that we see in front of us.","So with that, I'd turn it over to Brent for the final comments.","David Brent Shafer","Thanks, Marc. Thank you all for your time today. I just want to restate, I've really enjoyed my first year at Cerner, getting to know our associates, our capabilities, our clients. I believe we have positioned ourselves well for a good year in 2019. And as we mentioned, we're moving to an operating structure that I believe will allow us to innovate more efficiently, serve clients better, and pursue growth opportunities more effectively. And I look forward to seeing you at HIMSS. Thank you all. Have a good evening.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's program. This concludes the conference, and you may all disconnect. Have a wonderful evening."],"4955":["Cerner (NASDAQ:CERN) Q3 2013 Earnings Call October 24, 2013  4:30 PM ET","Executives","Marc G.

Naughton","Thank you, Philip. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the call. I'll lead off today with a review of the numbers. Zane Burke, our President, will follow me with sales highlights and marketplace trends. Mike Nill, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, will discuss our works businesses and R&D investments. And Jeff Townsend, Executive Vice President and Chief of Staff, will discuss our new relationship with Intermountain Healthcare. Neal Patterson, our Chairman and CEO, will be available during Q&A.","Now I'll turn to our results. We delivered good results overall in Q3, with revenue again being an exception due to continued lower levels of technology resale. We continue to increase gross margin dollars at a strong rate, which is evidence of ongoing strength in the higher margin components of our business.","Our total bookings revenue in Q3 was $928 million, which is up 21% over Q3 of '12 and is an all-time high for third quarter. Bookings margin in Q3 was $831 million or 90% of total bookings.","Our bookings performance drove a 24% increase in total backlog over Q3 of '12 to $8.4 billion. Contract revenue backlog of $7.63 billion is 26% higher than a year ago. Support revenue backlog totaled $770 million, up 6% over the year ago.","Revenue in the quarter was $728 million, which is up 8% over Q3 of '12. Similar to Q1 and Q2, lower technology sales impacted our revenue but had a limited impact on earnings. Next quarter will be our last tough comparable for technology resale. We do expect it to contribute to growth next year.","The revenue composition for Q3 was $203 million in system sales, $166 million in support and maintenance, $342 million in services and $17 million in reimbursed travel.","System sales revenue reflects a 12% decline from Q3 of '12, which had grown 22% over the prior year. The decline this quarter was again driven by a significant year-over-year decrease in technology resale. As with recent quarters, we continue to have strong levels of higher margin system sales components, including software and subscriptions, which is reflected in the 7% growth in system sales margin dollars even with the decline in system sales revenue.","Moving to services. Total services revenue was up 23% compared to Q3 of '12, with strong growth in both managed services and professional services and a continued increase in contributions from ITWorks and Revenue Cycle.","Support and maintenance revenue increased 8% over Q3 of '12.","Moving to gross margin. Our gross margin for Q3 was 83.6%, which is up from 82.2% in Q2 of '13 and 77.9% in Q3 of '12. The large year-over-year increase in gross margin percentage was driven by the lower mix of technology resale. This mix shift and the strength in higher margin business models is also reflected in strong year-over-year gross margin dollar growth of 15%, which is almost double the revenue growth rate in the quarter.","Looking at revenue by geographic segment. Domestic revenue increased 8% compared to Q3 of last year, even with the decline in technology resale. Global revenue grew by 1%, due largely to a tough comparable. We did have several positive developments in our global business, which Zane will discuss, but these did not have an immediate impact on our income statement.","Looking at operating spending. Our third quarter operating expenses were $426 million before share-based compensation expense of $13 million. This is a year-over-year increase of 15%.","Sales and client service expenses increased 17% compared to Q3 of '12, driven by the continued increase in revenue-generating associates in our services businesses.","Our investment in software development was up 6% compared to Q3 of '12, with a larger increase in gross spending being largely offset by an increase in capitalized software. As we have indicated, we expect gross spending and capitalized software to increase through the end of the year and should moderate at some point next year.","G&A expense increased 22% compared to Q3 of '12, driven by increased personnel expense related to our strong quarter and high amortization expense related to recent acquisitions and acquired intangibles.","Moving to operating margins. Our operating margin in Q3 was 25.1% before share-based compensation expense and was up 180 basis points compared to Q3 of '12. This was again driven by a combination of ongoing operating efficiencies, a lower level of low margin technology revenue and strength in high margin areas I have discussed.","Moving to net earnings and EPS. Our GAAP net earnings in Q3 were $115.3 million or $0.33 per diluted share. GAAP net earnings include share-based compensation expense, which had a net impact on earnings of $8.2 million or $0.02 per diluted share.","Adjusted net earnings were $123.6 million, and adjusted EPS was $0.35, which is up 17% compared to Q3 of '12.","The Q3 tax rate for adjusted net earnings was 34%, which is in line with our expected effective tax rate.","Now I'll move to our balance sheet. We ended Q3 with $1.5 billion of total cash and investments, which is flat compared to Q2. Total cash and investments include $922 million of cash and short-term investments and $577.5 million of highly rated corporate and government bonds, with maturities less than 2 years. Our total debt, including capital lease obligations, is $183 million.","Total receivables ended the quarter at $529 million, which is up $1 million from Q2. Our DSO in Q3 was 66 days, which is down from Q2 DSO of 68 days and 73 days in Q3 of '12.","Operating cash flow for the quarter was $164 million. Q3 capital expenditures were $83 million, and capitalized software was $48 million. Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures and capitalized software, was $33 million. As expected, free cash flow remains lower than recent levels due to higher CapEx, driven by investments in our cloud infrastructure, the build-out of our new campus and higher capitalized software. Operating cash flow is also slightly lower due primarily to timing of tax payments.","We expect capital expenditure to remain high in coming quarters as we continue these important investments in our growth. Even at these levels of investment, we still expect to generate solid levels of free cash flow. We expect these investments to moderate by the second half of 2014 and for free cash flow to increase at that point.","Moving to capitalized software. The $48 million of capitalized software in Q3 represents 45% of the $107 million of total investment in development activities. Software amortization for the quarter was $24 million, resulting in net capitalization of $24 million or 22% of our total R&D investment. As we've discussed, we expect capitalized software to remain high going into 2014 but then expect it to decline as we reduce the use of third-party developers throughout the year.","Regarding our share buyback, in Q3, we purchased $28 million worth of shares, bringing year-to-date repurchases to $170 million and completing the share repurchase program that was authorized last December. In total, we purchased 3.6 million shares, post-split, in 2013.","Now I'll go through Q4 guidance. For Q4, we expect revenue between $775 million and $815 million, with the midpoint reflecting growth of 12% over Q4 of '12. This revenue guidance range accounts for a wider range of results in technology resale and reflects expected ongoing strength in other areas.","We expect Q4 adjusted EPS, before share-based compensation expense, to be $0.38 to $0.39 per share, reflecting a 15% growth over Q4 of '12.","Q4 guidance is based on total spending before share-based compensation expense of approximately $430 million to $440 million. Our estimate for the impact of share-based compensation expense is approximately $0.02 to $0.03 in Q4.","Moving to bookings guidance. We expect bookings revenue in Q4 of $1 billion to $1.1 billion, which is up compared to the all-time high Q4 '12 bookings and leads to full year bookings growth of 18% at the midpoint.","I would also like to provide our initial thoughts on 2014. The initial version of our 2014 plan supports the current 2014 analysts' estimates. As always, we will continue to update our outlook on future earnings calls.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Zane.","Zane M. Burke","Thanks, Marc. Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll provide sales highlights and discuss marketplace trends.","Starting with our results. Our bookings revenue in Q3 of $928 million is an all-time high for our third quarter and reflects 21% growth over Q3 2012. Similar to the first 2 quarters of this year, our bookings included strength across all business models, except for technology resale. While I'm not pleased with the lower-than-expected system sales revenue resulting from the decline in technology resale, I'm not concerned given the strength in our core higher margin solutions and services.","Looking at other bookings metrics, we had 23 contracts over $5 million, including 11 over $10 million. The mix of long-term bookings was 32% in the quarter, which is in line with historical levels.","Our competitiveness in Q3 was very strong. 27% of our bookings came from outside of our core Millennium installed base, and this does not include our very strategic win against our primary competitor at Intermountain, which will contribute to Q4 bookings.","In addition to Intermountain, we had other domestic wins against our primary competitor and 2 noteworthy global wins, including Albert Einstein in Brazil and CHU de Nantes in France. Both of these hospitals are among the largest and most prestigious hospitals in their respective countries, and we are very pleased to be working with them. This is our sixth French client and our first client in Brazil, which we view as a great emerging area of opportunity as they have over 7,000 hospitals with limited EMR penetration.","The news of these wins create an immediate buzz across the industry, and I've already seen it have a positive impact on our momentum in both domestic and global opportunities. This success provides further evidence on our investment in Physician Experience, and Revenue Cycle are paying off and allowing our leading capabilities and vision for population health to carry more weight in the selection process. Our modern architecture and commitment to being open, which Jeff will discuss in more depth, is also contributing to our success.","Our momentum in the ambulatory space also continued as we had another strong quarter with several competitive displacements. Our success this year is evidenced by the fact that our ambulatory bookings for the first 3 quarters are already equal to the full year 2012 bookings.","We also had continued success with smaller hospitals, adding 6 CommunityWorks clients during the quarter.","Another highlight in Q3 was success with a new approach to providing non-Cerner EMR clients in solutions and services to help them with future stages of Meaningful Use and with their population health strategies. We are providing a mid-sized health system with Health Information Exchange, Community Patient Index, Patient Portal and Enterprise Master Patient Index solutions that wrap multiple existing non-Cerner inpatient and outpatient solutions. The client also plans to add our Enterprise Data Warehouse and our just-released Healthe Intent smart registry solution to coming quarters. This new client relationship is significant because it demonstrates our ability to create a wrapper for non-Cerner systems with our cloud-based population health platform and expands our addressable market for population health beyond our installed base. As we have discussed, our population health solutions are all EMR-agnostic, as we believe by the end of the decade, the EMR will just be one input into a broader cloud platform supporting population health, much like a lab system is viewed as one feed to an EMR.","Outside of the U.S., a highlight in addition to our strategic wins in Brazil and France was the signing of the contract for our pilot with the Saudi Ministry of Health. Recall that earlier this year, we were selected for the first pilot as a part of their national project that is expected to cover more than 200 public hospitals across the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. We are already working hard on this pilot and plan to deliver outstanding results to position ourselves for future opportunities.","Now I'll cover a few marketplace observations. The competitive landscapes continues to reflect separation between the 2 most successful companies and the rest. And as I discussed, our momentum against our primary competitor is better than ever.","In the provider space, with noise around the shaky rollout of the exchanges in the background, providers continue to be focused on cost and quality in anticipation of an expected industry shift to an at-risk model that incents keeping people healthy. The financial pressures are real, and they are coupled with a long list of priorities around Meaningful Use, ICD-10, health care reform and Value-Based Purchasing. While this is a challenging environment for our providers, it's a big opportunity for Cerner as our solutions and services are very well-aligned with keeping our clients -- with helping our clients address these challenges. Our continued success in the marketplace reflects our differentiation as a supplier investing in a vision, and one that partners with clients to navigate the changing environment versus just being an EMR company.","Another observation is the replacement market remains strong. We see a lot of opportunities where a supplier chosen in the past 10 years hasn't delivered as promised, or the hospital has concerns about their ability to deliver future capabilities needed to keep up with industry shifts. Our proven ability to deliver the needs of today, along with our platform to support clients in the population health era, gives us an opportunity to reengage with many of these hospitals and health systems.","A good example of this occurred in Q3 when we displaced a best-of-breed roll-up supplier at a 364-bed regional medical center in the Southeast. This client had selected a competitor system over Cerner in the past 10 years. Since then, the competitor has been acquired and the client has been -- has dealt with missed promises around integration of merged companies and multiple suspended implementations. Frustration over these challenges and a desire to be on a platform that can support them well into the future led them to choosing Cerner.","Finally, industry consolidation is continuing. Two large examples announced this year include Tenet buying Vanguard Health and Community Health Systems announcing their purchase of HMA. This is a trend that favors Cerner. So far this year, Cerner clients have acquired 6x more hospitals than our closest competitor's clients. As we have discussed, we also have a meaningful opportunity to our installed base, which includes 7 of the top 10 health systems. Just within these large health systems, there are more than 300 sites that currently don't have a Cerner EMR. This, combined with our clients leading the consolidation trend, represents a substantial opportunity for Cerner.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike.","Michael R. Nill","Thanks, Zane. Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'm going to discuss Revenue Cycle and ITWorks and provide an update on our R&D initiatives.","I'll start with ITWorks. Q3 was a great quarter for ITWorks as it included the addition of a prestigious client, Children's National Medical Center. As part of our expanded relationship with Children's National, we also formed The Bear Institute, which is the first pediatric health information technology institute in the country. Similar to our other institute relationships, The Bear Institute and ITWorks model creates a living lab for us to work together at the edge of health care delivery, and we believe we'll be able to leverage this edge development and discovery to benefit other pediatric clients in the future. Children's National will have a Vision Center on their campus, which is located just 2 miles from the U.S. capital, and will serve as the showcase for clients, Washington dignitaries and partner companies. It's worth noting that Children's National also became a Revenue Cycle client and will be displacing their existing Revenue Cycle supplier with both inpatient and ambulatory settings.","With that, I'll transition to discussing our overall Revenue Cycle activity in the quarter. Children's National's selection of our Revenue Cycle solutions contributed to a strong quarter for Cerner Revenue Cycle and provided yet another example of the momentum we have with our client base selecting Cerner's Revenue Cycle solutions. While we didn't have any new RevWorks clients in Q3, our strong level of bookings, including several competitive wins where Revenue Cycle was an important part of the selection process, reflecting our momentum in Revenue Cycle. We also had an important Revenue Cycle -- many Revenue Cycle go lives that reflect our ongoing execution. This process was on -- this progress was on display in a big way at the Cerner Health Conference, where interest in Revenue Cycle was very strong. As a result, our pipeline for Revenue Cycle solutions and full RevWorks services is stronger than ever, and I expect Revenue Cycle to be a meaningful contributor to our growth for years to come.","Now I'd like to provide a quick update on the progress we've made with our focused R&D investments. Starting with Physician Experience, our physician solutions and overall mobility strategy was extremely well received at our health conference earlier this month. As we've indicated, PowerChart Touch, our native iPad application, is now generally available in the Apple store, and adoption is ramping quickly.","We further demonstrate our leadership in mobility and workflow with our recent announcement of CareAware Connect. With CareAware Connect, our clients can use the iPhone to replace many disparate single-use devices such as pagers, bar code scanners and Voice over IP phones. The smartphone also allows us to rethink the workflow and provides the ability to integrate different platforms into a single experience. All this is wrapped around new voice calling and a secure text messaging capability, which utilizes the hospital existing wireless infrastructure rather than requiring a cellular plan.","CareAware Connect is another example of our ability to bring something from vision to reality very quickly, as it was a concept that we shared with our clients at our health conference in 2012, and we announced 2 live clients less than a year later.","Along with CareAware Connect, we also launched Skybox Mobility for mobile device management and Skybox Network Assurance services.","I also wanted to note that Cerner has become an Apple authorized reseller for the iPhone, iPad and all other Apple computing devices. We're the first non-carrier to be able to resell the iPhone, which will allow us to resell the iPhone unlocked without a cellular plan, streamlining the purchasing, deployment and staging of the device for our clients. Through this partnership and the rollout of CareAware Connect suite of solutions, we are meaningfully advancing our role in mobility and communications and further differentiating Cerner in the marketplace.","As you know, another key area of R&D investment has been population health, and we recently achieved a major milestone in our population health development efforts. In September, Cerner and Advocate took a huge step forward in delivering our shared vision for population health when we released our Healthe Intent smart registry solution to Advocate just 7 months from contract signing. Healthe Intent smart registries provide the capability to stratify patient populations based upon risk, conditions and attributed physicians. In addition, the registry enables care managers to quickly determine what key measures specific to the designated condition of the patient have been met. As Zane mentioned, we already have a non-Cerner EMR client lined up to buy our new smart registry solution, and there are several more interested in being early adopters.","I'd also like to mention another great accomplishment in the population health space. Earlier this month, CHIME presented the 2013 Collaboration Award to CHE Trinity Health and Cerner for our joint work on predicting and preventing sepsis. Trinity indicated they have saved more than 500 lives and $22 million over the last 2 years, with Cerner's Lighthouse process improvement solutions being a key driver of the savings.","In summary, we continue to believe our approach to population health is differentiated in the marketplace. We believe many companies positioning themselves as suppliers of population health solution underestimate the complexity, and none of them are addressing the population health opportunity with a comprehensive architectural approach that sets us apart. We also believe our ability to differentiate our capabilities will enhance -- will be enhanced by our relationship with Intermountain, which Jeff will discuss next.","Jeffrey A. Townsend","Thanks, Mike. Today, I'm going to provide a perspective on our Intermountain Healthcare relationship, how it fits into our broader vision and my role going forward.","Throughout Cerner's history, there have been moments in time that shape the next decade for both Cerner and for the industry. There's a few of us who spent the last several months with the leadership from Intermountain, sharing our collective thoughts around now and next. Listening to their approach around quality, cost and new care models, it became more and more apparent another moment was in front of us to create something unique that could shape the future of the industry and Cerner's role in that future. This is a much bigger thought than it may appear on the surface. I look at this as 2 organizations joining to disrupt the industry. I think there's an opportunity to accelerate clinical computing by a decade, making it more open, aware and intelligent. The resulting system could shift the current cost baselines by more than 20%.","There is an urgency to accelerate the impact information technology can have on the macro health economy. The macroeconomic environment is approaching unsustainability. IT is the only remaining lever to pull that could change that current trajectory. Innovation won't come from the policymakers. Their only lever is price and reduced services.","With the digitization that has occurred over the past several years, we are definitely in a better place today as an industry, but most of the targets have been IT-oriented, with little focus on quality, cost, efficiency and elimination of errors. As a result, we risk not getting value out of the investments that have been made if we stop here. Much of our industry is losing focus on the potential.","Our primary competitor used their recent user conference to argue for a 5-year delay in Meaningful Use, making the point that the industry needs to slow down versus speed up. Somehow, they tried to connect safety and innovation as victims of pace. There are surprising parallels if you study Kodak's history. They had the core technology used in digital cameras but didn't make the turn, spending most of their cycles optimizing the more profitable models of the past and attempting to delay the future versus speeding it up. We will have wasted a generational investment if we don't realize the true opportunity of digitizing an entire industry as important to each of us as health care.","This opportunity is playing out, while the macro business model for care is shifting. Our clients are feeling the pressure to continue to do more for less. If we don't unlock the impact that IT can have on the system, it will become a cost center. Delay isn't the answer as the industry isn't standing still. Both technology and medicine innovate daily, if not hourly. We have to shift the impact to cost, quality, productivity and throughput. Simply turning on systems and measuring process won't be enough.","For Cerner, this is our pivot, our moment to prove that Healthcare IT is more than storing the record, measurements and getting paid. IT will disrupt the current state, bend the cost curve and enable evidence being moved into practice overnight. It becomes the platform to discover, predict and prevent and enables in a personalized experience for each of us.","Now I'd like to share how Intermountain fits into this pivot moment. Two years ago, we introduced the PPR acronym for Physician, Population Health and Revenue Cycle. While Advocate and the Adventist Health System are leading the way on Population Health and Revenue Cycle, respectively, the Physician focus is spread across multiple relationships. Given the breadth and depth of Intermountain's system and their commitment to quality, evidence and intelligence, it will be a comprehensive Physician proof point. We will deploy solutions at an accelerated rate to all clinics and practices in the first phase of the project. This also positions us to more quickly advance the CIM+1 initiatives we added last year to address continuum of care, intelligence, member engagement and personalized medicine. All of this will happen in the context of one of the most sophisticated and complex computing environments I've seen in 3 decades.","Parallel to the implementation project is a set of activities to align Intermountain's decades of clinical history, decision support and knowledge repositories into the system as though it was always there from the beginning. Our early design discussions in this space with their world-class informatics organization has evolved into 3 major initiatives that will launch in parallel to the implementation. Together, I believe they will evolve into game changers for the industry.","The first is around Intermountain's Care Process Models. These are summarized guides to clinical decision-making, focused on both conditions and specific decision points within the care process. They are highly contextual, moment-in-time decisions that remove variance and produce the best outcome at the most appropriate cost in the context of the patient, provider and venue. This will be a significant step forward in our intelligence journey. The ability to use a variety of trigger events, including risk score calculators from Cerner Math to push the decision moments face up in the conversation, makes the workflow dynamic and contextual. Think of it as a clinical navigation system. This broad capability sets up a second objective, open.","Most of the discussion today around interoperability is pretty basic and moving at a very slow pace. As part of our work together, we're taking on something more disruptive but also more impactful than the slowly evolving standards that exist today. We're going to make Care Process Models EMR-agnostic inside the workflow. This will enable a new standard of care where we create the moment-in-time experience to support the decision, and at the right moment in time, it will surface contextually inside the workflow of the physician without upgrades, mapping of interfaces or retraining of workforce. We prototyped key pieces of this with real code during the selection process over the last few months. We are already very close. This puts us on a path to accelerate a lot of the work done by the industry today, embracing and advancing current standards much more quickly.","The third part of our alignment together is time-driven, activity-based costing. It's somewhat simple that if you're going to bend the cost curve in the industry, you have to know your costs. Most EMRs of today will have to be significantly redesigned and rewritten to become a true resource management system that provides insights into activities, methods and costs. I believe if we successfully blend executable content with more precision of activities inside an open EMR, my 20% estimate on bending the cost curve could be too low.","In closing, I want to share my perspective on how I view Intermountain and my role in the relationship. The Institute of Medicine published a series of books on the characteristics and journey of The Learning Healthcare System. The quick summary being a system that is continuously innovating and improving in its ability to deliver high value to patients through continuous learning, best care and lower cost. Working with Intermountain over the last several months, it's the closest I've seen to having this concept embedded into the culture of everything they do. There's a quiet confidence that they will continue to get better not only for themselves or the communities they serve but as a model for the industry to learn from. This is inherent in their mission. Alignment will be very natural for us. We share the same why: we are doing this because it's personal.","As a result, the decision for me to move to Salt Lake City to focus on joint innovation was actually an easy one. It's tremendous opportunity for Cerner, and we are setting the bar high as our goal is to literally transform the industry with a world-class partner. Note that I will still be maintaining my existing client relationships and my Chief of Staff responsibilities at Cerner. I look forward to providing you updates on future calls and investor days.","With that, I'll open the line up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Robert Jones from Goldman Sachs.","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Zane, you mentioned a lot of buzz following the Intermountain win, and I was hoping you could maybe just give us an update on what you're seeing as far as the EMR replacement pipeline. Are you seeing actually more RFPs at this point in the wake of the Intermountain win? And just how should we be contemplating the pace of additional wins from here?","Zane M. Burke","Robert, I think it's a little early to say in terms of it's driving new RFPs in the door. What I would say is, it enhances kind of the whole competitive process, and our pipeline is at an all-time high. So we are at an all-time high in that space, and the business feels very strong. I think it just solidifies what many of our clients and prospects are seeing is just the success that we've had in the marketplace in both delivering and in preparing for the future.","Marc G. Naughton","This is Marc. Not just new RFPs that could be impacted by this but existing RFPs that we are in a process today, almost to a client or a potential client, that's made a big impression on those -- the people we're talking with as far as future clients of Cerner.","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. I guess just my follow-up just around Intermountain. Could you guys give us any more of a sense of the breakdown between what percent of the bookings are EMR versus RevWorks? And then, I guess, just as we look forward, any guidance you can give us on how we should be thinking about revenue recognition around this win?","Marc G. Naughton","This is Marc. There's no RevWorks included in this, just...","Jeffrey A. Townsend","Rev Cycle.","Marc G. Naughton","Yes, it's Rev Cycle but not RevWorks. The -- I mean, from a size perspective, we've seen analysts' estimates of $100 million to $125 million for this -- the first deal that's contemplated, and those are probably in about the right range. Relative to breakout between all the different elements, it's really focused broadly across all of our suite of solutions currently but does not have a lot of our other service offerings in it today.","Zane M. Burke","This is Zane. Just as a reminder, none of that was in Q3. That would be a Q4 expectation.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Richard Close from Avondale Partners.","Richard C. Close - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","Marc, I was wondering if you could just comment on a modeling question in terms of in the third quarter, the sales and client services seemed to take up quite a bit versus as a percentage of revenue. Can you just go into that a little bit for us?","Marc G. Naughton","On the quarter -- on a year-over-year basis?","Richard C. Close - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","Well, I think it came in at around 42% of revenue, if I'm not mistaken, and it's up almost a couple of hundred basis points from the most recent quarter, second quarter.","Marc G. Naughton","Yes. I mean, other than the continued strength in our services business, including the works businesses that have been added in for the quarter, I think if you really -- when you talk -- anytime you're going to have a question on the percent of revenue, it's going to lead back to weak hardware and the lower amount of hardware that's coming through system sales. So it's naturally going to make everything else a higher percent of revenue than it was before.","Richard C. Close - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then, I guess, a follow-up on a different note. Can you guys talk a little bit about Revenue Cycle management in the Physician segment where you're having success? Or are you having success there? And maybe your -- the size of that business, if you could put any numbers in and around that?","Zane M. Burke","This is Zane. I'll defer on the numbers side, but what I'll say is that business is growing exponentially for us, very fast growth. We have had a number of wins, including some of the known competitors out there in this space. I think there's an absolute desire for physicians to offload this work as they go into the ICD-10 era. So as they start to look at what it takes to actually operate in that era and then the era beyond ICD-10, there's a desire by the health systems and the physicians themselves to look to offload those services. That has been a significant growth area for us, and we're doing extremely well against our competitors in that space.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sean Wieland from Piper Jaffray.","Sean W. Wieland - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Another question on Intermountain Healthcare. Can you somehow quantify how this relationship accelerates your R&D time line? Specifically, I'm looking -- and the answer what I'm looking for is, how long would it have taken for you to build these Care Process Models on your own?","Jeffrey A. Townsend","This is Jeff. The -- I think the acceleration for us, we use the word intelligence to mean the -- you're moving from kind of a workflow that is forced or designed around data capture to a workflow that is guided, filled with recommendations and insights. So I don't know that from just a pure clinical evidence. That's not a core competency of Cerner historically to go out and look at clinical guidelines and directly develop those pieces of content. The piece where we think it accelerates this is we're now building that in unison. So as the clinical evidence comes together, that's being built in unison with the workflow, in the context of when those decisions are made. And that takes a lot of time in a traditional cycle, where if we're doing that at the edge, it's the term we use, we think it will speed things up significantly.","Sean W. Wieland - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay. And then as you know, Intermountain has a history of chewing up and spitting out vendors. And just tell us -- you've certainly made a huge commitment yourself personally, but tell us how you're -- in recognition of that, how you're going about servicing this customer?","Jeffrey A. Townsend","I think the -- and this will be kind of in my words, but the difference here is, can we quickly put in the core so that we can get to what I classify as the fun stuff, the intelligence? So if you want to go back and look at progress and activities over time, not just Intermountain but at other large organizations with strong internal IT or informatics, they end up spending a lot of time to get the core to get to the fun stuff. So we look at this as somewhat of a traditional, very accelerated though, implementation to get the basics in place so that we can harness their skills and talents for the really hard, sophisticated things that sit over the top. So we're not concerned about any of the experiences of the past. We think this is a little bit different. We're not building from scratch.","Operator","And the next question comes from the line of Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.","Gavin Weiss - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","This is Gavin Weiss in for Lisa. First, Marc, if I think I heard you correctly, you mentioned that this is the last quarter of the tech resale comp. So how should we think about the impact to margins going forward from the lapsing of that comp?","Marc G. Naughton","Well, this is -- last year, we had the comp through most of the year, so basically, Q4 will be the last quarter that's in front of us where we have the tougher comp. After that, as we move into 2014, the numbers, given the things that Mike talked about, the additional device offerings, the CareAware Connect, all of these new and exciting things that we're bringing to market and selling to our clients, those will gradually start to increase that technology resale bucket kind of as we go forward. So we had a bolus in 2012. '13, we kind of have that put behind us. And starting in '14, we should start seeing kind of year-over-year incremental growth in that space as opposed to the declines that we've been experiencing. So going forward in '14, it shouldn't be a drag on my revenue growth. It should actually be contributing to my revenue growth.","Gavin Weiss - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","But we should expect some impact to margins from that revenue growth?","Marc G. Naughton","You will get some impact, but to the extent that it grows at a kind of a normalized rate relative to the growth of the rest of the company, it should have a relatively neutral impact, also depending on the specific margin for the technology resale. Once again, we talk about technology resale being either low-margin hardware, medium-margin hardware. There are higher-margin elements of it as well. So there's still a different mix, but it likely doesn't change the overall margin view significantly because we expect it to kind of grow at the rate of the rest of revenue.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser from Morgan Stanley.","Saurabh Singh - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","This is actually Saurabh Singh for Ricky Goldwasser. I just had a question about -- as we look at your contract backlog and your bookings, how should we think about the time horizon for how they convert into revenues and whether that's still consistent with a high single-digit revenue growth rate?","Marc G. Naughton","Yes, this is Marc. I think the mix with about 30% of our bookings kind of on average, being on the long term, extends the overall backlog length slightly, but there is 2 components of that backlog. I think a bunch of the backlog does roll out in the next year. The remainder kind of comes out over the next 2.5 years. So the contribution from backlog, given a lot of these things that we've been booking have that longer-term smooth -- smoothing of the revenue, it should continue to help grow our bookings. Obviously, any year in which we have significant booking success, as we have so far this year, feeding our backlog, that's going to contribute significantly to next year's revenue. We would expect, when we start next year, that we'd have 75% of that year's revenue basically in backlog or things that are easily converted into revenue. So we should be in the same shape as we have been kind of in the last year.","Saurabh Singh - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And one more question, if I may. What is your view on hospital health care IT CapEx budgets over the next year? Do you see them as increasing?","Zane M. Burke","This is Zane. I wouldn't necessarily say I see them as increasing, but I think what you see is there's absolute understanding. They've got to use IT as a lever to go affect the cost and quality in their organization. And so I think the allocation of capital towards those initiatives will continue to be very strong.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of George Hill from Deutsche Bank.","George Hill","I've got one strategic for Zane, and then I got a couple of housekeeping for Marc. Zane, on the Intermountain win, I guess, could you give us a quick 30 seconds, or minute on how the competitive process on this shook down between you and your closest competitor? And then what has been the reaction from prospects like after this win? And is it something that you guys can market to go win more business? Because you guys -- it's been a while since you guys have picked up a client that looks like Intermountain.","Zane M. Burke","So, George, I'm going to answer, actually, the second part of your question, and then I'm going to turn it back to Jeff for his specific commentary around Intermountain, given his direct involvement there. As it relates to the total marketplace, it has certainly emboldened our existing client base that they're on the right path, that they have chosen the right partner. And through all the success that we've had, the win here is just yet another piece of validation that they're on the right path as they look towards the future. So there's the existing client base, which is incredibly important because we have a lot of work still to go do together with our existing clients. On the new business side, it has -- I think it's a validation of what prospects are seeing when they take a look at Cerner. So when they look at us, they see all these great things in terms of both -- what we do from a -- what we can do today and what we're planning to do in the future era. And having the validation of someone like an Intermountain, where the world is moving to cost and quality. And they are the low-cost, high-quality provider, and that's what the marketplace needs to go after, absolutely validates us that -- it validates what they're already seeing when they look at us. They already see those things when they look at us, and it validates what they see. So I think it's incredibly impactful as we think -- move forward because it is a validation of what they're seeing as they take a look at us through the process. And, Jeff, I'll let you comment on the Intermountain specifics.","Jeffrey A. Townsend","Yes. I would say it was a more sophisticated process than typical. So there is kind of the traditional RFP scripted demos, site visit-type thing that would be very EMR-specific. But then in parallel to that was a much deeper look at architecture, future-proofing. And as Zane kind of outlined, where do we go from here? So a commitment to be open, a commitment to have cost and quality as a core premise and then, most importantly, being the readiness for population health. Are you really going to be able to not only bend the cost curve but ultimately impact the health status of those communities? Because in their case, they're further along than most in that they also have a health plan. And so there is a closed-loop environment there not only for research and for cost but on bending the total cost curve of the entire dollar, not just the portion that the provider gets. So all of that came together in a 9- to 12-month process to go really deep, and they look at it much like we do. This is not a project, this is a decade, if not a 2-decade-type relationship, between 2 organizations.","George Hill","Okay. And then Marc -- Jeff, I appreciate that. The quick housekeeping questions. Well, I'll say one is you guys have about $1.5 billion in cash now on the balance sheet, uses of cash. And then the second part is I wanted to follow up on Richard's question about the growth in sales and client service. You refer to them as revenue-generating sales in client services, client service people. You saw support and maintenance revenue grow 17% and change. You saw the growth in sales and client service expenses grow 17%-ish. Should we expect those 2 line items to track closely together with respect to growth rates, with maybe just a touch of margin in the near term?","Marc G. Naughton","I'd have to think about that one for a second, George. You're so much smarter than I am.","George Hill","Hardly.","Marc G. Naughton","I have to get my pencil out and do that one, but maybe I can get back to you on that one.","George Hill","Okay. How about just the cash?","Marc G. Naughton","The cash? Still have $1.5 billion. We've actually been investing a significant component of our free cash flow, as you all have seen, investing it both in development and looking at, certainly, strategic acquisitions, which we've done this year. And then I think a major component is that we've returned $170 million to shareholders this year. So I think relative to the near-term use of that cash, I think we're kind of trying to hit all the bases that we think -- the opportunities for this company are huge. The momentum shift we had with Intermountain and Einstein is dramatically opening up doors that some people would have thought weren't going to be available to us. So we're investing. We're putting one of the smartest guys we have, Jeff Townsend, with Intermountain to drive that faster, to create more intelligence that we can make available to our other clients. So we're going to keep investing. We keep think it's a good idea to invest internally rather than to try and go buy companies because there really isn't a company out there that does the kind of stuff we do. We will buy some things around the edges. So I think going forward, we're going to continue to invest internally through, certainly, the first half of 2014. We're going to certainly consider whether another stock buyback program is appropriate next year. And we'll continue to make small strategic acquisitions that fit into this overall architecture as we go forward.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Jeff Garro with William Blair & Company.","Jeffrey Garro - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","So I wanted to ask about the data warehouse platform and the Healthe Intent registry system. I want to get a sense of the amount of development work that still needs to be done there in terms of building out different predictive modeling scenarios, kind of how far along are you. And at what point do you need to get to really scale this out to the larger client base?","Jeffrey A. Townsend","I'll take that. I think on the smart registries is we look at that as kind of the entry set of modules. I would say there's somewhere around 15 to 20 of those focused around the most common conditions and diagnoses. What you'll see is the next wave of solutions moves beyond kind of the warehousing, reporting, analytics level to a tighter, what we call, closed-loop engagement. So if you have identified all the individuals based on their conditions and needs, you've matched them to the providers, then there's another wave of applications that will be a hybrid of EMR and what we call new workforce. So care managers utilization, not so much utilization review but more utilization management from a demand perspective. So we think we can more efficiently match supply and demand across the population into those lower-cost venues and still achieve better outcomes. So the registry piece is wave one from a market perspective. We think that offering is ahead of the majority of what's out there in the market as both proven by Advocate's selection, but then they recently -- about the same time we had our conference, they have a symposium they do that has participants from across the country. And so that's the stage most are in. We're now moving ahead to how do you now action that data, and move away from just quality scores to actually impact that. So that's -- the majority of the 2014 focus is to make that actionable to where you now engage both the individual patient, as well as the provider.","Marc G. Naughton","Just to provide -- this is Marc. Just to provide a little color. In Q3, we actually sold to a brand-new, a non-Cerner client, HIE, various elements, this Patient Portal, that qualified as one of our deals over $5 million. And we expect actually to complete some of the solutions in the pop [population] health space to that client in Q4 as an additional sale that will be a similar size. So when you start looking at the marketplace that's outside of Cerner's existing client base or includes people outside our existing client base and that just, today, selling it kind of as a software ASP-type solution, you can have a $10 million opportunity. Multiply that times all the other opportunities we think are out there. And even what we have today is a significant revenue opportunity, let alone what Jeff is going to be creating.","Jeffrey Garro - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","That's great. And then just kind of a quick follow-up there. Marc seemed to start to touch on some of this, but with this kind of evolving and hybrid model that you're moving to in terms of a revenue model and a sales process, how should we think about this product set differently than your core offerings?","Marc G. Naughton","Well, I think -- this is Marc. From going to market, certainly, there's a little bit of a different sell. You're selling potentially to different people inside the organization, but it's not a whole lot different than what we do with all of the wide variety of solutions that we have. Each of our solution groups can be sold to a different organization or different focus within an organization. So there's nothing new. We kind of know how to sell things. We have a very informed client organization that does a very good job of that. And in addition to the one I mentioned, I'm aware of at least 3 or 4 more in the pipeline that have similar characteristics. So I think this is just something -- this is inherent into what Cerner does. It's just the natural extension of what we've been working on for 30 years. So there's -- I don't know, Jeff, if you have any comments.","Jeffrey A. Townsend","Well, I think the -- you'll see, from a business model perspective, you'll see all the same -- similar capabilities -- licenses, subscriptions, technology. The mix of that may be a little bit different, and the throttle will definitely be different. So instead of number of physicians or users or beds, you're going to see things being more PMPM or size of population, but it will have -- the component parts underneath there will look very much the same.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Stockton.","Jamie Stockton - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I guess maybe the first one, Mike or Zane, I don't know who wants to take it, it's on Revenue Cycle software. There were a lot of standing-room-only meetings at your user conference talking about your Revenue Cycle software. So there's obviously a lot of interest. On the other hand, we have these deadlines that are looming in 2014 for ICD-10. So I'm just curious, internally, when you guys think about the conversations that you're having around leveraging your clinical footprint to sell more Revenue Cycle software, how do you think the deadlines are going to impact those conversations? Will they accelerate them? Will there be a point some time next year where things start to kind of settle down? Any thoughts on that would be great.","Zane M. Burke","Jamie, this is Zane. I would share that -- I agree with what you saw, which is there is a lot of interest in our Revenue Cycle solutions by our clients, both acute and ambulatory. And the success that we're having in a number of clients is bringing that to light. Most clients have a plan for ICD-10 today. So they've got a plan. They're now preparing for the future. It's much like I've discussed before, which is, our clients are buying for the future. They're buying for the changes that are going to occur both in the -- for a regulatory perspective and a reimbursement perspective. And they know that they're going to need to contemporize their Revenue Cycle solutions and really get closer to a clinically-driven Revenue Cycle. And hence, it's a combination of our maturity coming together at the time when they are going to be preparing themselves for some of those future Revenue Cycle needs that they have and the changes in business model. And so I would anticipate that we will continue to see significant increase in the Revenue Cycle solutions going forward.","Jamie Stockton - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then maybe, Marc, on the capitalized R&D, you talked about how the capitalization rates or levels should start to come down maybe after 2014. You've already seen amortization start to creep up some. Are there any dates out there that we should be keeping in mind, or any time frames around when what you have been capitalizing might be triggered from an amortization standpoint around a major software release or anything like that?","Marc G. Naughton","Most of the work is spread along -- around a bunch of different solutions. So there's not any one single package that goes GA that's going to trigger a bunch of the amortization. We'll have things that are going to go GA in Q1 that will start triggering the amortization, and it will continue on through '14 and into '15. So there's no -- it should be more of a kind of a steady addition, and, obviously, you have stuff that's going to roll off as well. But there's no single release trigger that's going to start pulling a lot of the amortization in. As we get closer to those occurring, we'll try to give you some visibility relative to that, but today, I don't expect there to be any unique or single quarter where we have a big hit in that.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Donald Hooker with Gmac [ph].","Unknown Analyst","I guess a lot of people have asked a lot of good questions, but maybe going in a different direction here. You won that deal down in Brazil, which is kind of interesting. It's a new country for you. I don't know too much about the Brazilian health care IT market. I mean, there are 7,000 hospitals there. Can you talk a little bit about -- and I'm sure those hospitals are a lot different than the hospitals up here. And so can you talk about the opportunity in Brazil, kind of the competitive landscape and then maybe talk about some of the other opportunities outside the U.S., you won a few in France and elsewhere, maybe in Asia?","Zane M. Burke","Sure, Donald. This is Zane. So in Brazil, there's a kind of 2-tier system. You've got a for-profit environment and a not-for-profit environment. And the for-profit environment has some more additional funding than perhaps the not-for-profit side of that. So we think there's a pretty good addressable market in that space with the kind of capital necessary to implement systems like Cerner's. We are -- we thought this one was incredibly important from a launch perspective, given this is the most prestigious organization within Latin America and having this as our launch into that and given that the competitive landscape from the other HIT suppliers is pretty -- is a little bit more limited. We thought this was an important one. So we're very excited about that. Given that Brazil is also the fifth-largest economy in the world and one of the fastest growing as well, we see that as a great growth opportunity for us. As we've discussed previously, Australia, Canada, the Middle East have been very strong marketplaces for us, and we continue to see those as strong markets. We anticipate that the U.K. will be a good -- will come off of a rebound and be very strong as well. And if we can get contributions like we did from France, those are bonuses. But the French market hasn't really turned yet, to date. But we'd anticipate continued strength from those other core marketplaces, as well as a resurgence coming on in the U.K. over time.","Unknown Analyst","I was curious in terms of some of the -- in the U.S., some of the managed services and hosting services you provide hospitals. Are you -- kind of where are you strong there internationally as well? Because I would assume that would be kind of maybe one of your -- drivers of your success over the years in the U.S. in terms of replicating that overseas.","Zane M. Burke","Donald, that does represent a great opportunity for us in those other marketplaces, and we've invested in data centers and a few of those marketplaces and will continue to evaluate that. But, obviously, our business model plays well in the continued services. And the need for those kinds of services are not just unique to the U.S. marketplace. They are absolutely applicable in the global market.","Marc G. Naughton","Yes, Don, this is Marc. I would -- relative to what Zane said about investing in data centers globally, our approach globally is a little different than the U.S., where you build and own data centers. We'll just -- globally, we intend to co-locate in appropriate locations so that we minimize the initial capital investment we have to do in those places. But certainly, it plays as well, if not better, than it does in the U.S.","Neal L. Patterson","Okay. With that, this is Neal. I guess to somewhat prove that I'm here, the -- but there isn't a question you all asked that the team didn't do a better job than I would have of answering it. So appreciate everybody's time here this afternoon, your interest in our company. So we certainly wake up every morning at the intersection of health care and IT, and we do it worldwide. There's a huge amount of opportunity in front of us. We have an extraordinarily productive -- we've been highly productive and made a lot of progress in the company for some period here. This summer was a very fun cumulation of a number of different initiatives that came together and, I think, propel us forward here. So our clients, and it's really our clients worldwide, basically, have to focus in today's world around the cost of what they -- how they deliver care and the quality, and the measurable quality of care they deliver. Certainly, in the United States, there is -- the kind of the tomorrow side of what they think they have to be able to do is be much more responsible for the health of the population. So the investments we're -- that we've accelerated here over the last couple of years, really, are focusing on both the current -- the now side of what our clients need and what we think the next side. So we've got a very good team. We're at a good place. I will, though -- my final comment will -- is one that many of you have heard from me many times, what we do, though, is hard, is complex, and even on the best of days, there's a level of ambiguity as to what the right answer is. But we're doing well. We are going to continue working our rears off here and serving our clients and expanding -- growing this company.","Thank you.

Today's date is October 24, 2019, and this call is being recorded.","The company has asked me to remind you that various remarks made here today constitute forward-looking statements, including without limitation, those regarding projections of future revenues or earnings; operating margins; operating and capital expenses; bookings; new solution, services and offering development; capital allocation plans; cost optimization and operation improvement initiatives; future business outlook, including new markets or prospects for the company's solutions and services and expected benefits of certain of our collaborations.","Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements may be found under Item 1A in Cerner's Form 10-K, together with the company's other filings.","A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this earnings call can be found in the company's earnings release which is furnished to the SEC today and posted on the Investors section of cerner.com. Cerner assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information except as required by law.","At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Brent Shafer, Chairman and CEO of Cerner Corporation. You may begin.","Brent Shafer","Thank you, Toronto. Good afternoon, everyone. And welcome to the call. I'll spend the first few moments providing my thoughts on the business and then I'll ask our CFO, Marc Naughton, to take you through the financial results. When Marc concludes, our Chief Client Officer, John Peterzalek, will provide some marketplace commentary. And I have also asked Don Trigg, our EVP of Strategic Growth, to talk about Cerner's growth strategies.","It's been an eventful quarter at Cerner. At the end of July, we announced our collaboration agreement with AWS and Amazon and the company has made good progress around our transformation efforts.","And we recently concluded our annual healthcare conference, Cerner Healthcare Conference, and it was really another successful CHC where we hosted over 11,000 clients, partners, media and other healthcare affiliates from around the world.","The theme of this year's conference was \"Now and Next.\" And during my keynote, I shared Cerner's improvements in addressing our clients need today and our innovation plans for the future.","Now, as we discussed last quarter, our strategic framework to deliver on this innovation and growth is focused on three key areas \u2013 software as a service, health networks and data as a service.","Our recently announced relationship with AWS and Amazon is foundational to these areas. Our work with AWS is expected to enable delivery of scalable and secure solutions in a faster, more agile way, with the power of advanced artificial intelligence and machine learning tools embedded in the workflow.","Our clients can expect to see advancement in the overall user experience for consumers and care teams, as well as their overall health system and financial operations.","We plan to modernize our platforms and software development approach, increase the pace of innovation and speed to market and lower the operational burdens for our clients.","This also represents an opportunity to reduce Cerner's costs over time and is part of our focus on long-term profitability improvements.","Further, the possibilities with the Cerner and Amazon collaboration are substantial given their vast consumer knowledge.","I'd also like to provide an update on other activity that's part of Cerner's broader transformation. We spent most of this year focused on identifying and addressing inefficiencies and cost optimization opportunities.","And while this work is ongoing, we are now putting additional focus on other improvements to drive long-term business transformation. This includes work on capability building, automation, product management and go-to-market strategy.","To help us deliver on the market and product management elements of our transformation, we recently created and filled the [Technical Difficulty] September. Now, Darrell Johnson is joining us from Cerner following his successful career at Medtronic and he has very deep expertise in healthcare data ecosystems and is a recognized leader in marketing innovations and global brand positioning for devices, software, services and data platforms.","I believe instituting this new CMO role and integrating strategic marketing into our organizational structure will strengthen Cerner's portfolio and product management processes and also improve our brand and go-to-market strategies.","As it relates to the financial results, I'm pleased with this quarter's numbers. Against the backdrop of advancing our transformation, the team executed and delivered against the expectations we set. Now, there's more work to do, but I'm confident that we have the right balance-of-focus on executing in the near-term and recalibrating the company for long-term and the profitable growth ahead.","And I'd like to hand the call over to Marc.","Marc Naughton","Thanks, Brent. Good afternoon, everyone. I am going to cover our Q3 results and future guidance.","In the quarter, we delivered solid bookings, revenue and earnings. I'll start with bookings, which were $1.651 billion in Q3, up 4% over Q3 of 2018 and at the high end of our guidance range.","We ended the quarter with a revenue backlog of $13.31 billion, which is down 9% from a year ago primarily due to the termination of a large outsourcing contract that I'll discuss in a minute.","Also recall that our backlog calculation under the new revenue standard excludes revenue from contracts with termination clauses, even though such clauses are rarely exercised, and we had a higher-than-usual amount of these types of contracts in Q3.","When you combine the expected revenue from our backlog and the additional revenue expected from contracts not included in backlog, our revenue visibility remains at approximately 85% over the next 12 months.","Revenue in the quarter was $1.429 billion, up 7% over Q3 of 2018 and in line with our expectations.","I'll now go through the business model detail and year-over-year growth compared to Q3 of 2018. Licensed software revenue in Q3 was $155 million, up 10% over Q3 of 2018 driven primarily by our strong growth in our SaaS offerings.","Technology resale of $70 million increased 16% compared to both Q3 of 2018 and last quarter. Subscriptions revenue grew 16% to $92 million. Professional services revenue grew 11% to $507 million, primarily driven by solid growth in implementation services.","Managed services was flat at $302 million, with the lack of growth primarily related to the phase out of revenue from Health Services clients that made the decision to leave in past years and are just now getting transitioned out of our data centers.","Note that our retention rate for Health Services clients is solid at about 80%, but there is still some impact from those that have left.","Overall, attrition remains very low and we expect managed services to return to modest growth in 2020.","Support and maintenance was also flat at $277 million, which is in line with our expectations and also reflects the impact of attrition.","And finally, reimbursed travel of $26 million was up 6%.","Looking at revenue by geographic segment, domestic revenue was up 6% from the year-ago quarter at $1.265 billion and international revenue of $164 million was up 8% year-over-year.","Moving to gross margin. Our gross margin for Q3 was 81.0%, down from 81.2% in Q2 of 2019 and 82.8% year-over-year driven by higher third-party services, largely related to our federal business and a lower margin mix within technology resale.","Now, I will discuss spending, operating margin and net earnings. For these items, we provide both GAAP and adjusted or non-GAAP, results. The adjusted results exclude share-based compensation expense, share-based compensation permanent tax items, acquisition-related adjustments, organizational restructuring and other expenses, and investment gains that are detailed and reconciled to GAAP in our earnings release.","Included in the organizational restructuring line this quarter is a $60 million charge related to the termination of our revenue cycle outsourcing contract with Adventist Health.","This was a joint decision based on what we agreed was best for both parties and is also related to our previously communicated portfolio management process. This will result in revenue cycle operations being assumed by Adventist and Huron beginning in early November, with nearly 1,700 Cerner associates transitioning back to Adventist Health and Huron at that time. This will reduce annual revenue by approximately $170 million, but have little impact on earnings.","Note that Adventist Health has re-committed to all clinical and revenue cycle solutions and ITWorks services. This only pertains to the revenue cycle outsourcing services.","One other item of note that is included in GAAP results but not our adjusted results is the $9 million non-operating unrealized gain on one of our equity investments.","Now, I'll walk through our operating expenses. Our third quarter GAAP operating expenses of $1.069 billion were up 18% compared to $903 million in the year-ago period, largely driven by the restructuring charges.","Our adjusted operating expenses were up 6% compared to Q3 of 2018. Looking at the line items for Q3, sales and client service expense increased 6% year-over-year, primarily driven by an increase in personnel expense related to the growth in professional services.","Software development expense increased 10% over Q3 of 2018, driven by a 7% increase in gross R&D, a 6% increase in amortization, and flat capitalized software.","G&A expense was down 8%, driven by a decline in both personnel and non-personnel expenses.","Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles decreased slightly year-over-year.","Moving to operating margins. Our GAAP operating margin in Q3 was 6.2% compared to 15.5% in the year-ago period. Our adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 18.1%, down from 19.2% in Q3 of 2018, but up from 18.0% last quarter and in-line with our expectations.","The adjusted operating margin implied by our revenue and earnings guidance that I'll discuss in a moment implies an expected adjusted operating margin slightly over our targeted 20% for Q4.","We also believe our ongoing business optimization efforts keep us on track for delivering our targeted Q4 2020 adjusted operating margin of 22.5%.","As I mentioned last quarter, we believe our ongoing cost optimization and business simplification efforts position us to continue improving our profitability beyond 2020.","Further, we believe our platform modernization and move to the cloud represents another driver of margin improvement longer term. This will be a multi-year process, particularly for Millennium, and most near-term benefit is largely offset by modernization investment.","However, we expect the lower operating costs associated with this move, along with efficiencies and improvements we are driving in our development process, to meaningfully contribute to our profitability, while also helping us deliver a differentiated solution to our clients at a lower total cost of ownership.","Moving to net earnings and EPS, our GAAP net earnings in Q3 were $82 million or $0.26 per diluted share, which is down from $0.51 in Q3 of 2018. Adjusted net earnings in Q3 were $212 million and adjusted diluted EPS was $0.66 compared to $0.63 in Q3 of 2018.","Our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates were both approximately 20% in Q3.","Moving to our balance sheet, we ended Q3 with $633 million of cash and short-term investments, which is down from $954 million last quarter with our free cash flow being offset by $400 million of share repurchases.","For the year, we have repurchased 14.4 million shares for $1 billion at an average price of $69.53, and currently have $483 million of remaining authorization under our repurchase program.","Moving to debt, our total debt remained flat to last quarter at $1.039 billion.","Total receivables ended the quarter at $1.155 billion, down from $1.229 billion in Q2 of 2019. Our Q3 DSO was 74 days, which is down from 78 days in Q2 of 2019 and 82 days in the year-ago period.","Operating cash flow for the quarter was $351 million. Q3 capital expenditures were $111 million and capitalized software was $66 million.","Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less capital purchases and capitalized software development costs, was $174 million for the quarter. We expect free cash flow to remain solid in Q4 and solid growth in free cash flow in 2020.","Moving to capital allocation. As I indicated, we repurchased $1 billion of stock in Q2 and Q3, leaving $483 million remaining on our current authorization. We still expect to execute the majority of the repurchase authorization by the end of Q1 of next year, subject to market conditions and other factors.","We intend to continue funding this with a combination of cash from operations and debt, with the amount of debt depending on the timing of our repurchases and whether we use cash for M&A and other purposes.","Regarding M&A, we did just announce a definitive agreement to acquire AbleVets. The cash consideration for this acquisition is expected to total approximately $75 million and we expect it to close in Q4 of this year.","We expect this to contribute approximately $90 million of revenue in 2020. As John will discuss, AbleVets is a great fit given their experience and the importance of our federal business.","Moving to our dividend program, we paid our first two quarterly dividends of $0.18 per share on July 26th and October 9th.","Now I'll go through guidance. We expect revenue in Q4 to be between $1.41 and $1.46 billion. The midpoint of this range reflects growth of 5% over Q4 of 2018 and would bring full-year 2019 revenue to $5.685 billion, which reflects 6% growth over 2018 and is within our previously provided full-year guidance range.","Note that guidance includes approximately $25 million of impact from the termination of our Adventist RevWorks agreement, and our Q4 guided growth would be 7% without this change. Also note that our guidance reflects minimal impact from AbleVets given it has not closed.","We expect Q4 adjusted diluted EPS to be $0.73 to $0.75 per share. The midpoint of this range is 17% higher than Q4 of 2018 and would bring full-year 2019 adjusted diluted EPS to $2.67, which reflects 9% growth over 2018.","Moving to bookings guidance, we expect bookings revenue in Q4 of $1.45 billion to $1.65 billion. The midpoint of this range reflects a 21% decrease compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 and would bring full-year 2019 bookings to $5.876 billion, down 13% from 2018.","Year-over-year decrease in Q4 is primarily driven by a couple of different factors. Historically, Q4 bookings have included large RevWorks extensions from Adventist Health that will no longer occur given the transition of those services back to Adventist.","Additionally, as we've discussed throughout this year, we are taking a more selective approach to low-margin long-term contracts, and this has led to a decline in those types of bookings and that is expected to continue.","We expect to provide our outlook for 2020 on our Q4 call.","In summary, we are pleased with our solid results in the third quarter. We have made good progress this year, but there is still a lot of work to do and we expect to continue executing against our plan as we finish 2019 and move into 2020.","With that, I'll turn the call over to John.","John Peterzalek","Thanks, Marc. Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I will provide results, highlights and a quick update on our federal business.","I'll start with our bookings, which grew 4% over last year and were at the high-end of our guidance. Consistent with recent quarters, we had a lower level of long-term bookings compared to last year, with the percent of bookings coming from long-term contracts in the quarter at 29% compared to 34% in Q3 of last year. Excluding these long-term bookings, our bookings grew at a double-digit rate in Q3.","We had solid contributions this quarter from all key areas, including revenue cycle, federal, and our strategic growth businesses, which include population health, health networks, employer, consumer, data-as-a-service, and other adjacent markets.","Coming out of our health conference early this month, I had several positive takeaways. First, our clients are creating tremendous value with our solutions. Clients led over 200 presentations, education sessions and demonstrations where these accomplishments were shared with over 11,000 attendees.","They are committed to getting current and staying current, which is an important foundation for our longer-term shift to a single-instance cloud platform.","They are excited and enthusiastic about our collaboration with AWS and Amazon, our commitment to innovation and the vast opportunities that a cloud-enabled platform brings.","Finally, we heard positive feedback on our revenue cycle progress, and this sentiment is also reflected in our pipeline, which includes some large clients initiating the move to Cerner's revenue cycle.","I also wanted to share a noteworthy success story that demonstrates the benefits of changes we have made over the past 18 months to become more client centric.","This client is an academic system that had low satisfaction with their Cerner solutions just a couple of years ago. By turning our focus to getting them current on our latest software release and strong alignment with our model experience, they have become a top reference site with strong system performance and improved clinician productivity.","We are also in the process of converting 125 of their clinics from our primary competitor's system to Cerner. This demonstrates the value of our client-centric operating model with a focus on getting clients current, aligned with standards, and which helps make them successful and can drive broad levels of satisfaction and opportunities to expand our relationship.","Now, I'll provide an update on our federal business where we had a very busy quarter. We brought a wave of four sites live for DoD in September and expect the next wave of sites to go live in the fall of 2020.","We are also kicking off the Coast Guard project this quarter. For VA, we expect the initial operating capability go-live and the kick-off for additional waves to occur in the spring of 2020.","Before I close, I'd like to provide a little more color on the AbleVets acquisition that Marc mentioned. We believe bringing the AbleVets team on board will provide Cerner additional capacity and technical expertise that will be very valuable in the federal space.","As a trusted partner in our EHR modernization program with the VA, they are highly specialized in cybersecurity, agile engineering, analytics, technology enablement, with deep experience in delivering value to federal health clients.","As we prepare for the upcoming key milestones on our federal projects, integrating the AbleVets team into our business is a natural next step, as we expect their expertise will accelerate Cerner's success in providing integrated, seamless care for veterans, service members and their families.","With that, I'll turn the call back over to Don.","Donald Trigg","Thanks, John. Good afternoon, everyone.","We believe our vision to create a health network architecture for providers of care in every community will be realized in the coming decade. The addressable market is far larger than the integrated EMR category that Cerner helped to created and progress was made in the third quarter to lead it.","One of the strongest provider brands in healthcare is Pennsylvania-based Geisinger. They share our vision to architect a system of health and care. In Q3, Geisinger designated our EMR-agnostic HealtheIntent as their preferred health network platform for a 10-year term. They also will continue to leverage our Wellbeing application for member engagement within their health plan.","Market reaction has been quite favorable. Health systems are seeking solutions to help them scale growing health networks with high levels of technology heterogeneity and a shifting mix of employed and affiliated physicians. Cerner is well-positioned to meet that market need.","Beyond Geisinger, the emerging market reach of HealtheIntent can be seen in the recently released CMS data on Medicare shared savings ACO performance. CMS announced over $700 million in 2018 MSSP savings. After accounting for shared savings and losses, Cerner clients generating nearly more than $200 million of those savings via their MSSP ACOs. Advocate Physician Partners or APP, Hackensack Alliance and Memorial Hermann were among the top performers.","As long-term and post-acute care become an increasingly meaningful part of the health network, we also took steps in Q3 to strengthen our continuum of care strategy. We announced ResMed's Brightree home health product will be our go-forward market solution.","ResMed and Cerner also will use HealtheIntent as a health network platform for post-acute care assets. This strategy, coupled with condition and therapeutic-specific analytic opportunities in areas like sleep, give ResMed and Cerner the potential to build a category-leading presence in a post-acute market that we believe has significant momentum.","In the state government space, we extended a meaningful relationship in the third quarter with the Texas Department of Aging and Disability to bring a holistic care offering to Texas senior and disabled population.","It's a solid use case for how Cerner's extended care and behavioral health assets, our managed services, our proven history of innovation and our solid delivery record created a compelling win strategy.","We also announced an investment and partnership in the third quarter with i2i Systems. i2i commands 25% market share within the federally qualified health centers segment, covers nearly a third of all Medicaid patient data and has a strong payer business with 13 managed care clients.","The relationship already has delivered our first material win, a FQHC\/community health network based in North Carolina. Cerner technology will help provide Medicaid recipients with care coordination and management across a state level network looking to tackle rising Medicaid costs.","Whether the financing model is Medicaid, Medicare Advantage or commercial insurance, we see the person at the center of any true health network architecture.","During Q3, we delivered a new version of our Wellbeing application. We also launched a consumer framework that delivers one seamless consumer experience for both our application as well as client-developed and 3rd party applications. As part of that overall strategy, we added consumer self-pay capabilities from Palo Alto-based Simplee and we also augmented our patient access and online scheduling capabilities through a partnership with Boston-based Kyruus.","Cerner's health network architecture vision has four core pillars: Automate the care process; connect the person; structure, store and study the data; and then close the loop by pushing those analytic insights back into the care process.","I believe our health network architecture vision is more relevant today than when it was first sketched for an MBA class in the 1990s. Our strategic urgency to advance it has never been greater, and the quarter just concluded was foundational for doing so.","With that, let me turn the call back to Brent.","Brent Shafer","Thanks a lot, Don. And thank you all for being on the call. As you heard from the team, we are continuing to execute against our targets and advance our strategies.","And just to summarize, our transformation work remains on track and is advancing beyond cost optimization to include broader structure and process changes and automation.","We are executing against opportunities in our core while also building pipeline and capabilities in our strategic growth areas.","And we are actively executing our portfolio management strategy and demonstrating increased willingness to partner when it accelerates opportunities and strengthens our capabilities.","In summary, I believe this represents solid progress on our pursuit of sustainable and profitable growth which I believe can be achieved while playing a key role in driving meaningful improvements in health care quality and efficiency.","Now, I'll turn the call over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette with Barclays. Your line is open.","Unidentified Participant","Hi. This is Jonathan Young on for Steve. I just had a question on the Adventist transition. I'm just curious if it has had any impact on future revenue opportunities. Or, I guess, what the client feedback that you're exiting al these Cerner relationships? And, I guess, to that extent, does it hurt future relationship opportunities where a client may want a one-stop shop type of vendor?","John Peterzalek","This is John Peterzalek. I don't think it hurts either our position or where we're trying to go because what we do is we try to align with the needs of our clients. And as those needs change and they result in something like we did with Adventist. So, as long as we have a good solid reason, explanation and the reason that that happened, it hasn't been an impact. So, we haven't got a tremendous amount of questions about it. And as this is one of the areas we're being more selective about, I think it's understood by our clients in terms of what we're doing. So, in the short term, it hasn't had any negative impact.","Marc Naughton","This is Marc. We talked about being selective, so that doesn't mean we're not going to do certain elements of that business, but we aren't going to do the full outsourcing. We're going to have all the bodies. We can still do tactical assistance to our clients often where they need help, but at margins that are attractive to us. So, when you still add that benefit to that client base without them saying, Cerner can't offer everything I need. So, I think \u2013 and we're seeing that in the marketplace.","Unidentified Participant","Okay. That makes sense. And then, I guess, as we kind of think about the top line revenue algorithm moving forward, how do you expect these exited businesses and future exits to change the top line dynamics? Will you guys end up leaning a bit more on acquisitions moving forward with respect to the 6% to 9% long-term revenue outlook?","Marc Naughton","Yeah, this is Marc. I think, clearly, as we're going through these optimization and restructuring efforts, there will be some level of resets at the top line as certainly we exit certain businesses and certain approaches to driving revenue. But I think if you look at the \u2013 M&A absolutely will be a component of how we look to grow the businesses. I think Don's comments really indicate that we have a lot of internal growth opportunities, some organic growth opportunities. By leveraging those with some M&A to make them go quicker and grow them more quickly, I think, is clearly one of our strategies. So, it's not going to be us just going out and acquiring revenue. It's going to be us investing in the business. And in some cases, that investment will be M&A and a business that can help us grow identified opportunity faster than if we do it organically.","Unidentified Participant","Okay, great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Lindley with Jefferies. Your line is open. Check to see if your phone is on mute.","David Windley","Thanks. Sorry about that. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to follow-up on the portfolio review. Would it be possible to get a little bit more specific as you transition out of the Adventist relationship and revenue cycle, you have I think a remaining small revenue stream with some other revenue cycle services that you're providing. Does it still make sense to stay in that business? And then, I think at your recent \u2013 at THC and the analyst discussion, talked about kind of maybe the varying levels of scale and penetration that you might've achieved in some of your international markets. What are your thoughts about your persistency in international markets? Thanks.","Marc Naughton","Yeah. This is Marc. Clearly, the non-US market is still a huge opportunity and John can comment on that. I think, overall, we are still in the process and working through that portfolio review process. So, I don't want to talk a whole lot about the results of that until we're at a point where we've worked through it and can be more precise. Clearly, one of the things we've talked about for a while is being selective in some of these outsourcing opportunities. And the fact that we could work Adventist who is interested in taking back those associates, every Cerner associate that was working on Adventist now has a job with Adventist. So, all of those people are employed. So, that is a great result for them to take that over. It was consistent with the strategy they currently have, consistent with our strategies. But there are going to be a lot of opportunity. We're going to look at the remainder of that revenue cycle business. If it doesn't meet our selective criteria relative to margins, we're going to determine what needs to be done with that business. From a global perspective, we're going to look at the same lens. We're going to look at the operating margins, the opportunities we see and how we might address those markets in a more efficient method that can drive margins or we might not be driving them today. John, do you have additional comments on the global.","John Peterzalek","Yeah. I'm going to comment on the international market. I still remain incredibly optimistic and positive about the markets outside the US. In a couple of fronts, when we addressed a call or two ago, which there are large RFPs pending or about to be released for some statewide and municipalities and regional components out there that we're looking at pursuing, as well as our strategy of where we have embedded in a country the ability to expand beyond that first initial region or footprints and expand beyond. And both of those are playing out right now. Not to mention opportunities in countries where we've already embedded in, in Canada, UK, Europe, Middle East and Australia. So, outside US still remains a positive opportunity for us, so one we look at opportunities everyday there.","Brent Shafer","No, I was just going to say, just to go back to sort of the previous question on growth and the discussion around portfolio management, from a growth perspective, we're going to be looking at a combination of build by partner strategies, as Marc discussed. I think relevant to that, there's also a divest and partner component that's been a significant piece of how we've been thinking about the business. I think over the last 180 days, there's a good cadence there. Certainly, the decision we made last quarter to partner with GetWell from a myStation perspective which gives us a best-in-class offering there from an experience perspective and with their GetWell Loop asset and in this quarter with the decision around Home Health and the partnership with ResMed. So, I think we are running a process. We have selectively looked to make some decisions there and it's part of a framework that we see continuing into 2020 that will be part of how we position for growth long-term.","David Windley","Got it. Thank you. I'll cede the floor. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Donald Hooker with KeyBanc. Your line is open\/","Donald Hooker","Okay, great. I'd love to hear maybe a little bit more elaboration on the ResMed partnership. Maybe kind of what they brought that you thought you could not do. And did you \u2013 I don't know if it's material, may not be, but roughly the size of the business that you had previously that you're, I guess, sunsetting. Can you talk about that and how that process will play out?","Brent Shafer","Sure. I'll do a little bit of high-level framing on how we thought about the relationship. So, I think first and foremost, we really like the macro trends playing out from an addressable market perspective in the postacute space. We think it's got interesting trend around it, particularly with large regional IDMs who are building out network strategies within their MSA. So, it's a space we like a lot and areas like behavioral health continue to be huge growth areas for us within the strategic growth business.","I think secondly, from a Home Health perspective, you'll recall that we acquired a solution in that space called BeyondNow. So, we we had an acquired solution in that area and we stepped back and looked at it and said, is this an area where we want to make significant investment? Or alternatively, is there a chance for us to partner? We like the Brightree solution offering. It's cloud-based. We think it's industry-leading. It has a very accelerated implementation timeline around it. And as I started the conversation with ResMed, we saw an opportunity for HealtheIntent to be a material network overlay around our postacute assets. And we also thought they brought some interesting sort of non-traditional assets from our perspective around areas like sleep and respiratory that could be very interesting for us as we play through our strategy on a five-year basis and start thinking about member and consumer strategies where that ends up being relevant around premium and first dollar risk strategies. So, that's how we thought about it at the decision tree level, if you will. And I can tell you, as John said, the reaction from Cerner Health Conference and from our early client conversations has been quite positive.","Marc Naughton","This is Marc. From an economic standpoint, it was not contributing a whole lot to revenue. We've not invested in the business significantly. The revenue was actually declining from that business. And by this agreement with ResMed, being able to get some additional dollar from HealtheIntent platforms and leveraging those elements, we actually expect that to turn and actually become a growth business for us, which it hadn't been. But today's contribution is very small. It's a blip on the radar today. And one of the reasons we want to take an action to turn that into something that would be a growth driver going forward.","Donald Hooker","Okay. And then, maybe with regard to the Amazon AWS relationship, how should we think about that juxtaposed against your hosting business over time? Like, how are you going to sort of balance kind of some of the overlap there?","Marc Naughton","Clearly, 80% of our clients are hosted today. First, AWS, there's a kind of strategy of when we're moving things there. HealtheIntent is going to be the first platform when we move there. It's a cloud developed solution that we host today. Very natural to move that over to AWS. And that's the first thing you're going to see move, and we'll have that primarily moved in the first half of next year.","The benefits of doing that are lower cost of operation from using a platform that I can buy on an as-needed basis, hour by hour as opposed to building out the maximum capacity I need at the height and having to provision for that in my data center.","It also allows me to take those data center components and space and rededicate them to projects such as the DoD and the VA, which is significant savings of capital as we roll forward.","So, relative to the hosting versus AWS, at a tactical level, it will drive efficiencies and drive up cost optimization as we move forward. We'll continue to move the platforms. CareAware will be the next platform we move over to AWS. And then, obviously, over time, then we start moving elements and components of Millennium over to that platform. But the first mover is going to be HealtheIntent, perfectly designed to go do that. We already have HealtheIntent running in AWS. All new clients we've had in the last two quarters have been brought up in AWS. So, it will be a very clean transition to go catch those benefits and the capital savings.","Donald Hooker","And real quick, could you say what the currency impact was for foreign revenues?","Brent Shafer","It was slightly negative.","Donald Hooker","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line Stephanie Demko with Citi. Your line is open.","Stephanie Demko","Thank you. And thank you for taking my question, guys. So, I saw some improvement in free cash flow conversion in the quarter. And I was hoping you would kind of walk us through the puts and the takes there that will be impacting your go forward cash flow conversions, just given you have this move away from some of these lower margin outsourcing businesses, [indiscernible] project in AWS, all going online.","Marc Naughton","Yeah. I think as the business moves to more recurring nature \u2013 healthcare is really the challenging collection environment just because of the pace of play. Usually get paid, but it always takes longer to get paid than most businesses. That's why you're actually pretty happy when your DSO is 74 days. But I think as we continue to move and more toward these SaaS business models, toward the monthly payments, you start getting into a mode of where those checks will be more repetitive in nature, similar to our support checks that we get as we go through this business. Obviously, in our mind, as we move to those platforms, it is going to help our conversion, lower our DSO, lower the AR as we move forward. We are very happy with the free cash flow that we delivered this quarter. Very strong and want to replicate that again in Q4 to get us to a fairly good position for 2019. And then, just as a reminder, from overall free cash flow, we'll complete the work on our new campus in the first half of 2020, which will then start allowance for the loss, a lot of the expenditures that are being spent on that campus, adding potentially $100 million of free cash flow as we roll forward past that completion.","Stephanie Demko","Once all of these projects net out in second half of 2020 and beyond, how should we think about your long-term free cash flow conversion evolving?","Marc Naughton","Clearly, as we look forward to 2020 and 2021 and beyond, if you're looking kind of as a percent of adjusted net income, say, we're between 50% to 60% in 2019, we expect to be quickly aggregating that to \u2013 where you're getting to the \u2013 going from the 70s into certainly the mid-80s by the time you get into the kind of the end of the three or four year period. We're not going to be spending more money on buildings. That's clear. So, the cash flow, it's safe. And that will be part of our capital allocation analysis and certainly will help us, both as we look at opportunities to invest in M&A, to invest organically and to look at share repurchases.","Stephanie Demko","Right, thank you. Just one quick follow-up. What drove the backlog decline in the third quarter?","Marc Naughton","The backlog decline, obviously, the AAH contract that was is the backlog isn't in the backlog anymore. So, that was the biggest element.","Stephanie Demko","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of George Hill with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","George Hill","Hey. Good afternoon, guys. And thanks for taking the question. I guess, Marc, are you able to \u2013 or will you quantify for us \u2013 you talked about the roll off of the Adventist business. I guess, can you quantify the total value if we think about it, like, on a 2019 basis of the works business that might roll off?","And then, I guess, as we think about the 2019 and the 2020 margin targets, how much should we think of as kind of the rolling off of the low-margin business versus the cost tackling initiatives the company is taking?","Marc Naughton","Yeah, George. We've been very clear that our focus on the margin expansion is focused on cost optimization and fit-for-growth efficiencies. But the top line impact may impact that one way or the other, but what we're focused on delivering is on the cost side. I think as you look at the AAH business, in Q4, it might be $25 million of revenue impact that's going away. So, that's a sense of what that number looks like. I think the \u2013 so, that will give you a kind of a sense for the total. But I think over the entire time, it's going to be someplace around $150 million, $100 million, someplace in that vicinity would be the annual impact. Once again, from an earnings impact, it's zero impact on the earnings side. And I think that's clearly one of the reasons or the reason we're looking to get out of that business. So, I think there will be some impact. Obviously, if you look at $25 million Q4, that might be 30 basis points of impact. But I think if you look at our guidance, we're kind of guiding to be in a 20-point-something, which kind of takes into account getting to 20 without the impact of that. But I think, once again, our focus is on driving the optimization cost. There will be some impact on top line relative to that, but our focus definitely is on the cost side of the business.","George Hill","That's helpful. And then, maybe just kind of as a follow-up, I think what a lot of investors are going to focus on is the Adventist is going to roll off to, call it, 150, 160. There's probably other business that rolls off. Thinking about the business that rolls off versus the M&A versus kind of what the company's longer-term top line targets which probably will need to be tweaked at the Investor Day, I guess stepping back, kind of \u2013 maybe just do you have a timeframe for when you'll wash through the businesses that you want to exit even if you don't want to quantify them. So, I guess, we can think of when the business re-bases and kind of construct your road back towards the company's long-term targets?","Marc Naughton","Good question. I think our goal through this portfolio management process is to make those decisions, identify those areas. And basically, as we exit 2020, we've got our base of revenue that we are expecting to deliver from and grow from going forward. And ideally, we'll be able to kind of keep investors in the loop as each of those decisions becomes public, what the impact of those is. Because, as you indicated, you have got an element of AAH is going away. But starting 2020, I've got an element of AbleVets that's coming in. Right now, there's going to be a lot of puts and takes. I can't give you with clarity when those are going to hit. But as we roll \u2013 get to the end, we start rolling into the 2020, we should be able to give you a better view of kind of the revenue that is in the bucket that we think is likely something that we're going to adjust out relative to portfolio management and the other things that we would expect to be able to bring in as we roll forward.","The point that you're getting to is really important is that 2020 will reset the base, our revenue number. And it's going to be at the \u2013 taking out low-margin revenue and bringing in big opportunities for growth and higher margin revenue. And once we get that kind of base reset, we absolutely will look to grow from that levels we've kind of consistently talked about in the past.","George Hill","Good stuff. All right, Marc. Thank you.","Marc Naughton","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sandy Draper with SunTrust. Your line is open.","Sandy Draper","Thanks very much. Maybe a follow-up on George's question. Marc, with the bulk of the revenue that you're \u2013 between AAH and other potential, is most of that going to show up in managed services or are there other revenue lines where that would show up? Just trying to make sure I'm thinking a little bit more near-term in terms of fine tuning the model.","Marc Naughton","Yeah, Sandy. As we go through the portfolio management process, some of those businesses impact all of the lines. And some of them aren't as high impact on the hosting side because there are some benefits. There are some businesses \u2013 if you look at our Home Health, that had nothing to do \u2013 small number, but it was more illustrative of solution sales and client revenue stream that we could turn into something that we saw as an opportunity. There will be other businesses that are more focused on shared services. And there will be other businesses that are just in areas that are kind of a full company complement of business models, but that we think they are in areas that we don't see the growth opportunity that we're going to go invest in them. So, I can't really give you today what business models are all going to fallout because there are a variety of business models that are going to be impacted. Ideally, as we get started working our way through 2020, we'll be able to give you something that lets get a little bit more of a sense of where those are going to hit.","George Hill","Okay, that's helpful. And then, a quick follow-up on support and maintenance. I missed what you said. I can't remember. Is there any 606, 605 issue that's impacting support and maintenance. Just remind me what it is that's caused support and maintenance to be flat to down this year. And do you think that starts to pick back up going forward? Thanks.","Marc Naughton","Yeah. Support and maintenance once again is really more tied to DHS [ph] clients that \u2013 basically, when we kind of did the acquisition were in flight or beginning to be inflight. We're starting to see those clients actually complete their contracts with Cerner and move on to a different platform. And that's offsetting the growth that you would see in the support stream normally. Once those kind of get fully embedded, which probably should be over the next 12 months or so, I think you're going to see going back to kind of low-single digit increases. But it's a very large number from a denominator perspective. But we should return to growth in that space, but there is going to be a near-term impact headwind to get through with some of those clients.","George Hill","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Gillmor with Baird. Your line is open.","Matthew Gillmor","Thanks for the question. I wanted to ask about the federal bookings side. I was hoping to confirm that the VA or it's helped drive some of the upside to the 3Q bookings are towards the high end, I should say. Marc, can you give us a sense for what's embedded within the fourth quarter guidance with respect to VA bookings?","Marc Naughton","This is Marc. We don't talk about exactly what's in our guidance relative to a client specific characterization. I think from a bookings guidance perspective coming into this quarter, we certainly \u2013 there wasn't any large single transaction that we're looking to get from any one location. I think we had a good contribution from the federal business as is kind of expected given the end of the government fiscal year. So, I think that was a contribution. But given the percent of that business versus the total business, [indiscernible] that was the upside to our bookings. We had some other things that came into the larger number than we originally expected. So, I don't know that that was a source of us getting to the high end of the guidance range. It was pretty good performance across. John, I don't know if you have\u2026","John Peterzalek","I'll start with \u2013 I was really happy with the Q3 results and I think the strong areas is where you would want to see them strong. So, revenue cycle, not RevWorks, but the actual revenue cycle solutions and those that surround it. We had a really solid quarter there, which also reflects the progress we've been making on revenue cycle. So, I think that's incredibly positive. Services were up, incredibly positive. And then, some of our strategic growth things that Don had mentioned in his components, whether they include population health, adjacencies and those type of things made a strong presence as well. I see that continuing. And I think it's where I want to see my bookings come from as well. It's because of what we've been focusing on. And then, we surround it with normal opportunities we have.","Matthew Gillmor","Got it. That's all I have. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Eric Percher with Nephron Research. Your line is open.","Eric Percher","Thank you. Marc, given what your \u2013 your commentary about growth and how much you need to work through in 2020, when we get to February, obviously, there will be a moment where we see what you've accomplished for 2019. As you think about the budget process for 2020 and what you'll be able to communicate for the year with all those moving parts, what does \u2013 what should we expect in terms of communication at that point?","Marc Naughton","Well, I think, obviously, in Q4 results, we'll talk to you about our guidance for 2020. As I indicated in my comments, the optimization work is going well. We are hitting our targets and that means that, for Q4, we feel good about delivering the 20% margin number that we talked about as Cerner's target. And as I did mention, based on the success that we're having and the fact that we're getting some of those benefits slightly earlier than we would've expected \u2013 had on the calendar to get to in 2020, it gives us a good feel for \u2013 relative to the 22.5% that we laid out Q4 of 2020. So, I think from a cost optimization standpoint, we're right on track. As I indicated, on the revenue side, the business is \u2013 certainly, there are opportunities for us to look through the various elements of business and do the portfolio management work that we've talked about and look at M&A opportunities that can impact 2020. So, all that work is still to be done when we come out and are able to complete our 2020 plan and kind of share the highlights of that with you guys in the form of guidance as we do our Q4 call. I think that will be the next time we're able talk to you about that. But as I sit today, I feel pretty good about where we stand.","Eric Percher","Okay. And then, one follow-up question. As you get to phase two or three of getting to those margin targets, I think there's been some discussion of investment in tools that will help facilitate the process. Are those significant? Will they run through non-GAAP metrics? Will those weigh on you to some extent next year?","Marc Naughton","For the most part, next year would be primarily focused on implementation of those tools. For the most part, that implementation work will go through on the restructuring line. So, it won't impact our adjusted earnings.","Eric Percher","Okay, thank you.","Marc Naughton","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Cherny with Bank of America. Your line is open.","Michael Cherny","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess, summarizing a lot of what you've said today, it seems to us, as you go through this portfolio rationalization, as you move towards the 2020 margin targets, I guess, how do you think about the balance of what should be contributed from somebody's potential exit? And if there are further exits of products or further wind down of some of this low-margin particularly services revenue, could we be viewing upside potential to that 4Q target? Or, I guess, what would drive the upside to the 4Q target if we were to see one? 4Q 2020.","Marc Naughton","Yeah. Once again in advance on 4Q 2020 other than expressing am I comfortable with the 22.5%, I would remind \u2013 restate that our focus is on the cost optimization to get to that 22.5%. So, depends on what the \u2013 the adjustments to revenue could change that number. Could impact that number. The AAH in Q4 could be a 30 basis point positive to it, but that's not \u2013 I'm not really taking that into consideration when I'm looking at my numbers, right? I'm looking at the cost optimization to drove to those margin targets. So, today, it's just too early for me to go tell you, hey, there's upside or there's downside. I'm focused on the 22.5% and focus on the cost drivers that I need to get to that number. So, I think at this point that's kind of all I can tell you. Hopefully, when we get to Q4 and can share our 2020 plan, guidance level, we'll be able to give you a little bit more specifics.","Brent Shafer","On the revenue cycle area, from a portfolio management perspective, as John said, the primary lens we have there is a significant whitespace opportunity in our client base and how we There is a significant whitespace opportunity and our client base and how we take advantage of a real growth opportunity for the business. So, that's our line of sight focus and how do we think about the total solution offering in terms of technologies and services required to go deliver that. And it's the best way to do that through an organic build, to partner or divest and partner strategy. So, I think that's the decision tree and the calculus and the process we're working through. But I think there's a big, big growth opportunity for us in the revenue cycle space. There's a lot for us to like about what's playing out there. It's got significant trend.","Marc Naughton","When you look at, clearly, at least in my mind, AAH, from a revenue divestiture standpoint, it is the largest by far. So, you're not see similar levels of businesses that we will be looking to get out of. Most of the others are going to be \u2013 they will be smaller than that and probably significantly smaller. So, relative to kind of your question, am I going to see the major change, that business alone is changing slightly, but the others will be smaller than that.","Michael Cherny","Thanks. And then, just one quick clarifications if I can. On the backlog adjustment, you mentioned how some that came from the change in the Adventist contract. It's obviously means we're higher in terms of \u2013 versus where the adjustments have been over the last few quarters. Should we think about that as the only adjustment that drives it meaningfully higher in terms of the backlog adjustment versus where it's been the last few quarters? Are there other kind of one-time items in there that drove some of the changes to the backlog?","Marc Naughton","That would be the major driver.","Michael Cherny","Okay, awesome. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Stockton with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Jamie Stockton","Thanks for taking my questions. I guess maybe two quick ones. Marc, the bookings commentary for Q4, I think you said, hey, I'm not going to have as many long-term oriented deals, deemphasizing some of that stuff. You also called out Adventist and like extensions of that RevWorks contract. I guess, my questions around that are, is that something that happened every year or you really just [indiscernible] because there was a big impact in Q4 of last year? And then, is there any way to think about the size of that, if it was every year?","Marc Naughton","Sure. This is Marc. The rhythm with them was we were \u2013 added one more year to the dealer every year. And that one more deal would have been given the revenue number we talked. It would have been a little bit higher than the revenue number based on other elements of it. So, [indiscernible] $200 million of bookings, that would've been on our radar when we started the year that are not going to be in Q4 this this year and would have been in Q4 last year as a direct apples-to-apples comparison. That's the key difference there. And it's just because it was every Q4, that number hit the bookings.","Jamie Stockton","Okay. And then, maybe just one more quick one. On pro services, I think you called out just implementation activity as a driver of the strength there during the quarter. Should we think about that as primarily centered around the government? I think John called out four DoD sites going live in September. And is it DoD at this point that we should be more focused on as the driver if it is government or is there already some VA starting to kick in at a healthy level?","John Peterzalek","Yeah. I'll answer it in a general term that, obviously, the DoD and the VA drive services through our model. But we also saw a very strong services in our optimization components. We have the get current, stay current component going on as we push our clients and with our clients to make sure they not only have the most current releases, but are aligned with our model solutions that we know that if you get aligned, you have a much better experience. All of those are components and drivers of our services, better business and of services that drive value to our clients. So, while the federal government, obviously, consumes services, it's not the only thing where we're seeing growth and upside.","Brent Shafer","And, clearly, the federal is helpful. The VA ways are going to start kicking off in the spring and there's work that's done prior to those getting kicked off. We've had a lot of interaction with the VA on our campus recently and I think that's getting all the training and things done. So, those will big \u2013 but as John said, it was the broad support of the professional services business was heartening because it does show the overall business is growing and that the government is contributing additional growth for that.","Brent Shafer","Hey, given the time, why don't we go ahead and stop the questions at this point. I thank everybody for their time. I know you've got other things to get on to. So, I look forward to talk to you soon. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day."],"5060":["Cerner Corp.

Sir, please go ahead.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Thank you, Michelle. This is Marc Naughton. Good afternoon everyone, and welcome to the call. I'll lead off today with a review of the numbers. Zane Burke, our President, will follow me with results, highlights, and marketplace observations. And then Mike Nill, our Chief Operating Officer, will provide some operational highlights.","Now, I will turn to our results. While solid overall, our results included bookings and revenue slightly below our guidance range and earnings at the low end of our range. Starting with bookings, our bookings revenue in Q3 was $1.434 billion, which reflects a 10% decrease from a very difficult comparable in Q3 of 2015 on bookings. We were an all-time high and had grown 44% over the prior year.","Relative to our guidance, bookings were $16 million below the low end of our range, but Q3 was still our second highest bookings quarter ever. Our revenue backlog ended the quarter at $15.471 billion which is up 11% from $13.876 billion a year ago. Revenue in the quarter was $1.185 billion, which is up 5% over Q3 of 2015, but $15 million below the low end of our guidance range of $1.2 billion to $1.275 billion. The revenue shortfall was mainly in system sales and was a result of lower than expected technology resale and software bookings for the quarter.","The revenue composition for Q3 was $301 million in system sales, $253 million in support and maintenance, $608 million in services and $22 million in reimbursed travel. System sales revenue for the quarter was down 7% compared to Q3 of 2015 with technology resale declining 21% and licensed software declining 12%, partially offset by 10% growth in subscriptions. System sales margin percent increased 150 basis points year-over-year to 69%, reflecting lower technology resale mix as well as lower commissions.","Moving to services, total services revenue including professional and managed services was up 13% compared to Q3 of 2015. This is in line with our expectations and continues to reflect good execution by our services organizations. Support and maintenance revenue increased 3% over Q3 of 2015, slightly below our expectation in mid single digit growth due mostly to lower equipment maintenance revenue related to our lower technology resale.","Looking at revenue by geographic segment, domestic revenue increased 6% over the year ago quarter to $1.06 billion and non-U.S. revenue was flat year-over-year at $130 million. Moving to gross margin. Gross margin for Q3 was 84.6%, which is up from 83.1% in Q3 of 2015, due mostly to the lower mix of technology resale and better services margins versus the year ago period.","Now I will discuss spending, operating margin and net earnings. For these items, we provide both GAAP and adjusted or non-GAAP results. The adjusted results exclude share-based compensation expense, Health Services acquisition-related amortization, acquisition-related deferred revenue, and other acquisition-related adjustments which are detailed and reconciled to GAAP in our earnings release.","Looking at operating spending, our third quarter GAAP operating expenses were $759 million compared to $722 million in the year ago period. Adjusted operating expenses were $713 million which is up 8% compared to Q3 of 2015. This growth was primarily driven by growth in personnel expense related to revenue generating associates which is reflected in the sales and client service expense line that increased 11%. Software development increased 3%, G&A was basically flat and amortization and acquisition-related intangibles was down 30%. But this represents only $1 million decline from $3 million to $2 million as this line excludes Health Services acquisition-related amortization in the non-GAAP view.","Moving to operating margins. Our Q3 GAAP operating margin was 20.4% compared to 19.1% in the year ago period. Our adjusted operating margin was 24.4% in Q3, which is essentially flat to the year ago period. This is in line with our previous indication that we expect margin expansion to be limited in 2016 but we do continue to believe we can expand margins 50-plus basis points annually after 2016.","Moving to net earnings and EPS. Our GAAP net earnings in Q3 were $170 million or $0.49 per diluted share. Adjusted net earnings were $203 million and adjusted diluted EPS was $0.59, which is up 9% compared to Q3 of 2015. Q3 tax rate was 30%, which is slightly below our expected rate. The benefit of this was largely offset by a $3.7 million write-off of a venture capital investment that is reflected in the other income line.","Now I'd like to preview an expense we expect to incur in Q4. We recently offered a new voluntary separation plan or VSP to eligible associates. Similar to our program in February of last year, the VSP was made available to U.S. associates who meet a minimum level of combined days in tenure. The irrevocable acceptance period for most associates electing to participate in the VSP ends in December. Based on the number of eligible associates and our estimate of participation, we expect the corresponding pre-tax charge in the fourth quarter of 2016 to be approximately $30 million.","Similar to our last VSP, we believe we'll be able to fill many of the positions vacated by participating associates with existing associates, which should create efficiencies in the future, while also creating career growth opportunities for our associates. This completely voluntary program will have a very small impact on our total head count, as the number of eligible associates we expect to accept the offer represent less than 2% of our total associates. Also, this should not be viewed as a layoff, or a sign we don't expect to grow. We've grown our head count by over 2,000 people this year and expect to grow head count next year as well.","Now, I'll move to our balance sheet. We ended Q3 with $837 million of total cash and investments, which is up from $720 million in Q2. We did not repurchase stock during the quarter which means $100 million still remains available for repurchase under the stock repurchase program authorized in March of this year.","Moving to debt. Our total debt including capital lease obligations is $573 million, which is down slightly compared to Q2. Total receivables ended the quarter at $985 million, which is essentially flat to Q2. Our Q3 DSO was 76 days, which is down 9 days from 85 in the year-ago period.","Operating cash flow for the quarter was $240 million, down from $272 million in Q3 of 2015. Year-to-date operating cash flow of $822 million still reflects strong growth over the $594 million of operating cash flow for the first three quarters of last year. We also expect strong Q4 cash flow.","Q3 capital expenditures were $110 million and capitalized software was $74 million. Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less capital purchases and capitalized software development costs, was $56 million for the quarter. This is flat compared to Q2 and down compared to Q3 of 2015. Year-to-date free cash flow of $266 million is nearly double the $134 million generated in the first three quarters of last year. Next year, we continue to expect a decline in capital expenditures, which we expect to drive stronger free cash flow.","Now, I'll go through guidance. We expect revenue in Q4 to be between $1.225 billion and $1.3 billion, with the midpoint reflecting growth of 7% over Q4 of 2015. Our guidance reflects our expectation that system sales will increase sequentially compared to Q3, but will still be below our original target for the quarter due to lower expected software and hardware.","We expect Q4 adjusted diluted EPS to be $0.60 to $0.62 per share, which is below our original expectations due to the impact of the lower system sales. The midpoint of this range is flat compared to Q4 of 2015, but recall we had a $0.03 tax benefit last year.","Moving to bookings guidance. We expect bookings revenue in Q4 of $1.425 billion to $1.575 billion and the midpoint reflects 11% growth over Q4 of 2015. When added to year-to-date actuals, the midpoint of our Q4 guidance implies the following expected full year 2016 results: revenue of $4.8 billion compared to a guidance range of $4.9 billion to $5.0 billion, adjusted diluted EPS of $2.31 compared to guidance of $2.30 to $2.40, and bookings of $5.5 billion compared to our stated target of exceeding 2015 bookings of $5.4 billion.","When compared to the guidance we provided a year ago, revenue is the only key metric projected to be below our previously guided range. Recall that I shared at our Investor Day in March that approximately 79% of the $5 billion midpoint over our original revenue guidance was scheduled to come out of backlog that existed at the beginning of 2016. This means that we expected about $4 billion of revenue to come from backlog that existed at the beginning of the year and the remaining $1 billion to come from current year bookings.","So far this year our conversion of backlog has been almost right at targeted levels, and we expect that to continue. Where we have missed has been on contribution of bookings to current year revenue, which is reflected in the lower system sales. Firstly, (11:16) much more of this miss has been due to hardware than software, which is the main reason we still expect to be in our full year adjusted diluted EPS guidance range. Also, while below our initial range, our 2016 revenue is still expected to be 8% to 9% higher than 2015, due to the very tough comparable as it did (11:33) around 30% over 2014.","Now, I'd like to provide initial expectations for 2017. We'll provide more formal guidance after we report Q4 results and finalize our 2017 plan. But based on the initial version of our plan, we currently expect 2017 revenue between $5.2 billion and $5.45 billion, reflecting 11% growth at the midpoint, and 2017 adjusted diluted EPS between $2.50 and $2.70, reflecting 13% growth at the midpoint.","Current consensus estimates for both revenue and adjusted diluted EPS are at the high end of these guidance ranges, largely reflecting the fact that consensus was formed before our Q3 results and Q4 guidance.","With that, I will turn the call over to Zane.","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","Thanks, Marc. Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll provide color on our results and make some marketplace observations. I'll start with bookings. While our Q3 bookings were slightly below our guidance range, it was still the second highest level of bookings in our history, second only to Q3 of 2015. In addition, we expect to return to strong bookings growth in Q4.","Looking at mix, 34% of bookings in the quarter were from long-term contracts, reflecting one new ITWorks client and strong managed services bookings. This is in a more normal range for long-term bookings, but our year-to-date mix is still lower than normal because of the lower long-term bookings in the first half of the year. Bookings this quarter included several large contracts with 35 contracts over $5 million, including 26 over $10 million.","From a new client perspective, 34% of bookings this quarter came from outside our core Millennium install base. This high level of new business reflects our ongoing competitiveness and good market activity. Looking ahead, we continue to believe the replacement market will remain active given the high number of hospitals on legacy platforms, some that are being sunset while yet others are preparing for future regulatory and payment models that many legacy platforms are not well equipped to handle. As we have previously discussed, the timing in these contracts is proving to be less predictable which I will discuss more in a minute.","First I'll provide some more highlights on the quarter. I'll start with Revenue Cycle, which continues to be a strong contributor to our results. The market remains very focused on clinically driven Revenue Cycle, which is driving strong sales into our base as well as inclusion in new EHR deals. We also had good contribution from RevWorks services in the quarter, with the expansion of an existing relationship and good contribution from our acute and ambulatory Revenue Cycle services offerings.","Our competitiveness in Revenue Cycle continues to improve across both acute and ambulatory, and this is reflected in the fact that we have displaced more than 10 different competitors so far this year. Looking ahead, we remain optimistic that Revenue Cycle will continue to be a strong contributor to our growth. We still have significant white space on solution penetration, and opportunities for our consulting services remain high.","Now I'll shift to Population Health where we continue to do very well. Our comprehensive approach to population health remains differentiated in the marketplace. The power of our platform and ability to integrate with EHR workflow remained key differentiators. But we also continue to strengthen our competitiveness against the niche competitors we face across different categories, such as registries, enterprise data warehouse, analytics, and care management.","We are very pleased with our overall progress in Population Health. Just two and a half years after our first HealtheIntent solution went live, we've now sold solutions to over 100 clients and the HealtheIntent platform has over 300 data connections from more than 80 unique sources. As we have discussed, the scope of many initial Population Health contracts are small, because most clients are not at risk for large portions of their populations. But we expect that ongoing shifts in reimbursement will lead to broader risk assumption, which should lead to adoption of more solutions and more lives being managed on a per-member-per-month model.","Additionally, we're discovering through the use of our solutions, the access to more data will enhance our clients' fee-for-service models. Also, our addressable market for Population Health goes beyond our traditional EHR clients to include ACOs, health plans, governments and employers. In addition, the opportunity goes beyond module (15:51) of the HealtheIntent platform, as there are significant markets to provide high value services that complement our solution offerings. Mike will discuss an example of where we are doing this.","Moving to the ambulatory market, where we had another very good quarter. This quarter again included multiple competitive displacements and strong contributions from ambulatory EHR, practice management and business office services. A noteworthy ambulatory win during the quarter was being selected to replace our primary cloud-based competitor for ambulatory EHR and business office services at a large investor-owned IDN that we believe is their largest client. We signed for one market in Q3 and anticipate expanding into other markets in the future. This was one of three displacements of this competitor in the quarter.","We also had a good quarter in the small hospital market. Our competitiveness in this market remains strong and we're having success against all competitors. In Q3, we added eight community hospitals with head to head wins against five different competitors.","Outside the U.S., our revenue was flat year-over-year. Non-U.S. revenue represents about 11% of our total revenue. So the flat revenue in the quarter didn't really impact our total results. Despite some current macro headwinds, we do expect the non-U.S. market to become a more meaningful contributor to our results over the long term, given the relatively untapped EHR solution and services market. We also believe there will be a large market for our Population Health platform outside the U.S.","Now I'd like to provide some perspective on our results and observations on the marketplace. Despite what was in most ways a solid quarter, we're always disappointed when we don't deliver against the guidance we established. So I'd like to comment about what I think are some of the elements contributing to results being somewhat less predictable. While our pipeline has continued to increase this year, and is at record levels, we're in a period where the timing of closing opportunities has been more challenging.","In the EHR replacement market, there continues to be a significant number of replacement opportunities, and we continue to win a majority of them. However, the reduced number of hard deadlines tied to regulatory mandates has impacted the clients' sense of urgency. As I indicated, I believe this is primarily a timing issue as deals in our forecast are changing from a calendar perspective but not being lost.","We have also had less contribution from our ITWorks and RevWorks businesses this year despite a strong pipeline of opportunities. These opportunities remain, and I believe we'll see much stronger contributions from these businesses in 2017.","Overall, I feel good about our ability to grow bookings in 2017 given the pipeline for larger Works contracts, ongoing EHR replacement opportunities, and an expected continuation in the ramp of contributions from Population Health. And as Marc discussed, our initial view of 2017 reflects good top and bottom line growth.","In summary, while our results were slightly below our guidance range for revenue and bookings, I still view our results as solid, and a strong pipeline in place, believe we remained well positioned for growth going forward.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike.","Michael R. Nill - Cerner Corp.","Thanks, Zane. Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'm going to discuss ITWorks and service collaboration with a large employer and leading health system. I'll start with ITWorks. We had a good quarter with one new ITWorks client and a strong sales back into our client base.","Our new client in the quarter was a community hospital that also has six clinics. Like most of our ITWorks clients, they added additional solutions to the roadmap as part of their agreement. In this case, they will be adding critical care, oncology and cardiology solutions. In addition, they're adding HealtheIntent Population Health solutions as well.","As Zane mentioned, we've had less ITWorks activity so far this year than expected, but our pipeline remains strong and includes some clients that are much larger than any of our existing ITWorks clients, which is why we're confident about the growth in ITWorks bookings for 2017. The value proposition to our clients remains very appealing, especially in an environment where they have pressure on operating costs, limited access to IT talent and increasing pressures in light of the industry issues related to security.","Now I'd like to discuss a new partnerships between Cerner, a large employer, and Memorial Hermann. Together the three of us have collaborated to create a high performance health network for employers. Employers are looking for strategies to improve quality, cost and experience. Leading health systems are creating and looking to grow their insurance offerings. As this emerging takes shape, Cerner is investing in new capabilities to address this market opportunity. We think the chance to positively disrupt and drive revenue is compelling.","Cerner and Houston based Memorial Hermann have a long history of collaboration and innovation. In addition to broad adaption of Cerner Millennium Solutions, they're an early adopter of our initial HealtheIntent Population Health solution and have been steadily adopting more solutions and replacing niche suppliers over the past three years. This has contributed to their success at running one of the largest, best performing ACOs in the country.","Memorial Hermann also has its own health plan built around their vast provider network in Houston. Within their plan, they've created their own custom fully insured product for a Fortune 500 employer. As part of the overall approach, Cerner is providing a concierge member services that will be tightly integrated into the health plan and health system, helping members maximize their benefits.","We're also providing the technology for the consumer engagement platform which brings disparate patient and member portals into an organized consolidated experience. As you know, we have administered our own health plan for the past decade, which has allowed us to reduce the growth in our health care costs while also leading to a better health experience for our associates. By leveraging this experience and partnering with an innovative world class provider like Memorial Hermann and a large forward thinking employer, we are building an approach to value-based care that can be a model for other markets.","We believe our tailored systems are uniquely positioned to play a role in helping employers move toward value-based care by offering high performance networks comprised of high-quality doctors. They can provide plans that help employers bend the cost curve while also providing a better overall experience and improving the health of their workforce. We look forward to sharing more about this collaboration as we move through the enrolment and the launch this offering and then expand these capabilities to other leading health systems, employers and markets.","With that, I'll turn the call over to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of Garen Sarafian with Citi Research. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. Hey, Zane, could you just elaborate a little bit on what you're seeing in the market and some of the delays? Could you just maybe give a couple examples? And then what gives you guys confidence that it's sort of just getting pushed over to a little bit farther down the road and not necessarily disappearing? Are they putting anything into their budgets for next year that gives you that confidence or any other metrics that we could rely on?","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","Yeah, Garen, thanks for the question. So, in the new business marketplace, I'd say our metrics are at all-time highs. So the activity levels are incredibly good, and in fact we had a very strong new business quarter overall. So we did very well. We just had anticipated doing slightly better and there were a couple of opportunities that moved and mostly from a just a pure timing perspective. So, it's not a question of if they're going to do it, it's a when. And without the challenges or without the regulatory elements behind it, the regulatory mandate times behind it, some of those clients are moving a little bit slower than they have in the past.","So, the budgets are there. The activity is there, and we had a high performance quarter in terms of numbers. We did not meet our expectations and what we had anticipated to come through for the quarter. So, and as we look forward, we see our pipeline of activity and those that are in the pipe as very strong and record levels of activity there.","And as those of you who have followed us for a long time know, we go through a rigorous process in terms of how we qualify those opportunities, how they run through our forecasting process and that's helped us to provide good predictability historically around the closing of some of those opportunities. In this case, as I have discussed previously, there are some timing gaps. So the activity remains strong. The ability to accurately predict within the number of weeks, days, et cetera on how we close our business was not where we have seen it previously. So.","Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Got it.","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","Does that make sense?","Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay, no, yeah, that's useful. And then as a follow-up maybe for Marc. In setting guidance for 2017, given just more uncertainty and sort of predictability in achieving these results, has the methodology in coming up with guidance any more conservative than in prior years? So for example, what percent of the midpoint of next year's revenues come from backlog versus prior years, or any other metric for that matter.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Hey yeah, Garen. Once again, it's early. What we're providing is our kind of view as of now. We don't have a 2017 plan completed. As we go through the process, the process will remain as it's always remained. We will look at the business. We won't make any assumptions that we're going to grow bookings. We will expect bookings to be relatively flat, a mix to be relatively similar. And we will then look at our forecast that goes out four quarters to see if that forecast supports those assumptions. We'll do all the things we do relative to look at spending and look at opportunities.","I would expect, while I don't have a number today, that a material component similar to what we saw coming in 2016, which was in the 80%, 79% range, that we would see that same contribution from backlog as we roll into next year. I don't know what the number exactly is going to be, but I think we're going to have that visibility. Once again, I think it will be a focus on the 20% that we've got to go drive, a lot of which comes through system sales, and that's going to be what we're going to focus on relative to our forecasting and our assumptions.","But my philosophy is we're going to do all the work, and then we're going to provide you guidance based on our best work. So we can't really, as I said, we can't \u2013 my planning process assumes certain things, one of which is flat bookings. I don't expect to have flat bookings next year. We were basically guiding today that we're going to be relatively flat for bookings, but I think as we look next year, we would certainly expect to get back on an uptick after coming off a very challenging year with a significant increase in bookings last year. Exceeding that very tough mark this year is actually a good accomplishment, but we'd expect to get back on track to growing bookings at a similar pace that we've seen in the past.","So once again, my comments on plan is we've traditionally always done from a actual expectation of bookings, the business expects to grow our bookings. Especially, Zane talked about in 2015, the Works businesses, or 2016, the Works businesses weren't a integral part of a lot of our bookings number. We didn't do a lot of big ITWorks deals. In the pipeline, there are more opportunities in that space. And given that and the size of those bookings gives us kind of a higher level of confidence that 2017 bookings are going to be stronger than 2016.","Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. That's useful. Thanks for the questions.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thanks for the questions. Marc, actually I just want to follow up on some of those bookings comments. Just to be clear, is it 2017 preliminary revenue outlook that you're providing tonight? Is that assume no bookings growth? And then I guess, just as I think about the short-term bookings, it does look like you're calling for a pickup in 4Q. I'm just curious as you look out into next year, is it just a conservative assumption to assume you don't see bookings growth or are you actually baking in some as you think about 2017?","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Yeah, and let me be very clear. We expect bookings to grow in 2017. That is our expectation. The business is there. Everything we're seeing in our forecasting process, which goes out four quarters, so we actually have a view out that long as to what the opportunities are. And as Zane says, it's at record levels. So we see bookings growing next year. My point is, relative to us doing a plan, the question kind of came up as, is there a level of conservatism. And for us, we don't expect, we don't plan the bookings are going to grow. We expect them to grow, but by not building that into the plan, that gives us some degree of cushion should they not grow to deliver the numbers that we provide in our guidance.","And so, I think that's our expectation. I expect bookings to grow. Zane expects bookings to grow. The opportunities are there. So, we will see higher bookings in 2017, but relative to giving you guidance, especially preliminary guidance, we're not going to go build growth and bookings into those preliminary numbers. When we come back to you after Q4 ends with a completely built backlog and have our best view, then we will certainly tie down those numbers. But at this point, based on our normal process, which we've done every year, we're comfortable with the guidance we're providing relative to a first look at 2017 and once again realizing we got to get through our planning process to tie it down.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.","No, that's fair. And I guess just one more specific follow-up around that. If I think about 2016 and maybe one of the things that was disappointing relative to your expectations coming into the year, probably would be around the work pipeline. It seems like the expectations for some of these large Works deals to be implemented has obviously moved throughout the year. I guess the question is what changes in 2017 as far as the systems that you've been talking to around IT and ITWorks and RevWorks, what changes that you see them actually moving forward with those contracts?","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","Robert, this is Zane. I think what we're seeing is some of those things moving through the pipeline a little bit faster in terms of \u2013 or not faster, but just maturing more appropriately through there. And so, what's really going on is when you make this move is, it's a combination of things. So there's always the how to go faster. And so, when you look at MACRA and MIPS, our clients are going to have a need to be able to measure and monitor a number of different metrics and to begin to prepare for that. And when they look at what the pressure they're under from meaningful use for MACRA, MIPS, those kinds of things are going to drive additional behavior around ITWorks.","In addition, the decreasing reimbursement environment creates a cost strain at a time when they need access to more data. They need more IT to actually be able to answer all these questions. So the combination of those regulatory elements in a capital and operating constrained environment at a point in time when they're trying to just flat out execute, what we offer for our clients is provide that kind of leverage. And I think what we saw in 2016 is there was almost a catch your breath mentality in that we did not have any of those major elements around meaningful use. In the current year, we didn't have the MACRA, MIPS. And in addition, the bottom lines for our clients were still pretty strong.","What you're seeing as you go to the back half of the year is a little bit of weakness with the bottom lines and that regulatory environment coming on. That's actually a really big positive for the IT, for the Works programs themselves, both Revenue Cycle and ITWorks. And so in the conversations that we're having, they're continuing along. And I feel like those are going to mature in a good way in 2017 that we just didn't see in 2016 with that kind of catch your breath element in some of those areas.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette with Bank of America. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Steven J. Valiquette - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Thanks. So I guess I'm just curious on just an update on the VA opportunity. There was some rumblings obviously a few months ago that the VistA system could potentially be replaced and potentially bidding to third parties. Just curious to get an update on what's going on there from your perspective. Thanks.","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","Thanks for the question. So, from a VA perspective, I think with the administrations changing and some of those elements, that there's a \u2013 I don't think there's an expectation that that's going to be in the immediate horizon, but there is clearly a dialogue. It has been from them around making a change out of VistA in the long run. And should we be called upon to respond to that and get asked, we'd be excited to perform. I think our best model is to continue to perform on the DoD, which we are performing very well on. And the follow-on opportunities for that are quite significant in and of themselves.","So as you think about 2017 and 2018 and the future, we have a unique position both from the DoD perspective obviously, the additional opportunities that are not yet booked as part of that opportunity, but also to set us up to be in good position to think about competing well around the VA. And so our motto is to put our head down, be very successful with the DoD. That will yield a lot of positive results for 2017 in terms of system sales for Cerner Corporation that are unique to Cerner, as well as position us for the VA.","Steven J. Valiquette - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Okay. Just based on that comment then on the DoD part of that then, it sounded like maybe you were saying that could be a source of upside to bookings next year. Or is that going to be counted in the bookings already as far as the opportunities? Just wanted to get clarity on that, that comment you made around that.","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","I would say part of those are in the bookings. And I'd say part of those could be upside to the bookings. So, I think as we have visibility to what that looks like, we're anticipating where we are. We have not set any guidance at this point around bookings other than to say, as Marc has said, our anticipation is to grow for next year. And given we haven't set that, I can't really tell you that piece. But in our forecasting process, we are forecasting opportunities around that and I think it will be both to provide some coverage for what we're doing from a guidance \u2013 what we will do around guidance as well as provide some upside opportunity.","Steven J. Valiquette - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Okay. Got it. Okay, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of David Larsen with Leerink. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC","Hi. How much did the DoD contribute to the quarter, if any, in terms of like bookings and revenue? And what would with that contribution be next quarter, please?","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","David, as we've said, the bookings from DoD tend to be kind of steady and not significant in any one quarter. They weren't significant similarly. There isn't a big impact in any one quarter. The revenue doesn't have a big impact in any one quarter and it's not a number we're disclosing. But if it was something material, then we'd talk about it. But it spreads out through multiple periods. And as Zane said, as we complete certain processes and elements of the project in 2017, that opens up additional task orders for us to realize, not one of which will be a giant booking in the quarter. But it will be definitely a strong support for overall bookings as well as the potential to provide some guidance, some upside to our guidance.","David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And then, Zane, just one more question, talking about like pipeline activity and new sales efforts, are there any metrics you can provide like for example, number of leads, how that's trending on a year-over-year basis? Or can you give any more sort of detailed color around which segments of the market you're seeing greater activity from? Is it community hospitals, physician offices, large hospitals? Thanks.","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","Sure. Happy to help with some of those pieces. There are some things that we do not provide numbers around but \u2013 those are proprietary for us. What I will say is in terms of absolute dollars across all segments, our pipeline is at the highest level in the history of the company. So that's kind of the ultimate metric in terms of what we're looking for. And that's after we took the second highest level of bookings in the history of the company out of the pipeline. So, I think that's an important element to think of first when you're thinking about the health of where we are.","As far as certain areas of strength in the marketplace, certainly you look at community hospitals, that's a very strong marketplace for us. The small hospital marketplace is very strong. Some places where we uniquely compete, around the investor-owned segment, around the government, both from a federal and a state and local perspective, those are very active parts of the marketplace, as well as our Population Health solution sets. So there are just a number of areas that we're very strong and continue to be very active.","David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC","Great. Thanks very much.","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","Pleasure.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Sean Wieland with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Sean W. Wieland - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Hi. Thanks. So, a year ago you said that you're comfortable with revenues in excess of $5 billion. And so, we're about $200 million or so short of that. Can you just, looking back at over the past 12 months, what areas of product or market or services could you account for that $200 million?","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Well. I think you can just, even looking at the last two quarters, there's $150 million that's come out of our revenue guidance. Half of that came out this quarter as a result of lower system sales, right. We did not contemplate hardware decreasing 21%. We didn't contemplate software decreasing. The business is out there. As Zane has talked, it's primarily timing issues. But once those things hit a quarter, so you're down half of that $150 million, you're out this quarter, that's going to have a carryover effect. So, even in our Q4 guidance where we expect system sales to rebound and get back to good levels, you've got the follow on impact of that. So that's going to impact basically, take you down the $150 million just in the last half of the year.","So, I think that's the material amount obviously. When we were giving guidance, we were looking for pretty significant uptick as we went through. And if you look at our Q4 guidance, I mean we're looking at a $78 million uptick at the midpoint of our revenue guidance range. So, we are still looking to get a significant bump in revenue to get to Q4. So, I think relative to what we saw at the beginning of the year, the backlog has played out just like we expected it to. It's the system sales and some of the other things that are signed during the year that impact us. But, Zane, do you have any thoughts on that?","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","Yeah, I think the other thing I would add is that the big difference is, as Marc discussed, first off low margin tech resale and frankly low margin ITWorks bookings that we would have anticipated would have been in the numbers that don't significantly add to the bottom line overall, but would have added to the top line in a revenue perspective. And if you look at the first half of our ITWorks bookings, they led to lower second half revenue results. So, I think the combination of both the tech resale, as Marc mentioned, as well as the ITWorks pieces, both low margin businesses for us. And both things that, and particularly the ITWorks side, as we look forward, having opportunities take back up, we feel better about that as we move forward.","Sean W. Wieland - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Okay. Thank you. And then you mentioned that you replaced your large, your cloud-based competitor at an investor-owned site. Is that a full rollout and when is that scheduled to go live?","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","It's a single region, so we look at it with opportunity to grow from that piece, but it's a single region at that one particular organization. And it'll be a go-live in the 2017 period.","Sean W. Wieland - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Okay. And one last quick one. Do you have any thoughts on free cash flow for 2017?","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Yeah. This is Marc. Clearly, we've talked about the CapEx we're spending on our new campus for Mike Nill that we expect that spending will moderate significantly when we head into 2017. So, we expect CapEx to be $100 million less next year. So if you look at the $100 million left to CapEx overall, and you look at kind of some level of increase just in operating cash flow that flows down through, I think you'll see a pretty strong increase in free cash flow as you look to model what that looks like next year.","Sean W. Wieland - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Okay. Thanks so much.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of George Hill with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. Good afternoon, guys, and thanks for taking the question. I guess, Zane or Marc, just first, if we assume that bookings are flat in 2017, would it be right to assume that the mix of business that comes from installed clients versus new clients shifts more towards the installed clients as it's largely cross-sell and renewals as opposed to new business? That's kind of question one. Then question two for Zane. If we think about books of business that would not have been impacted by the lapping of stimulus spend, I guess maybe can you talk about what you're seeing in the international markets and government markets? Thanks.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Let me just take the mix of business because we're talking hypothetically if we're talking flat bookings, because bookings will grow next year. And so, what reality is going to show in that growth is our expectation, a similar mix between new and existing clients, as we continue, as we move forward. Relative to our assumptions, we're going to assume a similar mix relative to our planned assumption, flat bookings. Zane, I'll let you take the second half of that question.","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","Thanks, Marc. Around the international marketplaces, there are a few markets that feel very positive as we look at it. There are some who are investing more in healthcare IT like Belgium, like Sweden and you see that like Australia. And then there's some interesting ones where you look at a country like the UK which is under incredible cost pressure, and that pressure really forces the change and forces the need for more IT frankly. And we were, you may be aware, we were awarded six of the 13. Our clients were awarded six of the 13 challenge grants around innovation. So, \u00a310 billion innovation grants by which they are charged with figuring out ways to use IT to lower costs and improve efficiencies in the UK.","And so, I look at a couple of markets where there's recognition for they're doing well economically and they want to go invest in healthcare structures like Belgium, like Sweden, or they're struggling and it's going to force the change like the UK. And I think we're well positioned in those marketplaces to have some good success. I also think Canada has the opportunity in 2017 and 2018 to be a very strong marketplace as they look at some more provincially wide procurements and those tend to take time and are very challenging in which to predict how those will come to closure. But, I feel very good about how we're positioned in many of those strong marketplaces.","George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Appreciate the color. And Marc, I'll hold you to a barbecue dinner or no?","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","You got it.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Eric Percher with Barclays. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Eric Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you. I'd like to go back to the discussion of the replacement market. And I know you talked about some delays across the book. But within the replacement market, what are hospitals coming to you for today? What is able to drive through some of those delays? Is it integration? Is it specific products around the ambulatory Rev Cycle? Can you tell us what is reverberating?","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","Yeah, I want to be clear. All of these organization are making a decision they need to change. And so, the delays don't have anything to do with, from a solution perspective or anything like that. It is truly a process and a need to \u2013 these are significant purchases for these hospitals. It's literally a do I want to buy a new EHR, which they know they have to to compete for the future. Or am I going to go invest in some sort of the other pieces.","On the existing clients, the ROI around some of the connectivity pieces to other parts of the business, whether that's device connectivity, whether that's their ambulatory marketplace, whether it's efficiencies, there is a focus on return on investments which breaks through the pause, if you will, or the kind of breathing, the sigh of breathing for 2016. Those kind of projects gain traction in this environment where we're competing for capital.","So, it's kind of the hard ROI elements, our staff schedule, our staff acuity solution sets, having a clinically integrated revenue cycle has been a very strong element. Again, it's bringing things together, same things that drive actually the new marketplace. How do I go round out my solution set such that I have a fully integrated solution capability and I've got data liquidity across my enterprise. And ROI doesn't any hurt anything in terms of getting it moving forward. So, thanks for the question.","Eric Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And how do you measure ROI among those different products and how difficult is that in the sale prices?","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","It's a good question. We have a set of tools by which we work with our clients with on their specific data and knowing our solutions work and spend time in their processes. And we run those against our models and determine, along with the client what that return on investment should be.","Eric Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Michael Cherny with UBS. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Michael Cherny - UBS Securities LLC","Good afternoon, guys, and thanks for the details so far. So, I'll just keep this kind of quick. And I apologize if some of this has been answered, but I want to ask it a bit of a different way. Marc, historically hadn't broken down the system sales as closely as you did today. And I know typically the tech resale has been something that's been very hard to predict, obviously non-core. I don't recall licensed software number coming down at that pacing, obviously offset by subscription. As you think about it on go forward basis, I'm not specifically talking about this quarter or maybe if you want to give any color, how should we think about the long-term mix of subscription versus licensed software relative to your business?","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Well I think clearly, licensed software or subscription is just two ways of selling intangible intellectual property, right. So from our view, Q3 was a little bit of a unique circumstance in that, as Zane talked about, there was a lot of business in the quarter and a lot of software opportunities that because of the timing issues that we're seeing didn't get done in Q3. We see that rebounding in Q4 and expect to get back kind of to more traditional levels. The reason you haven't heard us talk about software before is it really hasn't been different enough to highlight. The tech resales has been different enough that it has been a cause of the difference. So, that's one reason.","The variance between subscription and license, it really just depends on how we're selling it and how the client's buying it. We will, as we got market, we'll go to market in a variety of ways, they want to buy the software, they want to buy it as a time term license that's more of a subscription. If they want on the Pop Health side, a lot of it is, much of it's bought per member per month. So, much more like a ASP or subscription basis.","So, I don't know that that mix is relevant to our business as a Q3 where some of those opportunities \u2013 some of them of size have moved to a different period. But I think overall, we are a software company. We expect that to rebound. Our pipeline is strong and we have the opportunity to go sell software. People are still buying software in this marketplace. So, I think there are opportunities that are there and we just got to get to the point where we can \u2013 and we are at that point where we can effectively deliver on a fixed-fee basis the technology they need.","You know, Zane made really a good point earlier about MACRA and the impact that has on just the general desire for technology. I think as he was talking about the existing client base and what they're needing, some of that's going to be driven by their desire to have all of the data that's going to be required under MACRA and make sure that they have a single point of truth to go get that data and be able to get all the data they need. So, yeah, I don't know how we sell it makes much difference. We still sell it. Q3 I think was a low number. We've highlighted it because we want to be transparent. Q4, we don't think that's going to be an issue.","Michael Cherny - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks, Marc.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jamie Stockton with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Jamie J. Stockton - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hey, good evening. Marc, just on the expense trends that are backing up the 2017 view that you guys have given, and I understand that the budget is not fully baked at this point, but specifically as we think about R&D expense and what flows through the income statement, you guys have a relatively large gap between how much R&D you're capitalizing right now and how much you're amortizing. Can you give us a feel for how much of that gap is going to close next year or what the cadence over the next two or three years might be for that gap closing?","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Well, obviously, we continue to spend a significant amount of our R&D on new IP and new items that capitalize and that then go GA at some future point. We talked coming into this year that we had expected to have non-cash expenses on some of the amortization on that hitting us in 2016. It has hit us. It has not hit us as much as we had originally expected. So, I think you will see some carryover impact on the 2017 R&D expenses as that amortization starts, ramps up early next year.","We're continuing delivering the code. We're doing it on a timely basis. In some cases to get to GA, we require some testing by our client partners and sometimes that timing is not exactly within our schedule that we would do amortization. So I think you'll see next year similar levels of capitalization, because we are still working on new stuff. The overall expense will take a slight hit from the amortization element of being slightly higher for the amount that didn't get hit into the number this year. So, R&D expense basically is likely as we look at it goes up a little bit as we head into 2017, but it's not a significant adjustment. But once again, what we didn't see in 2016, it will come to roost in 2017.","Jamie J. Stockton - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Just as a follow-up, when you think about the gross R&D spend, I mean, I know when you guys announced the Siemens transaction, one of the major bullet points was the amount of kind of combined R&D spend between the two organizations and the likelihood that there wouldn't need to be significant growth for a number of years in that gross R&D spend. If we think about the gross amount, I think this year it's probably going to be somewhere around $710 million or $715 million. Is that a number that we shouldn't expect to see grow materially over the next couple of years?","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Yeah, no, I think that's definitely part of our plan, that you're going to \u2013 the goal was around the $700 million, that that should be enough for us to go deliver on what we're trying to do. At the very worst, any gross changes should be kind of low single digit. So, definitely growing at a rate lower than our revenue is growing. But I think long term, if you're just looking at kind of ordinary increases, kind of mid single digit growth would be something that would be along the lines of our expectation.","We still have opportunities. We are still using some of the acquired resources to work and get to a point on some of the HS solutions. And so those people will become available as we roll forward. And we are investing heavily in our India campuses. So our expectation there is that we will be bringing online more IP resources in that environment, which from a head count perspective will increase, but from a cost perspective will fit in with that mid single digit future growth.","Jamie J. Stockton - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Why don't we take one more question.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah. Hi. Good evening. And thank you for getting me on. So a couple of questions here. So first of all, when we look at the contract history, right, it seems that this quarter the percent of contracts that are long term in nature is the highest it's been since Q2. So, shouldn't we think about this as a leading indicator for just, again, a step down in booking conversion into 2017? I know that you talked about, in the call about MACRA and meaningful use. But it seems that the size of contracts, the bigger the contract is, it seems to me it's more complicated and therefore slower to convert. That's question one.","And then second of all, if you can give us some sense of booking growth. What percent came from Pop Health and what percent from these big international contracts you've talked about?","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Let me just address the bookings. I think the comment kind of revolves around the long-term element of the bookings. Keep in mind that if you look at year-to-date, in 2015 long-term bookings were 34% of our total bookings. You look at this year, it's been about 29%. So actually, for us to be relatively flat and looking to be slightly up over a year where we're actually not getting the support from the long-term bookings, which we talked about from the Works deals, I think that's actually a point that shouldn't go unnoticed.","But I think relative to the overall contracts, every contract has some degree of \u2013 these aren't simple but they're not rocket science, right. I mean if they want to buy stuff and we want to sell stuff, there's a lot of parameters around that. But there are a lot of \u2013 we have a lot of experience. They have a lot of experience. They also have a consultant that helps them put the contract together.","So, I don't think the complexity of the contracts is delaying the signing of the contracts. I think the delay, I think that is just more a matter of the organization's timing and focus and strategic planning. And they don't have an outside regulatory timeline that they have to go meet for some of these things. MACRA could change that. MACRA may make them be more focused on making sure they have these solutions throughout all of their departments so that they can get the data they need to do that reporting.","But, so, I don't think the complexity \u2013 these have always been somewhat complex. It's just a matter of the timing of the client to do that. The money is there, as Zane says. It's in our pipeline. It's just timing, tying down the 90-day period at which it's going to actually sign. It is a little bit more traditional to what it was prior to having meaningful use and all of these regulatory things that occurred.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","And then on the booking growth and from Pop Health, what percent is Pop Health and what percent is international?","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Pop Health is a very little piece of bookings growth at this point. I mean, we have some today with the pilot version of Pop Health, a $5 million booking is a good sized Population Health booking. So, it's not moving the meter on a $1 billion bookings number. And relative to global, those bookings have been basically relatively flat, if not a little bit lower over the last year. As Zane said, there's some opportunities going forward, especially in Canada and some other countries that look like demand is beginning to pick up. So we think that will help the global side. But most of the bookings and most of the stuff, growth your seeing is not Pop Health, not international. It is our core businesses that we've always been in.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Well, I want to thank everybody for their time. I think we're still on pace to grow bookings and revenue this your over a very tough comp. And I think we're all absolutely on path to grow revenue and earnings double digit in 2017. So I think based on our pipeline, based on the ITWorks opportunities we have, we do continue to expect to grow bookings year-over-year in 2017. With that, I will thank you for your attendance and bid you good day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference.

Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the call. I'd like to start with the very sad news we all got on July 9 when we learned of Neal's passing. It's been tough for us these past few weeks. And we appreciate the many people have reached out to offer condolences and share their thoughts and stories about Neal.","Neal firmly believed he had a lot more work to do and he didn't stop working until the very end. He believed healthcare was broken and it was our job to fix it. He was not done, but he built a company with 25,000 people who were inspired by his vision and passion for changing healthcare.","We believe the best way to honor his legacy is to keep up the very hard and important work toward achieving the vision he established. We believe Cerner is well positioned to do this and given the talent of our associates and the depth and breadth of our management team which Neal often called the best leadership team in healthcare IT.","With Neal at the helm, we were always recognized as a company with a visionary. But Neal engrained a vision in our culture and now is our chance to prove that we are also a visionary company.","As we announced, Cliff Illig has been named Chairman of the Board and Interim CEO. And the board is nearing completion of its ongoing succession planning process to identify our next CEO. We'll let you know as soon as that process is complete.","With that, I'll transition to a review of our numbers. Zane Burke, our President, will follow me with results highlights and marketplace observations. And then Mike Nill, our Chief Operating Officer, will provide operational highlights.","Regarding our results, Q2 was another good quarter that demonstrated execution against our established targets. Staring with bookings. Our bookings in Q2 was $1.636 billion, which is an all-time high and reflects a 16% increase over Q2 of 2016. Our revenue backlog ended the quarter at $16.65 billion, which is up 11% from $15.013 billion a year ago.","Revenue in the quarter was $1.292 billion, which is up 6% over Q2 of 2016. The revenue composition for Q2 was $348 million in system sales, $260 million in support and maintenance, $658 million in services and $26 million in reimbursed travel.","System sales revenue for the quarter was up 4% compared to Q2 of 2016 with growth in licensed software and subscriptions being partially offset by a decline in technology resale. Our system sales margin percent of 66.3% was up 50 basis points over the year-ago period reflecting the growth in software and down from 68.6% in Q1 of 2017 through the mix of technology resale that included lower levels of third-party software.","Moving to services. Total services revenue, including professional and managed services, was up 9% compared to Q2 of 2016. Support and maintenance revenue increased 1% for the quarter, was slightly below our full-year expected growth rate. But we still expect growth of 3% to 4% for the rest of the year.","Looking at revenue by geographic segment. Domestic revenue increased 8% over the year-ago quarter to $1.16 billion and non-U.S. revenue of $136 million declined 5% against the Q2 2016 comparable that included a higher-than-normal amount of hardware and software revenue. Another factor in the non-U.S. year-over-year decline was that currency fluctuations impacted non-U.S. revenue growth by about 3% in the quarter.","Moving to gross margin. Our gross margin for Q2 was 82.7% which is down 40 basis points compared to a year ago and down 150 basis points compared to Q1 of 2017 primarily due to the lower mix of sublicensed software and our technology resale business that I mentioned.","Now I'll discuss spending, operating margin and net earnings. For these items, I provide both GAAP and adjusted or non-GAAP results. The adjusted results exclude share-based compensation expense, share-based compensation permanent tax items, Health Services acquisition related amortization, acquisition-related deferred revenue adjustments and other acquisition-related adjustments, which are detailed and reconciled to GAAP in our earnings release.","Looking at operating spending, our second quarter GAAP operating expenses of $820 million were up 7% compared to $769 million in the year-ago period. Adjusted operating expenses were $771 million, which is up 7% compared to Q2 of 2016. This growth was primarily driven by an increase in personnel expense related to revenue-generating associates and non-cash items.","Looking at the line items, sales and client service expense increased 8%. Software development increased 6% driven by non-cash items as we had $8 million less capitalized software and $7 million more amortization in Q2 of 2016. G&A expense was up 1%. Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles decreased by $1 million.","Moving to operating margins. Our Q2 GAAP operating margin was 19.3% compared to 19.8% in the year-ago period. Our adjusted operating margin was 23% in Q2, which is down 80 basis points from the year-ago period due to the previously discussed technology resale mix and non-cash expense.","Moving to net earnings and EPS. Our GAAP net earnings in Q2 were $180 million or $0.53 per diluted share. Adjusted net earnings were $206 million and adjusted diluted EPS was $0.61, up 5% from $0.58 in Q2 of 2016. Our GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 29%. When excluding the share-based compensation permanent tax items, the Q2 tax rate was 32% which is basically flat compared to a year ago and consistent with our expectations.","Now I'll move to our balance sheet. We ended Q2 with $748 million of total cash and investments, which is up from $609 million in Q1. Moving to debt. Our total debt, including capital lease obligations, was $543 million which is down slightly compared to Q1.","Total receivables ended the quarter at $1.037 billion which is up from $986 million in Q1. Our Q2 DSO was 73 days which is up from 71 days in Q1 and down from 74 days in the year-ago period. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $292 million.","Q2 capital expenditures were $101 million and capitalized software was $72 million. Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less capital purchases and capitalized software development costs, was $119 million for the quarter.","As we noted the last quarter, our operating cash flow reflects classification changes required by new accounting standards. For Q2 of 2017, this impact resulted in approximately $12 million more operating cash flow than under the prior accounting guidance. We have also recast 2016 cash flows to reflect this change, which resulted in Q2 2016 operating cash flows increasing by $5.5 million over what was previously recorded.","Regarding free cash flow for the year, we still expect to increase our free cash flow by at least $150 million under the prior classification method. It is also likely we'll drive a similar increase under the new method unless the tax impact of share-based compensation is materially lower in 2017. Either way, we expect strong free cash flow this year.","Now I'll go through guidance. We expect revenue in Q3 to be between $1.265 billion and $1.325 billion with the midpoint reflecting growth of 9% over Q3 of 2016. For the full year, we expect revenue between $5.15 billion and $5.25 billion. This range represents a tightening of our previous range and still reflects an 8% full-year growth at the midpoint.","We expect Q3 adjusted diluted EPS to be $0.61 to $0.63 per share with the midpoint reflecting 5% growth over Q3 of 2016. For the full year, we expect adjusted diluted EPS to be $2.46 to $2.54 which also represents a tightening of our previous range and still reflects 9% growth over 2016 at the midpoint.","Moving to bookings. We expect bookings in Q3 of $1.45 billion to $1.60 billion with the midpoint reflecting 6% growth compared to Q3 of 2016. In summary, we are pleased with our good Q2 and look forward to a strong second half of the year.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Zane.","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","Thanks, Marc. Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll provide color on our results and make some marketplace observations.","I'll start with bookings. As Marc mentioned earlier, we had an all-time high level of bookings of $1.64 billion that reflects 16% growth over Q2 of 2016. The strength in booking this quarter was well balanced with good contributions from new and existing clients, short- and long-term contracts and strong growth across all business models except technology resale.","Looking at long-term bookings, 35% of bookings came from long-term contracts, which is up compared to Q2 of 2016 due to good contributions from ITWorks and a strong managed services quarter. A key highlight of our quarter was that we continued our momentum in winning new footprints as reflected in 32% of bookings coming from outside our core Millennium install base.","One of the many noteworthy new relationships this quarter was established with LifePoint Health, a large investor-owned health system that owns and operates more than 70 hospitals and has a significant number of post-acute and outpatient facilities. The contract currently covers a small group of sites that can be expanded to future sites as necessary and includes clinical revenue cycle and ambulatory solutions as well as remote hosting.","I remain pleased with our competitiveness and the amount of activity in EHR placement market. Our new footprints this quarter again demonstrate the trend of hospitals, large and small, looking to get off legacy systems to be on a more modern platform to keep up with regulatory requirements, drive operational efficiencies and prepare for ongoing shifts in reimbursement models.","We believe we're doing very well against our primary competitor in this environment. Given our ability to provide a predictable total cost of ownership on contemporary architecture and demonstrate value and return on investment. Additionally, our demonstrated commitment to an open and interoperable platform with the ability to use data more broadly is increasingly important to clients and prospects like.","Beyond our success outside our installed base, our existing clients remained active in rounding out their solution and service portfolios at their existing Cerner sites while also moving more of their sites to Cerner as they look to drive efficiencies through standardization on Millennium. This activity contributes to growth across acute and ambulatory EHR and includes sales of Population Health and Revenue Cycle solutions and services.","We also saw more ITWorks activity this quarter and continue to view it as a major opportunity in our installed base. In Population Health, while uncertainty remains regarding exactly when the broader shift from fee-for-service to value-based care will occur, there continues to be a high interest in our Population Health solutions. Currently, much of the focus is on analytic capabilities and tools that will support and optimize fee-for-service models while also preparing our clients for the shift to value-based models.","In our smaller venues, we had a strong quarter with our Ambulatory and CommunityWorks offerings. In Ambulatory, we had success at extending our solutions to the ambulatory facilities of our large health system clients, which led to the displacement of several different ambulatory competitors. We also had a noteworthy Ambulatory win at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Medical, which contracted with us for ambulatory EHR, practice management and Population Health solutions. MIT Medical serves more than 20,000 students, faculty, staff and retirees as well as members and their families. Our solutions will support MIT Medical clinical processes and facilitate proactive patient health management across its two locations, in Cambridge and Lexington, Massachusetts.","In CommunityWorks, we had an all-time high level of bookings, which was driven by strong levels of new clients as well as our first ITWorks deal with a CommunityWorks client. Another example of our competitive success is in the state and local market where we were selected by the Wisconsin Department of Health Services. Cerner will implement Millennium at all seven of the WDHS facilities, which include two psychiatric hospitals, two secure treatment facilities and three centers for the developmentally disabled.","Moving to our business outside the U.S. where we had mixed results. Despite the revenue decline, which was driven mostly by foreign currency translation and technology resell, we had several regions with good bookings and a good operational quarter with a client in Brazil achieving HIMSS Stage 6. Areas of bookings strength included Canada, Australia, Belgium and the UK. Looking ahead, we have a strong bookings outlook for our global business, which we expect to lead to better non-U.S. revenue growth, particularly as we move into next year.","Next, I'd like to provide an update on our project with the Department of Defense. Last week, we went live at Naval Hospital Oak Harbor in Washington State. This is a second site to come online as part of the Department of Defense's Initial Operating Capability program, and the go-live marks a significant milestone as the in-patient components of MHS GENESIS are now officially deployed.","Capabilities deployed include a single integrated record across ambulatory, acute and all other venues in the Oak Harbor medical enterprise; medical device interoperability; advanced clinical decision support; specialty provider workflows and embedded clinical calculators; and barcode medication administration. We also deployed a maternity-specific module designed to create a new infant record upon barcode scan and treatment plans tailored to mother and child.","At its core, MHS GENESIS is the same commercially available off-the-shelf electronic medical record that is deployed at thousands of facilities worldwide. This project is creating an integrated and longitudinal patient record and coordination across the continuum of care regardless the environment, scope or size of military and dental treatment facilities. The ability to integrate and share interoperable patient information with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and civilian health systems is critical and is inherently built into the system. We are pleased with this milestone that reflects the ongoing good work at the Department of Defense, Cerner, Leidos and other partners. We expect additional go-lives as we move through the year.","Now I'll briefly discuss our opportunity with the Department of Veterans Affairs. In June, Secretary of Veteran Affairs, Dr. David Shulkin, announced Cerner's selection to lead the next-generation electronic health record system for the Department of Veterans Affairs. We feel a great sense of pride and responsibility to now have the opportunity to support our veterans and extend the reach of the platform being established through our work of Department of Defense. Ensuring a seamless care for our veterans is one of the nation's top priorities and we are honored and humbled to have the opportunity to play a key role in improving the care experience of our former servicemen and women.","We're working closely with the Department of Veterans Affairs on scoping the full work effort, designing the project plan and negotiating a contract. We're also in the process of building our team and selecting partners. Please keep in mind there is little more we can say at this point. We look forward to sharing more information once there is a contract, which we believe will happen by the end of the year.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike.","Michael R. Nill - Cerner Corp.","Thanks, Zane. Good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with ITWorks.","As Zane mentioned, ITWorks was a larger contributor to our bookings in Q2 than it had been in recent quarters. We had a large existing ITWorks client expand the relationship to include additional services. This large expansion of services is a good example of the opportunity we still have within our base of ITWorks clients.","We also added a client to our ITWorks model in this quarter. The client, Western Missouri Medical Center, has been a CommunityWorks client for several years and has deployed Millennium solutions to their 84-bed general medical and surgical hospital and their ambulatory clinics throughout the community.","The addition of ITWorks will provide more resources through Cerner Centralized Services and help them increase system speed, enhance usability and stability, and improve issue resolution through an enhanced help desk. Looking ahead, our pipeline for ITWorks remains strong and we expect good contributions in the second half of the year.","Now I'd like to highlight a recent client accomplishment. Our first client in Brazil, Albert Einstein, recently achieved Stage 6 on HIMSS EMR Adoption Model. This accomplishment came just six months after their go-live. This was a large and complex project that required high levels of adoption and engagement from approximately 8,000 staff members and physicians. Stage 6 is considered a major accomplishment as it signals that hospitals have achieved a significant advancement in their IT capabilities. The hospital is currently making strides to reach HIMSS Stage 7, which is considered a paperless hospital.","Finally, I'd like to mention our recent Developers Conference, which we call DevCon, as I think it is an important part of our development culture and our success. DevCon is an associate-driven conference, designed to increase collaboration and continued learning for all Cerner associates who contribute to the development process. With 3,600 associates attending, its size is second only to the Cerner Health Conference. Attendees learn new concepts, brainstorm ideas and network with fellow associates in a fun and interactive environment. I believe the value of the interaction and collaboration that comes out of an event like this is immeasurable. It is clearly an important part of our culture, which I believe is a differentiating factor for Cerner when it comes to recruiting development talent and delivering high quality solutions.","With that, I'll turn the call over to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. Our first question comes from the line of Matthew Gillmor from Robert Baird. Your question, please.","Matthew D. Gillmor - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hey, thanks for taking the question, and let me offer my condolences on Neal's passing. So, on bookings, wanted to ask about the performance relative to guidance. I believe the second quarter bookings guidance didn't include any meaningful contributions from ITWorks. So, can you give us a sense for how much that large expansion added and did that represent most of the difference versus the initial guidance or did the underlying bookings also outperformed?","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","This is Zane, Matthew. Thanks for the question. You're correct that the initial bookings guidance, we were not anticipating significant contributions from ITWorks in the second quarter, although there are typical expansion opportunities in our base, which would have been part of our core guidance. We did have the small ITWorks offering. So, it's a smaller addition. So the bookings itself actually represented significant over-attainment overall. So it's a combination of the two. We did have this one that came forward a little bit as well as we saw bookings performance in excess of what we anticipated.","Matthew D. Gillmor - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Got it. And then maybe one follow-up on the LifePoint news. Can you just give us a little bit of background on that relationship and how many hospitals you're going to cover with some of the initial rollout?","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","Sure. It's an opportunity we've been working for a number of years. It's a great organization. I think it's one of the really fine examples of operating organization in the for-profit segment. Our initial phasing is a small group of hospitals and with good success should yield more opportunity.","Matthew D. Gillmor - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Larsen from Leerink. Your question, please.","David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC","Congratulations on a good quarter. Can you talk a bit about your Patient Accounting solution and what you're doing in the Revenue Cycle area? And I find it intriguing that \u2013 I think you said LifePoint is signing on with Revenue Cycle solutions and Patient Accounting, is that correct? Maybe talk about that process, please. Thanks very much.","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","Sure. This is Zane. Again, we've had very good success on the Revenue Cycle solutions and made a significant amount of progress there. LifePoint is signed up for full financials as well as the clinical and ambulatory. They are the third investor-owned organization to align along those lines. Previously, we've announced that both IASIS and UHS also made those decisions and they have gone live with the Cerner solutions in that space. So we've seen a lot of significant advancement, acceleration in terms of our acceptance of what we're doing in the Revenue Cycle space and we continue to gain momentum.","David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC","Great. And then I think, Mike, if you're on the line, any thoughts on Intermountain, and how \u2013 I think they're using your Revenue Cycle solution there, how are they progressing? Thanks.","Michael R. Nill - Cerner Corp.","We continue to advance the rollout at Intermountain. We recently completed the rollout within the Salt Lake area and the system is performing very well, the applications are delivering the value that was anticipated. So, Intermountain is serving as kind of a model experience that we're replicating across the rest of our client base, so we're very pleased with the progress thus far.","David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay, great. Thanks and congrats on a good quarter.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sean Dodge from Jefferies. Your question, please.","Sean Dodge - Jefferies LLC","Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks. So maybe going back to guidance, maybe more specifically on revenue guidance. When you first gave your full year target, it didn't sound like it assumed much in the way of bookings growth to get there. And if I look at bookings, if you hit the midpoint of your third quarter guide, bookings for the first nine months of the year would have grown 10%. So, can you help me square what looks like bookings growth running well ahead of your expectations and only a narrowing of the full year revenue target as opposed to tracking towards something maybe above that?","Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Yeah, Sean. This is Marc. The key element to that bookings number is to keep track of the long-term component of that. So I think Q1 was 37%, this quarter is well over 30%. So, strong bookings, but the near-term impact of some of that revenue is not as significant as it would be from things that are not long term in nature. So I think that's the reconciling item, if you will, as to why these bookings beat doesn't drive it. Obviously, we assumed some growth, but we just didn't guide to the specific growth exactly.","So we certainly look to increase the bookings. We're pleased with the bookings growth we've had. But the long-term nature does limit some of the impact that we see currently. The good news is I love those long-term bookings because they basically go into the backlog and they create higher visibility as we continue to see every year as we've gone forward.","Sean Dodge - Jefferies LLC","Okay, thanks. And then on ITWorks, the deals generate revenue pretty quickly after you sign them. You've got the one that you signed in the second quarter. It sounds like there is a couple of more you expect to land in the back half of the year. What does that mean for consolidated margins then as those revenues ramp as we're heading to 2018?","Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Yeah. This is Marc. Relative to the ITWorks, they obviously \u2013 once they turn on, start driving their 8 to 10 years worth of revenue and it starts impacting the quarter, but there is not necessarily a bunch of one-time revenue that comes from those. There is usually some software that's involved with some of those initial ITWorks deal, so that nature has some one-time and there are some projects that often go along with implementing that software in the early stage of an ITWorks.","So when you really look at it overall and balance the outsourcing element initially of the ITWorks deal against some of that software that comes in, in some of the projects, which is higher margin elements, there is a slight negative impact from some of the outsourcing revenues that are kind of lower double-digit type revenues from a margin perspective. But some of that is offset by the higher software margin and the higher project margin certainly in the early years of those. So it doesn't hit the margin significantly in those early years.","Sean Dodge - Jefferies LLC","All right. Thank you, again.","Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ross Muken from Evercore ISI. Your question, please.","Elizabeth Anderson - Evercore Group LLC","Hi. This is Elizabeth Anderson in for Ross. My condolences about Neal's passing. Thank you for taking the question. I was wondering about, if you had any further color on sort of the changes in the tech resale versus subscription versus licensing fees in the quarter or just sort of generally trends like you're seeing in that market this year?","Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Well, this is Marc. From the tech resale line item, we kind of talked a little bit about it. Relative to revenue growth, the tech resale kind of hurt us on a quarter-over-quarter comparison. That actually doesn't necessarily reflect it. Our tech resale was actually up pretty significantly over Q1. It was up against a very tough Q2 quarter, but the level that we delivered, even though was less than last year, was still a good amount of tech resale for us. So I think we're still seeing there is a level of appetite for that. We actually had a stronger hardware quarter in tech resale this quarter than we've had in a while. So that was good from a revenue standpoint.","We didn't see as much sub license software just from a mix standpoint this quarter, which meant that from a margin standpoint, you saw a probably little lower margins when you come in and look at the system sales volume. But overall tech resale, we kind of said last quarter that it felt like we're kind of back on path where we could develop a plan for tech resale and deliver against that plan. And I think we're doing that in the first half of the year. Q2, we just had a tough comp to go again.","So I think from tech resale, things are actually going pretty well relative to subscription. And from license, we had a strong license quarter, continue to do well there. We continue to see strong uptake on the SaaS type of license with that still being over 30% of our revenues we get from a license perspective. So both of those were strong elements in the quarter as well continuing the trend we've seen.","Elizabeth Anderson - Evercore Group LLC","Perfect. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Richard Close from Canaccord Genuity. Your question, please.","Richard Collamer Close - Canaccord Genuity Group, Inc.","Great. Thanks for taking the question. Congratulations here on the quarter. Marc, I was wondering if you could just give us your thoughts on margins overall and how we should think of them longer term. I think you talked about possibly returning to margin expansion. And then maybe more near term as we think about the annual guidance and the third quarter guidance, what gets you up into your higher end on the annual? It would seem to imply a pretty big ramp in the fourth quarter.","Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Yeah. I mean, relative to the fourth quarter, we usually \u2013 Q4 has traditionally been a time when you see a ramp-up, particularly in some of the one-time fee things, it tends to have higher margins. So, that's kind of logical for us that you're going to see the ramp up in earnings hitting in Q4. I think overall margins, as we've indicated from a non-cash impact of amortization, you've seen us that 2017 and 2018 are going to be challenges with those non-cash increases and amortization and depreciation being a headwind that we're going to fight against and basically probably will limit that margin expansion for those two periods. We also saw this quarter where we had a little bit lower capitalized software number net that obviously hit us about a penny of earnings per share relative to year-over-year.","But I think as we get out of this 2017, 2018 timeframe with the non-cash headwind, we've always said that this is a business that should drive 50 basis points to 100 basis points of operating margin at the size we are today and the ability to drive leverage in most of our business models, particularly as you get into 2019 and 2020 and you start seeing an uptick in some of the HealtheIntent and some of the other SaaS and cloud-based models that are higher margin.","I think that remains inherent in the business and I think that's kind of what we would look to get back to our normal margin growth. I think we work very hard to try to keep an eye on our costs and try to grow costs relative to driving revenue, and we'll continue that process. But I think as we get to 2019 and 2020, I think getting back to seeing margin growth is absolutely on our radar.","Richard Collamer Close - Canaccord Genuity Group, Inc.","So, as a follow-up, just based on your pipeline, the way you guys look at it now, there's enough near-term or short-term bookings in there to definitely get to the higher end of the annual range \u2013 EPS range?","Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp.","We provide a range of guidance based on our best estimates. So I can't talk to where in that range we expect to meet. We certainly go through a lot of work in our forecasting process and certainly track a lot of deals and lot of opportunities to put those guidance ranges out there. So we don't comment on whether we're going to be \u2013 where we're going to land within that range. If I knew where we were going to land in that range, I would give you a precise number, but that's why it's a range. There's obviously lots of work and lots of things to go accomplish as we go through the business.","But once again, as we get more toward the second half of this year, particularly on the bookings side, and we've talked about seeing some more Works businesses coming to the forefront, the bookings numbers feel pretty good, and we talked about growing bookings this year. I think we're certainly on track to be able to do that in a meaningful way. But I think our guidance range is consistent and I wouldn't want to pinpoint where we think we're going to land in that.","Richard Collamer Close - Canaccord Genuity Group, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Halper from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your question, please.","Steven Halper - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Yeah, hi. One housekeeping question and then another question. Just the number of contracts over $5 million and $10 million, if that's available?","Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Yeah, it's in the Trend File, Steve, I don't have it right in front of me.","Steven Halper - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Okay. You'll be sending that out, the Trend File?","Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp.","It's out right now.","Steven Halper - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Okay. Thank you. And then the real question, you talked around your HealtheIntent being used to optimize your fee-for-service and clients prepare to move into value-based reimbursement arrangements. Is that a recognition that the market itself and the clients themselves are not necessarily ready for what you have to offer or is it a function of the product capabilities and where you're at in the marketplace?","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","Steve, I think it actually is representative of how broad a scope of solutions that we have, which is when you get access to data in a very broad way, it opens your mind to how you can use that data to run your current fee-for-service world as well as prepare you for an at-risk world. So I think the beauty of what the Cerner team has done with the application set is really create a platform by which clients can embrace the technology today to get significant value out of going after fee-for-service world elements and knowing that those same toolsets they can use to actually to flip to the at-risk basis, because it's really that access to data, additional data outside the EMR itself, that really helps clients think about how to enhance their business in a different way.","And I think what we've done is shine a light on some of those kind of opportunities in the fee-for-service world at the same time we're talking about the at-risk model. So it's really a breadth and depth conversion. And it also has us where we're feeling comfortable about continued growth in our Population Health solutions no matter what the timing of fee-for-service or the flip to the value-based care is.","Steven Halper - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Right. So we shouldn't look at that comment as, oh, this might not be as important as we previously expected, correct?","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","Actually, I'd look at it quite the opposite.","Steven Halper - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Okay.","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","I'd say this is much more important, especially given that you're seeing some parts of organizations that are having some softness on certain areas in their marketplace, that they'll need tools like what we offer in the population health space to actually go maximize their fee-for-service world.","Steven Halper - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Cherny from UBS. Your question please.","Michael Cherny - UBS Securities LLC","Hi. Good afternoon, guys. And I also want to pass along my thoughts on the whole team relative to Neal's passing. Jumping into business and in terms of thinking more big picture, there's been a lot of noise across the market in terms of potentially non-traditional players entering into the space in some way, shape or form. As you think about the competitive moats that you've created, be it just the single installed base, the years of R&D and product development; how do you think about your ability to work with, work in conjunction with or fend off some of these new untraditional partners and maybe looking at when stuff like this has happened in the past, what have been the failures or what at least has allowed you to contain and maintain your share levels?","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","This is Zane. I'll take it. And, Mike, if you'd like to add any comments toward the end, that'd be great. But I look at it and say, first off, working with some of these non-traditional competitors, I think, as we're all talking about; we see those as great opportunities to work with others to really bring the value of some of the datasets. And I think it's really the value of being an open and interoperable platform. The core transactional EMR is a place where I think we have a significant moat built around us. The ability to get data out of our solutions is becoming increasingly important to clients overall. I don't currently anticipate that any of those non-traditional players are truly looking at the types of systems that we're operating in today. I fully actually anticipate that you'll see us embrace many, many organizations to use the full capabilities of the dataset and the EHR and our HealtheIntent solutions such that I think we embrace that part of the world. So I think that's sort of the non-traditional piece of today.","What I will say is many people have tried to get into this marketplace over time. Many large companies over a course of years have tried to engage in this space. And it's very hard and very different. And it is a very challenging and complex business. And there are many companies that have operated, that have tried to engage. So from an IBM to a McDonnell Douglas, there is a number of them. You can McKesson on that same line as well. And it's just very, very challenging for those who are not totally focused on the thing \u2013 the only thing they can get up and think about is healthcare and IT. And we stand at that cross-section of that. I think competition's a great thing. I actually don't think that those that are rumored to be doing things in this space are thinking about how they're going to create the next EHR. They're thinking about how can they add value into the whole entire healthcare supply chain and how can they think about making the consumer experience a better one because all of us are about to have a better patient experience at the end of the day.","Michael R. Nill - Cerner Corp.","Yeah. I can make a couple of comments as well. We have an ongoing relationship with, I think, many of these companies that you're referring to. And as Zane mentioned, the fact that our strategy to be an open and interoperable platform has made it fairly simple for us to work with these companies to exploit the large datasets and combine that with their capabilities around artificial intelligence and processing these massive amounts of data to drive intelligence back into the workflow. So I think as we move forward, you'll see how we leverage those capabilities to bring some very new concepts to market.","Michael Cherny - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nicholas Jansen from Raymond James. Your question please.","Nicholas M. Jansen - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey, guys. Congrats on a strong bookings quarter. Just quickly on cash flow. Obviously, it's seen a nice improvement year-over-year. But we haven't seen any share repurchase activity in the first half of the year. So I'm just trying to get a sense of how we should be thinking about capital deployment priorities and whether or not M&A is of interest now that the Siemens deal has been fully integrated. Thanks.","Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Yeah. This is Marc. Certainly, we're always looking at capital deployment. We went into the market very strong last year on a stock repurchase, spent a lot of cash in the market against our target of certainly buying enough shares to offset any option dilution, over-attained that target significantly. As we come into this year, an environment of somewhat rising interest rates; it's not a good time to sell out of any of our relatively short term but still existing investments and take a loss to go execute on these \u2013 on a share repurchase. Absolutely still on our plan to do share repurchase. Given that the additional $500 million was approved in May, I think that certainly gives us an opportunity to look at that as we get into the second half of the year and get some available cash.","Relative to M&A, we're not acquisitive. That's not the kind of company we are. Siemens was certainly a mark \u2013 a we're being successful in the marketplace today. There's not really any of those opportunities out there that look attractive to us. That being said, we continue to look at opportunities that we could enter new markets, leverage our existing capabilities. And we'll continue to do that constantly, which we have done. The number of those that actually make it to a point where they would make any sense has been significantly limited. But we certainly want to make sure that in an environment that's very quickly changing, that we keep an eye out and look for things that \u2013 especially when it's not relative to Millennium, but it's related to our HealtheIntent platform, which is \u2013 both of those platforms are interoperable. But HealtheIntent certainly allows us to look at opportunities that could integrate very quickly to that platform. So we'll keep our mind open. But from a stock repurchase which is where we're really focused on our capital deployment recently, we'll certainly be looking at that in the second half.","Nicholas M. Jansen - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","I'll keep it to one. Thanks for the color.","Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Yeah.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stephanie Davis from JPMorgan. Your question please.","Stephanie J. Davis - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, guys. Thank you for taking my question and my condolences on the news. Given the strength in 2Q bookings, could you talk to the drivers of moderation for your 3Q bookings guidance especially at the low end? And could you also touch on if this year-to-date strength impacts your full-year view just given previously modest bookings expectations?","Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Can you repeat the second part of that question?","Stephanie J. Davis - JPMorgan Securities LLC","I just wanted to ask if the year-to-date strength in bookings impacts your full-year view, just that you had previously modest expectations for the full-year outcome.","Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Well, I think our outcome coming into the year was one of we expect to grow bookings. And so I think, obviously, in the first two quarters, we've done that relatively successfully. We don't provide bookings guidance beyond the quarter. So relative to anything we've talked about for the full year, we certainly are on track for that, for growth. As most of you know, our guidance for bookings is created out of our forecast meetings where we go through on a deal-by-deal basis and look at the opportunities that we see out there. And that is the basis for the number that comes out in Q3. It's not going to be more conservative or more aggressive. It is based on our best view of what the opportunities out there.","Now, certainly, as we've talked about in the second half of the year, we see an opportunity with more ITWorks deals in our pipeline. And certainly, some of those have upside potential that we might not put into our forecast. So there could be an upside to some of the numbers that we've talked about. But once again our guidance is based on our normal practices. So it's not one way or the other relative to trying to achieve a goal. It is the best number we see. Zane, do you have a comment?","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","Yeah. I would just say we started out the year saying we would grow bookings. That's the extent of the guidance. But, obviously, we've had very strong year-to-date performance. And our Q3 guidance puts us in a great position to have good growth. And my outlook for the back half of the year is very strong. But it all aligns with what Marc said about how we have a discipline around forecasting. We feel very strong about the marketplace and our solution set and how we're being received in that marketplace. And the thoughts that we had about both our core EMR replacement marketplace as well as the works businesses overall are coming into play as we look at what's happened for the first half of the year and then particularly as we look at the second half of the year.","Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Yeah, and this is Marc. I think really Q3 is actually a pretty strong guided quarter given the significant over-attainment that we had in Q2 that was broad strength across all of our businesses. So we're actually pretty pleased with the Q3 number we have out there.","Stephanie J. Davis - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, all right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Stockton from Wells Fargo. Your question please.","Jamie Stockton - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi, yeah. Good evening. Let me just say I was very sorry to hear about Neil. I guess maybe Marc, on the support revenue, the dollars here aren't that significant. But I'm sure that there are some people wondering, so I figured I'll ask. Seems like it's coming in a little light. Is there anything going on there where maybe the subscription business is cannibalizing it a little bit or you guys are folding some of that into some of these works deals that you're doing, any color there?","Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Yeah. The primary thing for support, Jamie, is usually deals with maintenance contracts that are included in there that relate to the hardware we sell. As more and more clients opt for hosting and that's part of the impact this quarter on the strong long-term bookings, those maintenance contracts go away. They get out of their hardware. We don't buy their hardware, but they don't maintain their hardware. And a lot of times, it's at a time when they would be looking at purchasing new hardware, they go to hosting. That takes away the maintenance.","Certainly, this quarter was a little bit lower and the primary impact was that. I think for the year, we would expect to be 3% to 4%. It's kind of where we started the year and I think that's kind of what we would like. I think, certainly, as we've talked about with the Siemens acquisition, we've seen \u2013 there was a small set of clients, when we made that purchase, that had already made a decision to go outside of Cerner or Siemens. And as those complete their projects, then that support will turn off. So there's a little bit of impact on that in addition to the maintenance. We're still maintaining 75% of that base.","So we're very pleased about how that acquisition has gone. But this is kind of the window where some of that \u2013 as those projects move forward with their other supplier, we'll have a small impact on that. But still for the year, 3% to 4% feels right.","Jamie Stockton - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay, that's great. And then maybe one other quick one. You guys have made a number of comments that it seems like the ITWorks businesses is picking up a little momentum here. If we think about the RevWorks services business, my perception is you've had some decent deal flow in kind of the ambulatory setting. But it's been quite a while on the inpatient side. I guess I kind of came away late last year thinking that maybe things would pick up in 2017. But it doesn't really feel like that's happened yet. Can you just give us some color on what's going on there and when you think things will actually start to come back?","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","Jamie, this is Zane. So I think your characterization is pretty accurate in terms of we've had very good success particularly in the ambulatory RevCycle space. There's a couple of things. First off, we want to do very well with our alpha client, Adventist HealthCare, and really make sure that we deliver and have this figured out before we go roll out aggressively into the marketplace. So we have been almost a self-limiting factor for ourselves in terms of some of the acute side of doing a full RCO outsourcing arrangement.","We have begun accelerating that. We're feeling good about where we are in that project and the work that's been done and our ability to scale more broadly. And we are seeing things move through the pipeline that reflect larger opportunities. And whether those hit in 2017 or not, I can't say at this point. I'm looking at that more as a 2018 growth opportunity for us. But I'm feeling very good about how things are progressing through the pipeline. Similar to how we looked at the end of 2016 and said we see ITWorks returning back into the model for us and we thought as a second half of 2017 and that's exactly how it's playing out; that's how I would anticipate the RevWorks portion hitting.","Jamie Stockton - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay, that's great. Thank you.","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","Thank you.","Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Jonathan, do we have some more questions?","Operator","Can you hear me?","Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp.","I can hear you now.","Operator","Great. Our next question comes from the line of Sean Wieland [Piper Jaffray]. Your line is open.","Sean W. Wieland - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Great, thanks. So it's been some tough sledding in the for-profit hospital market or at least some of them. And I just want to hear from you. Are you seeing any of this in the nonprofit community hospital setting? And given some of these headwinds that we're reading about, how has your dialogue changed with some of these hospitals that are maybe facing pressure on admissions or expense management, that kind of thing? How has your dialogue changed with these customers over the past, say, three to six months?","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","Great question, Sean. I have not been seeing as much in the not-for-profit space as I have seen in the investor-owned space. And I can't get a great explanation for that. So what I am seeing in both spaces is we continue to see, like the LifePoint example, that organizations are going to use technology to help themselves in terms of operating at a higher performance level and that particularly in the for-profit space, they've got to operate as true clinically integrated organizations versus financial portfolio companies. And I think that's part of why their investment continues in that space and our proven capabilities across a number of different investor-owned organizations, and really our ability to drive hard value to the bottom line. So even in spite of some of the headwinds that they've had in this particular last quarter, we are seeing good buying in that space.","It is a little unique in that I'm not seeing some of those same kinds of conversations around the admissions on the not-for-profit side. And I'm not sure if that's just a lagging indicator. I'll be paying attention to that as we kind of move forward over the back half of the year. But to date, not really changing the dialogue with us.","Sean W. Wieland - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Okay, thanks. And, Marc, one quick follow-up just to clarify. You had given us a couple of data points on what the incremental contribution margin would be from a new ITWorks client. But I'm not sure I understood those. What is the incremental contribution margin for a new ITWorks client?","Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Yeah, Sean. The point I was trying to make is that a new ITWorks client comes with the ITWorks outsourcing services, which are low double-digit margins but also usually comes with a software transaction, which is going to be software, it's going to be additional professional services to implement. So that first two year or so period of an ITWorks client, new ITWorks client, is going to have a mix of that margin which is some very high margin, some medium margin and some lower margin, which overall usually will balance out to being something that helps support our margins overall.","Potentially in that period, it's slightly accretive but certainly isn't going to be something that's a big negative impact as opposed to if you just added some of the lower-margin services business. Right now, if you look at an ITWorks client, the contribution margin is probably overall about 40% contribution margin. And with all of the elements that go into that and a lot of the \u2013 certainly the software and the implementation services kind of help keep the overall margins high in the early years.","Sean W. Wieland - Piper Jaffray & Co.","That's super helpful. Thank you.","Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Hey, I think we'll take one more question. Before we get to that question, I did want to make a point. I think when I was talking earlier about some of the impact of tech resale for the quarter relative to revenue growth, I want to make sure tech resale year-over-year was lower but relative. So it did have a negative impact on our revenue growth, but it was still actually over Q1 was up. And so it was strong performance over Q1. So I think that was the point I was trying to make. And Allan was trying to clean me up, so I just wanted to make sure I got that out before our last question. So if we can go for one more question.","Operator","Certainly. Our final question comes from the line of Jeff Garro from William Blair. Your question please.","Jeff R. Garro - William Blair & Co. LLC","Yeah. Good afternoon, guys, and thanks for taking the question and squeezing me in here. I think there is some sentiment that a couple of areas of positive bookings contributors like the EHR replacement market and the Siemens client conversations are due to taper at some point. And that's certainly mostly due to your success in capturing those opportunities. But wanted to hear your outlook on the near-term pipeline in those areas and for other large categories that could grow to fill in as needed as we look out past the next quarter. Thanks.","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","Thanks, Jeff. We remain very excited about the near-term EHR market. There's still 50% of the marketplace that is on a non-currently-marketed solution set from our competitors. And so I think it represents great opportunity and the pipeline remains very strong and robust. In addition to that, we're starting to see the ITWorks development growth that we had indicated at the end of the year and we thought would happen and is in fact coming together as we thought. I've already discussed the RevWorks and how we see that playing out for 2018. In addition to that part, there is strength in the state and local marketplace and what that represents for us. And you're seeing a significant amount of buying behavior in that segment. And we've done very well and performed very well in that segment, which is incredibly important as you try to go out and do procurements in that space.","Finally, we have a couple of very large whales out there in the form of the DoD, the Department of Defense. So our ability to go execute on the four initial sites will free up basically the additional bookings over the course of time for that project. And so that represents significant growth for us around the DoD. And really that contract, it's already in place but just \u2013 it requires the performance. And that's why I always say our best indicator for future success is how we're performing. And we're very pleased with what we've done to date. We have to get through these next two sites and then that releases an additional flow over time. Finally, we have the Veterans Administration opportunity, where we are the prime contractor. So we anticipate that happening by end of year. And that will be a multiyear additional solution set for us.","So while we do think that over time there is an inevitable slowdown in the EMR marketplace, we don't see that at this point in time as we look out. And we see significant large opportunities beyond that core EMR marketplace where we're uniquely positioned to succeed and win across a number of different areas. In addition to that, we like our position in the global presence. So what we've done from a global perspective, the results haven't necessarily matched up with where we feel like we can take this marketplace and really drive that into a different perspective. So there are a number of reasons and I didn't even talk about Population Health as part of that dialogue. So we're incredibly bullish on the future of the company and our opportunities moving forward. And really ours will be much more about what opportunities should we focus on and less about there won't be enough opportunities. So that's the job of our management team is to figure out our focus and where we're going to focus our attention such that we can grow at the largest and most appropriate rate while we deliver value for our clients.","Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Great. Thank you, Zane. In closing, I want to thank everybody for joining the call. We're certainly pleased with the results and the outlook we provided today. I also want to thank you for the kind words and condolences on Neal's passing. We certainly appreciate your thoughts. And with that, have a good day.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect.

Today's date is February 10, 2015, and this call is being recorded.","The company has asked me to remind you that various remarks made here today constitute forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, those regarding projections of future revenues or earnings, operating margins, operating expenses, product development, new markets or prospects for the company solutions and plans and expectations related to the acquisition of Siemens Health Services.","Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements may be found under Item 1A in Cerner's Form 10-K, together with the company's other filings.","A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this earnings call can be found in the company's earnings release, which was furnished to the SEC today and posted to the Investors section of cerner.com.","At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Marc Naughton, Chief Financial Officer of Cerner Corporation. Please proceed, sir.","Marc Naughton","Thank you, Alex. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the call. I'll lead off today with a review of the numbers. Zane Burke, our President, will follow me with results, highlights and marketplace observations. Mike Nill, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, will discuss operations. Neal Patterson, our Chairman and CEO, is traveling. Jeff Townsend, Executive Vice President and Chief of Staff, will be at our Investment Community during HIMSS and looks forward to providing an update on our rollout of solutions at Intermountain Healthcare and our strategic alignment with them that we believe will broadly benefit Cerner, Intermountain Healthcare and our client base.","Now I will turn to our results. Overall, we had a solid Q4, a very strong year, and we have a good outlook for 2015 and beyond. Our total bookings revenue in Q4 was $1.16 billion, which is an all-time high and reflects 5% growth over Q4 of '13. Bookings margin in Q4 was $982 million or 85% of total bookings. For the full year, bookings revenue was $4.25 billion, up 13% over 2013.","Our bookings performance drove a 19% increase in total backlog to $10.62 billion. Contract revenue backlog of $9.79 billion is 20% higher than a year ago. Support revenue backlog of $826 million is up 5%.","Revenue in the quarter was $926 million, which is up 16% over Q4 of '13. The revenue composition for Q4 was $280 million in system sales, $197 million in support and maintenance, $431 million in services and $81 million in reimbursed travel. For the full year, revenue grew 17% over 2013 to $3.4 billion.","System sales revenue reflects a 14% increase over Q4 of '13, with strong growth in technology resale and good growth in software revenue. For the full year, system sales revenue grew 12% over 2013, driven by software growth of 17% that was partially offset by lower full year technology resale growth of 4%. Subscription revenue grew 12% for the year.","Q4 system sales margin dollars grew 11% over the year-ago period, and full year system sales margin dollars grew 16% over 2013, reflecting continued strong levels of higher-margin system sales components like software and subscriptions.","Moving to services, total services revenue was up 19% compared to Q4 of '13 and 23% for the full year, with strong growth in professional services, managed services and ITWorks. Support and maintenance revenue increased 16% over Q4 of '13 and 9% for the full year.","The higher growth rate in Q4 reflects the impact of the quarter having 14 weeks, instead of our typical 13 weeks. Note that the revenue benefit of the extra week was minimal for professional services and system sales, as we had low professional services utilization during the extra week due to the holiday and system sales is mostly non-recurring revenue.","Looking at revenue by geographic segment. Domestic revenue increased 14% and global revenue grew 34% over Q4 of '13. The higher rate of global growth in Q4 was driven by strong software and technology resale as well as continued growth in global managed services. For the full year, domestic revenue grew 18% and global grew 6%.","As a preview to the annual update of our detailed business model that we'll provide at our Investment Community Meeting on April 14 at HIMSS, I'd like to provide you with the total revenue and growth by business model for the full year 2014.","Licensed software grew 17% to $453 million. Technology resale grew 4% to $273 million. Subscriptions and transactions increased 12% to $220 million. Professional services revenue grew 28% to $1.09 billion. Managed services increased 15% to $549 million. Support and maintenance was up 9% to $725 million. And reimbursed travel was $90 million, which is up 28%.","Moving to gross margin. Our gross margin for Q4 was 81.3%, which is down compared to 82.1% in Q4 of '13, reflecting the higher level of tech resale and third-party services compared to the year-ago period. Full year gross margin of 82.2% was basically flat to 2013.","Looking at operating spending, our fourth quarter operating expenses before share-based compensation expense and acquisition-related adjustments were $524 million, which is up 17% compared to adjusted Q4 of '13 operating expenses, which also excluded a settlement charge.","For the full year, operating expenses before share-based compensation expense and acquisition-related adjustments were up 18% to $1.96 billion. Adjusting the growth rate for the extra week reduces the Q4 growth rate to approximately 10% and the full-year growth rate to about 16%.","Sales and client service expenses increased 17% compared to Q4 of '13 and 19% for the full year, driven primarily by a continued increase in revenue generating associates in our services businesses. Our investment in software development was up 15% compared to Q4 of '13 and up 16% for the full year, and continues to be driven by investments in our growth initiatives.","G&A expense increased 16% compared to Q4 of '13 and 13% for the full year, driven mostly by increases in personnel expense related to our strong growth and higher amortization expense related to recent acquisitions and acquired intangibles.","Moving to operating margins. Our operating margin before share-based compensation expense and acquisition-related adjustments was 24.7% in Q4. This is down 90 basis points compared to Q4 of '13 due to higher tech resale and to third-party services. We were also impacted by the extra week, which ended up having a slightly bigger impact on expenses than it did on some revenue elements, such as professional services, where we incurred a full week of expenses, but had low utilization due to the holiday.","As we indicated last quarter, we expect the first year of incorporating Siemens Health Services into our results to bring our adjusted operating margins down to the low 20% range. We expect operating margin to return to the mid-20s by 2017 based on ongoing leverage in our core business and as the expected accretion ramps.","Moving to net earnings and EPS. Our GAAP net earnings in Q4 were $148 million or $0.42 per diluted share. GAAP net earnings include share-based compensation expense, which had a net impact on earnings of $11 million or $0.3 per diluted share. GAAP net earnings also include adjustments related to our acquisition of Siemens Health Services, which had a net impact on earnings of $4 million or $0.2 per diluted share.","Adjusted net earnings were $163 million and adjusted EPS was $0.47, which is up 20% compared to Q4 of '13. For the year, adjusted net earnings were $576 million and adjusted EPS was $1.65, which is up 17% from 2013.","The Q4 tax rate for adjusted net earnings was 30%, which is lower than our normal tax rate, primarily due to the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit during the quarter. In total, the lower tax rate benefited Q4 adjusted EPS by $0.2, with about $0.1 tied to the prior period portion of the credit. For 2015, we expect our tax rate to be in the 33% to 35% range.","Now I'll move to our balance sheet. We ended Q4 with $1.65 billion of total cash and investments, which is up $94 million compared to Q3. Our total debt, including capital lease obligations is $130 million, down from $147 million in Q3. As previously announced, we added $500 million of debt early this year, which will increase our balance sheet efficiency and provide ample financial flexibility at a low cost. The impact on earnings from the debt will be minimal and does not change our guidance.","Total receivables ended the quarter at $673 million, which is up $56 million from Q3, driven by strong sales in the quarter. Our DSO in Q4 was 66 days, which compares to DSO of 67 days in Q3 and 67 days in the year-ago quarter.","Operating cash flow for the quarter was $223 million. Q4 capital expenditures were $76 million and capitalized software was $47 million. Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures and capitalized software, was $100 million for the quarter.","For the full year, operating cash flow increased 22% to $847 million. Free cash flow for the year was $393 million with capital expenditures of $276 million and capitalized software of $178 million.","Moving to capitalized software, the $47 million of capitalized software in Q4 represents 37% of the $126 million of total investment in development opportunities. Software amortization for the quarter was $28 million, resulting in net capitalization of $19 million or 15% of our total R&D investment.","For 2015, we expect to continue generating good free cash flow, with strong expected operating cash flow growth offsetting an expected increase in capital expenditures tied to beginning construction of a new campus and capital expenditures related to our Siemens Health Services acquisition.","Now I'd like to provide an update on our acquisition of Siemens Health Services, which closed last week as scheduled. The purchase price was $1.37 billion, which includes the $1.3 billion agreed upon price and $70 million in working capital adjustments.","We accomplished a significant amount of integration and transition preparation in the six months since we announced the acquisition. There is still a lot of work to do, but all of our work to date has supported our positive view of Health Services, and we are very excited to move forward as a combined company.","Now, I'll go through Q1 and full year 2015 guidance. For Q1, we expect revenue between $1.05 billion and $1.1 billion, with a midpoint reflecting growth of 37% over Q1 of '14. For the full year, we expect revenue between $4.8 billion and $5 billion, reflecting 44% growth at the midpoint.","We expect Q1 adjusted EPS before share-based compensation and acquisition-related adjustments to be $0.44 to $0.45 per share, with the midpoint reflecting 20% growth over Q1 '14 adjusted EPS. I'd like to point out that the consensus for Q1 adjusted EPS increased from $0.44 to $0.46 in the last 30 days and it appears to include some significant outliers.","Our guidance is based on our outlook, not consensus, but I want to point this out, because Q1 consensus seem to shift a bit out of line with the rest of the year, especially when you consider Q1 will naturally include the least amount of accretion from Health Services.","For the full year, we continue to expect adjusted EPS before share-based compensation and acquisition-related adjustments to be $2.05 to $2.15, with a midpoint reflecting 27% growth. Our estimate for the impact of share-based compensation expense is approximately $0.03 to $0.04 in Q1 and $0.14 to $0.16 for the full year.","Moving to bookings guidance. We expect bookings revenue in Q1 of $1.05 billion to $1.15 billion, with the midpoint reflecting 21% growth over Q1 of '14.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Zane.","Zane Burke","Thanks, Marc. Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll provide color on our results and make some marketplace observations. I'll start with our results.","Our bookings revenue in Q4 of $1.16 billion reflects 5% growth over Q4 2013, which was an all-time high. Full year bookings of $4.25 billion represent 13% growth over 2013.","I view our bookings performance is very good, especially when you consider the mix of long-term bookings was lower than it has been in the past. In Q4, long-term bookings were 24% of total bookings. This is well below our typical 30% to 32% range.","While, we did have one ITWorks deal in the quarter, the overall lower mix of long-term contracts is the primary reason our bookings were at the lower end of our guidance range. For the year, 30% of our contracts were long-term compared to 32% last year. As Michael discussed, our outlook for ITWorks is very good.","Looking at overall contract size, we had strong level of contracts over $5 million and $10 million, with 33 contracts over $5 million, including 16 over $10 million. For the year, we had record level of contracts at both categories, with 112 contracts over $5 million and 63 over $10 million.","New business activity was good, with 28% of our bookings coming from outside of our core Millennium installed base for both the quarter and full year. This is slightly lower percent than last year, which is more reflective of success in our base than lack of success outside of our base.","Looking ahead, our pipeline reflects more new business opportunities than we have ever had going into a year, with a notable step up from a number of opportunities we saw in 2014. I am also pleased with how well-positioned we are competitively in these opportunities. As a result, I expect 2015 to be a very good year for new business.","I believe we still have a multiyear period ahead of us, where there will be opportunities to win new footprints, where the core EHR isn't Cerner's. Overlapping this opportunity is growing demand for population health solutions, which continues to be fueled by trend away from fee-for-service payment models.","A recent example of this trend is HHS' announcement last month that they intend to ship from fee-for-service to value-based reimbursement more rapidly than many people expected, with a goal of having 90% of Medicare payments tied to quality or value by 2018.","I believe these trends play to Cerner's strength, as we improved our solutions that meet the present need of healthcare providers, while also widening our differentiation and population health, interoperability and having the most open EHR.","Now, I'll discuss a few key areas of our business, starting with population health. Our population health organization had a strong 2014 with revenue increasing more than 20% to $415 million. This was driven by sales of enterprise data warehouse, analytics, clinical process optimization, HIE, Patient Portal and Healthe registries.","2014 was also a year in which we demonstrated that our Healthe Intent platform has great potential beyond our installed base by establishing important new population health footprints outside our base. We have many more prospects in 2015. As I mentioned last quarter, we believe we will emphasis where our population health capabilities are sold first, and then lead to new EHR footprints.","Another trend that emerged in 2014 is that we are already starting to see opportunities to displace niche providers of population health solutions that were purchased by our clients as recently as 18 to 24 months ago. One of our larger bookings in Q4 was for replacing several niche population health solutions at a large client.","The niche providers have not taken on the significant challenge of aggregating and normalizing clinical, claims and financial data across multiple systems. It is also difficult for them to match our ability to bring new real-time information into the clinician's workflow. As a result, we believe most competing offerings are using incomplete and latent datasets and they are part of the workflow, which makes them less attractive to providers.","Moving to our revenue cycle business. We had a very good year that included strong growth and good progress at bringing key clients live on a revenue cycle solutions. For the year, our revenue cycle business grew more than 30% to approximately $200 million. This is a five-fold increase since 2010, reflecting our strong progress and returns on the significant ongoing R&D investments we've been making in this space.","A key for our revenue cycle business has been getting more large clients to roll out our revenue cycle solutions. 2014 was a big year in this regard, as we brought sites live for some of our largest clients, and they are now hosting reference sites for us.","This success contributed to another one of our large IDN clients purchasing a broad suite of revenue cycle solutions in the fourth quarter to implement across their 12 acute facilities and 85 ambulatory clinics. In addition to our strong current capabilities contributing to this selection, a key factor was our work on next generation revenue cycle solutions, designed to support emerging financial models that are more aligned with population health.","Looking ahead, we have a very strong pipeline for revenue cycle that includes several of our large IDN clients. We also believe the significant experience the Health Services associates bring will help continue our strong momentum.","Moving to the ambulatory space, where we had a strong Q4 and year that included the following highlights: 16% revenue growth to $151 million; record bookings, including 30% growth in the business office services, where we continue to gain momentum; signed 11 signature displacements of our key competitors, including the three largest clients of one competitor; signed an alignment deal with an investor owned post-acute care company to do outsourced billing for their providers in several markets; and we received Best in KLAS recognition in the one to 10 Physician Ambulatory EMR category.","We also had a great year in the small hospital market, adding more than 20 CommunityWorks clients during the year and growing bookings over 50%. We were also recognized again by KLAS as category leader in the community hospital market.","Outside of U.S., we had a very strong Q4, with revenue growing 34%, driven by strength in the U.K., Middle East and Australia. This growth, combined with a good growth in Q3, offsets decline in the first half of the year and led to 6% full-year growth. We remain well-positioned for a good 2015 based on the strong global pipeline, great 2014 bookings and the complimentary global business of Siemens Health Services.","I'd like to highlight an announcement from early this year that we helped the U.A.E. Ministry of Health become the first organization in the Middle East to rollout a member portal. The online portal is a bilingual website that allows residents of Dubai and Northern Emirates to communicate directly with the ministry's healthcare providers. As we've discussed in the past, population health is very much a global opportunity, and this is a nice milestone in an important region that could lead to broader population health opportunities.","One additional global highlight is that Cerner client Marina Salud became the first non-U.S. hospital to earn the HIMSS Davies Enterprise Award. Davies Award recipients are HIMSS stage 6 and 7 organizations that demonstrate significant, sustainable improvement of patient outcomes through the utilization of EHRs and information technology, while achieving return on investment.","Before turning the call over to Mike, I'd like to make a few comments on our recently closed acquisition of Siemens Health Services. We are very pleased to welcome the Health Services associates and clients to Cerner. Thanks to a significant amount of pre-close efforts on both sides, we have hit the ground running.","We just had our first joint forecast meetings this past week, just two days after the official close of the acquisition. These meetings reinforced my positive view about the opportunities we have as a combined organization.","We have a good initial view of cross-sell opportunities and we are already in discussions with many of our new clients about providing additional Cerner solutions to meet their needs, ranging from replacing their EHR to adding population health or device connectivity capabilities. We look forward to providing you updates as we progress through the year.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike.","Michael Nill","Thanks, Zane. Good afternoon, everyone. Today I'm going to discuss ITWorks, professional services and provide a client success highlight. I'll start with ITWorks, which had a great year, including a new contract in the fourth quarter.","Our new ITWorks client is Genesis Health System, based in Davenport, Iowa. Like most organizations, they have been on a journey to increase quality, while reducing costs. They viewed an ITWorks alignment as a good match. It can improve service and allow for predictable IT spend.","The new relationship also calls for the establishment of a value alignment office, which is aimed at helping Genesis innovate and optimize care processes, ensure patients receive the best possible care and increase return on technology investments. The agreement also includes new services, such as help desk operations, application services and optimization of IT service delivery across the health system.","Financial results for ITWorks were excellent in 2014, with revenue growing over 60% to more than $300 million. We believe our offering is very compelling, because we help clients control spending, while getting more done and achieving a higher level of value. Our ITWorks clients are all referenceable, 100% have attested for meaningful use, and 74% are at HIMSS EMR adoption level 6 or 7, which is more than 3x the 22% industry attainment level.","Overall, ITWorks clients are typically model clients that stay on our latest code, embrace new solutions and services and are strong Cerner advocates. We believe that as provider organizations face ongoing pressures, our ITWorks value proposition will continue to resonate very well. This is reflected in a very strong pipeline, and we expect 2015 to be a record year.","Now I'd like to provide some highlights from a strong year from our professional services organization that they delivered. In 2014, our professional services revenue grew more than 25% and eclipsed the $1 billion mark, with strong growth in traditional implementation revenue as well as operational management, performance improvement and other non-implementation revenue that is creating diversity in our services business.","With approximately 6,000 associates, our professional services organization is the largest healthcare IT-focused consulting business in the world. I believe our services capabilities create a competitive advantage over competitors that rely almost entirely on third-party services, because of our ability to deliver a predictable outcome at a predictable cost.","In 2014, we continued to advance our implementation methodologies, including our model system approach that starts with a fully built best-practices system, then allows for fine tuning as users get hands-on experience and training. This approach has the potential to significantly reduce implementation duration and effort, which should benefit new clients transitioning to a Cerner platform.","In 2015, we are focused on: first, facilitating seamless migrations for clients of Health Services that choose to move to Cerner; second, continuing to grow non-implementation components of our business, such as process optimization, enterprise resource planning and performance improvement; and third, staffing the expected increase in new footprints that Zane discussed earlier.","Now I'd like to briefly highlight a client accomplishment involving success with our revenue cycle solutions. Recently, Cerner client Lafayette General Hospital received a MAP award from the Healthcare Financial Management Association. MAP stands for measure, apply and perform, and Lafayette General is one of only three organizations in the country recognized by HFMA for performance improvement in revenue cycle.","The key achievement of Lafayette was decreasing net AR days from 75 days to 44 days. They were also able to reduce their levels of discharged not final billed from nearly $20 million down to approximately $6 million.","A key to their success has been their ability to leverage Cerner's clinically-driven revenue cycle to enable staff to capture accurate and complete information at the front-end, provide financial clearance capabilities and enable client data to drive coding, billing and cash collection operations.","With that, I'll turn the call over for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Michael Cherny with Evercore ISI.","Michael Cherny","You obviously had a very strong year going into your base in terms of incremental new bookings, as evidenced by the results you've generated. As you think about 2015 and think about priorities for pursuing new business, obviously, Zane, I heard you guys talk about incredibly strong pipeline.","How much do you think about that in segment, the opportunities in the pipeline, at least qualitatively, in terms of going into the existing base of your own customers, first going to the existing base now of the Siemens customers that you have on, where I would assume there is a pretty nice, very hopefully early to achieve incremental upsell opportunity versus the replacement market, which seems to continue to be shaping at least in a nice way in your direction?","Marc Naughton","I think the overall market as we look for '15, again, I think you segmented it pretty well, Michael, our space kind of the HS base and then the new opportunities. Zane has spent a lot of time working on our new opportunities. Zane do you want to?","Zane Burke","It will be the new business space, particularly the large regional player is very active in the marketplace. And I think you would see, we do some segmentation to match up with the buyers. If you think about our CommunityWorks offering on the smaller end, the regional community hospital marketplace, the IDN segment, and then the investor owned segment.","There is further segmentation down that and then there is also our outside the U.S. organizations, which each country reflects a different marketplace, as we look at those. And so we attack those in different ways. And frankly, across the board, we see good opportunities across all segments of both new business as well as our installed base, and that's across the U.S. and outside the U.S.","Marc Naughton","Zane, this is Marc. How about the Siemens client, you've had a chance to.","Zane Burke","In fact, I've had to spent a fair amount of time with a number of clients, and clients are very receptive and excited that Cerner has stepped in to acquire our services. And I think there is many that are looking for a strong path moving forward with Cerner, and whether that's on Soarian platform or whether that's perhaps on a Millennium platform. And each client's journey is different, but I've been very pleased with how the clients have responded to date.","Michael Cherny","And just one clarification. I heard the one ITWorks deal in the quarter, I assume there were no RevWorks since they weren't mentioned. Any other kind of really, really sizable deals that were into that bookings number?","Zane Burke","There were no large RevWorks deals of any kind. We did have a number of business, some small business office services deals and some smaller RevWorks offerings, but no full scale revenue cycle management and no other significant large long-term booking.","Marc Naughton","That's kind of one of the reasons that the bookings were at the lower end of the guidance range. I think as we look for '15, we do see some, particularly the ITWorks side of the business, looking that it could get on kind of the 1.25 type of a run rate for the year that we've been talking about. So we kind of do see a little bit of an uptick in that, as we look at our pipeline.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of George Hill with Deutsche Bank.","George Hill","I guess, Zane or Marc, first I'd start with you guys. If I look at kind of the composition of the bookings in the quarter, the very strong booking guidance for Q1, and the rev pull-through. I guess, Zane, can you provide any color around did any kind of long-term deals, long-term bookings, slip from Q4 to Q1 that you kind of have visibility to in Q1? And if not, I guess, can you just talk about what was generally happening with the longer-term bookings environment in the quarter?","Zane Burke","Look I'd say, there is a lot more opportunity in 2015 than what we saw in 2014 in total, particularly on the new business side, but we see a number of opportunities, as Mike pointed out in his comments, around ITWorks side. We'll continue to be judicious about how we engage in the rev cycle space.","And so I think you're going to see a little -- it's not unnatural to see some lumpiness in terms of how those longer-term bookings will pull through and have an impact on those numbers. So I don't think there is any trend per se in that space other than we feel very good about the ITWorks activity and the pipeline, and how that maybe impacting the bookings outlook as we move forward.","George Hill","And then, Marc, maybe a quick follow-up, just with respect to the Q1 bookings and the Q1 revenue guidance. Is there any chance you'll give us some color on which portion of that we should think of as legacy Cerner and which portion we should think of as the SMS contribution?","Marc Naughton","Really as we've given the fact that Q1 is going to have maybe a partial impact of Cerner health services and after going through a forecast meeting there, which actually I have to put a little bit color, that was really impressive that both their teams and our teams were able to have a pretty descent forecast format and a dive onto their opportunities.","They are not going to have much contribution to bookings in their first quarter. I mean, they're kind of waiting for the close. Clients are certainly looking to see what the next step is and those conversations are ongoing. But most of the activity that you're going to see driven by in Q1 from a bookings perspective, will be coming almost entirely from Cerner.","I think as you look at the revenue side, topline side, you kind of can look at health services providing us between $95 million and $100 million a month on the revenue topline. So I think that's pretty good estimate. That's kind of the number we've talked about. And I think that's one that our most recent work would continue to confirm.","So I think from that perspective, you'll get a good view of the company. For those of you that are looking to kind of give a little bit of a historical view, at least kind of a prior year under Siemens, their 930 financial statements under GAAP will be issued some time in the next 60 days, as one of our filings and it will breakout health services. So you get a little bit of view.","I would just indicate that when you look at those numbers, topline will look about right. I think on the earnings line, they had some one-time things, as they put together their GAAP statements and operations that moved up their earnings a little bit more than you'd expect. Basically you exclude those and their earnings would have been breakeven, which is kind of what we talked about. So that's a little kind of the color I can provide right now as far as what their impact on Q1 is going to be.","And obviously, ones we get them in our income statement format and have a little bit better view, well certainly I think probably be looking to update our trend file and do different things in that space. As we combine the companies, there is things like backlog that we just have different approaches on certain elements and trying to parse them out between contract and support may not make sense going forward, we may have to go to a single backlog number, but our goal always is to be transparent and provide you guys what you need to make your decisions.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Steve Halper with FBR.","Steve Halper","Just going back to the cash flow comments that you forecasted or made. Could you provide a little bit more color, I mean, Marc, just because we're not really familiar with the levels of capital requirements at Siemens or what you're planning on doing on R&D basis? Are you looking at flat free cash flow in 2015?","Marc Naughton","When you're looking at 2015, right now my best estimate is that we'd expect it to be right around $400 million, so basically flat to this year. The primary driver of that is going to be more CapEx. The CapEx required for health services isn't significant. There is some things we want to invest in","Clearly, just their offices and making sure that they've got what they need, a little bit relative to their data center, getting that up to speed relative to our standard and be able to utilize some of that space. But I think overall even with those additions and even with spending more money on our campus than we certainly did last year, we should still be able to fund all of that and still drive out right around $400 million of free cash flow.","Steve Halper","And would you expect that number to -- your level of CapEx, does that stay elevated for a number of years or is '15 a little bit of a increase because of the campus build-out?","Marc Naughton","The campus build out is going to be the key for '15 and '16, so that will impact those years. Once we get the first phase of that campus done, we'll likely be able to take a little bit of a pause, once again depending on our growth, because the key for us is, we're a growth company and we got have places to go, put our people and make them productive. But I think right now that's kind of looking like '15 and '16 impact with '17 probably being a relief from some of those bad spend.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Bob Jones with Goldman Sachs.","Bob Jones","Marc, I actually wanted to ask one on operating margins. I know the target coming into 4Q, I think was for more than 50 basis points of expansion. You obviously didn't see that. Margins were actually down. And then also for the year, I think you came in below the annual target as well.","I understand you guys are talking about the holiday week being unproductive, but I would imagine some of that is more of an annual issue. So I guess as you think about the margin progression you saw in '14, and in the quarter, for that matter, could you maybe just talk a little bit about kind of what went off target as far as the things you thought you had control of?","Marc Naughton","Well, I think the key talking about the holiday week is not so much that it's a holiday, because, yes, Christmas comes every year, which my kids think it does, and they're right. And the fact that we do a 52-53 week year, so this year was 14 week quarter, which included that extra week, which had the normal spend, all the spend, but didn't have as much topline impact.","I think we've always looked at the company as we should have a goal of driving out 100 bps per year growth in our operating margins. And that growth is going to kind of go up and down on an annual basis, but if you look back to 2010, I mean in the last four years, we probably averaged right at a 100 basis points a year of growth.","I think the key really for operating margins at this point is looking at '15, because when we add in the health services revenues, and then much lower margins from those revenues, you're going to see a significant impact on our operating margins. So I said in my comments, we'd expect those to be down kind of in the low-20s from current 25-potentially-plus-percent levels.","The good news is that as the accretion starts driving out as we go into the out years, that quickly gets back to current levels and begins to be able to go up at our 100 basis points a year expected growth rate. So 2014 strong, in Q4 particularly, really the margin impact was as much driven by a strong hardware quarter and device resale quarter as anything, but I think it doesn't change our view of the business and the opportunities we have to get more efficiencies out. And clearly as we add health services, we, a bigger company, we should have more opportunities for those efficiencies.","Bob Jones","And then I guess, maybe Zane, just one on the new business side. I mean nice win with Meridian Health, particularly given that it is outside of your EMR base. Any sense you can give us on what the bookings or annual revenue contribution is for a strategic deal like this? And maybe more broadly, anything on the pipeline around similar deals that are focused around Healthe Intent?","Zane Burke","As we mentioned that the population health is about $415 million in revenue. And still we had the good growth and we're anticipating continued good growth in that space. So they can kind of use that as a marker for how you can anticipate our population health business to grow in some of those kinds of schematics, but I can't speak about the individual deal economics.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of David Windley with Jefferies.","David Windley","So as you think about the Siemens side of your bookings for the full year, I know, Marc, you already said, first quarter won't be much of a contribution. As you think about the full year, can you help us to understand maybe which of the major buckets you expect to see the most traction in the early going? Is it selling Millennium into the base? Is it population health leading? Zane, as you kind of talked about going to market population health first and following with EHR, or is it even managed services? Can you help us to understand where that traction will come early?","Zane Burke","I think you'll see traction. I think managed services will continue to be a strong element for -- that's kind of an existing business for them and one that will continue. We offer some additional services in that space. So remember our first objective is to make sure that we keep that client-base satisfied and moving forward.","I think you will see a number of clients that may think about moving to a Millennium platform and so there maybe some benefits in that. And so that will be reflective in our guidance as well. But it's a blend of the managed services, which is what they've continued to do, some add-on solutions. We'll continue to sell Soarian Financials in a patient accounting on a standalone basis.","There was a marketplace for standalone patient accounting, particularly, given one of our competitors has announced the sunsetting of some of their applications in the larger space. So I think you will see a number of different buckets that that falls in. Those are all kind of reflective in the bookings guidance that we provided.","David Windley","And then, Marc, to your point on margin going down first, and then working its way back up over time, are there, say, significant buckets of expense that you could identify to us that will come out of the Siemens side that will be the contributors to that synergy and margin accretion over the next couple of years? And are those things tied to the pace at which, say old Siemens base converts over to new Cerner footprint base?","Marc Naughton","Yes, relative to, I mean, the synergies are certainly important. I think efficiencies come from just a combination of our two organizations. I don't know, I mean we've liked the health services associates. We think they are talented. They are experienced. There were valuable assets. So we're pleased to keep to work with them and to build their momentum certainly within that client-base and our shared-client base.","So I think a lot of the synergies are just, they're efficiencies relative to being a organization under a large corporate parent that has a certain method of operating, that is somewhat more bureaucratic than perhaps Cerner Corporation is. There are things that we just see from how you operate and certainly there are elements of staffing that we can repurpose people to be focused on revenue producing activities rather than administrative type activities.","So we think there are opportunities to go drive that out and given the targets we set, get into a $175 million of OE kind of coming from these assets by 2017, we think those are eminently attainable. And if we just keep executing, keep driving our business, and getting with their client-base and driving them forward, that we should be able to deliver that without a great deal of effort.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.","Gavin Weiss","This is actually Gavin Weiss in for Lisa. Zane, I wanted to touch on your comments on the ambulatory space. I think you said, you had 11 displacements, including three of the largest clients from one competitor. I just wanted to get some color on the drivers of those displacements. Is it dissatisfaction with the products or are the providers now affiliated with a core Cerner institution?","Zane Burke","These are long standing clients of Cerner's from an acute key perspective, and I would say it's kind of a combination of factors. One, our ambulatory solution is incredibly good. And the investments that we've made in the R&D and the improvements that have been made on the ambulatory side, our clients have seen. And as they move towards further clinical integration and wanted to create more system-ness, if you will, they're looking for an integrated acute, an ambulatory solution as they move forward.","And I think you will also look at that organization, and say that that competitor was also not providing the kind of value that those clients were looking for. So it's kind of combination of factors that comes together, but incredibly good wins for us this year and representative of a trend that we think we'll continue to see.","Gavin Weiss","And then, Marc, I think I heard you that you said the addition of the new debt will not impact earnings, so can you just give us more color about how should we think about the interest expense, interest income for '15?","Marc Naughton","No, it will impact earnings, but as you've likely noted, our guidance has basically remained the same, since we talked about at the end of Q3. So we'll just cover that interest expense within our existing guidance.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of David Larsen with Leerink.","DavidLarsen","Zane, you made an interesting comment about 2015. And I think you indicated that the pipeline and the activity for '15 was actually greater than 2014. Can you just give any more color around that? Are you talking about hospitals, large hospitals, community hospitals, just any more color would be great?","ZaneBurke","I am speaking about hospitals primarily, so in the hospital marketplace and it's across many segments. And as we've talked about for a while, this is a replacement market, a replacement market that's preparing for changes in their business models, that's preparing for changes in being a true systems and just not seeing the value from their existing suppliers that they need on a going forward basis. And it's much stronger than it was in 2014 and we see the level of activity significantly up.","DavidLarsen","And then would you say a good portion of that is coming from Siemens? And then would there be maybe one or two other vendors like may, I don't know, Horizon or MEDITECH that you'd highlight or is it really maybe 10% Siemens? Just any more details will be great.","Marc Naughton","Sure. So obviously, one of those you mentioned has announced some sunsetting of solutions, and that's creating a part of that, which actually, I would say, is additive to even the level of activity that we've seen. The Siemens activity is actually additive to the volume that we were seeing early on. So we are already seeing increased levels of activity for '15. And some of these other events, including some of that we've created through our own acquisition is driving even more demand for our solutions. So it is all those factors out there, but the activity level is just higher than it was in '14 by orders of magnitude.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Sean Wieland with Piper Jaffray.","Sean Wieland","If you could break down for us, if I am a Millennium customer, what's on my shopping list that I really have to buy to be ready for Medicare's shift to fee-for-value? Put another way, what are some of the specific capabilities that you are bringing to the table there that you think are unique to you?","Zane Burke","Sean, there's is a couple of things, which you would first to think about. We have, what it we call our Lighthouse offerings, which are truly around how do you provide the best quality care at a lower cost. And so we are able to actually put content and process through our software and solutions to help drive better outcomes both from a patient perspective and a financial perspective.","So the first thing you want to do is go future-proof yourself around some of those quality metrics and prepare for that. As you take more risk, our population health offerings will be the next set of things that you'll want to have and you have to have in this marketplace.","You will need the access to data, so you're going to have to be able to think about your data in different ways and he who has the data wins in the future game and following that data is going to be really incredibly important. So having a open interoperable solution is a very important element.","So you're going to need an EMR that's capable of actually accepting different solutions, getting it back into the clinician's workflow. Its actually, you're going to need all of Cerner to be successful moving forward and the things that we have built and the things that we will build continue to add value. So it's a very exciting time.","More risk that's borne, obviously, has impact on our clients, but we view that as very positive from an IT perspective and the need to understand the data, know the data, and to impact at the point of care is going to be more important, so you really think about all those components as part of that future proof.","Sean Wieland","How about specifically some of the stuff you're doing with iCentra and Intermountain Healthcare, or should I wait for HIMSS for that?","Zane Burke","Well, we'll give you guys an update around HIMSS for that, but we're very pleased with the progress that's been made at Intermountain. We anticipate going live here in the first quarter. And so I think you'll get an opportunity to speak with both our client and Jeff as it relates to what's happening at Intermountain. And we believe that represents another turn of the crank on EHR that will be ready for the future, so there are number of things that we're pretty excited about.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Mohan Naidu with Stephens.","Mohan Naidu","My questions, Marc, maybe on the bookings, so you noted about the long-term contracts. What do you construe as long-term contracts, I am presuming ITWorks, RevWorks. What else?","Marc Naughton","Usually anything that's got a duration that's going to be five-plus years, so ITWorks tend to be seven to 10 years, RevWorks are similar to that, so that's how we would manage services or hosting agreement all of those. And keep in mind, when we sign a brand new client, and they buy software and services and implementation, many of those also buy managed services or hosting services. So that contract, a component of it will be a long-term booking and the rest of will be just kind of normal.","Mohan Naidu","And one follow-up question on the Siemens contribution. You noted $95 million to $100 million per month. Is it fair to say that the majority of that is going to be support and maintenance revenue?","Marc Naughton","The majority of it will be in backlog for health services that will come into the income statement. The classification of it will vary, but it is flowing from long-term contracts that will have a variety of components to the revenue, but it's basically kind of a single bucket of dollars that would be parsed out in different places, but it's coming out of primarily the backlog.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette of UBS.","Steven Valiquette","So one of your smaller hospital EHR competitors reported some soft earnings about a week or two ago, and it talked about this meaningful use attestation period for FY '15 being increased from 90 days to 365 days starting back in October of last year. However, that may have caught some hospitals unprepared to start a year-long attestation and may have led to push out of some purchase related to stage two. So I guess I am just curious if you think that this CMS timing situation maybe had any impact on your bookings in the just-reported 4Q '14. And also, could that impact the current 1Q '15 as well?","Zane Burke","I don't see, we've been talking about this for a while, but meaningful use has not been part of our bookings elements and our clients have been passed that dialogue for quite some time as it relates to impact on our bookings or revenues. And we've been in a different marketplace around the replacement side of that, so I don't anticipate that that had any future impact and I don't think it had any impact on the previous quarter either.","Marc Naughton","Even the new business opportunities outside our client base are people that probably cobbled together something to meet stage two.","Zane Burke","I will actually say, substantially all of them have strategies for meaningful use. They are looking at the increased level of activity is not a meaningful use conversation. It is about how do I create a platform for the future by which I can think about either remaining a viable standalone organization or creating a scale to be a bigger larger organization or preparing for changes in payment models, aligning across the continuum of care, all of which plays into Cerner's strength.","Steven Valiquette","So were you surprised to hear this peer talk about this, or is this peer just kind of so small in the grand scheme of things it wasn't really something that you guys were really focused on one way or the other?","Marc Naughton","Their view differs from ours.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Jamie Stockton with Wells Fargo.","Jamie Stockton","Just a couple of quick ones. Marc, on the Siemens business, can you give us some feel for what bookings were in 2014 or what the book-to-bill was, or anything that we can go by as we think about how 2015 is likely to play out?","Marc Naughton","Jamie, I don't know that really historically it's going to have a lot of value. Some of their activity has been extending contracts, so adding years to existing relationships, which is great, when we come in, because there is a lot of long-term agreements that are in place.","If you looked at any particular period where they had a bunch of those, you would come up with a big bookings number. And so I don't that that's going to be that helpful. I think as you look going forward, are they going to have the same book-to-bill level we will? No, I don't expect that.","At this point, I don't know that I could, given that in Q1, which is the bookings number we can really talk about. It's going to be so low that it's not really worth doing the math to figure out their book-to-bill. We should be able to give you a better sense of what their bookings level is going to be as we go forward, and get a better sense of kind of what we think on a quarterly basis they'll be able to do, but is it 1 to 1, is it 0.5 to 1, I cant' tell you today what that is, but I can tell you it's going to be lower than ours.","Jamie Stockton","And then, Zane, maybe real quick, you mentioned that there were some niche health guys that were already at risk of being replaced in, I assume some of your core clients. Can you talk about in the pop health space how important is it for a vendor to be able to provide both the technologies that health needs and maybe also services around that technology, care management or whatever? Is that something that is differentiating some companies from others in kind of the pop health space and how do you think that will play out?","Zane Burke","It's good question, Jamie. I'll speak first to kind of what I think has happened in the replacement activity. I think the replacement activity has been driven by people that earlier on they had something that sounded like it was pop health related, and our clients and their industry was needing anything and grasping it, at some of those niche providers that had something of some value, but at the end of the day it's not a comprehensive platform for managing population health.","And I think what the future is, is a true platform-based population health strategy. And I've talked before about kind of 1.0 buyers in the space versus 2.0 buyers. And what I mean by that, people that have actually been assumed taking risk see the need for a system-based approach, that's an enterprise-wide based approach that thinks across the continuum side of this.","As it relates to integrated services, I think there are some compelling offerings and I think you'll see additional solutions and services for companies that do provide both technology and service moving forward. And I think you'll continue to see business models evolve as we get further into the population health role, and the more risk that our clients take on. I do think there were some opportunity for that side.","End of Q&A","Marc Naughton","We're kind of over our limit on time. So I just want to thank everybody for being on the call. We're very pleased with the strong 2014 that we had and we really like the outlook for 2015. We really look forward to welcoming our health services brethren and going to do great things together. Have a good day.","Operator","Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day."],"4834":["Cerner (NASDAQ:CERN) Q1 2012 Earnings Call April 26, 2012  4:30 PM ET","Executives","Marc G.

Today's date is April 26, 2012, and this call is being recorded. The company has asked me to remind you that various remarks made here today by Cerner's management about future expectations, plans, prospectives and prospects constitute forward-looking statements for the purpose of the Safe Harbor Provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements.

At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Marc Naughton, Chief Financial Officer of Cerner Corporation. Please proceed, sir.","Marc G. Naughton","Thank you, Anne. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the call. I'll lead off today with a review of the numbers. Zane Burke, Executive Vice President of our Client Organization will follow me with sales highlights and marketplace trends. Mike Neal, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer will discuss operations. Mike will be followed by Jeff Townsend, Executive Vice President and Chief of Staff, who will discuss strategic initiatives. Neal Patterson, our Chairman, CEO and President will be available during Q&A.","Now I'll return to the results. We delivered strong results in the first quarter with all key metrics above our expected levels. Bookings exceeded the high end of our guidance range. Our income statement performance was excellent, with revenue and adjusted EPS well above expected levels and continued margin expansion and strong earnings growth. We also had very strong cash flow performance.","Moving to the details. Our total bookings revenue in Q1 was $652 million, which is a record for a first quarter. Bookings exceeded the high-end of our guidance range by more than $50 million and were up 24% from Q1 of 2011. Bookings margin in Q1 was $529 million or 81% of total bookings. As Zane will discuss, the strength of bookings in Q1 spanned across all business models and included a new ITWorks contract. Our bookings performance drove a 22% increase in total backlog to $6.27 billion. Contract revenue backlog of $5.57 billion is 25% higher than a year ago. Support revenue backlog totaled $704 million, up 6% year-over-year. Revenue in the quarter was $641.2 million, which is up 30% over Q1 of '11. The revenue composition for Q1 was $226 million in system sales, $146 million in support and maintenance, and $258 million in services, and $11 million in reimbursed travel. The upside relative to our guidance was largely driven by higher system sales, but service revenues was also very strong.","System sales revenue reflects 61% growth from Q1 of '11. This was driven by strong growth in software and subscriptions and especially strong growth in device resale and traditional hardware resale. Services revenue was up 23% compared to Q1 '11, with strong growth in both managed services and professional services. Support and maintenance revenue increased 11% over Q1 of '11. ","Looking at revenue by geographic segment. Domestic revenue increased 32% year-over-year to $554 million, and global revenue was $87 million and grew 23% compared to the year-ago period. ","Moving to gross margin. Our gross margin for Q1 was 75.4%, which is down from 78.6% in Q4 and 81.6% in Q1 of '11. The decline in our gross margin percentage was driven by the very strong levels of device and hardware resale that I discussed, which impacted the mix of system sales. While the gross margin percentage for the quarter was lower, total dollars of gross margin grew 21% from the year ago period and total margin from system sales grew 32%, driven by the strong growth in software and subscriptions. ","As we've noted in the past, while revenue mix can impact our gross margin percentage in any given period, we continue to drive operating margin expansion and strong earnings growth, as I'll discuss in a minute. ","Looking at operating spending, our first quarter operating expenses were $346.8 million before share-based compensation expense of $8.9 million. This is an increase of 16% compared to Q1 of '11. Sales and client service expenses increased 22% compared to Q1 of '11, driven by an increase in revenue generating associates in our services business. Our investment in software development was flat compared to the year ago period. We've been hiring in our R&D organization this year and expect our R&D investments to grow throughout the rest of 2012, but the growth will still be moderate compared to expected revenue growth.","G&A expense increased 12% compared to Q1 of '11, driven by personnel and other expenses related to an increase in hiring and training. ","Moving to operating margins. Our operating margin in Q1 was 21.3% before share-based compensation expense and was up 70 basis points compared to Q1 of '11. Given the much higher mix of lower margin technical -- technology resale for this quarter, I am pleased with this level of margin expansion. Going forward, we expect the mix to normalize somewhat, which will allow us to deliver margin expansion in our 100- to 200-basis point target range for the year. ","Moving to earnings and EPS. Our GAAP net earnings in Q1 were $88.7 million or $0.51 per diluted share. GAAP net earnings include share-based compensation expense, which had a net impact on earnings of $5.5 million or $0.03 per share. Adjusted net earnings were $94.2 million, and adjusted EPS was $0.54, which is up 35% compared to Q1 of '11. The tax rate for adjusted net earnings was 32.2%, which is lower than normal due primarily to a favorable tax settlement we previewed last quarter. Note that normalizing to a 35% tax rate, which in the range we would've expected for Q1 without the settlement, would reduce adjusted earnings per share by $0.02. For the balance of the year, we expect our effective tax rate to be between 35% and 36%.","Now move to our balance sheet. We ended Q1 with $1.27 billion of total cash and investments, up from $1.13 billion in Q4. Total cash and investments include $894 million of cash and short-term investments and $375 million of highly rated corporate and government bonds with maturities over one year. Our total debt, including capital lease obligations, is $153 million. Total receivables ended the quarter at $536 million, which is down $27 million from Q4. Contracts receivable or the unbooked billed portion of receivables were $85 million and represents 16% of total receivables. Cash collections were a record at $683 million. Our DSO in Q1 was 76 days, which is down from 83 days in Q4 and 87 days in Q1 of '11. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $162.7 million. Q1 capital expenditures were $26.4 million and capitalized software was $23.1 million. Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures and capitalized software, was $113.3 million. We expect an increase in capital expenditures for the rest of the year. Some of this will be driven by the construction of additional space at our new Kansas City campus as needed for our growing associate base. Those costs will span multiple years and we'll also be receiving incentives that will offset a portion of the construction cost.","Moving to capitalized software, the $23.1 million of capitalized software in Q1 represents 31% of the $74.8 million of total investment in development activity. Software amortization for the quarter was $19.4 million, resulting in net capitalization of $3.7 million or 5% of our total R&D investment. For the rest of the year, we expect quarterly capitalized software of $23 million to $26 million and amortization of $20 million to $23 million per quarter. ","Now I'll go through Q2 and full year guidance. For Q2, we expect revenue between $620 million and $640 million, with the midpoint reflecting growth of 20% over Q2 of '11. For the full year, we expect revenue between $2.525 billion and $2.6 billion, with the midpoint reflecting 16% growth. This is up from our previous range of $2.425 billion to $2.5 billion. We expect Q2 adjusted EPS before share-based compensation expense to be $0.52 to $0.54 per share, with the midpoint reflecting 20% growth over Q2 of '11. For the full year, we expect adjusted EPS between $2.25 and $2.32, with the midpoint reflecting 22% growth. This is up from our previous range of $2.20 to $2.30. Q2 guidance is based on total spending before share-based competition expense of approximately $350 million to $355 million. Our estimate for the impact of share-based compensation expense is $0.03 in Q2 and $0.12 to $0.14 for the full year.","Moving to bookings guidance. We expect bookings revenue in Q2 of $675 million to $715 million, with the high end of this range reflecting double-digit growth over our strong results in Q2 of '11 when bookings grew 39%. ","In closing, we are pleased with our strong results in Q1, with all key metrics above our expected ranges, including strong bookings, revenue, earnings and cash flow and strong margin expansion. With that, let me turn the call over to Zane.","Zane M. Burke","Thanks, Marc. Good afternoon, everyone. Today I'm going to provide sales highlights and discuss marketplace trends, starting with our results. Our bookings revenue in Q1 of $652 million reflects 24% growth over last year, as all-time high for our first quarter. We had strong contributions from both inside our installed base and from key competitive wins outside of our base. While our ITWorks contracts and record levels of technology resale clearly contributed to our booking strength, there was also strength across all other business models. This broad strength is reflected in our large deal account, with 23 contracts over $5 million, including 13 over $10 million, both of which are record levels for our first quarter. ","Regarding the record technology results. These were driven by yet another record level of device resale and an unusually strong quarter in traditional hardware resell. The hardware resell strength was primarily driven by 2 large deals, so we would expect hardware to return to normal levels, but we do expect ongoing strength in device resale. The demand to use Cerner as a single source for connected devices remains robust, and we continue to expand our relationships with existing device manufacturers and add new ones as they recognize the value of our device connectivity platform and the strategic relationships we have with our clients. A recently announced example of the value we provide in this space is the use of our iBus device connectivity platform to integrate infusion pumps and Cerner's EMR at Oklahoma Heart Hospital. This new offering helps hospitals improve patient safety and reduce medication and administration errors while also reducing the number of manual steps required to program an infusion order in as many as 16 down to 2 or 3. ","Another recent announcement that highlights this strategic value of the relationships we have with our clients is our partnership with Advocate Health Care, a long-standing Cerner client that is widely recognized as a leader in population health management. As Jeff will discuss, this partnership will allow us to significantly advance our population health initiative. It will also increase our competitive differentiation and allow us to help our clients have a meaningful positive impact on the health of the communities they serve.","Now I\u2019ll move to the position market, where we continue to strong results in Q1. We had an all-time high level of ambulatory bookings in Q1 that included 2 large IDN selecting Cerner to replace their existing ambulatory supplier. The enhancements we have made to our solutions and the marketplaces' desire to have an integrated solution across inpatient and outpatient venues is starting to be reflected in our results. We believe this trend will continue as we have several more large clients that chose best-of-breed ambulatory providers in the last 3 to 5 years that are now coming back to the market for an integrated solution. ","Additionally, significant greenfield still exists in a smaller end of the physician practice market, and we are well-positioned for this opportunity. Our competitive position in both replacement and greenfield opportunities will only get stronger as we roll out Millennium+ and PowerChart plus Touch which Mike will discuss. The strength of our ambulatory solutions is also translating into even stronger competitive position in the inpatient market. In Q1, we had several competitive wins including several end processes that included our primary competitor. In total, 25% of our bookings came from outside of our core install base and we believe we will continue to gain share in the coming years. We see a growing number of hospitals reconsidering their supplier as they face the rising bar for a Stage 2 and Stage 3 of Meaningful Use and additional requirements for Value-Based Purchasing, ACOs and data analytics capabilities. Several of our competitors continue to be vulnerable due to challenges with transitioning to new platforms and uncertainty around their ability to keep up with future requirements. As a result, we believe we are still in the early stages of a multiyear market share shift. Cerner's ability to help future proved healthcare providers in this environment have increasing complexity positions us very well to be the beneficiary of this shift. ","As I have indicated, there is really only one competitor that presents a consistent challenge in these replacement opportunities and our competitiveness against them continues to improve. By significantly improving the physician experience, we are neutralizing the primary area they have used to compete. This allows us to change the conversation to the importance of a modern platform and our investments in interoperability, data analytics, and our Millennium+ and Healthe Intent platforms. These investments provide a meaningful differentiator against a company that has a platform that makes interoperability and data analytics challenging, if not impossible. We also believe that ultimately we'll need to do major upgrades in coming years to catch up in these areas and these upgrades are likely to be very difficult and expensive for clients. We see evidence of this by looking at challenges faced by another vendor that is currently trying to upgrade from a similar mumps based platform. My belief that we are incredibly well-positioned in this marketplace was reinforced at HIMMS. our launch of Millennium+ and PowerChart plus Touch was extremely well perceived, and I was very pleased with the level of excitement in our existing clients and the high volume of interest expressed by perspective clients. ","Moving to our global result. As Marc mentioned, we had strong results outside the U.S. as well with 23% revenue growth. We continue to see some improvement in many global markets and had strong results in Canada, Australia, England and the Middle East. In Australia, we have had strong results the past 3 quarters, including bookings related to our long-standing presence in New South Wales and Victoria in Q1, as well as an initial booking from a significant relationship with Queensland Health in the past 2 quarters of 2011. We are also seeing more interest in our hosting capabilities outside of the U.S. and this quarter include hosting agreements in Australia and England. We believe the opportunity for remote hosting outside of the U.S. remains very strong. ","Operationally, our success outside the U.S. is reflected in Cerner being the first hospital in France awarded HIMMS Level 6 status. We also expect announcements soon regarding a Cerner client being the first HIMMS Level 7 hospital in Spain and another being the first HIMMS Level 6 hospital in the Middle East. ","In summary, I'm very pleased with our record results in Q1, and I think we are well-positioned for a strong 2012 and beyond. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike.","Michael R. Nill","Thanks, Zane. Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'm going to discuss ITWorks, revenue cycle and provide an update on imperatives I discussed last quarter. I'll start with ITWorks, where we got off to a good start this year by adding a new client in the first quarter. This brings our total to 10 ITWorks clients. This 750-bed hospital has been a Cerner client for more than a decade and has already implemented a broad suite of service solutions and attested for Stage 1 Meaningful Use. Debut ITWorks is the best way to continue their Meaningful Use journey and as a way to align with Cerner and further advance their organization strategically. The pipeline for ITWorks remains very strong, and I expect us to have a very strong year in 2012. I believe the recent tipping point with ITWorks were the success of our initial client, hopefully at a clear value proposition for prospective clients and makes future sales much easier.","Moving to revenue cycle. While we didn't sign a new acute-care RevWorks deal in Q1, we did add additional ambulatory business process outsourcing clients. We also had a strong quarter in our overall revenue cycle business with 6 new footprints and strong levels of bookings for patient accounting, access management and care management. We are building a good foundation in our install base and increasing penetration of these core revenue cycle solutions. Overall, the interest in our revenue cycle offerings continues to increase. I believe this is the result of hard work that we have done in recent years to improve our solutions and services. In addition, I think the desire to have an integrated solution is increasing as the industry begins to shift from a -- shift to a value and quality based model that will require tighter integration between clinical and revenue cycle systems, which is a trend that clearly will benefit Cerner. ","Before handing the call over to Jeff, I want to provide a brief update on the 2012 imperatives I shared with you on the last call and at our Investor Day. These imperatives are: Drive Meaningful Use adoption; dramatically improve physician experience; empowering population health management. Regarding Meaningful Use, we're clearly on a good path and continue to expect about 85% of our clients to have attested for Stage 1 by the end of the year. This weight of activity will lead to our entire client base being on the current version of our software, which is a big undertaking, but also has a big positive from an ongoing support standpoint. As I mentioned last quarter, Meaningful Use is driving physician adoption at unprecedented levels. This process of change can be difficult for physicians who have little time to experiment with and to adapt to new methods of doing work. As a result, we are putting physician productivity and the overall physician experience front and center. The key element of this effort, which many of you saw at HIMMS, was PowerChart Touch, a native iPad app that is the first of a new-generation of physician applications. Our fast, easy, smart mantra reflects our focus on providing an extremely fast solutions that are easy to use and intuitively smart and contextually aware of the physician's specialty, venue and patient's condition. PowerChart Touch is enabled by the next generation of our Millennium architecture called Millennium+, which we also announced at HIMMS. Millennium+, combined with the enterprise platform with a secure Cerner cloud makes it possible to merge our relevant and available clinical, financial and operational information, which enables the physician to be much more productive. ","As Jeff will discuss, Millennium+ is also an important component of our population health strategy as it enables broader interoperability across all EHRs and allows connectivity to our Healthe Intent population health management platform. ","In closing, I believe we are off to a good start in 2012 and well on our way to delivering our imperatives and further strengthening our leadership position in the marketplace. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeffrey A. Townsend","Thanks, Mike. Today I'm going to provide some more background and context on how Millennium+ fits in the evolution of our platform. As the industry has accelerated the adoption of EMRs, the concept of a paperless system is becoming a milestone on the journey versus an endgame. As we have discussed on past calls, there are second-order of facts that are just starting to surface that will challenge how we think about clinical computing. As the healthcare industry plays catch-up to other digital industries, it is also evolving as a system in search of solutions to coordinate care across venues and organizations and to managed populations for both health and care. Today, the EMR is optimized for the enterprise, and the new target is now evolving beyond the boundaries of a single provider organization. For those of you familiar with the original Ran study around digitizing the healthcare industry, 50% of the benefits were associated with coordination of care. The pivot point for this transformation is pointed at the physician, who is expected to consume more clinical information, merging evidence, dynamic reimbursement policies and increased efficiency all at the same time. Over the last few years, Cerner has continued to innovate around the EMR solutions such as CareAware that facilitates medical device interoperability. At the same time, we've been actively deploying solutions through Cerner's cloud services. Our next generation of this progression comes with Millennium+, which leverages the knowledge that exists in Cerner Millennium and combines it with the agility of cloud computing. While Cerner has been deploying cloud solutions for more than a decade, the significance of Millennium+ is that the solutions are now designed with those services in mind from the beginning. This isn't just the change in end user experience or devices. This is also a shift in the distribution channel for innovation all the way to the end user. Nearly everyone these days carries a device that allows you to download apps, whether it be for tracking weather, playing games, checking e-mail or viewing your friend's photos with a quick swipe of a finger. Now Cerner is extending the same experience to healthcare with a quick and easy access on the iPad. We understand this is a pretty dramatic change from the approach of today, and this is a more complicated computing environment than Angry Birds. But we're also betting that more recent cycles of mandates, measures and regulatory requirements is only going to continue to accelerate as the industry is digitized and the platform, to stay current, has to accelerate along with it. In addition to providing the next generation of user experiences, connectivity beyond the enterprise creates the potential to accelerate our population health and data analytics initiatives. As Mike indicated, Millennium+ enables broader interoperability across all EHRs and connectivity to Cerner's Healthe Intent platform. Last quarter, I discussed how we are building the foundational data for the Healthe Intent platform largely through our chart search offering. We now have over 125 clients engaged and are adding billions of results each week. As Millennium+ becomes broadly deployed, and we have the majority of our clients connected to the cloud, the volume of data on the Healthe Intent platform will accelerate. ","As we outlined in our presentation at HIMMS, the difference between 400 attribute claim data sets versus a 20,000 attribute clinical data set is significant. The challenge the industry faces in aggregation of data into contextual meaning is variability in data collection methods and nomenclatures. We are using supervised machine learning algorithms to map and tag these attributes without significant clinical labor investment. As a byproduct of these metadata mapping techniques, it allows our Millennium+ solutions to become operational out-of-the-box, applying our big data efforts to identify relationship patterns across clinical data sets, it not only supports the creation of predictive algorithms, but also produces more productive workflows to understand the intent of the user. Using new Millennium+ mantra of fast, easy, smart, this is the source of the \"it just knows\" design. As Zane referred earlier, we announced a partnership with Advocate Health Care last week. Advocate is the largest health system in the Midwest and is already viewed as a national leader in clinical integration and population risk expertise. We believe that by combining our capabilities, we can increase the rate at which predictive models and advanced analytic tools are developed. We are initially focused on predicting and reducing incidents such as readmissions and hospital acquired conditions, and we'll expand our efforts to develop models that convert -- predict patient complications from chronic diseases. This alignment with such a  strong client positions us very well to advance our population health platform, which can ultimately be deployed across our client base and have a substantial positive impact on the health of communities they serve. Now I'd like to open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of David Larsen with Leerink Swann.","David Larsen - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Anything in the proposed Stage 2 rule that looks particularly promising from a vendor's perspective?","Zane M. Burke","This is Zane. There's a number of things which we think are very positive in the Stage 2 elements, which is the physician documentation pieces, some of the meds pieces we think there a number of elements that will, as well as the quality and outcomes based metrics which frankly, we're one of the few EMR providers that actually have those solutions in our capability set, and so that gives us some unique opportunities as we look forward. So we do continue to see some good opportunities in that space, both from a new business perspective as well as our install base.","David Larsen - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Okay. Great. And then I don't know if you saw, but Allscripts just preannounced and it showed a pretty significant decline in bookings year-over-year. Any thoughts on Allscripts in the space right now or anything you're seeing in the market for eclipses as relative to eclipses?","Zane M. Burke","Dave, this is Zane again. I think as we've mentioned previously, we see a number of installed bases that are literally up for grabs, and we would put that particular organization in that situation and we've seen that playing out in the marketplace as we've talked about and highlighted in both the calls as well as some of the analyst events that we've had. And so, yes, we do think that presents opportunity for us.","Marc G. Naughton","Yes, Dave, this is Marc. We've continued to say that we think there are basically kind of a duopoly that we're seeing in the marketplace with 2 very strong companies that are going to be successful. These results are consistent with our view of the marketplace. It's consistent with our view of our pipeline of who we are seeing relative to their client base showing up as being in the market for new systems. So the timing is unfortunate for us, because we have a lot of good news to talk about today. We know you guys will be having to split your attention, but it is not something that's surprising to us.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Sebastian Paquette with Goldman Sachs.","Sebastian Paquette - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","First is on implementations, can you just talk to us about after a strong ramping year in 2011 how you continue to hire there? And then for the implementations that or the bake-offs that are becoming a bit more competitive with some of your key competitors, are you seeing any implementation capacity issues with your competitors?","Marc G. Naughton","I think from an implementation standpoint for Cerner, we continue to be ready to start any project as soon as we sign the contract with the client. We've done a good job as you seen from our headcount numbers of on-boarding new people in that area who are very quickly trained, put into our solution center and being basically effectively working on implementations from, very soon after they are hired in. So I think that continues to work well. The good news is that the amount of work we have to do gives them experience very quickly in 12 months, those people are getting to work on 2 or 3 different projects, which would be normally take a much longer period of time. So I think all of that is working well for us. We are using our people, and not relying on third parties for the most part for doing implementations. I can't speak for what other people are doing. There are certainly a lot of consultants in the world that are always willing to kind of come in as a third-party to help do implementations. But, we don't see that as an issue, we certainly see it as a benefit when we are talking about relative to new client is that we will guarantee the implementation and the timing and the cost, and that doesn't seem to be something that is capability for some of the competitor, well basically all of our competitors.","Sebastian Paquette - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","All right. And then maybe could you spend a little bit more time talking about your gross margin profile. And maybe first off, just highlighting some of the mix that is going on, any details you can give us around the actual proportion of tech resale and on the margins around tech resale or device works or some of the larger services contracts and maybe just talk about kind of when you think about the stage of where some of these services contracts are if they're starting out at lower gross margins or the potential ramp-up over time, just because it seems like it's one of the bigger disconnects in the model, even though overall profit margins are increasing, just try to get a better handle on the trajectory for gross margins would be really helpful.","Marc G. Naughton","Sure. It's actually, you threw out a lot of things there, but it's actually a fairly simple explanation. Just to provide a little -- just a context, relative to gross margin, for the most part, all of our services come through as 100% gross margin unless it's provided by a third-party, which is a very, very small amount. So from a gross margin perspective, the services business really doesn't have a significant impact on that from a relative to bringing it down below 100%, because all of that kind of revenue basically almost all of it drops to the gross margin line. The real key that you've seen in Q3, Q4 and now Q1, is us doing much stronger than we would have projected in both the device resale and even on our traditional hardware sale. So those are single-digit margin businesses, but the group of people that is responsible for doing that is basically a relatively small group that doesn't grow a lot, and they are driving more and more revenue, really, for us the key is they're driving more and more margin. So what you saw in Q3, Q4 and especially in this Q1, was significant strength on the device and the hardware sales. So we're $50 million over the top end of our range of guidance, probably $40 million of that is relating to technology resale in some form or fashion. Now that over Tayman [ph]only drove about $3 million to the bottom line because of the low margins that we get on that business. So from a management of the business, we've always talked about \"I'm going to manage to the gross margin line,\" because that's really what I'm looking at. So I love it, I love all that extra hardware we're selling for really not a lot of extra effort, we're leveraging our client base and our relationships to be able to sell into that base, but I think if you look at the math, and at the results, you'll see that, that technology resale is what's kind of brought us down from 81% range down to kind of the mid- to upper-70s. Given that, we're kind of at 75-point something this quarter, I'm thinking that we'll probably get into 77% range at the end of Q3. With Q2 we think there's still likelihood it'd be a little bit higher tech resale, not significantly, but a little higher, nothing like we had in Q1. But at that point you're going to have kind of a normalized history with each of the preceding year ago quarters having a pretty good impact relative to the tech resale and then you'll be able to kind of see us doing more of our normal margin level gross growth at the operating margin level of the 100 to 200 basis points. Does that help clarify?","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of George Hill with Citigroup.","George Hill - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Marc, maybe I missed this in the prepared comments, did you detail what the contribution was to bookings in the quarter from Queensland in the new ITWorks contract?","Marc G. Naughton","The -- relative to Queensland, there was nothing from Queensland in Q1. The Queensland initial bookings came through Q3 and Q4, and they were not part of any of the Q1 bookings. We had some other bookings in that territory, which were beneficial to overall bookings. But Queensland, actually, was a Q -- initial bookings were Q3 and 4, with obviously significant expansion opportunities and we roll forward with that contract.","George Hill - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then I guess just a follow-up and maybe this is a question for Zane or a question for Mike. As you see competitors kind of stumble in the competitive landscape, how should we think about your ability to effectively market around that and take share? And I guess how much of an opportunity does it really create versus how much of it, I'd say is public perception that we worry more about, than customers worry about, and should we see whether it's I'd say whether it's somebody stumbling in the revenue cycle management segment where you guys have the RevWorks business, which is more comprehensive in technology or whether somebody stumbling in the EMR business or whether somebody is stumbling in the patient accounting business? I guess, help us as investors bridge the gap between what is the perception that we see and what is the perception you guys are effectively able to market clients?","Marc G. Naughton","This is Marc, and I'll let Zane follow-up because he's the guys that's actually out on the marketplace. But clearly, if you referenced to put names to some of the suggestions you talked about, it's clearly fairly easy for us to differentiate ourselves from some of those companies that you reflected as, certainly in recent times having stumbled on revenue cycle in our sector. I think the concept of selling around their failures, we expect to create their failures, and we are absolutely doing everything we can to do that. So the fact that we start to see that occurring is very much in line with what we're doing. When you start seeing it from an outside perspective, you're seeing what we've been seeing in our pipeline for the last 6 months. So this is just better opportunity for us. Zane, I'll turn it over to you if you've got some additional comments.","Zane M. Burke","Marc hit it exactly on. I think the key here -- the other point to think about is primarily in the EMR market space, there is a bright line with the Meaningful Use element, and there's a bright line around things like 30-day readmission rate. And your -- the -- our clients' capabilities to get there and their confidence or lack of confidence in our competitors' capabilities to get them to that level. And so that bright line creates a very definitive opportunity by which you can market around pretty effectively and given what we have in our client base to date.","George Hill - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","All right, then just quickly, Zane, I just to boil it down to a simple, what you're telling me is can take these stumbles of these other competitors and turn them into business ones for yourself?","Zane M. Burke","Absolutely, and we're doing it.","George Hill - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And just I know that you guys are getting a lot of questions. I just want to sneak one more in for Marc. Marc, according to my model, this is the first time that you guys, since 2001 that you guys have had bookings up sequentially. I'm sorry, system sales revenue up sequentially in Q1 from Q4. I guess can you talk a little bit more about what drove that? And then I guess whether or not we should think that this is sustainable trend?","Marc G. Naughton","Yes, George. This is Marc. Relative to the Q1, it's clearly very strong hardware and tech resale and device resale. So way beyond what you would've expected. A lot of that seems kind of get closed in last month of the quarter. So it's harder for us to provide visibility on that, because we are tracking margin, which isn't going to make a big difference to a quarter. But that's the main reason. We wouldn't necessarily expect to see a change in the seasonality too much, but when you're an active market like we're seeing right now, you're going to see it on occasion that a sequential quarter, which normally would be impacted by the seasonality kind of come through with more strength than you expected. So it's really related to hardware which goes completely as you know into system sales.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Kipp Davis with Barclays.","Kipp R.F. Davis - Barclays Capital, Research Division","One quick one, I know Mike, you had mentioned at ITWorks you felt like you've reached the tipping point and just kind of wanted to dig in there. How do we think about that, you obviously signed one deal this quarter, I know you guys have sort of said around the deal a quarter, are we at the point where we might start to see that accelerating maybe not in the next quarter but as we look at into late in '12 and '13 where we might see, say a couple a quarter?","Michael R. Nill","Yes. First to comment on the acceleration of business. ITWorks is it's really it's a bundling of many of the services and solutions that we've created over time. So we're starting with, not a brand-new foundation, but some very established businesses like CernerWorks, our AMS upgrade center, et cetera. So when we entered into the market with our first client, it was not a case where we need to go through a maturity cycle, we were able to deliver exceptional performance from day one. And those clients that we've engaged with, they have proven out that they can move forward with their clinical transformation projects 2 to 3x faster at the same or lower cost. We said that initially, and now we have multiple clients that have demonstrated data, proving that we said could happen is actually happening. In terms of the pipeline of business moving forward, it's very similar to our CernerWorks business. As our clients now see those proof points, there's more and more that are coming to the table saying they're interested in this type of partnership with Cerner. It's hard -- the pipeline looks very good. We have many prospects in the pipeline right now in terms of how many per quarter, I think you're going to look at really the same rate, it will be a gradual acceleration, but you could probably expect a client a quarter I think is reasonable.","Kipp R.F. Davis - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Got you. Okay. And then another question on sort of the revenue cycle side, just curious is the delay of ICD-10 impacting business there? Are people sort of saying might want to hold off on making decisions? And again I recognize you guys have a pretty broad offering across different areas of revenue cycle, but just curious if that's making some potential customers kind of pause? And then sort of a related question to that, obviously some folks have had some hiccups in the revenue cycle space, I know your model is a little bit different, I'm just curious if you're seeing that create opportunities as well?","Zane M. Burke","This is Zane, Kipp. I would tell you on the revenue cycle side we actually see the delay of ICD-10 creating opportunity for us. So it's allowing clients you may have wanted to wait 'till after the implementation of ICD-10 to upgrade their patient accounting systems in particular. So in the core system space, it's giving them opportunities to come back and may rethink some of that strategy, and we are actually seeing some opportunities in that space. It'll also elongate the services opportunity time for the preparation for ICD-10 as we move forward. As it relates to your second comment around the revenue cycle business outsourcing, obviously we are different than the one organization I believe you're referencing. And our focus is in our core installed base today, and that's where we have the best opportunity to succeed, and we think we'll continue to do well in that space. And so, while at this point, I would not, in fact, think that will have a lot of impact on our revenue cycle business at this point.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Steve Halper with Lazard Capital Markets.","Steven Halper","Just 2 questions. Given the slightly higher CapEx expenditures for the year, do you still expect free cash flow to grow year-over-year?","Marc G. Naughton","Yes, Steve. Relative at this point, we would expect to do that. The key will be kind of when the cash starts flowing down the second half relative to the building. But given our strong cash flow performance, I feel pretty confident we'll -- you'll see us growing free cash flow year-over-year.","Steven Halper","How much are you going to be spending in the second half of the year for the building?","Marc G. Naughton","It can vary. I mean, it can be anywhere between $30 million to $45 million, and some of that's going to be based on timing. We're trying to go faster, because we need the space. We're growing like crazy, and we need the space so that we can put our people that are involved in those what we would call continuous 24 by 7 businesses in a single campus, which we name the Continuous Campus, get them all in one place. Right now, they're split between couple or 3 different places and we want to get them all in one place to be effective.","Steven Halper","So that will be more sort of service-oriented folks, correct?","Marc G. Naughton","Yes, doing the 24 by 7 job.","Steven Halper","Right. So the other question is, when you look at device resale, specifically to this quarter, what pieces were strong in the quarter? Was it pumps? Was it dispensing cabinets from CareFusion? What goes into -- what went into that device resale this quarter?","Marc G. Naughton","It was strong across the board. We had interest in pumps, we had interest in our own cabinets. We had interest in the cabinets that we are reselling. So it's a -- the exciting part about that is we are continually -- continuing to actively add to that portfolio at a fairly high clip. People are seeing the success we're having. They understand that we can impact our clients' decisions on what they're going to buy by connecting them to the Millennium infrastructure. They trust us. So I think that's -- it's a great business for us to be in, but it was pretty broad across most categories relative to that resale. So that's good news for us, because that makes it easier to grow each element of that.","Steven Halper","Great. So if you, when you look at the upside on the device and hardware sale, was it more of the your traditional hardware resale? Or was it more of a device resale?","Marc G. Naughton","Yes. It was actually kind of both. So we had a couple of larger deals where clients purchased a bunch of hardware from us. And then we also had strength in the hardware side. Just as an aside, most of the focus will be on the hardware and the device resale and how that impacted the top line. I don't mean to minimize the fact that we also had a very strong software quarter, and that was certainly a component of driving higher system sales and driving part of the overtame on the earnings side. So it just wasn't exceptional like we saw in the hardware and the device resale.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Greg Bolan with Sterne Agee.","Gregory T. Bolan - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Can you just talk a little bit about Europe? It appears that there's some momentum it seems on the decision-making side for some of the trust underneath the NHS umbrella. Just kind of wanted to get an update on your thoughts on where that market's going, if it's, if you see it accelerating here in the coming 12 months?","Zane M. Burke","This is Zane. I think what we do see is there is buying happening at the trust level, and so the trusts are now reaching into their own pockets and making decisions. And that we view that as a very positive overall in the U.K. marketplace, that they are now entering into decision-making processes and actually going out procuring systems and we think that's a positive.","Gregory T. Bolan - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","And would you characterize, it seems like there are really just 3 players, including yourselves, that are kind of at the helm. I mean, given the longevity of Cerner's presence within Europe, I mean how would you kind of characterize your -- what you think your batting average might be as these decisions are made at the trust level?","Zane M. Burke","Well, each one of them is unique. So every, and as are almost every single competitive situation that you have, we refer to them as they're all knife fights. And so each one of them has their own nuances to them. And so I would say that those 3 -- the 3 competitors are the ones that you would think of in this space.","Marc G. Naughton","This is Marc. I think one of the things that we're focusing on now that we start seeing the trust maybe coming to market, and you spending their own money. We're certainly focused on getting one of our clients to be an absolute showplace relative to our hosting it, relative to the solutions they have and relative to getting PowerChart Touch into the environment, so that the physicians can see the new iPad apps that we are rolling out now in the U.S. So I think -- keep in mind that we have been operating under a government program that told us what we should build and offer and being hosted by a partner. So for us to be able to go and show our complete portfolio, if you will, in country, we think is going to advantage us. Obviously we're leveraging the fact that we've successfully implemented a large number of sites in the last decade. But as Zane said, this is a business where it's not what did you do for me 2 years ago, it's what you're doing for me lately. And in many cases, as you've implemented things, the company coming in that has no history can make a lot of promises, and that's sometimes people will react to that. But we feel very good about our implemented client base and our ability to go create that show side that we think will be differentiating going forward.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Donald Hooker with Morgan Stanley.","Donald Hooker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So in the past I think you've, when you talk about bookings, you talked about sort of long-term bookings, as you refer to it as a percent of the overall. Can you share a percent for long-term bookings this quarter?","Marc G. Naughton","Yes, I think that was 25%.","Donald Hooker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Did I miss that?","Marc G. Naughton","Yes, 26%. It was a little lower than our average, it was kind of around 29%. I'd also point out that the ITWorks deal that we did do, which tends to be the kind of -- one of the longer term bookings only has a 6-year initial term. So it's not the normal 10 years that we see. So that was a lower relative bookings, than what you might see, there's a built-in extension to the contract, but the only thing that's included in bookings is that first 6 years.","Donald Hooker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Got you. And then the, with regards to the deal with Advocate, the predictive modeling and population management analytics deal that you had, can you talk about the economics of that? Just curious how you guys, how we should think about those types of deals because I suspect that's going to be more common going forward. I mean, is there a sort of a deal size or some sort of revenue number you can put around that, roughly?","Marc G. Naughton","This is Marc, for the most part those are leveraging a lot of the things that they have already bought from us. So and this ultimately that business is a per member per month type of management of a defined population in assisting them. Jeff, any other comments?","Jeffrey A. Townsend","So specific to this one what's significant for us there is that, as Marc mentioned, there is a portfolio, some of which they already own, some of which they'll grow into over time. But the significance there is really this joint development effort or joint innovation effort to combine what they've done, combine our portfolio and go create net new. So what you'll see in the coming months coming out of that relationship will be new IP or new solutions and services that we'll take to the market across the rest of our client base.","Donald Hooker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay and one last quick one and I'll jump off line. You -- I think you commented about strength in the ambulatory market. I was curious if you would be willing to put a percentage around that? Because I think you've got a pretty nice percentage growth in calendar '11. I was curious if that was continuing to grow at the same rate in going here into calendar '12.","Marc G. Naughton","Yes. This is Marc. I don't think in the comments we had anything relative to our growth in ambulatory. Continues to be a good portion of our business. But I don't think we have in the past we're talking about 50% year-over-year increases. I don't think we achieved that level, but we had good growth overall and that once again not only deals that leverage some of our clients as they go to affiliated physicians but also going directly to physician offices.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Atif Rahim with JPMorgan.","Atif A Rahim - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So a question on the revenue cycle side. You said you didn't sign any acute business but added ambulatory business. How was your model there? Are you charging some of the 2 other structures in the industry that we're familiar with, like fixed percentage of collections, or do you have something other than that?","Zane M. Burke","This is Zane. Yes, we do charge a percentage of collections at typical revenue cycle outsourcing model in that space.","Atif A Rahim - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then competitively relative to other players, I don't know if you can discuss what you're advantages versus disadvantages are, maybe starting with price and running down to service?","Zane M. Burke","I would start -- the biggest key element is we have technology that supports the process of the collections, that supports the business processes of driving revenues for the organizations, where most all of our competitors do not have that type of technology, and that is a, that is absolutely the key differentiator in our offering and how we approach the marketplace in that areas. The marriage of the technology and the processes and understanding of how to use those in our client base is very, very unique, and it's really, truly only as Cerner can.","Marc G. Naughton","Yes, I'd just like to add to that point, it's much like the pattern of CernerWorks. Our ability to post at a world-class level has a lot to do with we own the IP and develop the IP that's being hosted. And so that closed loop model as Zane said a lot of the competitors in the space come in and kind of live with whatever's already been purchased, where ours is tightly bundled. But the other differentiator is that revenue cycle is becoming more than 50% about the clinical processes, the coding and the data that's being captured and it's becoming less and less about dropping the claim and trying to collect. So that's our, kind of our differentiator is that ability to go upstream into the clinical processes to ensure that the data's correct and accurate and codified well before it hits the back office.","Atif A Rahim - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Got it. That's helpful. Could you mention [ph] that business for us in terms of maybe revenues and number of customers and also what the target market is for you, who you are targeting first?","Marc G. Naughton","This is Marc. I mean, it seems today that that's a pretty small number still. I mean, we're -- once again it's an area where the -- we're breaking into getting into kind of the, at the dock practice level. So the amount of dollars at this point is small enough that I don\u2019t have it actually in front of me, and it wouldn't be a material item to know. But we continue obviously to push into that market because we think it's a natural extension, as Jeff was saying relative to our technology and our ability to drive, do that more efficiently, which is kind of the whole key on the revenue cycle. Keep in mind, revenue cycle today is not outcomes based as much for the most part. When it is becomes totally outcomes based pay-for-performance, you're going to have to have a clinical record driving the revenue cycle, and that we expect that to differentiate us. Fortunately, we have a little bit of time to get to that market because people are not necessarily making decisions currently because the deferral in ICD-10.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Sean Wieland with Piper Jaffray.","Sean W. Wieland - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","So in follow-up to a couple of other questions that have danced around it. Accretive Health yesterday, could you just take the opportunity to differentiate your RevWorks platform from the way that we've learned Accretive Health goes about doing collections and hospitals?","Marc G. Naughton","This is Marc. A key differentiator that I can see is we are not a collection agency. We're not going to go try to use the data in the approach they were to go wring every dime out on that side. We're going to make sure that the claims are in the appropriate format and that we're getting bills out. And then we're certainly helping people with managing their collection relative to the system. But we're not going to be on the front-line berating the widows and orphans to get paid. So that's not our business model.","Sean W. Wieland - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And then one quick one. You've talked a lot on your prepared remarks about analytics. When do you think this becomes a meaningful contributor to your revenue?","Marc G. Naughton","I'd say there's pieces of it that show up today around just basic reporting around the EMR. So a fair number of our clients will have kind of a what I call it basic warehouse to be able to do operational reporting and improvement. In the past, we've also talked about our Lighthouse practices, where we are out pushing quality initiatives or process improvement type of initiatives, all of which drive off of those analytics. I think as Zane mentioned, the movement towards more of the quality type scores being tied more directly to how I get paid, or whether it get penalized is what we think will kind of drive the next wave for us.","Sean W. Wieland - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay. But in terms of helping doctors make decisions, better decisions at the point of care, and things like that, yes it's a differentiator in how you saw your software, but is there a longer-term plan there in terms of monetizing that?","Zane M. Burke","Yes. So as far as monetizing, in our, we talked about in the past deployment of our sepsis solution. That's an algorithm that is out there really become a condition our client base for lots of those yet to come. But in that process, you navigate through things like data rights, timeliness of the data, mapping of their information. So that's very significant to us to get both Search and Sepsis out in the market, which will allow us to not only monetize but roll those other things out much quicker without a long delay.","Marc G. Naughton","Sean, this is Marc right now, it's early, we're kind of creating the framework for significant number of analytical tools that we can roll out over time. But today, it's really not driving any revenue. As you are aware, sepsis and search we're making available free to get that infrastructure built. ","And this is Marc. I think we've kind of gone our time. I know these guys are going to -- probably have a busy afternoon. So at this point, I'd like to thank everyone for attending the call. We're very pleased with our results, the strength overall of the business, and we certainly thank you for joining us. We look forward to talking to you soon.

Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Thank you, Bridget. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the call. I'll lead off today with a review of the numbers. Zane Burke, our President, will follow me with results highlights and marketplace observations. Neal Patterson, our Chairman and CEO, will be available for Q&A.","Now I'll turn to our results. Similar to recent quarters, our great success in the marketplace is reflected in our record bookings, but we delivered revenues slightly below expectations. Today we'll address the disconnect between our outstanding bookings and what remains a very strong marketplace and our near-term revenue shortfalls. While we are disappointed about delivering slightly lower than expected revenue, our bookings this year coupled with our strong pipeline sets us up for good revenue growth next year.","Our bookings revenue in Q3 was $1.59 billion, which is an all-time high and reflects 44% growth over Q3 of 2014, including record amounts of new business activity. Our revenue backlog ended the quarter at $13.9 billion, which is up from $10.2 billion a year ago, and reflects the strong bookings in Q3 as well as the inclusion of backlog from Health Services.","Revenue in the quarter was $1.13 billion, which is up 34% over Q3 of 2014, and includes approximately $250 million from Health Services. The total is about $20 million below the low end of our guidance range, with approximately half of the shortfall related to core Cerner and half attributable to Health Services.","On the Cerner side, the shortfall is much lower than previous quarters mainly because we appropriately adjusted our forecast for lower services revenue, which was the primary issue in prior quarters. This quarter, the lower than expected revenue is mostly a function of lower than usual levels of upfront software revenue on some of our larger contracts and technology resale being slightly below our expectations.","On the software portion, I'd like to note that we had an all-time high level of software bookings, but a larger than normal portion of the contracts were structured in a manner that resulted in revenue being spread over a longer period. This is obviously good for future periods, but did impact our current quarter revenue. Relative to Health Services, the lower revenue was spread among a few areas, including software, technology resale, and maintenance revenue, and also reflects that we are continuing to fine-tune our visibility in that space.","Another factor we have not discussed that has impacted revenue this year is foreign currency fluctuations. In Q3 revenue would have been $20 million higher if you held exchange rates consistent with those in Q3 of 2014. While we have factored a portion of this into our guidance, it did have some impact beyond what we expected in Q3 and is also a contributor to the lower revenue for the year.","Now I'll quickly go through the total revenue composition for Q3. Total system sales revenue was $325 million. Support and maintenance was $245 million. Services was $539 million, and reimbursed travel was $19 million. System sales revenue reflects a 45% increase over Q3 of 2014, with the growth mainly driven by an increase in subscriptions, which is where the addition of Health Services has had the biggest impact, as well as growth in licensed software and tech resale.","Our software sales margin percent was 67.5%, which is up from 64.3% in Q2 due to a sequential decline in technology resale. The margin percentage is down year over year mainly because Q3 2014 had a very low mix of tech resale that resulted in an unusually high system sales margin percent.","Moving to services, total services revenue, including professional and managed services, was up 30% compared to Q3 of 2014, mainly driven by the addition of Health Services as well as growth in core Cerner managed services. Support and maintenance revenue increased 38% over Q3 of 2014, reflecting growth in core support and maintenance and the addition of Health Services.","Looking at revenue by geographic segment, domestic revenue increased 35% over the year-ago quarter to $998 million and global revenue grew 32% to $130 million, both driven largely by the addition of Health Services.","Moving to gross margin, our gross margin for Q3 was 83.1%, which is basically flat both year over-year and sequentially.","Looking at operating spending, our third quarter non-GAAP operating expenses, which excludes share-based compensation expense, voluntary separation plan expense, and acquisition-related adjustments, were $661 million, which is up 36% compared to adjusted Q3 2014 operating expenses. This growth was primarily driven by the addition of Health Services business.","The total year-over-year growth for each expense category on a non-GAAP basis was 32% for sales and client service, 37% for software development, and 62% for G&A. Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, which you'll recall is a new expense line we added in Q2, was basically flat. Note that similar to last quarter, this line is $25 million on our GAAP income statement and just $3 million in our non-GAAP results since we are excluding amortization related to Health Services.","Moving to operating margins, similar to the past two quarters, we delivered basically in-line earnings on lower revenue, resulting in a higher operating margin percent than we projected at the beginning of the year. Our operating margin before share-based compensation expenses, voluntary separation expense, and acquisition-related adjustments was 24.5% in Q3. This is down 90 basis points year over year, due mostly to the very low tech resale in Q3 2014, and up 30 basis points from Q2 of 2015.","Moving to net earnings and EPS, our GAAP net earnings in Q3 were $147 million or $0.42 per diluted share. Adjusted net earnings were $189 million and adjusted EPS was $0.54, which is up 29% compared to Q3 of 2014. Adjusted net earnings exclude share-based compensation expense, which had a net impact on GAAP earnings of $14 million or $0.04 per diluted share; as well as the voluntary separation plan expense, which had a net impact on GAAP earnings of $2.5 million or $0.01 per diluted share.","Adjusted net earnings also reflect adjustments related to Cerner's acquisition of Health Services, including Health Services acquisition-related amortization, which reduced GAAP net earnings and diluted earnings per share by $15 million and $0.04 respectively; other acquisition-related adjustments, which reduced GAAP net earnings and diluted earnings per share by $4 million or $0.01 respectively; and the acquisition-related deferred revenue adjustment, which is not included in GAAP net earnings but increased adjusted net earnings and diluted earnings per share by $6 million and $0.02 respectively.","The Q3 tax rate for adjusted net earnings was 32%, which is slightly below our expected range of 33% to 34%.","Now I'll move to our balance sheet. We ended Q3 with $766 million of total cash and investments, which is down from $857 million in Q2, primarily due to the use of cash for our repurchase programs. During the quarter we finished the remaining $100 million of repurchases authorized in 2014 and purchased $100 million of the $245 million authorized in September of this year. In total we repurchased 3.2 million shares at an average price of $61.91.","Moving to debt, our total debt including capital lease obligations is $631 million, which is basically flat compared to Q2.","Total receivables ended the quarter at $1.05 billion, which is up $50 million from Q2. Our Q3 DSO was 85 days compared to 81 days in Q2 and 67 days in the year-ago quarter. The higher DSO is primarily a function of the lower revenue in the quarter, and we are also still working through some delayed billings for Health Services clients as part of the transition. We do expect DSO improvement in Q4.","Operating cash flow for the quarter was $272 million, up from $109 million in Q2. Q3 capital expenditures were $88 million and capitalized software was $72 million. Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures and capitalized software, was $111 million for the quarter, driven by strong operating cash flow.","Now I'll go through Q4 and full-year 2016 guidance. For Q4, we expect revenue between $1.15 billion and $1.2 billion, with the midpoint reflecting growth of 27% over Q4 of 2014. Our Q4 revenue guidance combined with year-to-date results put us slightly below the low end of previously provided full-year guidance, as we have factored in the lower results from Q3 and lower Q4 to reflect a similar run rate. So far this year, a favorable mix of revenue, lower expenses, and Health Services synergies have allowed us to deliver mostly in-line earnings despite our lower revenue. Looking to Q4, we do expect the lower revenue to have some impact on earnings, mainly due to the continuing effect of lower services revenue and the impact of lower upfront software on some contracts.","We expect Q4 adjusted EPS before share-based compensation, voluntary separation plan expense, and acquisition-related adjustments to be $0.56 to $0.58 per share, with the midpoint reflecting 21% growth over Q4 2014 adjusted EPS. This range is below consensus estimates and slightly below our original plan, but it does get us to the low end of our most recently provided full-year guidance. Also, the Q4 guidance combined with year-to-date results still reflect strong growth of 26% for the full year. Our estimate for the impact of share-based compensation expense is approximately $0.03 to $0.04 in Q4, which equates to $0.14 to $0.15 for the full year.","Moving to bookings guidance, we expect bookings revenue in Q4 of $1.45 billion to $1.55 billion, with the midpoint reflecting strong growth of 29% over Q4 of 2014 and 31% growth for the full year.","Now I would like to provide initial expectations for 2016. Note that these comments should be viewed as preliminary until we finalize our financial plan and provide more formal guidance when we report fourth quarter results.","We currently expect 2016 revenues to be over $5 billion, which equates to growth of at least 13% on top of what is projected to be approximately 30% growth in 2015. We realize that the growth this year benefited from our acquisition and has come in below our original targets, but growing 13% on top of a 30% growth year is still strong. Our 13% target does include a benefit of having 12 months of Health Services revenue in 2016 compared to 11 months in 2015, but that only equates to about 2% of the growth for the year, so our full-year growth target is still double-digit even excluding the extra month.","While there are obviously many assumptions that go into projecting future revenue, we do feel positive about our ability to deliver good growth in 2016. A key element to our confidence in 2016 revenues is our backlog, which has grown significantly this year due to our record bookings and the addition of Health Services business. This larger backlog translates into better visibility for 2016.","As we look at the rollout of backlog in 2016, we currently expect approximately 75% of our revenue to come from backlog, which is higher than historical levels. Another key assumption is we do believe the market opportunity will remain strong, which Zane will discuss.","For earnings, we currently expect adjusted diluted earnings per share before share-based compensation and acquisition-related adjustments between $2.30 and $2.40 per share, with the midpoint reflecting 13% growth over 2015 expected results. This range is below the current consensus estimate of $2.52, which was formed in the absence of company guidance. We believe the primary potential differences between our preliminary view and the consensus estimate may include higher non-cash expenses and professional services contributions.","Regarding non-cash expenses, our current estimates reflect an increase in depreciation and amortization of more than $75 million in 2016, which equates to nearly $0.15 of earnings per share. And we believe consensus estimates have less than this for non-cash expense impact. The large increase in amortization is tied to a significant amount of previously capitalized software expected to become generally available. And the large increase in depreciation is related to recent increased levels of capital spending.","Relative to services contribution, while we expect strong growth in services revenue and earnings contributions next year, the growth will be coming off of the lower 2015 levels we have discussed. We do not intend for these comments to precisely reconcile our preliminary view to analyst estimates, but more to provide our thoughts on potential differences.","In summary, we realize this has been a challenging year relative to delivering against our revenue expectations. As I indicated, we believe revenue growth will be good next year and we have visibility to this growth, partially driven from a backlog that has benefited from what has been by far the best year of bookings in the history of our company.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Zane, who can talk about why our bookings are so strong.","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","Thanks, Marc. Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll provide color on our results and make some marketplace observations.","I'll start with our results. Our bookings revenue in Q3 of $1.59 billion reflects strong growth of 44% over Q3 2014. Bookings this quarter included another all-time high level of large contracts, with 45 contracts over $5 million, including 31 over $10 million. For long-term bookings, we did have two ITWorks contracts, but the overall mix of long-term bookings was more in the normal range of 31%, which makes the strength of these bookings even more impressive because it wasn't driven by elevated levels of longer-term contracts.","A highlight of the quarter was that we again signed a record number of new footprints, with 39% of our bookings coming from outside our core Millennium installed base. So far this year, we have signed more new footprints measured by dollars and count of sites than any full year in our history. This success reflects our strong competitiveness and the continued large opportunity for competitive displacements.","Our success this quarter and the opportunities in our pipeline span many market segments, including IDNs, regional hospitals, children and community hospitals, state and federal, behavioral health, ambulatory surgery centers, and physician groups.","A particularly noteworthy area of success is large IDNs and investor-owned health systems. In addition to McLaren Health Care selecting Cerner for EHR revenue cycle and population health, which they announced last month, we also gained another large investor-owned health system as a new client during the quarter.","In addition, one of our existing investor-owned clients chose to move forward with Cerner for an additional 24 sites. These are in addition to Baptist Health South Florida and the Department of Defense, which we talked about on our last call but occurred during the third quarter.","As I mentioned before, I believe a key element of our success is driven by our track record for delivering projects on time and on budget as well as creating measurable value, which aligns well with our clients' focus on making ROI-based decisions. This ability to deliver value along with predictable costs and timelines serve as a differentiator relative to our primary competitor. I believe their list of clients, where the significant costs of deploying and maintaining their systems have been cited as a key reason for financial challenges, is starting to impact them in the marketplace. This not only differentiates us in the sales process, it has also contributed to some of their existing clients switching to Cerner, even after having spent $100 million-plus on their system.","We are also continuing to sign Health Services clients to migrate to Millennium, including both IDNs and small hospitals. Overall, we remain pleased with our progress with Health Services base, with migrations continuing at a good pace.","Now, I'd like to highlight an important announcement we made during the Cerner Health Conference that represents a major milestone for our HealtheIntent platform. During Neal's keynote address, we announced that Geisinger Health System, a national model for high-quality and high-value healthcare, decided to use our HealtheIntent Population Health platform to extend their data-driven population health capabilities.","Cerner and Geisinger share a core belief that managing the health of populations requires access to information outside traditional healthcare domains. And we are excited to be a strategic part of Geisinger's ability to provide systems-level insight to manage population health at scale. This relationship builds on a proof-of-concept project that started last year when Geisinger leveraged HealtheIntent, our system-agnostic, near real-time platform that normalizes data to aggregate clinical and financial data from its core EHR and other sources, such as its insurance company.","We believe this decision makes a clear statement to the market, as Geisinger uses our primary competitor for their core EHR and is one of their longest duration and most significant clients. We believe this demonstrates that our capabilities could not be equaled by a competitor, and the HealtheIntent platform is the right platform to support Geisinger's quest for ongoing innovation.","I also think this makes clear that our investments in interoperability and open platforms that enable client and third-party innovation are paying off. This is a great example of why we believe Cerner is positioned to play a major role as healthcare continues to shift from a fee-for-service model to outcomes-based reimbursement models that intend on keeping people healthy.","Moving to our revenue cycle business, we had a good third quarter. We continue to have a high take rate of revenue cycle in our new EHR footprint, which supports what we've been saying about the market looking to buy integrated systems. A key element of our success in the revenue cycle has been the increasing number of proof points with our clients.","One quick example I'd like to share is something from a thank you note a client CFO sent us recently. In the note, he indicated that in the past year they had decreased AR days 19%, increased average daily revenue 22%, and reduced discharged not final billed days by 33%. These success stories are becoming more common and add to our momentum in the marketplace.","Moving to the ambulatory market, where we had an all-time high level of bookings in Q3, surpassing a record we just set in the last quarter, the bookings were driven by success at displacing our key competitors, both by expanding our solutions to the ambulatory venues of our acute care clients and as part of new business footprints.","In ambulatory business office services, we had two displacements of a certain cloud competitor. Our opportunity to displace this competitor resulted from their lack of execution, failure to meet established objectives, rising costs after teaser rates, and a realization by the client that they ended up needing similar or more staff even though they thought they had outsourced the function to our competitor because they left much of the harder work and complex work to the client.","We also had a strong quarter in the small hospital market and passed the 100 client milestone with our cloud-based CommunityWorks offering. This quarter's success was again driven by a combination of traditional new footprints, extensions through our health system clients, and Health Services migrations. We expect the CommunityWorks offering to exceed 125 clients by year end.","In addition, CommunityWorks opened two new markets by completing multiple client conversions within standalone orthopedic surgical hospitals along with a multi-site clinically integrated network in the state of Iowa. We believe there is good market opportunity for Cerner in the small hospital market and are very pleased with our competitiveness in this market.","Outside of the U.S., we had a solid Q3, with revenue growth of 32% and good bookings in Australia, the United Kingdom, and the Middle East. We continue to make progress with integrating the global components of Health Services, which is augmenting our global presence and positioning us for good long-term contributions from our global business.","In summary, I'm very pleased with the success we are having in the marketplace and maintain a positive outlook because of our large pipeline, broad solution and services offering, and strong competitive position.","With that, I'd like to open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question is from Dave Francis with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","David K. Francis - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi, good afternoon, guys. Marc or Zane, can you help us understand a little bit more, as you talked about at the front end of the call, the difference between getting revenue growth and the backlog and the bookings? It's understood from the last quarter there were several contracts that had some meaningful revenue attached to them that didn't fall into the quarter. I'm just trying to true up the difference there so we can better understand the cadence of bookings and how that translates to revenue in the short term.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Sure, this is Marc. Relative to license revenue, as we said, record bookings for licensed software in the quarter. We actually had record license revenue, very strong license revenue. However, it was lower than our projections primarily because certain contracts have some provisions, especially as we start addressing the new markets for new clients who are coming off of an unsatisfactory relationship where they are looking to hold the new suppliers' feet to the fire a little bit. So we do have those contracts that will have some payments tied to milestones.","Traditionally as we've talked to you all in the past, most of our payments for licensed software are date-based and don't impact revenue recognition at all. We're now seeing some payments being tied to milestones, which is very reasonable for clients to do that in this current environment. That tying into a milestone defers that revenue to the milestone occurring. So that revenue goes in the backlog and comes out at a future point in time as part of the project is getting done. Good for the future, but when you go into a quarter end, you don't see those provisions up front as an expectation, but they are negotiated as we go forward. It does impact the amount of revenue we take in the initial quarter for particularly those new clients is where we're seeing that.","David K. Francis - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Let me ask it a different way then. As you look at your initial guidance for 2016 and talking about conversion out of backlog into revenue and what have you, the visibility issues that you guys have had relative to this year, what changes over the next coming several quarters to give you the kind of confidence that the revenue levels that you're looking at, up double digits year over year, are achievable relative to your ability to convert out of backlog? And I'll stop there, thanks.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","The key for 2016 when I'm looking at 2016 is the amount of backlog we have and the fact that I am having things such as licensed software rolling out based on a projection of the projects, as I do hours to be done.","Another key factor for 2016 is that really in the last half of 2015, particularly in Q3, we saw a strong increase in professional services implementation bookings, and we expect to see that in Q4. That strong increase in those specific bookings is speeding the backlog, and those projects will be started and underway in 2016. Just from a number of bodies times number of hours perspective, we hired over 200 people into this professional services organization during Q3. So we ended Q3 with a larger workforce, which means we'll be able to go work additional hours, drive additional revenue from that backlog that's there.","The 75% we referenced is coming as 2016 revenue is being driven from the backlog is the highest percent of revenue for a year that I've seen in my tenure here. Normally, I think recently it's been in the low 70%. And all of that at this point should be predictive work that we can drive with available head count. We're not going to be in HS mode of trying to decide should we hire, should we not hire. We're back into our mode of seeing the work, hiring the people, getting them up to speed. Unfortunately for us in 2015, the impact of that is going to be in 2016.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.","I guess just one follow-up on that, Marc, just so I'm clear. I think the last few quarters, where the top line might have missed expectations, it was really more around services conversion obviously just being slower by nature, and then also some weakness in tech resale. Am I understanding it correctly that it's still a component of those two things, but now in addition to that there are some longer conversions around your more classic license software sales? Is that the message on this quarter's revenue shortfall?","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","No, let me make sure I'm clear. This quarter we actually delivered our services number. The number we had projected, we delivered that. The difference in the revenue from external \u2013 from what we shared in our projections to what we delivered was really focused on two things, primarily licensed software from the Cerner side and from lower than expected tech resale.","We had a fairly significant \u2013 a couple of significant tech resale deals primarily related to third party, the resale of third-party software that we expected to happen in the quarter and they did not happen. One of those actually was changed to be sold by the manufacturer. We'll get some profitability out of that, but we won't get the revenue out of that. So that was the primary driver on the license side for Cerner. Why the license was less than we had projected, even though it was strong and at record levels, we had projected even higher levels. Those contracts from new clients, we had a few of those that were larger that included milestone-based payments. So the payments for the license are tied to milestones. We can't take the revenue for that licensed software until the milestone occurs.","Relative to the service businesses, we actually delivered the services number. That was the number we focused on internally and we actually delivered that. But for Q3, the difference was \u2013 half of it HS, half of it is Cerner. And on the Cerner side it was licensed software and those two tech resale deals that didn't materialize.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it, that's actually really helpful. And I guess just some back of the envelope math on the EPS guidance range for next year, assuming your guidance of roughly around $5 billion on the top line, it seems like at least directionally it would imply a tougher operating margin year than I think many were thinking. I guess first off, is that accurate? And then secondly, can you maybe just talk about the major components of what might be weighing on margins more than people expected?","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","I think if I do the quick math, I think it basically looks at flat operating margins. They'll be around 25% if you use a revenue number that's around \u2013 that's at $5 billion. And to get to the earnings, I think we basically expected not to grow quite as much on the operating margin side clearly because of lower revenue. This year has actually gotten almost back to our prior operating margin levels. Next year it's really the impact of the non-cash expenses. That's a $75 million to $80 million hit that is going to impact my operating margins. It's not a cash hit but it is additional expense.","And so I think if you go math out the numbers, you'll end up with about the same operating margin next year. It should be within 30 to 40 basis points to where we would end up with this year, which is somewhere around 24.5%, so somewhere in the 24.5% to 25% range would be my rough math for 2016. So we don't see a decrease. We do see because of the higher non-cash spending challenging to grow above that. But I think clearly we'll continue to invest in the business and should be able to get to a level where we start getting some more leverage back into businesses as those increases moderate.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay, thanks so much.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Sure.","Operator","Our next question is from Sean Wieland with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","Sean W. Wieland - Piper Jaffray & Co","Hi, thank you. So first to confirm, I didn't hear you mention any contribution from DoD in the quarter or at least for 2015 or 2016. I want to confirm that that is the case.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Once again, as we said, DoD will have certainly a slower impact on the bookings and a slower impact on the revenue that we recognize. We did have the first task order, task order number one. Our group, The Leidos Group, we got an order from that, but that number was less than 1% of my bookings for the quarter. So once again, those numbers are coming in smallish chunks on a just-in-time basis to some extent, so no contribution in 2015 from DoD from either earnings or for material bookings. And in 2016 we're not relying on DoD to be anything that provides additional uplift over the other business.","Sean W. Wieland - Piper Jaffray & Co","Okay, and then one other question to follow up to Dave's on these milestone payments.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Yes.","Sean W. Wieland - Piper Jaffray & Co","What kind of milestone are we talking about? Are we talking about shipment of software? Are we talking about achieving certain savings metrics or clinical measures? Can you just tell us what kind of milestones you're baking in to the contracts?","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","Sure. Sean, this is Zane. I think it's more project-related items. So as you think about the projects and where these clients have come from, so there I just always describe it as they're getting divorced at the same time they're trying to get remarried, and their previous vendor has left them in a very challenging position and has basically failed then to deliver the kinds of solutions that they need long term. And so when you're in those kind of predicaments, as oftentimes happens as the client is getting divorced from their former vendor and getting married to Cerner, they come in with a pre-nup that looks a little bit different than what you would typically see. And then as we gain experience with that client and they gain the confidence in us to deliver, those kinds of things tend to go away in subsequent periods. So when we have the high level of new business bookings that we had in the quarter, there is a higher susceptibility to some of those types of activities impacting our results at the end of the day.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","One milestone could be go-live. That's a pretty standard one that they put in that we are saying we're going to get this done in this kind of timeframe. And they say that's great; let's tie a payment to us going live when we expect to go live.","Sean W. Wieland - Piper Jaffray & Co","What about like performance like AR days or things like that?","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Yeah. Those aren't milestones. In our view, milestones are really events that occur relative to some payments that are at risk in some form or fashion. We'll have some of those in a contract on occasion. Usually, it's upside to us. So we get our base pricing, but at the last minute there will be an element of shared savings that we'll put into contracts because obviously the client want to see us focused on making them successful, and the best way to do that is to have some at-risk elements. But that doesn't really affect my revenue recognition because any at-risk payment doesn't get recognized until we actually receive the payment. Not only do we deliver the action that should get the payment, but we take a conservative position that I've got to get the check in my hand before we take that revenue. But that's outside what I would call revenue recognition thoughts.","Sean W. Wieland - Piper Jaffray & Co","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","And I think I'd just \u2013 I wouldn't necessarily say this is a new trend. I think it's just one of those things that when you end up with a higher level of new business bookings that that's something that is part of the process. And so I wouldn't necessary say that's a new trend element. I think the trend part is the significant bookings, our increase of new bookings, a percentage of those go into our business.","Sean W. Wieland - Piper Jaffray & Co","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Eric Percher with Barclays. Your line is open.","Eric R. Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks. I think I'll come back to the margin question. As we look at this year, you've been able to reduce expenses tremendously, and I know that Health Services was a big part of that. Can I ask you to just walk us through as you look that the underlying business and maybe the mix shift, it's really a mix question, out into next year there is obviously some non-cash elements. But do you expect that your mix continues to give you the opportunity to drive higher op margin, or have we entered a period where op margin and earnings look much closer to the revenue growth number?","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Eric, this is Marc. I don't think we're in a period where we would expect operating margins to stay at the same level. We continue to have opportunities, certainly on the combined HS and Cerner organization, to drive out additional synergies on the spend side as well as the operating and revenue side. I think that you'll see us in 2016 offsetting the impact of significantly higher non-cash expense, we will add resources at Cerner to the extent that they drive revenue, and that's been our philosophy at many points in time.","We invested heavily in R&D and those types of areas more recently, but I don't think you're going to see a lot of needed additional investment in those areas. You'll see us hiring people to go work on projects, drive revenue. You'll see us hire people for managed services, which drives revenue, some of the support organization, which drives revenue. So that's really where we're going to focus our dollars on.","I think once you get through a period of the software turning on and ramping up some of the software amortization, we should get back to a time when you'll start seeing improvements in operating margins. There's no real change in the mix of the business. Software is still really strong, and that strength in software should logically, as you get through some of this non-cash spending element, you should actually get to a point where operating margins can increase.","Eric R. Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc.","That's helpful. In the services investments, you maybe talked about 200 additional team members. Does that same type of ramp occur in Q4?","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","We can give you the Q4 numbers once we have them. I think the hiring in Q2 or Q3 was related to the Q3 strong bookings that we expected. So I think we will be hiring based on our demand. I would expect to see that number go up. I can't tell you. There's a little bit of hiring at the end of the year and timing relative to when people graduate school and all this kind stuff that impacts a lot of people we don't bring in until January. So will we at the end of Q4 have another 200 people? I can't address that, but I can indicate that we are back on track to increasing that workforce.","Eric R. Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Very good, thank you.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Sure.","Operator","Our next question is from David Larsen with Leerink Partners. Your line is open.","David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC","Hi. Can you talk about Siemens Health Services? I guess the revenue came in slightly below expectations. Was that from Siemens hospitals buying other Siemens software solutions, or was it conversions over to Millennium that were slightly below expectations? Any more color around that would be helpful. Thanks.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Sure, David. This is Marc. The HS was really not related to selling more Siemens software because we aren't expecting to sell a lot of additional Siemens software specifically. Migrations are doing well, but it's primarily just related to their business overall. Some maintenance contracts that people canceled was probably as big of an impact on revenue as anything. Those are dependent on that client having certain equipment or keeping that maintenance contract with Siemens, but it didn't reflect really a major change. It's just the expiration of certain maintenance. And in some cases, people just not renewing their maintenance contracts relative to the equipment that they had through Siemens.","The rest of it was just spread throughout the piece of the organization, but nothing that reflected a trend relative to their selling more of their Siemens software, which we didn't expect and they didn't do, or migrations which are going well, and once again fall into a bucket that is not necessarily \u2013 we can't necessarily attribute it to Siemens as fulfilling selling the revenue. I think we're still working obviously through the visibility on the revenue side. But when we look at the net impact on Cerner, our overall accretion remains on track. It's primarily at this point just the top line forecasting timing we're trying to get through.","David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay, that's great. Thanks very much. And then can you size how much bookings in the quarter came from the Siemens side of the house?","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","It would be minimal.","David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC","Minimal, okay, so that's all mainly organic.","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","This is Zane. We would have had a number of migrations that would impact the bookings, but pure Health Services \u2013 purchasing Health Services solutions would have been fairly minimal.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Dave, we get into the element that we've been talking to you about is we're one company now. And so anything that we sell that's Cerner stuff we think of as a Cerner booking, but even if it's a migration to Cerner from a Siemens client. So the cross-sell in those elements are going to be coming through the Cerner bookings. The HS bookings for me is primarily things that they're selling their services or their own software. And as I said, we haven't really been focused on selling a lot of their own software at this point.","David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay, that's great, and just one last one. I think you signed a couple large service engagements last quarter. Should we see the revenue flow through for those in 2016? Thanks.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Sure, especially relative to our ITWorks business, we've actually had a very successful 2015. We signed two ITWorks deals each quarter in Q1, Q2, and Q3, so that's the rhythm that was talked about us wanting to achieve. And once we get those signed, that revenue stream usually starts up very quickly because those associates get rebadged very close to the timing of the signing of the contracts. So that revenue does kick in, and all six of those deals will be contributing to 2016 revenue.","David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay, great. Nice bookings quarter, thanks a lot.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from Mohan Naidu with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.","Mohan Naidu - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thank you very much for taking my questions. Marc, maybe when I go back to your bookings and revenue conversion one more time, with your new guidance, it looks like you're going to do 30%-plus growth for the full 2015. That's great, but your revenue guidance for next year points to low teens growth. Can you help us understand what are the moving parts that translate from a 30% bookings growth to a teens revenue growth?","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Certainly the elements of bookings growing significantly. And keep in mind; in 2015 we are growing revenue 30%. We're growing earnings 26%. Obviously, you understand there's an element from the acquisition that impacts that. But when you look at our bookings, you've got the long-term component of them, which this quarter even on the larger number trended down, or trended to be more normal like the 31% rather than the mid-30% that we've been seeing. The longer-term bookings don't have an immediate effect. They spread out over a period of time. They will help 2016, but one-tenth of them help 2016. Relative to current quarters, the item we're talking about primarily was the license component. And you're talking about $10 million or $15 million of licensed software when you're talking about that relative to the overall total revenue growth, so it's not a significant difference.","A lot of these contracts have a significant amount of professional services in them. That rolls out over a period of time, sometimes multiyear period of time. They all have a hosting element to them, which falls into our long-term bookings percentage. So really the mix of the business is actually pretty much normalized in Q3. The big difference is even with strong license based on that bigger number, we did not get as much revenue from the current quarter as we would have expected. That revenue flows forward. But I think from a growth perspective, if you look at 13%-plus revenue growth in 2016 off of a number that grew 30% in 2015, we've got an extra $1 billion or so of revenue that we're growing on top of. We've always targeted growing double digits, especially after a year where that was more challenging for us in 2015.","We're actually pretty \u2013 feeling good about getting back to double-digit growth on a much higher number base than we have had in the past. So we actually think the growth in earnings and the growth in revenue being more aligned than normal is a matter of just not getting as much leverage in 2016 because of higher non-cash expense. And I think that, as I said, moderates over time.","Mohan Naidu - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Got it, that was very helpful. And if I understand that correctly, if we take out the Health Services revenue out of your 2015 and keep the bookings the same, we could have seen 25%-plus revenue growth. Is that fair?","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","You would have certainly seen strong \u2013 you would have seen in 2016 stronger revenue growth, absolutely.","Mohan Naidu - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thanks a lot, Marc.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Sure.","Operator","Our next question is from Steven Valiquette with UBS. Your line is open.","Jonathan Yong - UBS Securities LLC","Hi, this is Jonathan Yong on for Steve today, just a question back on the margins. I get the non-cash expense side of things. But I guess some of the synergy targets that you originally laid out for the Siemens deal of the $175 million, are you guys still on track for that? Is there a way to \u2013 are you guys speeding up? Can I just get a sense of where you guys are in terms of the synergy levels there?","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Yes, relative to Siemens, we are absolutely on track for 2015 delivering the synergies that we expected. We might be slightly ahead, but things are going well there. I think in 2016 we continue to expect to deliver the synergies we originally expected. As we've indicated, the harder part for us now is because of the coming together of the organizations and the fact that there's some spending on the Cerner side that relates to the HS business.","Now it is not cleanly that I could give you a P&L for HS. I don't have that visibility. I can't track the spending at that level, and so I can't specifically tell you exact numbers that it's driving out as a separate P&L. But based on all the metrics that we track, based on their spend, based on our spend, we see that those synergies are coming through, and that is part of the benefit we get on the spend side in 2016, so it does help offset some of the non-cash. But we're also growing \u2013 we're continuing to invest in revenue-producing associates, which should drive revenue, but also is going to drive up spending as well.","Jonathan Yong - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And then just on the RevWorks side, since we're past ICD-10 now and hopefully things are good in the market there, have you guys heard any chatter about clients particularly looking at your RevWorks solutions yet? Thanks.","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","This is Zane. I think we continue to see interest in revenue cycle in particular, and then obviously the business off a services perspective has been very strong on the physician side, so we continue to see good growth there. I think that you will see a return to that marketplace for broader RevWorks offerings there. And we continue to sell well as piece parts of that. But I do sense that that will return to the fold here as people get past ICD-10 and begin to think more long term about how to best handle their costs and the collections related to changing business models.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","This is Marc. Keep in mind, ICD-10 wasn't just flip a switch and okay, all the lights stay green, so we're good. Thirty days later, you're going to get \u2013 as one of payers come back and tell you if they agree with the claim, you're going to be tracking all the metrics you track. So even though people were post the technical ICD-10 go-live, there's still a good six months as people are going through and looking at making sure that they understand the impact of ICD-10, relook at what their needs are in case their environment has changed. So I think the demands are as Zane said. I don't think flipping that switch was going to trigger a bunch of demand. I think it will be something you see starting to hit us in 2016.","Jonathan Yong - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, that's helpful. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from George Hill with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey. Good afternoon, guys, and thanks for taking the question. I guess, Marc or Zane, can either of you guys tell us what \u2013 I want to call it what like-for-like Cerner bookings are and what the growth has looked like year over year because I think there was probably some misunderstanding about the composition how this year includes Siemens bookings and last year did not, so real bookings growth year to date isn't actually 32%. What is the like-for-like Cerner bookings growth?","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","This is Marc. Like-for-like, actually Siemens is negligibly impacting us. They aren't selling a whole lot of stuff. They're not selling a lot of tech resale. From a bookings perspective, there's not a lot of \u2013 they haven't had a lot of individual sales of what they offer separately. Almost anything that has been driven by that base has been migration-related. So I think you might take a few percent out of it if you want to relative to that increase. But the vast majority, certainly 95%-plus is related to Cerner and sale of our solutions and our services and our ITWorks and all those things. So if you're really looking \u2013 if you're trying to figure out is this bookings increase reflective of Cerner's opportunities in the marketplace, it is almost entirely related to our opportunities. Zane?","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","And I think the first place to start is by looking at the new business bookings. You had 39% new business bookings for the quarter, which is all Cerner, Cerner-Cerner. And as Marc said, it's a few percentage points as it relates to the current year impact of Health Services bookings on our total bookings, so it's very minimal.","George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, then I guess the follow-up question then becomes, it would seem that there has to be an elongation in the backlog to a revenue recognition conversion period. We've talked about this before, and you said there hasn't been a meaningful change there. I guess can you help us bridge the gap from 32% bookings growth year to date, likely to stay that number as we go into the end of the year to the revenue guidance? You talked about the milestone payment, but you wouldn't even think that \u2013 that hasn't been impacting the business long enough to explain the change in the bookings growth rate to the rev-rec, to the delta in the rev-rec growth rate, or just what am I missing there?","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","The milestones primarily impact current quarter bookings near term, and it does feed the backlog. Keep in mind, George. This year we had significantly higher levels of long-term bookings. The first two quarters were primarily \u2013 35%, 37%, whatever the percent it was. It was significantly higher relative to the bookings. Certainly this quarter, it's more like it's back into the 31% range, which is normal, on a much bigger number.","A lot of these new contracts that are getting signed by new clients have a significant amount of services and other items that roll into the backlog. So I'm not sure that it's elongating the backlog because things like software, and something to your point, if I have day-based (53:43) payments, the software really never hits the backlog. It gets recognized mostly in the quarter in which it's booked and I don't have any future impact. I am now getting \u2013 for milestones for some other contract term, I am getting backlog that is coming in from license. Now it's more of a two to three-year timeframe, but it varies from day one to that. So from an elongated backlog, yes, it's slightly longer in some cases, but it's not materially different relative to the business.","So understand that the large bookings number coming through feels like it should contribute more to 2016. It does contribute more. I'm getting 75% of my revenue in 2016 out of that backlog, where in prior periods it would have been closer to 70%. So I'm getting a significant \u2013 I am getting more revenue coming through there. But the mix is similar except I have a lot more long-term this year than I've had in prior years, and that is going to \u2013 that's all 10-year stuff that is going to basically add to the overall average number of years it takes to drive the backlog out.","George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, that's helpful. And then maybe one last quick question is, you referenced briefly the increased scale of the business now with the inclusion of Health Services. I guess should we be thinking of this 10% to 15% EPS growth as the new normal target range for the company, or is 15% to 20% closer to the right range? I guess I'm trying to think about what do we think as a sustainable number now given the new size of the business and given the growth profile of the legacy Siemens business. Thanks.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Yeah. I do not intend that the current 2016 guidance, where revenue and margin \u2013 earnings are growing at the same rate, to be indicative of what we look to do in the future. We are a business that should have leverage. Keep in mind, we are growing off of a 2015 that we put in Siemens, and so certainly that helped us. But now in 2016, we're growing on top of that. So we're having to go grow revenue on top of a 30% revenue growth business. I have to grow earnings on top of a 26% earnings growth business.","So it isn't illogical that in the year following that significant amount of growth particular year I'm getting hit with these non-cash expenses, that the growth might more track with revenue. I think over time, we would look to grow revenue double digit and that you would see us moving that earnings percentage growth up higher than our revenue growth. We will get leverage that way. The bigger the company we get as a software company, as we get more efficient in our services businesses, as we roll and continue to roll out the model system, which is an effective way to go implement our software, as we look to go make very quick migrations of Siemens clients, I think there are a lot of opportunities for us to certainly get efficiencies in the business. So yes, I'm not calling this the new normal. There's upside to our growth percentages.","George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, thanks for that.","Operator","Our next question is from...","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Okay. Go ahead.","Operator","Our next question is from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Zachary W. Sopcak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey, good afternoon, this is Zack for Ricky. I just wanted to ask a question, a bit of bookkeeping when thinking about bookings for 2016. Is the comp for 2016 bookings going to be tougher because 2015 is going to include the migration of Health Services clients to Millennium?","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","The bookings comp since HS doesn't have a whole lot of impact, pure HS on the bookings, it won't really be a reason. But given, as we talked earlier, that overall bookings are growing 30%, I'd call that a pretty reasonable comp to grow above. But yes, it's a tough comp. But I think that's \u2013 keep in mind that most of the growth this year was pretty much organic. It wasn't impacted a lot by HS on the bookings side. Certainly on the earnings and revenue side it was impacted, but on the bookings side it wasn't. So we grew 30% relatively organically on the bookings side. We see a very active marketplace. So our goal is to grow on top of that 30% uptick in bookings we saw in 2015.","Zachary W. Sopcak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got you. And just quickly on the contracts, so you mentioned the strong growth in large contracts, and it looks like contracts over $10 million have already exceeded 2014. Can you give just a little bit more color on what's driving those and how that compared to your expectations going into the year?","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","This is Zane. I think what you're seeing is we had a large number of big systems making purchases. So we talked about our competitiveness in the IDN marketplace, in the investor-owned marketplace, and so just some pure very large new business and current clients that are out procuring solutions to standardize their businesses as they move forward on a standard platform and using Cerner to help drive cost down and leverage, create leverage for their organizations. And I think some of those larger contracts, they're all about actually creating leverage in their organization.","So whether it's ITWorks type situations where our clients are utilizing our scale to help drive costs appropriately on their side and prepare for the future elements, I think some of those larger elements are reflective of a broad base to the business because we hit on pretty much every large contract in that space. Big IDNs, investor-owned, our ITWorks businesses, our regional and community hospital marketplace, they're going to drive significant large upfront bookings. So I think it's a combination of things and it's really about our clients are preparing for the future of healthcare, and that's what we're helping to provide them to help drive their costs down and to improve the quality of care.","Zachary W. Sopcak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great, thank you.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Thanks. Why don't we take one more question?","Operator","All right, your last question is Steve Halper with FBR. Your line is open.","Steven P. Halper - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Yes, hi. Could you just run through for me one more time the factors behind the reduction in the fourth quarter guidance? And also as a follow-up, what are the cash flow expectations for 2016 now that you've set the stage for the income statement?","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Sure. Relative to Q4, I think we continue to see lower revenue for Q4. I'm not looking to go \u2013 we hit services revenue in Q3. We had probably expected Q4 to grow a little bit from that number. I think our current projections based on the timing of hiring new people and based on the work is that Q4 would be relatively flat on the services side to Q3. So we're not looking to go increase that a significant amount. And I think we'll still see some of the impact of this milestone-based payments on contracts. It's going to have an impact on the timing of revenue recognition.","So those are elements that as we look forward to the revenue coming out of Q4 that we expect it to probably be about $50 million lower probably from the midpoint as to what it previously had been out there. Half of that probably is HS continuing to be lower than we projected, and the other half is basically Cerner professional services and some of those Q3 elements rolling into Q4. So that's the primary difference you're going to see relative to the Q4 number.","On the cash flow side, I think in Q4 we would expect \u2013 we have some larger cash CapEx items related to buildings that will hit us in Q4. So we would expect to end the year at about $475 million \u2013 $470 million of total CapEx including software CapEx. Next year there probably will be a little bit of an uptick on that as we finish out our Trails building. One of the key things in 2015 is we are purchasing our Lee's Summit data center building. We currently lease that. And given all of the data center activity that we have there, we want to own our future there. We don't want to be subject to the vagaries of a landlord, which has been a very good landlord to us, but we want to own that facility.","So I think we've got \u2013 as you look at this year, we end up with about $405 million of CapEx, about $275 million of software CapEx, and those probably increment up a little bit as we go into 2016.","Steven P. Halper - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","So just to clarify, the building purchase for the lease on the data center, is that going to be 2015?","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","That will be Q4. That will be this quarter, Q4 of 2015.","Steven P. Halper - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","So all-in CapEx and your capitalized software is $475 million this year?","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","All in, it would be $675 million.","Steven P. Halper - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","$675 million, okay.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Yes, so about $400 million of CapEx and $275 million of software CapEx.","Steven P. Halper - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Got it. And then a little uptick from that next year?","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Correct.","Steven P. Halper - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Great, thank you.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Certainly, Steve.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","With that, I'd like to close. I'd like to maybe just step back a little bit to provide a little perspective. We certainly understand our accountability to deliver against all our metrics. But Zane's commentary around our bookings and our current position in the marketplace gives us confidence regarding our success in that marketplace. We've been at this a very long time, and one thing we've always been driven by is delivering on the bigger vision. We're focused on long-term value, but also have been pretty good about delivering against nearer-term expectations.","I think we're incredibly well-positioned to become a large company. It's not going to be a really perfectly straight path. But where we're situated between healthcare and IT I think gives us a lot of opportunities. We're investing $700 million a year in R&D to address those opportunities. And I think that level of investment, especially when you look at it in the context of other people trying to buy things that they're going to put together, is impressive and will generate a long-term benefit and an advantage for us.","Many of you had a chance to attend our Healthcare Conference, where we had 14,000 attendees focused on solving major issues in healthcare. It's hard to come out of that conference not being energized with a belief that we are on the right track. We're actually now just getting to some of the fun stuff with the base level of digitization in healthcare, using data, predictive analytics. We think this can have a real disruptive impact on quality and outcomes and payment models, and we expect to be right in the middle of that disruption. What we do is hard and is complex, but we think we're well-positioned, and certainly I wouldn't trade our position for anybody else's.","Thanks for listening and have a good evening.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program, and you may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day."],"4836":["Cerner (NASDAQ:CERN) Q3 2012 Earnings Call October 25, 2012  4:30 PM ET","Executives","Marc G.

Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the call. I'll lead off today with a review of the numbers. Zane Burke, Executive Vice President of our Client Organization, will follow me with sales highlights and marketplace trends. Mike Nill, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, will discuss operations and provide an update on our corporate imperatives. Jeff Townsend, Executive Vice President and Chief of Staff, will follow Mike and discuss strategic initiatives. Neal Patterson, our Chairman, CEO and President, will be available during Q&A.","Now we'll turn to our results. We delivered excellent results in the quarter, and we continue to have a very positive outlook. Bookings, revenue and EPS exceeded our guidance range, and we again delivered very strong cash flow.","Moving to the details. Our total bookings revenue in Q3 was $770 million, which is a record for a third quarter. This reflects 18% growth over our very strong results in Q3 of '11, when bookings grew 31%. Bookings margin in Q3 was $671 million or 87% of total bookings. Our bookings performance drove a 20% increase in total backlog to $6.79 billion. Contract revenue backlog of $6.06 billion is 22% higher than a year ago. Support revenue backlog totaled $724 million, up 5% year-over-year.","Revenue in the quarter was a record $676 million, which is up 18% over Q3 of '11. The revenue composition for Q3 was $230 million system sales, $154 million support and maintenance, $278 million in services and $14 million in reimbursed travel.","System sales revenue reflects 22% growth from Q3 '11. This was driven by record Q3 license sales, as well as continued strong growth in device resale, traditional hardware resale and subscriptions.","Moving to services. Total services revenue was up 19% compared to Q3 '11, with strong growth in both managed services and professional services. Support and maintenance revenue increased 11% over Q3 of '11.","Looking at revenue by geographic segment. Both domestic and global revenue increased 18% year-over-year, with domestic growing to $591 million and global coming in at $85 million.","Moving to gross margin. Our gross margin for Q3 was 77.9%, which is up from 76.9% in Q2 and down slightly from 78.9% in Q3 of '11. The sequential increase in gross margin was driven by stronger software and the year-over-year decline was driven by slightly higher third-party maintenance costs.","Looking at operating spending. Our third-party operating expenses were -- our third quarter operating expenses, pardon me, were $369 million before share-based compensation expense of $10 million. This is a year-over-year increase of 14%, which is well below the growth of our revenue and gross margin, and reflects ongoing operating leverage.","Sales and client service expenses increased 17% compared to Q3 '11, driven by an increase in revenue-generating associates in our Services businesses. Our investment in software development was up 7% compared to the year-ago period. As we have discussed, we have been hiring in our R&D organization this year and expect our R&D investments to continue growing, but the growth will still be moderate compared to expected revenue growth.","G&A expense increased 8% compared to Q3 of '11.","Moving to operating margins. Our operating margin in Q3 was 23.3% before share-based compensation expense and was up 90 basis points compared to Q3 of '11, which is just below our targeted range due to continued high levels of tech resale revenue and slightly higher spending in the quarter. However, we still generated earnings upside as this level of margin expansion, combined with our higher than expected revenue, still drove operating earnings growth of 23%.","Moving to net earnings and EPS. Our GAAP net earnings in Q3 were $99 million, or $0.56 per diluted share. GAAP net earnings include share-based compensation expense, which had a net impact on earnings of $6 million or $0.04 per diluted share. Adjusted net earnings were $105 million, and EPS was $0.60, which is up 25% compared to Q3 of '11. The tax rate for adjusted net earnings was 34.8%, which is within our expected effective tax rate range of 34% to 35%.","Now moving to our balance sheet. We ended Q3 with $1.5 billion of total cash and investments, up from $1.39 billion in Q2. Total cash and investments include $1.04 billion of cash and short-term investments and $463 million of highly rated corporate and government bonds, with maturities over one year. Our total debt, including capital lease obligations, is $197 million.","Total receivables ended the quarter at 55 hundred and $42 million [ph], which is up $50 million from Q2. Contracts receivable for the unbilled portion of receivables were $86 million, and represent 16% of total receivables. Cash collections were $662 million. Our DSO in Q3 was 73 days, which is down from 87 days in Q3 of '11.","Operating cash flow for the quarter was $182 million. Q3 capital expenditures were $52 million, and capitalized software was $26 million. Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow, less capital expenditures and capitalized software, was $105 million.","Going forward, we expect quarterly capital expenditures to remain in the $45 million to $60 million range, driven by the ongoing construction at our new Kansas City, Kansas, campus. As we demonstrated this quarter, we can still generate strong free cash flow even though -- during this period of elevated capital spending.","Moving to capitalized software. The $26 million of capitalized software in Q3 represents 31% of the $83 million of total investment in development activities. Software amortization for the quarter was $21 million, resulting in net capitalization of $5 million or 6% of our total R&D investment.","Now I'll go through Q4 and full year guidance. For Q4, we expect revenue between $670 million and $700 million, with the midpoint reflecting growth of 11% over Q4 of '11. This equates to full year revenue between $2.63 and $2 -- I'm sorry, $2.63 billion and $2.66 billion, with the midpoint reflecting 20% growth. This is up from our previous range of $2.575 billion and $2.625 billion.","We expect Q4 adjusted EPS before share-based compensation expense to be $0.62 to $0.64 per share, with the midpoint reflecting 15% growth over Q4 of '11. This equates to full year adjusted EPS between $2.34 and $2.36, with the midpoint reflecting 26% growth. This is up from our previous range of $2.32 and $2.36.","Q4 guidance is based on total spending before share-based compensation expense of approximately $375 million to $385 million. Our estimate for the impact of share-based compensation expense is approximately $0.04 in Q4, and $0.13 to $0.14 for the full year.","Moving to bookings guidance. We expect bookings revenue in Q4 of $925 million to $975 million, reflecting solid growth over our record Q4 '11 bookings of $899 million, which were up 44% over Q4 of 2010.","I would also like to provide our initial thoughts on 2013. The initial version of our 2013 plan supports current 2013 consensus estimates for revenue and adjusted earnings per share. As always, we will continue to update our outlook on future earnings calls.","In closing, we are pleased with our strong results in Q3 with all key metrics above our expected ranges, including strong bookings, revenue, earnings and cash flow and strong margin expansion. With that, I'll turn the call over to Zane.","Zane M. Burke","Thanks, Marc. Good afternoon, everyone. Today I'm going to provide sales highlights and discuss marketplace trends. Starting with our results. Our bookings revenue in Q3 of $770 million reflects 18% growth over last year's bookings and is all time high for a third quarter. Bookings included 21 contracts over $5 million, 9 of which were over $10 million. Noteworthy areas of strength included licensed software, professional services, Managed Services, device resale, revenue cycle, physician practices and community hospitals. In the hospital market, we continue to see strong levels of purchasing in our install base, as our clients purchase additional solutions for Stages 2 and 3 of Meaningful Use, and prepare for Value-Based Purchasing ACOs and other shifts in the industry that will require additional IT investments.","We also continue to sell strong levels of services to our installed base, which was very evident this quarter in the ITWorks and revenues RevWorks successes that Mike will discuss. Outside of our install base, we continue to operate in an environment with multiple install bases actively considering alternatives, and we're in -- in strong competitive position in these opportunities. Evidence of our competitiveness is that 31% of our record Q3 bookings came from outside our core Millennium installed base. A highlight this quarter was a new relationship with a major investor-owned health system that will be implementing Cerner Solutions in 19 of their hospitals, displacing 2 different competitors in the process. We are very excited about this new relationship, which we believe could grow significantly in the coming years.","We also had a major Catholic health system choose to expand their use of Cerner to 9 -- by 9 hospitals, for which they had previously chosen another supplier.","As I indicated last quarter, our pipeline for additional new footprints is very strong, as we see a growing number of hospitals reconsidering their supplier, as they face the rising bar for Stage 2 and Stage 3 of Meaningful Use and additional requirements for Value-Based Purchasing, ACOs and data analytics capabilities. We believe Cerner is the only company with the comprehensive and scalable platform that will position our clients for success, as the industry transitions from a fee-for-service model, revolving around treating people when they get sick, to a pro-active model that keeps people well. We believe our primary competitors' narrow focus on simply being an EHR product company will become a problem for both them and their clients, as they realize their antiquated platform will not be sufficient in the evolving health care landscape.","In addition to our investments in areas we believe will be necessary to support the future healthcare environment, we've also continued to invest heavily in the areas that still drive many of today's decisions. As an example, we believe we are leapfrogging our competition with Millenium+ and PowerChart Touch by providing a physician experience that is superior to any other system, and also fits into our broader analytics and population health strategy. These improvements are already contributing to an improved win rate in the hospital market. We also continue to have strong success in the ambulatory market, where we are benefiting from our improved solutions and the marketplace's desire to have an integrated inpatient and outpatient solution. As I indicated, this desire for integration is not limited to hospital and physician office integration. With reimbursement increasingly tied to quality and outcomes and more care shifting to different settings, the ability to coordinate care across multiple venues is becoming critical. Cerner's ability to provide solutions for physician offices, ambulatory surgery centers, behavioral health, urgent care, home health, occupational health, rehab hospitals, skilled nursing and long-term care facilities as well as many other venues is another competitive advantage in this environment.","One additional trend I'd like to discuss is that consolidation is occurring in the hospital market. Given our strong market share and strong relationship with IDNs that are frequently the acquirers, we believe this is a potential positive trend for Cerner. In the past 18 months, Cerner clients have acquired more than 75 hospitals, with the majority of these representing net new opportunities to extend our client base.","Outside of the U.S., we had a very good quarter with solid results in most regions and particularly strong results in Canada, Australia and the Middle East. In the Middle East, we signed a contract to provide solutions and services to a 1,200 bed private hospital in Saudi, which we believe contributes to our strong position in the region and helps our chances to participate in a large opportunity for the country's public hospitals. We were also selected for new business in Australia, England and Ireland during the quarter.","Before handing the call over to Mike, I'd like to make a couple of comments about the 2012 Cerner Health Conference, which was held in Kansas City earlier this month. This conference was a huge success, with more than 10,000 attendees, including global attendance that was up 34% from last year and included attendees from 21 countries. Our theme, because it's personal, struck a chord with attendees and included our clients and associates sharing stories of why healthcare is personal to them, not only in the job they do, but also as individuals who interact with the healthcare system. I came away from the conference with increased conviction that we are focused on the right things for the right reasons. The conference also reinforced my view that we still have significant room for growth, both with our existing clients and through an increasing number of new client opportunities. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike.","Michael R. Nill","Thanks, Zane. Good afternoon, everyone. Today I'm going to do success ITWorks and revenue cycle and provide an update on our physician experience imperative. I'll start with ITWorks. In Q3 we signed our third quarter -- our third client of the year, bringing the number of clients signed since launching ITWorks in late 2009 to 12. Our new ITWorks client has worked with Cerner since 1997, and believe that an ITWorks alignment would further align its strategic goals of transforming health information in its region, enhancing clinical processes and positioning the health system for future growth and advancement. The broader point, which we have made before, is that ITWorks is much more than traditional outsourcing. Aligning IT resources and using our scale and expertise to improve and accelerate IT outcomes at our clients is important, but it is only part of how we align with them. The level at which we align is captured in the ways of transformation model we recently created with the leadership of our ITWorks clients. This model starts with technology as a foundation for greater levels of transformation in the areas including patient experience, physician experience, clinical and financial operations, quality, safety and, ultimately, population health management. These continue to represent major categories that impact the industry, and our clients are leveraging ITWorks as part of their strategy to be successful in this period of rapid industry change.","As I've discussed in the past, the tight alignment we have with our ITWorks clients often leads these clients to rapidly adopt additional Cerner Solutions and Services. A good example of this occurred in Q3 when one of our ITWorks clients also became a RevWorks client. The client established an ITWorks agreement in 2011, and their high satisfaction with that relationship contributed to the decision to align with Cerner to manage their day-to-day revenue cycle, operational and administrative functions. Another important consideration in their decision is that they believe we help position them to achieve their organizational mission of managing the health of their community. This marks the fifth RevWorks acute services client and our second combined ITWorks and RevWorks client.","In addition to another RevWorks client, we also had a strong revenue cycle sales quarter, adding several new clients. Operationally, we passed a milestone by bringing our 100th hospital live on patient accounting during the quarter. We also have more than 430 clinics live. As I mentioned last quarter, we've been working closely with some of our largest clients to advance our solutions. This has resulted in functionality, in clinical, financial integration that is unmatched in the industry.","With the rollout of our revenue cycle solutions progressing nicely in our larger clients, we believe we are establishing proof points that will lead to an acceleration of revenue cycle adoption in our client base and strong differentiation when competing for new business.","It is becoming increasingly clear that an integrated approach is needed to succeed as the industry begins to shift to a value-based -- to a value and quality-based model that will require tighter integration between clinical and revenue cycle systems.","Next I'd like to provide an update on our physician experience imperative. As most of you know, we had a big push this year toward enhancing the physician experience, and we've made significant progress. We brought PowerChart Touch, our native iPad app, live at a client site for the first time in August, and we now have 13 early adopter clients. The feedback has been great, and the solution's ease-of-use and the amazing speed at which it runs has been substantial. The speed is enabled by our design approach and by Millenium+, the cloud platform on which we are deploying PowerChart Touch. As we discussed, Millenium+ is also an important component of our population health strategy, as it enables broader interoperability across all EHRs and provides connectivity to our Healthe Intent population health management platform. I'm pleased that we've accomplished -- I'm pleased with what we have accomplished with PowerChart Touch. In less than one year, we went from a mere concept to a production application. While we view this as just the first milestone in a long journey for PowerChart Touch and other future mobile applications, it proves our ability to bring a concept to a reality that can radically alter and improve the user interactions within -- with Millennium. This project also demonstrates a new method for designing and building applications with the end in mind. All design development systems management and support teams were involved in the project at the outset to ensure that we not only created a great user interface, but one that performed well and delivered the levels of stability that our clients expect. In short, I believe we are demonstrating the agility of a small, entrepreneurial company we still are, at our core, while leveraging the scale and resources of the large organization that we have become.","I'd also like to point out that our focus on the physician experience goes well beyond the iPad. We continue to roll out improved workflows and a new look and feel across our solutions and the response has been extremely positive. We are also taking a comprehensive approach to maximizing physician productivity through optimal design, configuration content and training across all venues. We have rolled out best practice standards for our preferences and privileges that are derived from the accumulated experience of implementing our solutions and CPOE across our client base. In many cases, this approach allows us to reduce what took hundreds of configuration decisions now down to about 10. This, too, is having a very positive impact on our physician experience.","In summary, I'm very pleased with our progress we have made on improving the physician experience and I believe we are on a clear path to leapfrog our competition. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeffrey A. Townsend","Thanks, Mike. Today I wanted to recap some innovations that were highlighted during the Cerner Health Conference, the evolution of our Healthe Intent platform, our population health initiatives, which both Zane and Mike highlighted. Our health conference creates an opportunity for us to sync with our clients on both future and current state activities at a significant scale. This year was highlighted by more than 500 client-lead interactions as they shared and showcased their progress over the last 12 months. The solution gallery was our largest to date, providing an opportunity for more than 250 solutions and services to be showcased. As many of our client organizations have either completed Stage 1 of Meaningful Use or are approaching that milestone, they are now positioned for a wave of next new capabilities that position them to improve safety, reduce cost and improve outcomes.","As an example, Care Connect was introduced during the conference. Initially introduced on the iPhone, this is a comprehensive communication and care delivery solution that integrates voice, messaging and care delivery capabilities, such as medical device association, clinical alerts and medication administration into a single application workflow. For the first time, clinical collaboration is possible through traditional communication technologies, with the EMR and medical devices all synchronized into a single, embedded on the go mobile experience. As Mike outlined, the revenue cycle suite is continuing to gain traction across our client base and was another heavy traffic area during the conference. Over the last 18 months, an additional 24 solutions have become GA within the revenue cycle suite. The continued progression of revenue cycle upstream into the clinical workflow and physician documentation areas is creating greater opportunities within the existing clinical experiences, as well as driving more and more innovations to begin the roadmap of replacement with their existing platforms as they approach the ICD-10 transition in 2014. As new models continue to emerge in both quality incentives and population management, the ability to navigate the continuum of revenue cycle demands is becoming increasingly important to our clients. Our client base will have at risk more than $5 billion of annual revenue in the coming years tied to Value-Based Purchasing, Medicare 30-day readmission rules, quality reporting requirements alone. As a result, Cerner's alignment with our clients to help them mitigate these risks and succeed in the evolving health care landscape will create a significant financial opportunity for Cerner.","Moving onto our Healthe Intent platform. Chart Search has now hit a tipping point across our client base, and we expect accelerated adoptions as clients complete their checklist of mandates. Over 50% of our U.S. client base is now utilizing this solution, as we are approaching 1 petabyte of index clinical information. Much like the speed of deployment around Millenium+ and PowerChart Touch that Mike shared, we are seeing a similar pattern emerge through our Healthe Intent cloud-centric solutions. While Cerner has offered a sepsis alerting package within our Lighthouse practice for several years, the adoption and use of our cloud-based algorithm is more than twice the adoption of the prior solution in half the time since general availability. In addition, the ability for the platform to support an agent-based learning environment has allowed for the algorithm to evolve on a 30-day lifecycle, followed by rapid adoption within days versus months. We are seeing the platform validation and distribution model change the paradigm for speed to value.","We shared our population health relationship with Advocate in the past. Early progress from these efforts was another highlight of our health conference. Joint development of more sophisticated predictive models has been an initial focus of this partnership. While we're only a few months into the partnership, the combination of Advocate and Cerner Math teams has created an initial predictive agent for readmissions, which was shared during the conference. It has demonstrated a 20% to 30% improvement in predictive powers compared to the majority of existing evidence-based models in use today, and we're confident it can be improved. We continue to see significant potential from working with one of the more advanced population health organizations in the country.","More specific to population health, there is a pattern from a couple of decades back that is now repeating. There is a growing number of niche, best-of-breed solutions emerging much as they did in the '80s and '90s around clinical solutions. In the end, architecture and integration won out. We believe we are similarly positioned for success in population health as the rest of this decade plays out, while others repeat history with the spare piece parts.","We have outlined the foundational elements of population health in the past in a more granular level, somewhat as clues to the larger strategy that is now playing out. From data liquidity through the Cerner Network interoperability in HIE offerings, to our Lighthouse enterprise data warehousing and quality solutions, as well as our patient portal platform and PHR Solutions which offers a range of device and provider connectivity offerings, as well as wellness options. While we expect the foundational portfolio to continue to evolve, these have become real businesses, with total revenue in excess of $150 million. Supporting these solutions is Healthe Intent, which is our cloud-based architectural platform for population health. At our Health Conference, Neal shared our vision for how we would continue to advance our capabilities in this area, providing a glimpse under the hood. Fundamental to the design of this platform is an evolving operating system, specifically designed to identify the person, predict where interventions will be effective, attribute the individual to accountable providers and guide them to take appropriate action. During the keynote address, we outlined the clinical programming language we called Synapse. This is a purpose built clinical programming language that creates agents within the Healthe Intent operating system to trigger and coordinate health care programs across the population. Very much like the clinical definition, the language supports the recognition and signaling of an event, then coordinates that action across the platform based on localized requirements. We think this is a fundamental differentiator as the level of sophistication to manage the health of a population ultimately requires both personalization to the individual, and localization to the provider network within the community. This must be much more than a set of workflow applications with independent data sets and configuration options. The ability to create these sophisticated commands in a natural language familiar to clinicians, will create an ecosystem of rapid discovery and innovation beyond the 4 walls of Cerner. While this description oversimplifies the complexity of healthcare as it plays out at a ZIP code level, we believe we are the only company positioned to comprehensively facilitate population health. Over the next year, we will bring more Synapse agents to life, leveraging the platform we have evolved over the last 3 years.","With that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Michael Cherny from ISI.","Michael Cherny - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","So just thinking ahead a little bit on the outlook, and obviously with the 4Q bookings number, very impressive number, especially given the growth you'd put up last year. I want to get a sense if you can, about the expectations for any of the larger deals, particularly the works types deals in the fourth quarter. As you get more comfortable with these deals, as you get greater clarity about what it takes to get clients signed up for them, is it giving you a higher degree of visibility in terms of being able to guide to these deals? And is there any kind of clarity you can give around any potential contribution in the fourth quarter of any deals you can be expecting?","Marc G. Naughton","Mike, this is Marc. I think the -- we've been indicating that clearly for -- so far for this year, we've been consistent with having an ITWorks deal every quarter. I think we're able to predict those, at least relative to our normal forecast process where we review all the deals, lay out where we think they're going to happen. So it kind of varies between -- if there's one that we think is on track for Q4, we would -- it would be part of our guidance. If there isn't one that's on track for Q4, it wouldn't be part of our guidance. I think you've seen us be fairly consistent with those long-term bookings to be kind of around the 30% level, a little over, maybe a little bit under. So I think it's pretty fair to say that, that feels like that's going to be a fairly consistent number, that you are going to see us in the upper 20s to low 30s of that number, relative to the total bookings. And I think the -- we are getting a little bit of an ability to forecast those at a higher degree of certainty, and a little bit less risk in our forecast process. But -- so each quarter is going to be a little bit different, the types of deals, but I think, overall, with our mix of long-term opportunities in any one quarter, you can kind of still see us generating that type of percentage on a quarterly basis.","Michael Cherny - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Great. And then just quickly on the large, for profit public company you guys referenced. Obviously, it seems like that customer had a fairly recent go-live with one of the solutions you're displacing. Can you talk a little bit about -- if you can, any clarity as to how you guys were able to wedge your way in there? What that means, going forward, and I know you talked about a few other systems that are looking now for replacement. How quickly you expect this replacement marks [ph] to develop with Stage 2 on the horizon, about 15 months from now?","Zane M. Burke","This is Zane. As it relates to this particular investor-owned organization, we've been working it for about the past 2 years, and having dialogue is -- and they had an awareness of, maybe some of the shortcomings that were in some of our competitors solutions. And then some of the success that we've had in the investor-owned segment. And so, really, the combination of our success in the investor-owned marketplace and in fact, delivering on predictable timelines on particular budgets and creating a framework by which you can use your scale in a different way, which is what the premise behind these large-scale organizations, really drove home what they needed to do there. So my expectation is, we'll continue to see opportunities, both in the investor-owned segments as well as other segments as people look at our competitors and where they are, relative to being able to meet the mandates that are coming up.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of George Hill of Citigroup.","George Hill - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Marc, I guess just a question on the bookings guidance, following up on Michael's question is, I guess, do we know what the composition of the Q4 bookings will look like? Or I guess, can you give us directionally, because I would've expected the revenue guidance to be a little higher, given the bookings strength in the quarter? So is there anything that's changing in the composition in the booking mix? Or is there anything you know now about the bookings mix that's putting the revenue guidance kind of where it is?","Marc G. Naughton","No. There's nothing in particular in the bookings guidance. I think the -- for this quarter, obviously, we had a strong software quarter. So it drove out a higher level of revenue, relative to the bookings performance. But I think Q4 feels pretty normal. Once again, still looking for a percent somewhere around 30% of the bookings to be from a -- long-term in nature. And there's still going to be a chunk of that, that's going to be hardware-related, but that's kind of now equalized on a quarter-over-quarter basis. So I don't think there's anything unique, George, that's -- that I point to relative to the -- to looking at the revenues coming out of that. Keep in mind, you're getting a lot of us -- revenue, a lot of our revenue is coming from the backlog, and a lot of the bookings is driving into some of the backlog, even the stuff that isn't the 30% long-term can still have a 3- or 4-year element of some of the service components. So I think it's -- there's not going to be necessarily a complete, direct correlation between the bookings number and the revenue number. But it's -- there's nothing unique about it.","George Hill - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","All right, I appreciate that color. And also a question for the Mikes. On the displacement opportunity, I guess just how quickly are we starting to see the market turn? I feel like, historically, whether it's been Meaningful Use or CPOE or care based drift cycle, whatever the industry trend was, market churn really never ticked up much above 5%. Do we feel like we're seeing an acceleration? And I guess, how do we expect that to play out into '12 through '13, and maybe first part of '14?","Zane M. Burke","George, this is Zane. I would say that we are seeing a bit of an acceleration in the displacement market, and I think that's evidenced by some of our -- the things that I discussed in my script. And I think that's indicative -- that, those comments are indicative what's going on, broadly. And I actually believe, again, that this is a long-term view, that this is a 5- to 7-year marketplace, as you look at it. I think that many organizations will look at who they're -- with the horse that they bet on, and make a decision to go a different direction. And I think it will occur over that 5 to 7 year time period. I don't think -- I think we'll actually -- you'll see some -- there's obviously a natural curve to some of those things, but I think we're on the very beginning of that curve.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Halper of Lazard Capital Markets.","Steven P. Halper - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Just looking at the operating margin before stock comp, it was up 90 basis points. And a touch below that target understanding the high level of tech resale that's been happening in the quarter. But when you look at the consensus numbers for 2013, and you support those numbers, is it safe to assume that you'll -- you get back to that goal of 100 to 150 basis points? Or is the composition of the model changing such that, that goal might be too high now, even though the absolute operating profit might be where you want it to be?","Marc G. Naughton","Steve, I think when we've look at operating margin percentage, we've always, again it provided obviously all the way from down -- 9% on up, trying to provide a path to let people know what we're going to grow there. That's always been conditioned a little bit on what we saw this top line growth. And I think this year, certainly, we're seeing top line growing at a rate that is faster than we envisioned when we first -- when we started the year, which is a good thing, because we have a tendency to be able to capture that growth and then grow margins on that higher revenue number. So based on the current consensus estimates, clearly they're looking to have some place between 100 and 200 increase in operating margins. Unless there is a significant adjustment in what our current plan is, that would be our continued expectation. I think we're looking to continue to see opportunities to grow software sales, these deals that are longer-term, that have a negative or certainly a breakeven impact in the early part of those deals, are now getting some time on them that increases naturally, the profitability of those deals as we [indiscernible] more, so I think all I think those are all good points. We're also planning on investing heavily in R&D. And as we did that this year, we increased our R&D spend significantly. We're going to continue to do that in 2013, because the amount of things we have in front of us as opportunities, that we can deliver by developing and innovating, is as great as I think we've ever seen. And I think we're going to continue to make those investments as we appropriately can. But I think, today, there's -- I don't, would not say that there is anything that's going to be different from what you guys have in your models, which is going to be over 100 basis points to 200 basis points increase in margin. Obviously, we're going to land our '13 plan as we finish out the year, and get all of our initiatives lined up, and we'll provide true guidance on our Q4 call. But until that time, we're comfortable with what consensus is.","Steven P. Halper - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Right. And then, just one other quick question on 2013, if I may. In terms of free cash flow, on the margin, do you expect free cash flow to be -- to grow in '13 versus '12?","Marc G. Naughton","Our expectation would be to see it grow. Obviously, in '13, we'll have a full year of investing in our new Kansas campus. You're -- I think you're aware -- investors are aware, we're building one tower. We're going to start building the second tower immediately. So we're going to continue to have that capital outflow. But I think our cash flow performance, certainly to date would indicate that we'd be able to grow year-over-year free cash flow.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser from Morgan Stanley.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I had a question on the value of the contracts. Just looking at some of the data points, it seems that, the total number of contracts year-to-date is about in line with last year, maybe even a tad lower, but the dollar value associated with it obviously is greater. So can you just give us a little more color on the scope of the contracts that you're seeing and your expectation for that trend to continue or not?","Marc G. Naughton","Ricky, this is Marc. I think every quarter, obviously, is a little bit of a unique microcosm of the deals that are available. If you look back in Q3 of '11, I think we probably had 25 contracts that were over $5 million and 16 that were over $10 million. This quarter we're $21 million -- or 21 contracts over $5 million, and $9 million over 10. So clearly, with the enhanced bookings, that would imply that the ones that were over $10 million were stronger over $10 million than the 16 in the other. I think you've got, certainly this quarter we had 3 large deals that were over $60 million. And that would include the RevWorks, the ITWorks and another large client deal. So I think the mix is going to change, relative to kind of forecasting forward. I think we're going to continue to see a mix of RevWorks and ITWorks deals coming in that we'll have the over $10 million number, be, at little bit higher, but it going to -- it will depend a lot on the quarter. We are selling a lot of things to a lot of people. And I think that broad support in the marketplace is allowing us, the growth of bookings, isn't just the bigger contracts kind of getting bigger. It's a broad support across a variety of contracts that's allowing us to deliver these enhanced bookings. So this just kind of quarter-over-quarter, I provide a little bit of view into that. But it'll vary each quarter, and we continue to look at our client base and new opportunities as providing the leverage on a quarterly basis.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And obviously, the trend of cross-selling opportunities between hospital and ambulatory is an important one, and I know we talked about strong growth on the ambulatory side. Can you quantify it for us, how fast is ambulatory growing in the quarter?","Marc G. Naughton","We have -- for us, ambulatory is still a fairly small part of our overall business. The percentage trends for a lot of that business is growing 50% year-over-year. I think it's continuing to grow. It's not quite growing at that level, but it continues to grow. And a lot of that growth is thriving because of the desire of clients and physicians to be on the same system. And so a lot of our clients are looking to standardize on a single platform. That's where we're getting -- our footprint inside the acute-care facility, acute-care health system is, what's driving a lot of our ambulatory business. And I think it's important to see that as a differentiation from others in the industry, who don't have that footprint inside the acute-care industry and who are trying to either get it in there or just trying to sell on the ambulatory side. We're continually seeing a standard, centralized platform for both ambulatory and inpatient being what's driving the market, and that's what's driving our success. Obviously, as we continue to get bigger, the growth rates don't continue to grow as much. But we're very happy with where that business is, keeping in mind it still is, today, a small part of our total revenue.","Operator","Your next question comes from Charles Rhyee of Cowen and Company.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Maybe a question for Jeff here. You're talking about the Healthe Intent platform and then obviously the big focus at the user meeting a few weeks back here. And you talked about what you're doing with Advocate. Can you talk about, sort of where we are in this segment of the market? You -- definitely a lot of small players coming up with sort of technology solutions, but it seems that the way you guys are approaching it is not only from technology, but really also engaging employers as well as, and patients as well the members. And can you talk about how that all needs to come together to really drive, I guess, true population health and where are we at in sort of this adoption curve, and how long do you think it takes for it to really sort of take off here? And then lastly, if there's a change in the administration, with the elections, and you start potentially seeing some type of rollback with the health reform, how do you think that kind of either stalls or maybe changes the pace of some of this?","Marc G. Naughton","Help me if I forget one of those, A, B, C, and Ds. But -- so at the macro level, and I think some of you have visited and seen it. We've been running our own health plan since the middle of the decade. And have not only ran our own plan, but put up clinics and used our population as something to experiment with. And that has been a big driver for us, as we've stepped back and said holistically what does the platform really have to do to manage the health of a population. What impact does it have on revenue cycle and new reimbursement models and then, more broadly, how great it is all that have to be. So that's been a big guide for us as we've designed the systems. At the adoption curve level, and we've mentioned that a few times, they are on the front end of the market as far as taking risk and seeing significant shifts in their business model of how they are being reimbursed. I think the rest of the market, still either has experimentation or is beginning to kind of stick their toe in the water in these spaces. So what you're seeing play out, and you kind of mentioned it, is a lot of niche players to do one very small piece for one very specific scenario, whether that's quality reporting or its maybe a pilot ACO with a small number of lives. So we think that trend is going to continue, but in pretty short order here, and I'd say somewhat as we lead into the 2014 window, with the uncertainty of whether the current health plan model proceeds or not, you're going to continue to see at a CMS level, kind of independent of Obama care and who's in place, there is a demand to drive cost down. And pretty much the consensus thinking is you have to move from a care model to a health model. And at the end of the day, you've got to drive demand down and drive down the cost per unit of what it takes to deliver those demands. So we don't see anything on the horizon that's going to slow the economic trends all the way from the pressure on deficits, to the total cost of healthcare. All of these things are kind of set up, independent of whatever the next thing is that gets passed, or who's elected here in 2 weeks. But I think on the short-term, if you're looking for kind of where is the fuse is going to get lit, I think you're going to continue to see a lot of niche experimentation out there. And we, frequently will hear from our clients, as \"I just need is as a placeholder to get me this through this next short window in time. I know there's a bigger, broader strategy that I need to develop.\" So my long answer to that, I'd say in the next 12 to 24 months, you're going to see more and more movement from a small percent of the marketplace experimenting with population health to the majority of the marketplace having some level of risk inside their revenue mix.","Operator","Your next question comes from Glen Santangelo from Credit Suisse.","Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I just had 2 quick questions if I could. I wanted to sort of follow-up, Zane, on an earlier question regarding the shift in market share, I think in your prepared remarks, you talked about a number of potential customers are reconsidering their supplier, and it seems like the company has put a significant amount of focus on data analytics and population health and I'm kind of curious as what's sort of driving the market share shift? Do you think it's really some greater transparency around Stage 2 guidelines? Or you think it's clients are really starting to look down that 5- to 7-year road that you kind of discussed and we're at that tipping point where they're really going to have to decide to make a dramatic shift, if that's the case? I mean, what do you think is creating an acceleration potentially in that market share shift?","Zane M. Burke","Glen, I think it's actually both. So I mean some of that is the -- get to Stage 2 and looking at Stage 3. But ultimately, if you're going to make it that kind of selection, I think there are -- it's really about the additional mandates that are coming at or the client base over time. And so things like the value-based payments, the 30-day readmission elements. None of our competitors are ready to handle that, today. And so we are -- we're in uniquely in that situation, and there it just becomes more and more mandates that are coming at that our clients, and are going to continue to come at them over time. And so it's really a combination of those things. And I think we're going to see that continue, that I think we are very much on the front side of that trend.","Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And just to think about the longer opportunity here for a second, we really didn't talk a lot about HIEs here. How do you think about the information exchange marketplace? And how do you view that opportunity for Cerner, like, particularly relative to some of your competitors that maybe could have issues, as far as that's concerned?","Zane M. Burke","Well we probably have 2 sets of bets playing out simultaneously here. On the HIE side, we are a big interoperability advocate. And around some of the things being driven out of DC, like the Direct Project, Cerner contributed the majority of the open-source code for that project. So inside kind of our core business offering, we are proponents of getting the -- what we call it, liquefying the data. So getting the data moving is key to kind of the next stage of improvement around population health. Our other bet in parallel, and we've signaled some of this with technologies like Search and then some of the things we've done around sepsis is, we've invested in technologies that we think can accelerate beyond the standards, so we don't have to wait. So being able to take things like textual documentation, parse that, find the clinical meaning and then put it into a structured form will get us past or through some of the delays you see, I'll call them, orphan systems out there that aren't going to be able to keep up with Meaningful Use Stage 2 and Stage 3. We don't think that data needs to stay as an island. But I think you will continue to see at the pure HIE level, you'll continue to see a fair amount of experimentation and probably multiple networks in some of the communities or states. As they -- as some will find that they didn't discover a business model to drive it, and others you'll find multiple private networks in a given community.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Greg Bolan from Sterne Agee.","Gregory T. Bolan - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Can you maybe talk about, actually progress with IDN clients that are consolidating solely with Cerner products and services across the organization?","Zane M. Burke","Sure, this is Zane. So what you're -- what we're seeing is it is -- obviously our clients are well-positioned to be the acquirers. In fact, our -- in the last 18 months, our clients have acquired more share than any other clients, any competitor have acquired in that space. So nearly half of the hospitals are up -- were acquired by Cerner clients. Now that being said, not all -- that doesn't -- guess we moved to a Cerner platform. It really just provides a good opportunity for us to come back in and use that as a selling opportunity that as they look to leverage their scale, to drive down costs within their organizations and create better efficiencies across the IDNs. And so we work with our clients in that way. And we have the proof in the large systems of how to run these very large programs in a way which you can predict the costs, get the outcomes that we're looking for, and really set them up to become systems of the future. And that's what we're doing with these large IDN clients.","Gregory T. Bolan - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","And this last one, this -- if you could, maybe characterize the audition process for the investor-owned hospital that you had mentioned earlier and maybe your thoughts around the ability to penetrate more of these hospitals, because it looks like you're at around 15% penetration now for this system?","Zane M. Burke","Obviously, there's the opportunity to do -- if we do good work, it tends to get other work. And that's been our experience in the investor-owned, that the -- that -- those organizations tend to be a prove-it model, so that they don't go all in upfront, but they look for, kind of a pilot phase, and with success, it will get other success.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jamie Stockton of Wells Fargo.","Jamie Stockton - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I guess maybe, Zane, just following up on one of Greg's questions. Is there a number you can put around the facilities that are maybe within existing client footprints that are not Cerner shops today, and I don't really mean like the Kaisers of the world, but more like Catholic Health West, where there are facilities that are maybe with another vendor and you have a decent shot at getting those?","Zane M. Burke","We do actually quantify that data...","Marc G. Naughton","We can put a number to that, Jamie, yes, is that your question?","Jamie Stockton - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Yes, can you give it to us?","Marc G. Naughton","Can I share you that number? No. Sorry.","Jamie Stockton - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Well, all right. Well, maybe then, Mike, just touching on RevWorks. You had another deal there this quarter. I think maybe that's the second deal in the last 6 quarters. Could you give us some color on what the environment for deals in that space seems like today? Has it slowed down and that's why we saw kind of a window where there weren't a whole lot of RevWorks deals? And is it starting to reaccelerate now?","Zane M. Burke","This is Zane, I'll take that one. The, I think it's pretty -- it's natural that there's an ebb and flow in that side of the market. And that as we get more and more proof points, I think you'll see more predictability, it's very similar to where we were in the ITWorks' life cycle. So it's a little bit behind -- RevWorks is just, in terms of when we launched it, it's just a little behind that ITWorks life cycle. And I think it's quickly going to go down a similar path where it'll become a more predictable part of what our business, because our clients are seeing success from our RevWorks offerings. And that, again, that success begets other success, and that's what occurred on the ITWorks side, in that we had some early initial wins, had some variability in when those would come through the pipeline, but as we've gained success and the success becomes known within our client base, it becomes a much more repeatable thing. And I think that's what we're beginning to see on the RevWorks side as well. And in fact, this particular client was a Rev -- was an ITWorks client, where we've had success on the ITWorks side, and they've seen the success that we've had around ITWorks, and they extended it into their RevWorks case [ph] as well. So I think that's a natural extension, on top of what we do around ITWorks, and I think you can look at that as a great extension of our business.","Jamie Stockton - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, and then, maybe just my last question. Along the lines of what's going on in revenue cycle, I think 2 or 3 years ago, at the Analyst Day, you guys threw up this chart where you kind of showed the map of revenue cycle solutions, and then you showed a future state of revenue cycle. Could you give us a feel for, like where are you in the progression of the portion of the revenue cycle platform that you want to fill out? I think Jeff said that you'd had 24 solutions go GA in the last 18 months. Are you where you want to be? Or is there incrementals development that needs to occur?","Jeffrey A. Townsend","This is Jeff. We -- I think we're within, I'd say 6 to 12 months of where we want to be from a kind of a completeness. At the same time, as I mentioned, that depth and breadth of solutions going out, there's been 2 trends inside our portfolio: One is bringing more of the capabilities inside of a native Cerner platform, versus using third parties. That's both at a solution level as well as at a connectivity level. So things like an EDI connectivity is an example. So we're seeing more being pulled back in. The other is somewhat as Zane pointed out, the mandates, the measures, how you get paid is a moving target that's going to require more and more investment by our client organizations in some of these areas to adapt to a modern platform, and as simple as take a charge and drop it on a claim. So if you were to look at our roadmap today, as compared to the one you saw several years ago, you'd see probably about 75% to 80% of that filled out in a GA form. And you would see that at the same time though we have a list of futures, not quite as large, but that we anticipate a need to be built out to deal with the future state.","Operator","Your final question comes from Richard Close of Avondale Partners.","Richard C. Close - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","I was just curious, with respect to 2013, is there any reason we should not expect bookings at least flat to the 2012 levels?","Marc G. Naughton","There's no reason that you shouldn't expect us to grow bookings in 2013.","Zane M. Burke","You know what? I'll turn it over to you to close [ph].","Neal L. Patterson","Okay, great. So, I thought I'd make a few comments here. So I tell these guys is, you guys, if you all ask questions, they can't answer, I'll step in, but as you can tell, it's a very good, it's a very strong team, very good job. So we, basically, wake up every morning at the intersection of healthcare and IT, it's a very good place to be, it generates enormous opportunities for us. There are clearly challenges to being here, but I can't imagine a better place to start the day. So we've kind of basically, as a company, we kind of reinstated a boldness around here. The opportunities are just too significant not to be driving hard forward. We are clearly an innovator, probably we're the most significant innovators in healthcare, because we think this intersection of healthcare, IT -- healthcare and IT is really going to create the foundation of the future healthcare, how healthcare is delivered and managed, both at the delivery side and inside populations. So the environment of healthcare is always going to have a political aspect to it, but the fundamentals don't change based on the elections. The fundamentals are, the cost of healthcare have been rising for the last 60 years faster than the growth of our economies. And because of that, there is fundamental pressure to find a -- to drive improvements in the current healthcare systems that create and deliver greater value. We think Information Technology is going to be the core way of doing that. So we -- our goal is to be the trusted partner of our clients in this industry, and drive innovation with them and creating platforms for them to both deliver medicine and in the future, manage populations. So with that, I'll sign off. We're about ready to commence here in the room, a surprise party for Jeff Townsend, who is now celebrating his 25th anniversary. So I thought I'd share that with you guys, and let you be part of this small celebration here. So have a great day.

Today's date is May 2, 2018, and this call is being recorded.","The company has asked me to remind you that the various remarks made here today constitute forward-looking statements including, without limitation, those regarding projections of future revenues or earnings, operating margins, operating and capital expenses, bookings, taxes, solution development and future business outlook, including new markets or prospects for the company's solutions and services.

Cerner assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information except as required by law.","At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Marc Naughton, Chief Financial Officer of Cerner Corporation.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Thank you, Ella. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the call. I'll start with a review of our numbers. Zane Burke, our President, will follow me with the results, highlights and marketplace observations and then Brent Shafer, our Chairman and CEO will provide closing comments.","Turning to our results. Our first quarter included strong bookings and record cash flow but revenue was below our expectations due to software, technology resale and subscriptions and the delay of the VA contract. The lower revenue was largely offset by expense control and a lower tax rate resulting in our earnings being in line with expectations for Q1 but the slow start to the year and ongoing uncertainty as to the timing of the execution of VA contract has led us to revise our full year revenue and EPS outlook.","Now I'll go through the numbers. Our bookings in Q1 were $1.398 billion, which reflects a 12% increase over $1.25 billion in Q1 of 2017. Our revenue backlog ended the quarter at $14.6 billion. Notice, this reflects the adoption of the new revenue recognition guidance under Topic 606.","Certain provisions within the guidance impact how we calculate backlog with the primary change being that we have removed a portion of backlog tied to long term contracts that include an option to terminate before the end of the contract.","In our experience, almost no contracts \u2013 no clients exercised this option, so this doesn't change our total long term revenue opportunity as it shortens the duration of what is included in the backlog. Revenue in the quarter was $12.93 billion, which is up 3% over Q1 of 2017. You note that we have gone to a single revenue line on our income statement. This is also related to the adoption of Topic 606.","While there's less detail in the face of the income statement, we're now including the business model detail that we previously provided annually as an additional disclosure each quarter. We'll use those to discuss our results instead of our old categories of system sales, support maintenance and services.","Now I'll go through the business model detail and year-over-year growth compared to Q1 of 2017. Licensed software revenue was $135 million, down 5%, primarily due to lower than anticipated levels of licensed software bookings in the quarter as well as a tough year-over-year comparable, due to the shift in how we sold some content in 2017. As I discussed in our last call, a higher amount of content that is typically sold as a subscription was sold as licensed software last year. Technology resale decreased 1% to $63 million.","The next item, subscriptions revenue, was impacted by Topic 606, which reduced the backlog of subscription revenue. The shift in sales approach in 2017 that I mentioned previously also lowered the run rate of subscription revenue.","In addition, a portion of subscription revenue is now treated as support under Topic 606. This amount is classified as support and maintenance in the business model view for Q1 of 2018. The impact of these items results in subscriptions revenue of $77 million as compared to $113 million in the prior year period.","Professional services revenue grew 11% to $441 million driven largely by growth in our Works businesses. Managed services increased 3% to $268 million with the lower growth rate mainly reflecting the tough comparable as Q1 of last year was the strongest growth quarter in 2017 for managed services.","Support and maintenance was up 9% to $285 million, reflecting our expected low single-digit growth plus the adjustment for the support element, formerly reflected in subscriptions. And finally, reimbursed travel was $24 million which is up 7%.","Looking at revenue by geographic segment. Domestic revenue was flat from the year ago quarter at $1.135 billion and non-U.S. revenue of $158 million increased 23%. Moving to gross margin. Our gross margin for Q1 was 82.1% which is down from 82.6% in Q4 of 2017 and 84.2% a year ago primarily due to the lower levels of licensed software and higher third-party services costs.","Now I'll discuss spending, operating margin and net earnings. For these items, we provide both GAAP and adjusted or non-GAAP results. The adjusted results exclude share based compensation expense, share based compensation permanent tax items and acquisition related adjustments, all as detailed and reconciled to GAAP in our earnings release.","Looking at operating spending, our first quarter GAAP operating expenses of $866 million were up 6% compared to $817 million in the year ago period. Adjusted operating expenses were $819 million which is up 6% compared to $773 million in Q1 of 2017. This growth was primarily driven by an increase in personnel expense related to revenue generating associates and non-cash items.","Looking at the line items. Sales and client service expense increased 6%. Software development expense increased 10% driven by a 5% increase in gross R&D and 23% increase in amortization. G&A expense was up 1%. Amortization of acquisition related intangibles decreased 30% year-over-year.","Moving to operating margins. Recall that in our last earnings call I highlighted a number of near term headwinds that we anticipate will drive operating margins down in 2018 including increases in non-cash software amortization and depreciation, traditional software revenue growth challenges due to the maturing EHR market, a shift to more SaaS models and the tough comparable created by our strong software growth in 2017, growth in our lower margin Works businesses and investments in projects ahead of revenue being recognized.","Each of these factors did impact our margin in Q1 as GAAP operating margin was 15.1% compared to 19.4% in the year ago period and adjusted operating margin was 18.8%, down from 22.9%. Our adjusted operating margin was below our expectations due primarily to software being even lower than we expected.","We do continue to believe that many of these factors are temporary in nature and that we do have opportunities to improve margins as our non-cash expense growth slows, we get return on investments we are making in our Works businesses and our SaaS revenue related to population health ramps and balances the increase in mix of Works revenue.","In fact we believe the framework for margin expansion we laid out at our Investor Day is still valid. The principal change is that 2018, which we'd already indicated as an investment year, is now forecasted to have lower margins, which creates a lower baseline from which we expect to begin expanding margins next year.","Moving to net earnings and EPS. Our GAAP net earnings in Q1 were $160 million or $0.48 per diluted share. Adjusted net earnings in Q1 were $194 million and adjusted diluted EPS was $0.58 compared to $0.59 in Q1 of 2017. Our GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 20%. And excluding share based compensation permanent tax items, the Q1 tax rate was 22% which is slightly below the high level estimate we provided on our call last time. For the remainder of 2018, we expect our tax rate to be closer to 23% to 24%.","Now I'll move to our balance sheet. We ended Q1 with $1.093 billion of total cash and investments, which is up from $1.003 billion in Q4 of 2017 due to strong cash flow partially offset by use of cash for our stock repurchase program and making a debt payment.","During the quarter we repurchased 1.4 million shares of stock at an average price of $62.99 per share for a total of $88 million. We now have $330 million remaining of the $500 million stock repurchase program approved by the board in May of 2017. Given our strong cash performance, we have the ability to be active on the repurchase program.","Moving to debt. Our total debt including capital lease obligations was $446 million which is down from $527 million in Q4 of 2017. Total receivables ended the quarter at $1.041 billion which is essentially flat to Q4 of 2017. Our Q1 DSO was 73 days, which is up from 71 days from the year ago period and 72 days in Q4 of 2017.","Operating cash flow for the quarter was a record high $409 million. Q1 capital expenditures were $80 million and capitalized software was $74 million. Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less capital purchases and capitalized software development costs, was a record at $256 million for the quarter.","Note that our operating cash flow benefited from a tax refund in Q1, so we do expect it to go down sequentially. However, we still expect strong operating cash flow for the year to more than offset expected increase in capital expenditures and lead to another year of strong free cash flow.","Now I'll go through the guidance. We expect revenue in Q2 to be between $1.31 billion and $1.36 billion with the $1.335 billion midpoint reflecting growth of 3% over Q2 of 2017. For the full year, we expect revenue between $5.325 billion and $5.45 billion with a $5.388 billion midpoint reflecting 5% growth over 2017.","This guidance range is down from our previous range of $5.45 billion and $5.65 billion reflecting the lower revenue in Q1, a more cautious view on the market environment, and the delay of the VA contract. We are still confident we will sign an agreement with the VA, but we are now anticipating it will be in the second half of the year and will have less impact on our results. We expect Q2 adjusted diluted EPS to be $0.59 to $0.61 per share, the $0.60 midpoint reflecting $0.01 less than Q2 of 2017.","For the full year, we expect adjusted diluted EPS to be $2.45 to $2.55 with the $2.50 midpoint reflecting 5% growth over 2017. This range is down from our prior guidance of $2.57 to $2.73 due to the follow through impact of the lower Q1 software, a more cautious view on software for the rest of the year and the VA contract delay.","Moving to bookings guidance. We expect bookings revenue in Q2 of $1.35 billion to $1.55 billion. The $1.45 billion midpoint reflects a 11% decrease compared to a tough comparable in Q2 of 2017. We do expect to return to bookings growth in Q3 when we'll have a much easier comparable period.","In summary while some aspects of our results were solid such as bookings and cash flow, we are disappointed in our revenue performance and that we needed to lower our outlook. However, it was necessary to factor in the VA contract delay to make sure we set attainable targets in what is a challenging near term environment even though we remain confident in our longer term growth opportunities.","And with that I'll turn the call over to Zane.","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","Thanks, Marc. Good afternoon, everyone. Today I'll provide color on our results and make some marketplace observations. I'll start with bookings, which were strong overall, as they grew 12% over Q1 2017 and were at the upper end of our guidance range.","In Q1, the percent of bookings coming from long term contracts was higher than normal at 40%, reflecting good Works contributions and lower software and technology resale. As Marc discussed, the lower level of software and technology resale bookings and the delay of the VA contract did impact our revenue in the quarter.","We did, however, have a good quarter from a competitive standpoint, with 27% of bookings coming from outside our core Millennium install base. Our ambulatory business had a strong quarter, driven by ongoing penetration in ambulatory settings of our large health system clients. We're also seeing increased activity in the large independent provider market.","In the smaller hospital market we had strong Q1 success with our CommunityWorks offering. We continue to see record levels of activity in this space and are positioned for a strong year.","Moving to revenue cycle. Activity remains very high as it included in almost all new deals and our existing clients continue to migrate from legacy systems to Cerner Millennium. Since beginning of last year we brought over 300 hospitals and more than 1200 ambulatory facilities live on revenue cycle solutions.","In population health, we had a strong quarter. In addition to strong sales at HealtheIntent to provide our clients, we had good contributions from other markets further validating the broad applicability and addressable market for our population health solutions and services.","One example of this in Q1 was a State of Montana, Department of Health and Human Services choosing HealtheIntent for their Medicaid enterprise system to help manage 300,000 enrolled Medicaid lives.","Moving to our business outside the U.S. Following a strong second half of 2017, we continued the momentum into Q1 and had a very good quarter with 23% revenue growth. We also had strong non U.S. bookings in Q1 with some of the strength driven by the signing of our contract for the Region Sk\u00e5ne in.","This is a major win for our non-U.S. business, as we will provide our core solutions to 10 hospitals and 190 primary care facilities. It also represents our first Nordic population health client, serving 1.3 million citizens. In addition to the strength in Sweden, we had stronger contributions from the U.K., Germany and Canada. Looking ahead, we expect to have a good year with Australia, Canada, Middle East, U.K., Ireland and Germany, all forecasted to provide good contributions to our growth.","Next I'd like to provide an update on our federal business. Starting with the Department of Defense MHS Genesis project. The optimization phase of the project at the initial site has been completed. This phase of the project resulted in several improvements and we expect to begin the next wave of deployments this fall. We're also very pleased with the announcement last month that the United States Coast Guard now plans to adopt the same commercial EHR as DoD as part of MHS Genesis project.","Now I'll discuss our opportunity with Department of Veteran Affairs. As you are all likely aware, the signing of the contract was delayed again in Q1. While this is disappointing, we continue to believe we have broad support from key stakeholders and initial funding for the project was approved as a separate line item in the budget. Therefore, we still expect to sign the contract. It's just difficult to predict exactly when. As I've indicated before, delay does not change in any manner the magnitude or importance of the overall opportunity. We are honored to have the opportunity to serve our nation's veterans and will be ready to deliver when it signs.","Next I'll provide some marketplace observations and discuss how we're positioned for growth. While we remain optimistic about our overall market opportunity, particularly over the long-term, our results and outlook are reflective of an environment in which providers are financially challenged and have a lower sense of urgency to make purchase decisions due to the lack of hard regulatory deadlines.","I'd like to discuss how we're adapting to the current environment and where we see growth opportunities. In the EHR market there are still about 2000 hospitals on legacy EHR platform. We believe most of these hospitals will need to move to a more modern platform at some point. While most of these are smaller, they represent a significant opportunity in aggregate and we're doing well with our CommunityWorks offering that aligns with the needs of smaller hospitals.","In addition, because we have a footprint of 70 of the 100 largest health systems, many of these opportunities are accessible directly through our existing clients as they look to standardize on Cerner at sites that are still on legacy EHRs which can save them money by reducing the cost involved with managing multiple platforms.","Our large footprint also represents meaningful whitespace for us to cross-sell our solutions and services. We believe that our lower penetration of revenue cycle, Cerner RevWorks, Cerner ITWorks and population health represents significant growth opportunity. A key to selling these solutions and services back into our base is demonstrating ROI, which has become increasingly important in the current environment.","We have had a significant focus on delivering the value to our clients, with a focus on demonstrating hard ROI, whether it be increased charge capture and more efficient collections through our revenue cycle solutions and RevWorks services, lower cost operations with ITWorks or using our population health solutions to increase fee-for-service revenue or improve performance on value based contracts.","We have also demonstrated that the addressable market for our population health platform goes beyond our traditional provider end market, and we expect to continue expanding the reach of our population health solutions and services. Our state and local and federal business also represent significant opportunity, and we expect these to contribute to growth as long as we continue to execute on our initial contracts.","Clearly, getting to the next wave of DoD rollouts and getting start on the VA are important milestones that are needed to drive these meaningful contributions. As this plays out, we believe the timing of the growth will not only create a bridge to when we will have more contribution from our population health offerings, but will also become an important long-term contributor to our market presence and growth.","There are also several niche markets and smaller venues that collectively represent a large opportunity, including ambulatory, behavioral health, post acute, advisory consulting, employer services, workforce efficiency, and provider communications, to name a few. Finally, our non-U.S. business is picking up, and it represents an earlier stage EHR market opportunity than the U.S. as well as an opportunity for nearly all of our other solutions and services, I discussed.","To conclude, while much of our end market is currently facing financial pressure and uncertainty, our solution and tech-enabled services are aligned with these pressures and could be sold based on value. We believe our ability to do this is an important differentiator that will allow us to grow as we help our clients address the challenges of the day while preparing for a post fee-for-service economy.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Brent.","Brent Shafer - Cerner Corp.","Thanks, Zane. Good afternoon, everyone. Marc and Zane did a good job of covering the results in the current marketplace. We understand we didn't deliver against the expectations we set, and we are disappointed. We have revised our outlook to factor in the near term reality Zane discussed and we work very hard to deliver against these expectations.","Now I'd like to give you an update on my areas of focus. On our Q4 call in February, I mentioned that I'd be spending my first 100 days doing a deep dive into Cerner, talking with our clients and working with our leadership team to review our opportunities and investment priorities. It's now about 90 days in and we're on track in making excellent progress on our review of markets, clients, workforce, solutions, services and opportunities.","Together with the leadership team I've spent significant time with our clients. I've gained a clear understanding of our strategic value to them as well as some real opportunities for us to make improvements. After a period of focused review and assessment we recently got together as a leadership team for a three-day strategic planning retreat. We discussed our findings and spent the majority of the time getting aligned on the elements of a refined strategic plan.","We emerged from the retreat with a set of strategies that we intend to test and improve as we draw closer to our formal planning processes this fall. Broadly, the refined strategies fall into three categories, first, focusing on the client experience, second investing in the platform, solution and service innovation; and third profitable growth.","Focusing on the client experience is a set of objectives for ensuring our clients have full access to Cerner's best capabilities and get what they need from Cerner to help them succeed. Our belief is that as we have grown in size and scope, our relationships with clients have grown more complex than they need to be.","We want to simplify the experience of working together, so that we can be a better transformational partner. This has become increasingly important in a consolidating marketplace where we need to align with our large clients and provide them with tools to be successful to achieve their targeted benefits as they grow.","Investing in platform, solution and service innovation is a group of objectives focused on making targeted improvements to our technological platforms, solutions and services and speed in innovation of solutions and services that address new market opportunities.","Finally, we have a set of objectives around profitable growth that are focused on supporting markets that have the highest growth potential over the next few years, consolidators, community hospitals, governments, global markets, employers, payers and non-hospital providers.","In summary, regardless of the near-term challenges the assessment process we've just gone through makes me optimistic about our market opportunities and prospects for growth. We have work to do. But if we execute and we will, I believe the long-term growth targets we have shared with you remain attainable. Cerner's leadership team is exceptional and we're working together extremely well. I'm very excited about our future together.","With that I'll turn the call over to the moderator, so we can take some of your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question is from Sean Dodge with Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Sean Dodge - Jefferies LLC","Yeah. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe starting with the VA contract. Zane, you're now expecting it will be signed in the second half of the year. You touched on it a bit. But I guess since there aren't any permanent senior leaders in place at the VA right now, what gives you confidence this is something you can still get done and get done as soon as the back half of this year?","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","Yeah. Great question, Sean. We continue to remain linked to kind of the Hill, the White House, and the agency, all of those folks, and there are obviously the Secretary position's on an interim basis right now, but all of those factions are all seemingly moving ahead. And we feel strong about that. And the line item in the budget is a critical item as we move forward that gives us the confidence in that side. But obviously, it's been very challenging for us to predict the actual completion of that contract. And such we've moved that to the back half of the year.","Sean Dodge - Jefferies LLC","Okay. That's helpful. Thanks. And then your comments in the prepared remarks about revising your outlook down because of the large contract delay and a less predictable end market. I get the delay portion, but can you give a little bit more color on what you mean about a less predictable end market? Is it contracts are getting bigger and it's tougher to pin down timing? Or are you seeing clients get a little bit tighter with HCIT budgets and pushing off or delaying projects?","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","I think it's multiple things. We had the one contract which obviously the VA was a significant contract that moved out of the quarter that we had planned on. At the end market side of this, there's quite a bit of M&A activity. There's a competition for capital. The bottom lines are under pressure and technology is still a lever by which people can make a difference in this space. And so what you're seeing is, as we've discussed over the last several quarters, is there's an unpredictability to the completion of some of that business. And I think that continues forward and can create some lumpiness in some of those elements and some predictability in part of those pieces.","Sean Dodge - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Very good. Thanks again.","Operator","Our next question is from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah. Hi. Good evening. So when we talked about the profitable growth and the goal supporting markets, with largest growth areas, you've listed quite a large number of growth opportunities. I think you listed most of your clients. So can you give us maybe some perspective on within that group, where do you see the most realistic opportunities in the near term?","And then also in the long term, as the healthcare landscape evolves and changes, we're seeing a lot of obviously M&A, vertical integration which would suggest that the market might look very different five years out versus today. And within this context you reiterated the long term growth rate for the company. How long do you think it's going to take to return, go back to these growth rates?","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Yes, this is Marc. I think the things that Brent laid out relative to the markets, if you will, that we're looking at from consolidators on. Clearly we think all of those have potentials. That's why we're identifying them all as different markets. The consolidator market is completely \u2013 is very different from what the non-consolidator market is from a provider perspective. The provider market on the non-consolidated end is very active. Lot's of activity going on. Lots of opportunities.","But as Zane said, there's a real ROI focus. There isn't a meaningful use. There isn't an external item that is forcing them to get to decisions. They have to go through the process to get to that ROI. In the consolidator market, we've got to be the people that are providing the tools that allow them to gain leverage and to gain scale as they go forward and work on taking these accumulated assets and turning them into a single health system, which is the goal of most of those.","But each of those areas, and obviously governments with VA, with foreign governments as we realized with our Swedish deal with Sk\u00e5ne this quarter, those are big opportunities that we see. So each of those has a different timing and different uptake. As we talk about our 10-year view, or that we've shared in our ability to continue that and strive to get to that, really as you look at the elements that are out there that drive a lot of that growth, the Works businesses in both ITWorks and RevWorks, if you look at the population health element of that, all of those things still remain elements that all of health care is looking to add.","And as we look globally, the population health certainly is an additional element that has helped us succeed in those global markets where some of our primary competitors have been unsuccessful. So I think without quantifying, I think our 10-year model gives you an idea if you look at each of those markets when we think they're going to start providing more lift, and I think employer, on the population health side, those are likely in the out years as we've indicated. Governments, we're starting to see uptick currently. We've seen more uptick in the government in the global side. And then we continue to see activity in the, certainly the non-consolidator market, as well as the consolidator market. So some of that, the providers are probably more near term. The others are going to be medium to longer term.","Operator","And our next question is from Sandy Draper with SunTrust. Your line is now open.","Sandy Y. Draper - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thanks very much. Can you hear me, okay?","Brent Shafer - Cerner Corp.","Yes.","Sandy Y. Draper - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay, good. And I guess just a little bit of a follow-up to Ricky's question, but more on the expense side. When you think about still being optimistic about the long term impact of the higher growth, when you think about the near term challenges, how do you balance at what point do you pull back on expenses, and recognize, okay, so this period we're not going to hit the higher end, so we need to curb expenses, because you guys over the long term have done a great job of growing, it's been a spend and grow and spend and grow. The market right now as you said is challenging. There's no obvious end. How do you sort of balance the long term focus versus near term, hey, we don't know when this is going to get better. We're going to pull back on expenses until we have clear signs. Just thoughts about that, and don't know, Brent, if that was something you brought up and discussed in the plain view strategy? Thanks.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Yes. This is Marc. Certainly we talked about our cost structures as part of the retreat. I think the key for us is we divide our resources and our associates into revenue producing and those that aren't. We are making \u2013 and we said on the last call, we are making an investment in 2018 relative to the market. We believe the VA's going to happen. We're going to be absolutely prepared to deliver on that when it does, and we're going to continue to have a level of investment in that business.","We talked about adding a Kansas City Works business. We hired 200 of those people in Q1 versus our 600 target. So we are continuing to invest in those businesses because we think that it's the right thing to do. Those businesses are there, and they're going to happen. We're going to continue to invest in our IP organization because innovation is our differentiator in the marketplace.","Certainly as we look at anything that isn't revenue producing or isn't creating innovation, we look at those expenses very carefully. We're managing, as those of you know me, can expect a travel level at open cards or open head count positions as far as do we fill those immediately or do we hold them for a month or two. So if you look at the total spend we incurred in Q4 and compared to total spend in Q1 I think we went up about $3 million in total spend. And that was an increase in amortization.","So I think your points are great Sandy. We're certainly focused in making sure that we're not spending crazily and spending in a way that doesn't match the opportunity we see. But as an investment year and given our history that we've been able to invest in and drive future growth, we see 2018 as one of those years. And we are going to control spending that isn't directly related to accomplishing those goals, but we are going to spend where we think that going to \u2013 we can drive those goals forward.","Sandy Y. Draper - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Great. Thanks for the comment.","Operator","Our next question is from Eric Percher with Nephron Research. Your line is now open.","Eric Percher - Nephron Research LLC","Thank you. Back to your comment about (32:27) as we consider those costs and the ramp over time, how much have you had to bring on in order to be prepared? I know part of this is Cerner expense. There are also will be third parties involved. And how should we think about what's been fixed versus variable and your ability to ramp that down or up as you're waiting?","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Yes. We've missed the first part of the question but I assume it was based on the VA and the ramp expense related to that.","Eric Percher - Nephron Research LLC","Yes.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Yes. For the most part, the third party expense we're not incurring third party expense at this point. They're doing the same thing. They're ramping up. They're being prepared, but we are not incurring any third party expense. It is all on the far side of the \u2013 that the expenses being incurred and that includes the services teams, it includes the hosting of the VA, data center, it includes provisioning and getting ready in the data center. So there's elements \u2013 those are the elements that we're ramping up.","So from a timing and ability to repurpose those, certainly the people on the services side, we're filling some of their time with short term projects to get some revenue out of them, but they're not going to be as productive as they will be if they were fully on this fact. And keep in mind from \u2013 that's just relative to what our cost structure is, the VA is working through a process. It's a federal procurement process. So we've got to be careful how much we talk about that.","But from what we're doing to be prepared I can tell you that certainly we're doing \u2013 we're incurring this cost that we think we need to. But those \u2013 the ability to change in direction on those will be something, at this point we don't see the need to do that. I mean if that was necessary the services people have skills that can be applied to other places in the organization and the capabilities \u2013 other capabilities are ones that we can expand in our existing clients.","Eric Percher - Nephron Research LLC","And just following up to Brent's commentary, from the timeline he laid out, it sounds like the process is really one that looks at the forward year. When will we begin to hear about what's coming out of that process? Is there a period? I know you have your health care conferences. Is that when you start to speak to clients? And when do we as investors start to hear about some of the outcomes?","Brent Shafer - Cerner Corp.","It's I think definitely in that same time period we'll try to align there and make sure we're keeping you informed appropriately.","Eric Percher - Nephron Research LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Jeff Garro with William Blair. Your line is now open.","Jeff R. Garro - William Blair & Co. LLC","Yeah. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Wanted to ask about the comments around lower software sales, and maybe if you could just follow up with any particular areas where you're seeing weakness more so than others, maybe acute versus ambulatory or the core segment versus population health or revenue cycle?","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","This is Zane. I think what you'd see is, it's really the mix of the clients themselves. So it's really \u2013 we saw \u2013 actually quite a lot of activity from a number of deals. It was just some of the larger opportunities weren't there that we'd anticipated being there in the first quarter. And so we saw great activity really in the community hospital side, but it was probably in the larger opportunity side that some of those were not where we thought they would be. And those just come with more software.","Jeff R. Garro - William Blair & Co. LLC","Got it. And then one more, if I could. Zane, you mentioned it was a good quarter from a Works contribution aspect. And maybe you could provide a little bit more detail on ITWorks versus RevWorks, and fully outsourced ITWorks clients that you're adding to the cohort there? Thanks.","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","Sure. We saw strong activity in our business office services from a RevWorks perspective. And so that was a big contributor. We saw some additional ITWorks extensions into some other areas that we hadn't previously worked in, but not really a new footprint per se.","Jeff R. Garro - William Blair & Co. LLC","Great, thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from David Larsen with Leerink Partners. Your line is now open.","David Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC","Hi, of the 200 individuals that were hired for like I guess the Works area in Kansas City, what is their utilization right now? Are they all billing 40 hours a week? Or is it more like 20 hours a week each? Any sense for I guess how utilized they are?","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","So this is Zane. These folks are in training at this point because these are going to be on our shared services groups for our enhanced revenue cycle solutions. And that will yield significant results, both top and bottom line, over time, but there's a ramp up to that and there is a much more significant investment frankly in these resources than in some of our implementation resources, just given the nature of the activities of what these folks do.","So what I would tell you at this point they're all in training and it takes a time period for them to get productive and into full use.","David Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC","So are there projects that you have lined up for them to work on in the back half of the year where they will all be able to bill?","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","So this is Zane again. We absolutely have a backlog of revenue cycle opportunities, and we've had a good contribution \u2013 a good contribution again in bookings on business office services. So the work is there. We're feeling good about where that work is. But this is a little bit different in terms of billability and how that works. It's not a straight up professional services rate per hour kind of a situation. These are the folks that are filling needs and for a revenue cycle position.","This over time it will give us much more leverage in our cost model as we move forward in that space. But at this point in time you're doubled up on cost from either the resources still out of the client side and you're paying for the training on this side of the house as well.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Yes, David this is Marc. The goal is to obviously create the centralized billing center in Kansas City and use that to not only take on new business but to take on some of the business we're already funding from some diverse resources that are located in different places throughout the country. So I think that's a key to bear. If you will, it's almost like a fixed fee engagement. We charge the clients a certain amount of money, and then we do the work that's necessary to deliver the service. It's not, we don't get paid by the hour. We get paid by the month, if you will, and timeframe based on the size of the client and what they're doing. So, but, as Zane said, right now those people are not driving any revenue as they train.","David Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC","Great. Thanks very much. Sounds like your international team is doing a great job. So, thanks very much.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from Sean Wieland with Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open.","Sean W. Wieland - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Thanks very much. Couple of quantification questions. So, first, content sold as license that would normally be sold as subscription. Could you quantify that from last quarter? And is that an ongoing trend that you saw again in the first quarter? I misunderstood that.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","We can't necessarily quantify it, but the point is that in 2017 as we sold subscriptions and we would sold content and historically we might have sold that as getting paid for it over time. The new 606 revenue standard basically would have said on the date those were signed that's when the revenue will be taken into the new standard, and when the new standard took effect January 1, all of that future revenue would have gone out of our backlog.","So as we looked at it, we were able to convert some of that content into lot perpetual licenses, which allowed us normal licensing treatment to take into revenue, and it goes \u2013 it would rolled into the licensed software number. So that's the main point.","Under 606, which is the rules beginning in Q1, there isn't a distinction between subscriptions of a certain type and license software. It's all, to the extent it's both our point in time revenue that are recognized on the appropriate either signing date or first productive use or whatever the milestone is. But those \u2013 so the \u2013 what we did in 2017 and what we talked \u2013 we're referencing is the licensed software number was a little bit stronger because of our ability to convert some of those deals to license.","What it did going forward is reduces the subscription number going forward because we didn't book as much subscriptions in 2017 as that revenue would have gone away anyway. We're now basically operating under the same way we did in 2017 relative to that.","As you look at Q1, the amount of subscription bookings was below plan. So that's part of the shortfall we had in licensed software. So while the accounting treatment would be the same to how we sold it as perpetual software last year, it didn't have an impact in Q1 because of the level of bookings we had in that space.","Sean W. Wieland - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Right. So if I get this straight, it's not an end market like a customer wanted to buy it differently. It was the accounting treatment of it that caused you to account for it differently. Am I hearing that correctly?","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","It caused us to sell it differently as a license rather than a subscription, and therefore the accounting treatment followed the way it was sold. But we did alter it in advance of 606 being adopted to minimize the impact of 606. If you look at the overall impact of 606 on our company, I mean, the net retained earnings adjustment, which is just kind of the net revenue or the net impact on earnings for all the adjustments that were made is probably $7 million.","So I think we did a pretty good job of managing and trying to be prepared for the reduction of backlog that you would see for subscriptions coming from that. You also see an increase in backlog coming from some other items and you also see commission expense, which we had previously taken 100% of commission expense in the past, we now get to take it again as it rolls out over a period of time. But the net of the backlog adjustment plus the expense impact kind of nets down to that $7 million over a period of time as all of those things roll out. So that was part of that activity.","Sean W. Wieland - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Okay. And the other quantification question I had. Could you quantify the direct costs associated with the VA in the quarter? And when you eventually sign this contract, are you going to get made whole on those expenses?","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","No. I can't quantify it.","Sean W. Wieland - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Will you be made whole?","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","I can't quantify them. It's a federal procurement. And I can't discuss anymore. Sorry.","Sean W. Wieland - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Got it. Don't want to get you in trouble. Thanks so much for taking the question.","Operator","Our next question is from George Hill with RBC. Your line is now open.","George Hill - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Good evening guys and thanks for taking the question. Maybe I'll ask part of Sean's question in a different way which is, I guess, can you quantify the risk to the guidance in the balance of the year should the VA not sign, if this kind of process continues to drag on?","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Yes, I mean, as Zane indicated, we still have in our guidance the signing of VA in the back half of the year. So that is part of the forecasting we've done. That's part of the assumptions we have. So if in fact VA did not sign at all during the year, that would have an impact. But currently it's obviously lower. We reduced our guidance based on the fact that the number we have in there is less than we initially had in as we went into the year moving it from the first half of the year to the second half of the year. But I think at this point, I can't really quantify it any more than that just based on things we talked about before. But the number still does have VA in it with the second half impact.","George Hill - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. And then I kind of wanted to ask Sean's question a different way which was typically the accountants make you report the business from an operating perspective, the way that you guys run the business. You guys have kind of moved from reporting to, what we'll call the business model perspective versus the prior perspective. Is it changing anything about the way that the company goes to market and approaches its customers? And is it changing the way in which Cerner tries to contract with customers at all? Like is the new reporting reflective of any actual go to market changes?","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","No. The line of business that we're doing to provide additional detail on the revenue line is a number that we've shared with you guys annually for as long as I can remember doing this. So I think that's one of the reasons we went to that is 606 said, your revenue is one line on the income statement, but you need to provide a disaggregation of that number in the financial statements.","We decided that the business model was the one that was most familiar to investors, and for the most part other than the subscription differences I discussed earlier is consistent with what you've seen that number be in the past. It absolutely is going to provide more transparency, as you look to analyze our results because you're going to see elements that would have been included in another category on the former income statement.","So I think from an accounting perspective it's, the goal would be to provide some additional level of transparency, and certainly for our standpoint it's merely taking a number that we provided annually and now providing it quarterly. But you will see some fluctuation in those numbers because those numbers can vary somewhat quarter-by-quarter to the extent that they are one-time items and not recurring in nature. But I think that's part of the transparency that's the goal of the standard.","So there is no change in how we do business. No change in how we're going to go to market other than obviously the retreat we had and things that we'll certainly look at as we go look at the markets and decide how we want to attack those, but accounting is not driving how we're operating the business. In fact this is one time when what they've asked to do on the transparency line actually makes sense.","George Hill - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. All right. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Michael Cherny with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Michael Cherny - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey everyone. Thanks for the color so far. I just have one question, a lot of them have been asked. You talk a lot about whether it's the VA contract being timing oriented, some of the choppiness in the market, but still confident in the long term health of the business. You guys have very frequently had a very clean, almost pristine balance sheet, so nice cash flow in the quarter.","Why not any thought to being more aggressive in the capital deployment side, particularly given the opportunity potential to do something like whether it's accelerate share repurchase, a more sustainable return of capital to investors, even the long discussed and questioned dividend. Any thoughts around change in the capital deployment structure, particularly given that this seems to be at least from your perspective a very short term or at least medium term blip in your business versus something that's permanently impairing the organization?","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Yeah, Michael. This is Marc. We certainly had record free cash flow for Q1. So that was certainly a huge positive. We have $339 million of stock repurchase authorization still remain to be exercised. And I would believe that our expectation is to be aggressively working on that as we work through this quarter. And we may, Mike, expectation is that certainly the board will consider more, may, board and shareholder meeting expanding that to a broader repurchase. Because I think today from a capital deployment, we look at the opportunities to repurchase shares and we look at the opportunities to, is there anything from an M&A perspective that might make sense for us or an investment perspective that might further these businesses that we expect to be long term growth potentials for us.","So we want to be able to be able to do that. I think from a dividend perspective that's probably not in the near term opportunities just because I think we are a growth company. We think there are other opportunities for things for us to invest our capital in. And I think that at this point we'll probably focus from a shareholder perspective on stock repurchases as our capital deployment vehicle.","Michael Cherny - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Understood. Just more curious because I think you're probably the only the company I cover that has a net cash position on your balance sheet. So appreciate the color on that. Thanks.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Sure.","Operator","Our next question is from Steven Halper from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is now open.","Steven Halper - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Hi. Appreciate the comments around you're still a growth company. But I guess when you look at the current environment and how and what you go to market with, what gives you the confidence to say that we can reaccelerate the growth back to those established long-term targets, given what you know today obviously things can change, but what do you know today that can help us sort of believe that that is attainable?","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","This is Zane, Steve. There are \u2013 things that our clients need are the kind of tech enabled services that we have around ITWorks, RevWorks and what we do in our population health. So actually solving the challenges they need more technology and they need those tech enabled services and solutions. And the uptick of that, I think is continuing to go well. And that gives us a lot of optimism in the future in our core marketplace.","Then as you think about that government marketplace, the state, local, federal space that really has an opportunity to become incredibly meaningful on a growth top line perspective for Cerner overall. And then some new marketplaces that our technology really works effectively and really we have all kind of the pieces, as you look at employer and payer and the beginnings of some of that coming together. Those pieces are picking up steam in some pretty meaningful ways. And I think the pace of change causes some to freeze at some point in time. And I think that's a little what we've seen in some of the marketplaces but it will also cause enough pain that people will have to make decisions and make moves that they haven't historically considered like outsourcing their revenue cycle, like outsourcing their IT shop. And I see that picking up in the long range quite significantly. And I think you can see, this would be a different conversation had this VA Secretary been in place at the end of the first quarter. And I think we'd be having a different conversation about how the outlook of the year is. And so I think it's important not to look too far past what that really means to the overall business and really how we're viewing this from an optimistic perspective and where we are.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Yeah, Steve. I'd just add that from the Works businesses, one of the good things about them is the client is already spending those dollars. You're not looking for additional spend. You're just trying to take the dollars they're already spending. And so that's a pretty key element, and as the ROI and the focus becomes even more intense, as Zane said, those businesses we just \u2013 our conversations are more people thinking I know I'm going to probably get there. It's just I got to decide what the timing is.","Steven Halper - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","And just one follow-up. Just a housekeeping question. I appreciate the comment. When you look at the cash flow statement, the capitalized software cost and CapEx is that both of those items, are those good proxies for the rest of the year? Or is there any change?","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Relative to the amount incurred in Q1 compared for the year?","Steven Halper - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Yeah.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Yeah. I mean I think that as you look forward for CapEx, we probably, we talked that it's probably going to be in the range of $450 million to $500 million would be my expectation. Capitalized software is probably going to be slightly above what it was last year. So I think that gives you a sense of where we're at. Our overall thought is that free cash flow for the year basically lands about what it was last year, maybe just slightly \u2013 a little bit up from last year but in that range.","Steven Halper - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","So based on that commentary you're expecting an increase in CapEx the next three quarters and that's based on projects at the new campus? Is that-","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Yeah, basically projects, the campus projects is the one that's \u2013 has the biggest impact. And as you said, it's probably $100 million more CapEx year-over-year based on those projects.","Steven Halper - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","And then it should moderate next year?","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Yeah. We have a second year on one of the campus expansions that will impact but some of those projects will reduce as well. So we'll give it another view but it could be a two year version at that level and then declining after that.","Steven Halper - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Okay, thank you.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Sure.","Operator","Our next question is from Donald Hooker with KeyBanc. Your line is now open.","Donald H. Hooker - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Great, good afternoon. So obviously a lot of questions asked, but I'll throw in one sort of more detailed question. I was curious if you could elaborate on that Medicaid agreement in Montana. It was probably small in terms of its contribution of course. But it seems a little bit different. And I wonder \u2013 I would like to hear what kind of solutions you're offering there and what that might bode going forward for state opportunities?","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","Donald, thanks for the question. So this is the state's Medicaid population and they're deploying our care registries to start with, and then they'll move into a full enterprise data warehouse and analytics of their Medicaid population. And this is direct competition against kind of a different bigger competitor that we suit and play against in a public procurement. And this is reflective of the marketplace that we think is pretty significant. And this is a multimillion dollar booking arrangement for us. So it is significant. It's meaningful, and it's the precursor to additional work that you can go do beyond the software and analytics.","It's the additional services that you can go do in those spaces. So we do view that state and local government is a great growth opportunity for us as we move forward. And we sell \u2013 we have offerings well beyond the EHR in this space. It's probably \u2013 it's one of those things that we'll spend some time highlighting as we move forward. So thanks for the question.","Donald H. Hooker - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","I mean are there other states, remind me if are there other states that you're working with in this manner as well?","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","This is a first of its kind. Yes, we do work with other states on a number of different \u2013 a number of different solutions. So we work with states from an employer clinic perspective. We work with states from a behavioral health perspective or from a electronic health record. We work with states in multiple ways. So we're working with I think about seven different states. The Department of Corrections in California is a very large client of ours. So they just \u2013 there are some pretty significant markets that are just not thought of in a traditional sense that give us quite a bit of optimism in the state and local space.","Donald H. Hooker - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thank you.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","We would take one more call.","Operator","Our last question is from Matthew Gillmor with Robert W. Baird. Your line is now open.","Matthew D. Gillmor - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hey, thanks. I just had two quick follow-ups. The first one, Marc, was Topic 606 a headwind to revenues for the quarter or was it about neutral?","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Yeah, I mean for the \u2013 it rolls out differently each quarter. Overall it was probably a slight positive when you talk about the backlog revenue side and you talk about the commission expense offset against that. For the quarter, from an earnings perspective, it was about a negative $2 million impact. I think for the overall revenue, those two items netted to a pretty small amount. There is also \u2013 Topic 606 did impact the Venice West (58:58) contract that we have relative to RevWorks. We re-badged those associates on April 1. And normally under the old rules when you re-badge them, you take \u2013 start taking the software gross. But with Topic 606, you would take it gross all the time even if you haven't re-badged associates. We knew that that was going to be the case. We were looking at re-badging those associates on January 1st. But because 606 would let us start taking that revenue anyway, we deferred the re-badge to April 1 at the client's request.","So if you \u2013 the number that shows up in 606 will have a probably 80% of it will be related to that Venice West (59:47) contract and the revenue from it in Q1. Going forward, there would be no difference between 606 and the old rules because we will have re-badged them. So net-net what I see is 606, which is the backlog adjustment and the expenses was pretty nominal impact.","Matthew D. Gillmor - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. And then another topic that you touched on, on a previous question, but I was hoping to get some more details. Does the VA readiness crowd out other revenues that, and other projects you don't otherwise be working on that would generate revenue? And do you have an estimate for what that would be?","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","I don't have an estimate. There's certainly people that could be on other jobs working more efficiently than some of the things we have them filling in on today. So certainly, it is a loss of revenue relative to those. And that's why we characterized it as an investment. It's clearly, I wouldn't expect that my spend would exceed my revenue as it is on those resources. And that's what it is today. But I can't quantify that for you right now.","Matthew D. Gillmor - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay.","Brent Shafer - Cerner Corp.","Okay. Thank you, Marc. This is Brent. I'd just like to thank you all for joining us today. I want to reiterate what a pleasure it is to be here at Cerner. And now that first 90 days have passed in a heck of a hurry, it's already clear to me that Cerner is a company with great opportunities. We've talked about some of those today and we'll talk more with you as the year goes on.","And I know we have a lot of work to do. We have a very strong leadership team and a strong associate base. And I really believe we can deliver lasting growth by making focused investments and innovation and ensuring we do the things necessary to make our clients successful. And that's what we're all about. So, thanks for being with us. Have a good evening.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thanks for participating in today's conference. You may now disconnect.

At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Marc Naughton, Chief Financial Officer of Cerner Corporation. Please proceed.","Marc G. Naughton","Thank you, Derrek. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the call. I'll lead off today with a review of the numbers. Zane Burke, Executive Vice President of our Client Organization, will follow me with sales highlights and marketplace trends. Mike Nill, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, will discuss our works businesses and 2012 imperatives. Mike will be followed by Jeff Townsend, Executive Vice President and Chief of Staff, who will discuss strategic initiatives. Neal Patterson, our Chairman, CEO and President, is traveling today.","Now I'll turn to our results. Our strong fourth quarter results capped off a record year across all key measures. Bookings were very strong and exceeded the high-end of our guidance range. Our income statement performance was excellent, with revenue and adjusted EPS above expected levels due to [ph] continued margin expansion and strong earnings growth, and we had very strong cash flow performance.","Moving to the details, our total bookings revenue in Q4 was a record $899 million. Bookings exceeded the high-end of our guidance range by more than $200 million and were up 44% from Q4 of '10. Bookings margin in Q4 was $755 million or 84% of total bookings. For the full year, bookings revenue was $2.72 billion, up 37% from 2010. As Zane will discuss, the strength of business in Q4 spanned across all business models and included 2 ITWorks contracts and 1 RevWorks contract. Our bookings performance drove a 24% increase in total backlog to $6.11 billion. Contract revenue backlog of $5.4 billion is 26% higher than a year ago. Support revenue backlog totaled $706 million, up 8% year-over-year. Revenue in the quarter was $615.6 million, which is up 23% over Q4 of '10. The revenue composition for Q4 was $220 million in system sales, $142 million in support and maintenance, $242 million in services, $11 million in reimbursed travel. The upside relative to our guidance was largely driven by higher system sales and strong services. For the full year, revenue grew 19% to $2.2 billion.","System sales revenue reflects 34% growth from Q4 of '10. This was driven by strong growth in licensed software, subscriptions and device resale with the growth in these items slightly offset by flat levels of traditional hardware and sublicensed software. For the full year, system sales revenue grew 28%.","Services revenue was up 24% compared to Q4 of '10 and 20% for the full year with strong growth in both managed services and professional services. Support and maintenance revenue increased 7% over Q4 of '10 and 6% for the full year.","Looking at revenue by geographic segment, domestic revenue increased 21% year-over-year to $524 million. Global revenue was $92 million and grew 35% compared to the year ago period. For the full year, domestic revenue grew 21% to $1.89 billion and global revenue grew 7% to $309 million. As a preview to the annual update of our detailed business model that we'll provide at our Investment Community Meeting on February 22, I'd like to provide you with the total revenue and growth by business model for the full year 2011.","Licensed software grew 21% to $325 million. Technology resale was up 39% to $246 million, driven by growth in device resale. Subscriptions and transactions increased 28% to $136 million. Professional services revenue grew 21% to $550 million. Managed services increased 20% to $351 million. Support and maintenance was up 6% to $551 million and reimbursed travel was $45 million, up 38%. We'll go into more business model detail at our Investment Community Meeting.","Moving to gross margin, our gross margin for Q4 was 78.6%, which is basically flat compared to 78.9% in Q3 and down compared to 81% a year ago. The year-over-year decline in gross margin was driven by the strong levels of technology resale that I discussed, as well as an increase in third-party services. For the full year, gross margin was 80%.","As we've noted in the past, while revenue mix can impact gross margins in any given period, we continue to drive operating margin expansion as I'll discuss in a moment. Looking at operating spending, our fourth quarter operating expenses were $337.8 million before share-based compensation expense of $8 million. Total operating expense was up 15% compared to Q4 of '10 with the majority of the growth driven by an increase in revenue generating associates in our services business. For the full year, operating expenses were $1.27 billion, up 11% from 2010. This compares to revenue growth for the year of 19%, reflecting strong operating efficiencies. Sales and client service expenses increased 19% compared to Q4 of '10, and 13% for the full year, driven primarily by growth in managed services and professional services. Our investment in software development increased 4% compared to Q4 of '10, and 5% for the full year. We expect to continue growing our R&D investments in coming years to accelerate innovation in areas Mike and Jeff will discuss. We expect to be able to do this with R&D still growing slower than revenue, so we maintain the leverage we have achieved from our R&D investments.","G&A expense increased 10% compared to Q4 of '10, and 11% for the full year, driven by personnel and other expenses related to an increase in hiring and training. Moving to operating margins, our operating margin in Q4 was 23.7% before share-based compensation expense and was up 160 basis points compared to Q4 of '10. For the full year, operating margin increased 140 basis points to 22.2%. Moving forward, we believe we can continue to expand operating margins 100 to 200 basis points annually through efficiencies across our business models and expense leverage.","Moving to earnings and EPS, our GAAP net earnings in Q4 were $91.2 million or $0.52 per diluted share. GAAP net earnings included share-based compensation expense, which had a net impact on earnings of $5 million or $0.03 per share. Adjusted net earnings were $96.2 million and adjusted EPS was $0.55, which is up 26% compared to Q4 of '10. For the year, adjusted net earnings were $324.9 million and adjusted EPS was $1.87, $1.87, which is up 26% from 2010. The tax rate for adjusted net earnings was 35%, which is in line to slightly below what we expected. For 2012, we expect our effective tax rate to be 35% to 36%, with the rate in Q1 likely being lower due to a favorable tax settlement.","Now I\u2019ll move to our balance sheet. We ended Q4 with $1.13 billion of total cash and investments, up from $1.09 billion in Q3. Total cash and investments include $775 million of cash and short-term investments of $359 million of highly rated corporate and government bonds with maturities over one year. Our total debt, including capital lease obligations, is $127 million. Total receivables ended the quarter at $563 million, which is up $15 million from Q3. Contracts receivable or the unbilled portion of receivables were $91 million and represents 16% of total receivables compared to 19% in Q3. Cash collections were a record $638 million. Our DSO in Q4 was 83 days, which is down from 87 days in Q3 and Q4 of '10. Operating cash flow for the quarter was a record at $168.5 million. Q4 capital expenditures were $29.2 million and capitalized software was $21.1 million. Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures and capitalized software, was also a record $118.2 million. For the full year, operating cash flow grew 20% to $546.3 million and free cash flow grew 31% to $358.6 million, with capital expenditures of $104.8 million and capitalized software of $82.9 million. Free cash flow represents more than 100% of net earnings for both Q4 and the full year, demonstrating strong earnings quality.","Looking at 2012, we expect an increase in capital expenditures compared to the low $100 million range we've seen in the last 2 years. Some of this will be driven by the construction of additional space at our new Kansas City, Kansas, campus that is needed for our growing associate base. We do not expect this to have a material impact on our free cash flow as the construction will span multiple years, and we will also be receiving incentives that will offset a portion of the construction cost.","Moving to capitalized software, the $21.1 million of capitalized software in Q4 represents 28% of the $75.2 million of total spend on development activities. Software amortization for the quarter was $19.2 million, resulting in net capitalization of $1.9 million or 2.5% of our total R&D investment.","Now I'll go through the Q1 and 2012 guidance. For Q1 revenue, we expect revenue between $565 million and $585 million, with the midpoint reflecting growth of 17% over Q1 '11. For the full year, we expect revenue between $2.425 billion and $2.5 billion, with the midpoint reflecting growth of 12%. We expect Q1 adjusted EPS before share-based compensation expense to be $0.48 to $0.50 per share, with the midpoint reflecting 23% growth over Q1 '11. For the full year, we expect adjusted EPS between $2.20 and $2.30 per share, with the midpoint reflecting growth of 20%. Q1 guidance is based on total spending before share-based compensation expense of approximately $335 million to $340 million. Our estimate for the impact of share-based compensation expense is $0.03 in Q1 and $0.12 to $0.14 for the full year.","Moving to bookings guidance, we expect bookings revenue in Q1 of $560 million to $600 million. The midpoint of this range reflects 10% growth over Q1 of '11.","In closing, we are pleased with our strong results in Q4 and the full year, with all key metrics at or above our expected ranges, including record bookings, revenue, earnings and cash flow and strong margin expansion.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Zane.","Zane M. Burke","Thanks, Marc. Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'm going to provide highlights of our sales results and cover marketplace trends. Starting with our results, we had another quarter of record bookings, driven by robust demand in our client base and strong competitiveness in new footprint opportunities. Our bookings revenue in Q4 of $899 million reflects 44% growth over last year and is an all-time high.","For the year, bookings revenue was up 37% to $2.7 billion. As Marc mentioned, we signed 2 ITWorks contracts and 1 RevWorks contract in the quarter. These contributed to the percent of our bookings from long-term contracts being 34%, which is slightly above historical levels. But recall, that Q4 of last year also had 2 ITWorks contracts and a RevWorks contract, so had a similar mix. These contracts are clearly not our only large contracts as we had an all-time high level of 32 contracts over $5 million, including a record 19 over $10 million.","Another driver of the strength in bookings and revenue this quarter was strong results from our DeviceWorks organization. 2011 was a breakthrough year for DeviceWorks as our client's interest in using Cerner as a single source for connected devices increased and more device manufacturers look to us to be resellers because they recognize the value of our device connectivity platform and the strategic relationships we have with our clients. We have been saying for several years that DeviceWorks concept to flat to declining trend of traditional hardware sales, and we saw this play out this year as essentially all of the 39% growth in total technology sales in 2011 was driven by device resell. This strength came from broad sources, including CareFusion, Pyxis, medication dispensing devices, RxStation, infusion pumps, beds and monitoring devices.","Another highlight for Q4 and the year was the traction we gained in the small hospital market with our CommunityWorks offering. Recall that CommunityWorks is our staff offering for small and critical care hospitals where we leverage our hosting and services capabilities to provide a complete suite of clinical and financial solutions at a very competitive price. In 2011, we added over 20 new small hospital footprints and expect this to accelerate in 2012.","Moving to our physician solutions. We had a strong Q4 that contributed to the best year in our history, with ambulatory bookings growing 60% in 2011. I believe this strength is the result of enhancements we have made to our solutions over the past few years, coupled with the marketplace's desire to have an integrated solution across inpatient and outpatient venues. Evidence of this trend is that we continue to partner with many of our clients in our installed base to extend our solutions to their employed and affiliated physicians. In 2011 alone, we partnered with 42 of our large health system clients to offer physician solutions. In many cases, our clients are displacing an existing ambulatory EHR supplier so they can move to our integrated offering. The recently announced expansion of our relationship with Adventist Health to include 130 outpatient clinics is a good example of this.","In addition to this example, we are replacing the ambulatory solutions of our primary inpatient competitor. We also displaced all the major best-of-breed ambulatory competitors at least once in 2011. We believe this trend will continue as we have several large clients that chose best-of-breed ambulatory providers in the last 3 to 5 years that are now coming back to the market for an integrated solution.","Additionally, significant greenfield still exists in the market, and we're well positioned for this opportunity as well. Our competitive position in both the replacement and greenfield opportunities will be further strengthened by our constant focus on enhancing our solutions to improve the physician experience and productivity with PowerChart Touch, and our Project Go initiative, which Mike will discuss in more detail.","Moving to our global results. As Marc mentioned, we had a strong quarter outside the U.S. as well, with 35% revenue growth in Q4. After a slow start to the year, these strong results bring the full year growth to 7%. Overall, we continue to see gradual improvements in most global markets, and we had strong years in Canada, Australia and the Middle East. The strength in the Middle East included an agreement with Hamad Medical Corporation to digitize the entire public health system of Qatar. This agreement significantly expands our leadership position in the region and strengthens our position for other large opportunities. In England, despite continuing coverage of changes to the National Programme, we are continuing to execute. In Q4, our [indiscernible] contract was extended, and we expanded our relationship with 2 trusts. Going forward, we believe we are well-positioned for growth in the U.K. as we expect more opportunities to sell directly in all trust -- in all regions.","Moving to the overall marketplace and our competitiveness, we gained share again in Q4 with 35% of bookings coming from outside of our core Millennium installed base. For the last year, 32% of our bookings were from outside our base, which is up from 28% last year. We continue to see significant new footprint opportunities. While many hospitals will use their existing supplier to get to Stage 1 of Meaningful Use, we expect many of them to switch suppliers as they face the rising bars for Stage 2, Stage 3 and additional requirements for Value-Based Purchasing, ACOs and data analytics capabilities. With 2 major installed base largely up for grabs due to challenges with transitioning to new platforms and  uncertainty around their ability to keep up with future requirements, we believe we are still in the early stages of a multiyear market share shift. And since only one competitor presents a consistent challenge, we have a great opportunity to gain a significant share of those vulnerable installed bases in the coming years.","I'm also pleased that we had our best win rate against our single toughest competitor in 2011, and I believe this will continue to improve for 2 reasons. First, we have already enhanced and are making significant incremental improvements in the one area that has historically led to their success, the physician experience. We now offer a very competitive physician experience and believe our efforts this year with Project Go and PowerChart Touch will change the game in our favor. Second, we strongly believe we are the smart choice for anyone looking beyond the early stages of Meaningful Use. Our investments in interoperability, data analytics and our Healthe Intent platform provide a meaningful differentiator against a company that has a platform that makes interoperability and data analytics very challenging. From a macro view, while we recognize health care is likely to be targeted as part of the solution to the U.S. deficit, we believe the stimulus plan will remain intact, and other programs such as Value-Based Purchasing to drive ongoing IT adoption. While some level of cuts to our clients funding are likely, we expect any future adjustments to be tied to quality and outcomes, which will make IT adoption essential for organizations looking to remain competitive.","In summary, I'm very pleased with our record results in 2011, and I think we are well positioned for a strong 2012 and beyond.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike.","Michael R. Nill","Thanks, Zane. Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'm going to discuss ITWorks, RevWorks and Cerner's areas of focus for 2012. Let's start with ITWorks which had a great Q4 that included 2 new ITWorks clients bringing our total to 9. One of them is a long-term client that chose to expand their relationship with Cerner by adding both CernerWorks hosting and ITWorks. The second client is brand new to Cerner and chose Cerner to displace their existing EMR provider and to provide hosting and ITWorks services.","This is a second example where ITWorks being part of a new client win, and it demonstrates that ITWorks is not just something we sell into our base, but it's also a part of our competitive differentiation. The success of our existing ITWorks clients is a key factor in the decision-making process for potential clients. Future clients can directly observe the speed of progress against clinical roadmaps, and they can easily conclude that ITWorks' alignment with Cerner is very powerful. It is the best way to accelerate their path to Meaningful Use and to ensure compliance with future regulatory requirements.","Another noteworthy observation about ITWorks is that almost all of our ITWorks clients have executed some form of scope expansion since their initial contract. In total, we had over $50 million worth of scope expansion contracts in 2011. This activity proves the benefit of the tighter alignment that is created with ITWorks and is evidence that there's still room to grow after the initial ITWorks relationship is established.","Moving to RevWorks, we also signed a RevWorks client in Q4. This marks our fourth RevWorks client and is a critical access hospital that chose RevWorks. The signing was an existing CommunityWorks client that is already live with a suite of clinical and revenue cycle solutions. The RevWorks relationship allows them to advance their current system and deploy new capabilities to optimize revenue and generate cost savings.","In addition to adding a RevWorks client, we also had a great deal of success in 2011 with clients increasing adoption of our revenue cycle solutions and services that can become the foundation for a broader RevWorks relationship. In total, our revenue cycle bookings more than doubled over 2010 levels, with the strength driven by patient accounting, access management, care management and health information management. We also continue to execute operationally, and in 2011, we brought patient accounting live at 31 hospitals and 95 clinics. We now have a total of 76 hospitals and 365 clinics live.","Looking ahead, we remain confident that revenue cycle will be a big contributor to our long-term growth. We are building a good foundation in our installed base and are increasing penetration of core revenue cycle solutions and establishing strong examples with our initial RevWorks clients. We also believe that as the industry shifts from the current volume-based reimbursement model to a value-based quality model, providers will increasingly look to clinical solution providers that can offer integrated revenue cycle solutions versus relying on standalone solutions.","In summary, we remain bullish about the outlook for all of our works offerings. We believe strongly that if we provide high-quality services that deliver superior value to our clients, these offerings will create an outstanding value proposition and client adoption will accelerate. The key element that makes these offerings compelling is that they do not require incremental spending by our clients. They're just shifting existing spending to Cerner and getting better performance for the same dollars. We have proven this model with CernerWorks over the last decade and now, our new works offerings are following the same pattern.","Before handing the call over to Jeff, I wanted to discuss our 2012 imperatives that I recently shared with our clients as I think they are relevant to everyone on the call as well. The imperatives are: drive Meaningful Use adoption; dramatically improve physician experience with our solutions; and powering population health management.","First, Meaningful Use continued to be a very powerful driver across our client base in 2011 and will continue to be the focus of significant activity in 2012 and beyond. By the end of 2012, the majority of our clients will have attested for Stage 1. The Meaningful Use wave of activity combined with ICD-10 will require our entire client base to migrate to our current version of software, which is a big undertaking, but also very positive from an ongoing support standpoint. In the process, we will significantly impact workflows and activities of our clients' physicians, and it's imperative that we make this a smooth process and provide the best experience possible.","This leads me to our second imperative, dramatically improve physician experience with our solutions. Meaningful Use has driven and will continue to drive physician adoption at unprecedented levels. We believe we have the best underlying technology to support Meaningful Use. And, with the acceleration of physician adoption, we continue to increase our focus on physician productivity and physician experience. During the health conference in 2011, Neal launched Project Go and PowerChart Touch. The core message and driving principles behind these efforts are to make the solutions fast, smart and easy. We're focused on speeding up workflows, reducing clicks and ensuring our solutions provide each user with the information they need at the right point in the workflow in the context of the person, condition and venue. We are building applications that require limited training and support the natural movement of the user throughout the day across the tablet, desktop and phone. In short, we are focused on enabling health care delivery anytime and anywhere.","Meaningful Use is just but one set of requirements in a growing wave of measures and mandates that will continue to impact our clients in the future. Cerner's focus is to future-proof our clients' organizations by providing the technology to withstand changes in reimbursement models and the associated quality and regulatory reporting requirements.","This brings me to our third imperative for 2012, powering population health management. The current narrative uses terms like medical home and Accountable Care Organizations. Our population health management solutions will help our clients exchange and aggregate clinical data to support the advanced analytics required to predict and prescribe the patterns of care that deliver the higher highest quality outcomes at the lowest cost. This is where our competitive differentiation begins to widen.","In summary, we executed very well in 2011, and we're set up for 2012 to be a year that includes significant growth in our client adoption and substantial advancements in Cerner's capabilities and competitiveness.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeffrey A. Townsend","Thanks, Mike. Today, my comments are going to pick up where Mike left off and expand on how we are getting ready for the second order effects [indiscernible] as health care is digitized. In 2011, we made good progress on this front and are focused in 2012 on future-proofing our client's readiness for measures and mandates as well as facilitating population health management as a continuation of this progress. As we have discussed, we are building a meta data layer agnostic to the source EMR to better position our clients for the increasing use of quality standards, performance measures, interoperability and managing the health of populations. We call this layer Healthe Intent, and 2011 was a foundational year for this platform.","In just over a year, our Chart Search efforts went from a nascent offering to having 115 clients engaged. We are currently adding about 6 million documents and 150 million results on a daily basis, quickly building foundational data for the Healthe Intent platform. There are several differentiators when comparing the Healthe Intent platform to other attempts to aggregate and analyze data. Interoperability is a key one. By being EMR agnostic, we can operate in the reality that not all information will come out of the Cerner source system. We have already proven leadership in the area of interoperability with our Cerner Network and health information exchange offerings, which create better clinical integration and coordination of care by facilitating secure electronic flow of data between hospitals, physician practices and other stakeholders regardless of the EHR system being used. We exited 2011 with approximately 100 million clinical and financial transactions being sent across this network each month. This is double the level of transactions from a year ago.","Another differentiator of Healthe Intent is we were able to capture research, evidence and claims data that when combined with real-time clinical data from the EHR, significantly enhances the power of the platform. We can be predictive and help identify risks as they occur, so care plans can be changed versus just reporting on them after it is too late. The key element of our ability to be predictive is the deployment of agents across the Healthe Intent platform. Concurrent with the rapid growth in data being captured on our platform, we are deploying sophisticated machine-learning algorithms to support mapping of clinical concepts and clinical decision support agents such as sepsis. And to advance this progress we recently launched Cerner Math, which is an initiative aimed at accelerating our ability to discover and develop clinical agents using a hybrid of published evidence on our Health Facts research platform. These tools will be critical to our clients as the health care landscape evolves to having payments tied to quality, outcomes and the ability to manage the health of populations. The dynamic nature of these changes to reimbursement structures will require the ability to quickly adapt to new requirements. As a result, we believe our cloud deployment model is important because we can help our clients be ready for the next requirement without major upgrades or implementation projects.","In closing, I'd remind you of the Wednesday investment community event at HIMSS, as Zane, Mike and I have outlined, there's a lot of innovation now coming to the surface not only in the EMR and physician space, but also in interoperability, population management and new care delivery models beyond the enterprise. We will be using this year's event to formally launch several of these new solutions. We've made great progress in 2011 at building a foundation that will help future-proof our clients while also positioning Cerner for the next wave.","Now I'd like to open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator",".","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from the line of Jamie Stockton from Morgan Keegan.","Jamie Stockton - Morgan Keegan & Company, Inc., Research Division","I guess maybe the first one, Zane, as far as Stage 2 is concerned, do you guys have any expectation for when the rules are going to come out or be proposed and then maybe when demand related to that is really going to kick off?","Zane M. Burke","Sure, Jamie. I think the -- we anticipate the final ruling coming out here by the end of February. And obviously, we've been working based on the drafts as they exist today. We expect the final ruling here in February. We're seeing demand based on Stage 2 today, mostly in the new business area where you're seeing clients that are thinking about making changes after they get to Stage 1 on some -- either an ED system or on a competitors' element, but don't feel good about where they're headed down in -- for the future. The other piece of that is you'll see significant opportunity for us in our existing client base around a couple of particular areas that will drive up the quality reporting, analytics. And then there's some areas around physician documentation and meds administration that will provide opportunities in our core client base as well. So we would anticipate that once those are finalized, that, that will help drive additional demand.","Jamie Stockton - Morgan Keegan & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then I guess maybe, Marc, it looks like the service expense base grew a fair amount sequentially during the quarter. Obviously, you guys are signing more outsourcing deals. But are you hiring a fair amount there ahead of some of these deals? If you could give us any color on that, that'd be great.","Marc G. Naughton","Yes, I think it is twofold, Jamie. We do have, obviously, when we have ITWorks deals get signed, we pull those people into our services organization, and that is a quick bump of the number of people that hits that line right away. We've also been hiring aggressively during 2011 based on our backlog and pipeline of work that we see for primarily implementation services. So we've been adding costs. As when we get to our Analyst Day and investor meeting at HIMSS, we'll talk a little bit about the contribution margins you're seeing from that business, and one of the things that we're proud of is the level we're driving it from that business in the year where we actually incurred a bunch of expense, bringing people on, getting them trained. But now, all those people that we brought on are ready to go for 2012. We don't expect to hire as many people for '12. It'll be dependent on what the activity is. If the activity continues to increase, we'll certainly hire a certain level, but I think we're really well positioned to get those people billable and out on jobs. So that's the expense increase you saw both from the ITWorks and from bringing on people that were getting trained or ready to go out in the field.","Operator","Your next question is coming from the line of George Hill from Citigroup.","George Hill - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Marc, I want to follow up on one of Jamie's points and did I hear you right, that gross margin in the quarter deteriorated a bit on an increasing mix of services, and now that I thought I understood your comment in the last question to be that you've brought in a bunch more people. Any anticipation of new services business coming online, plus other associates that get put into the field? Should we then think of gross margins as having the ability to expand again in 2012 as opposed to the deterioration we saw the last 2 quarters?","Marc G. Naughton","Well, the really -- the key for the gross margin level, there is 2 components. The key component clearly is our DeviceWorks and the resale of those devices. The higher component of that and the higher cost and the lower margins is clearly the primary driver. The statement relative to services is basically for RevWorks and people that we bring in. And some of the RevWorks deals, we didn't hire the people directly. We actually -- they remain employed by the health system, but we're basically hiring them as consultants outside of Cerner. And so those costs go into our cost of goods sold and to get to our gross margin. So it's those 2 elements. And clearly, we had a great year, so there's going to be an element of higher commissions that will go into that cost line that gets us to gross margins. So kind of in a decreasing order of those are the 3 elements that impact that. We actually continue to see those things to be going forward, so we think that the level you've seen in the last couple of quarters is an appropriate level. And obviously, I would point out that relative to our operating margins, we were still successful in growing our operating margins even with some of the lower gross margins and we expect to be -- continue to be able at these kind of level of gross margins that we expect to see going forward as in Q3 and 4, to continue doing the 100 to 200 basis points growth at the operating margin level. So we're very comfortable with that. We think gross margins are kind of at a fairly consistent level for a period here, and that's all right with us.","George Hill - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I appreciate that color, and then maybe a quick follow-up for Mike. Mike, it sounded like with respect to ICD-10 and the rollout of new financial software packages, there doesn't seem to be a new license opportunity for people who are on service and maintenance, but it sounds like you might be able to take a service and maintenance increase on that. Did I hear that right?","Michael R. Nill","Yes, that's -- that is correct. We expect there's going to be a significant services opportunity for us as our clients move through ICD-10 and try to control their revenue and maximize the potential there. So we see a -- an opportunity for us in the future.","Operator","Your next question is coming from the line of Glen Santangelo from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I was wondering if I could just ask a quick question on Health Information Exchange marketplace. I mean, you've clearly discussed this in some detail in the past, and I know you've had some success on the private side of things. But maybe could you give us an update in terms of the public side of things? I know you mentioned obviously some of your competitors maybe have issues with interoperability. Doesn't seem like that's an issue for Cerner, but could you just maybe give your assessment of that marketplace and how we maybe evolve from here?","Michael R. Nill","Yes, it's -- I guess a wide variety of options out there. Starting back at the stimulus level, every state has to stand up or come up with a exchange alternative. And so if you start at that level, you'll see a variety of states trying to actually invest in technology and have their own offering for the broader public to states that are just certifying or coming up with a short list of named existing, what you would call, private networks that they're going to sponsor or certify. So at the macro level, every state has an objective to go complete and stand that up to get the dollars associated with it. At the federal level, the ONC is also driving a fair amount of activity, trying to push what they call the Direct Project, which initially is messaging, and that's something Cerner's been very, very heavily involved in and contributed well over half the open source to that effort. At the individual Cerner existing client level, really, anybody that has more than one facility, or more than one care delivery venue, is creating their own private network as well. So I think that if you look at other industries, whether you want to look at telco, cable, all of these kind of follow a similar pattern of there will be a lot of these networks to begin with. And then there's likely to either be consolidation or the standards will take over to where it's more plug and play. But right now, it's relatively chaotic environment, driven by Meaningful Use is requiring you to be able to share. And so it is almost a zip code by zip code thing, to answer that question.","Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. Maybe if I can ask one quick follow-up question on Stage 2. I know we're sitting here waiting for the criteria to be announced, and, obviously, maybe we'll see a pickup in demand after that criteria comes out. But my question is more around the delay of it. Are you seeing any changes in your customers' behavior, like a willingness to maybe switch vendors or pursue a different strategy kind of given the delays in getting to Stage 2?","Zane M. Burke","Glen, this is Zane. I think it's been nothing but beneficial for us in terms of the delay of the Stage 2 enforcement elements of it, and it's allowing some of the marketplaces, some of the platforms, as we've discussed about -- we've discussed that have either been sunsetted or are struggling, some are competitor's platforms that are struggling. It's allowing our clients the opportunity and prospects, the opportunity to go back and take another look at what their strategy should look like.","Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And then maybe -- I appreciate that, and this is my last question and I'll jump off, hey, Marc, the company's sitting with over $1.1 billion in cash now. I know in the past that we've talked about potential acquisitions or small ones and potentially trying to gain access to their installed base. But the company seems to be doing a good job of winning market share in its own right. So what would you foresee the uses of those cash a couple of years down the road?","Marc G. Naughton","Well, Glen, I think the opportunity to do acquisitions is regardless of whether it's market share or interesting technology that could, we could bundle with Millennium is going to increase. I think in an environment where increasingly the enterprise delivery systems from a technology standpoint are going to be the winners, there's going to be a lot of interesting niche technology whose owners as a company are not going to really have a long-term future ahead of them. So we think there's a lot of opportunity to go be acquisitive in an appropriate way. I agree with your comment that our market share purchases, we talked about that having a useful life. There could still be something there that would be interesting, but we are being very successful in going into the other bases. So I think we're going to continue to hold the cash, focus on ways that we can invest it. I think there's going to be a lot more opportunities than we've talked about publicly that can come up. And as a cash buyer in this market, given that private equity is -- having difficulty getting access to capital, I think we're in a really good position to take advantage of what we think could be a buyers' market coming up. So we're going to keep the cash; we're going to keep looking for opportunities and ways to invest it. And certainly, over the long term, if we don't find a better way to use that money to drive benefit to our shareholders, we\u2019d look at returning it to the shareholders in some form or fashion. But I think over the -- certainly over the next year or 2, there are going to be opportunities that I want to continue to hold that cash balance.","Operator","Your next question is coming from the line of Sebastian Paquette from Goldman Sachs.","Sebastian Paquette - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So my first question is just on the performance analytics market. And while you're giving Sepsis away for free right now, I'm wondering when you're expecting to GA your excess free Admissions product and any initial thoughts on pricing and maybe what proportion of your clients you might expect to purchase the software.","Marc G. Naughton","Yes, this is Marc. I think it's probably a little early to go into a lot of detail. Obviously, our focus right now is getting search out there, getting the infrastructure, the delivery system created, the -- getting our clients used to accessing the cloud for data, which is a little bit different from what they've done historically. I think certainly, we'll start talking about that at the appropriate time. But to try to go into pricing and those types of things at this point is a little premature. I don't know that we've really nailed that down, and certainly, our expectation is to have a portfolio of those solutions available. And obviously, that will impact the pricing as to how we bundle those. So good question. It's just probably little early for us to be able to provide really a definitive answer yet.","Zane M. Burke","The only thing I'd add is that you will see us demonstrate and show the -- some of the other things in that portfolio at HIMSS, so you'll get a better feel for what the next set of solutions that aren't free look like.","Sebastian Paquette - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And if you take a look at the latest CMS data, about half of eligible hospitals in the U.S. have not yet registered for the Meaningful Use program. And I'm wondering, and assuming that not all of these unregistered hospitals have fully implemented HCIT, I'm just wondering what you, from your vantage point, what you\u2019d attribute this lag to compared to the earlier adopters? And then how would you see this later adopter market segment start to show up in your bookings?","Zane M. Burke","This is Zane. I think there's a couple of things. I think first off, there's that part where the change in some of the incentives in terms of there not being an incentive to go little early, created an environment and where some of the hospitals waited for a year to actually attest. So we anticipate in our own client base to be a very significant portion of our own client base will attest in 2012. The other piece of that is this later adopter element, where I think there was some feeling of whether the government would continue to fund it as checks have gotten written. As checks have gotten written, then I believe those clients are coming into the marketplace and saying that they want their share as well. So what they were avoiding was a -- the concern over at -- Cash for Clunkers, and clearly, that did not come about. We are seeing our clients receive their checks in the -- were well in the hundreds of millions of dollars.","Marc G. Naughton","Hey, this is Marc. One other thing that is kind of interesting is that we discussed the strategy of health care to get them to Stage 1 of Meaningful Use with an existing supplier. So you're going to see that list probably at the top of it, Meditech and some other companies that we've talked about that might be challenged having gotten their clients to Stage 1. We think those are additional opportunities. So just because someone's on that list, doesn't mean that they're not a future client for Cerner Corporation. So I think it's -- you've got to look at that as -- it's interesting data, but it doesn't mean that those people have made a final decision.","Sebastian Paquette - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got you. And then just -- one last question here, going back to the additional hirings in 2011, am I in the ballpark of assuming that they're roughly 1,000 additional associates hired on just over 8,000 total base as of the last 10-K filing? And I'm wondering, do you expect to continue that pace of hiring in 2012? Or should you start to see that hiring pace decline?","Marc G. Naughton","Yes, I think relative to headcount, I think when we file our next 10-K, you'll note that we hired almost 2,000 people net in 2011. So I think, certainly, that was a huge year for hiring. In 2012, the opportunities are there. We will continue to hire where we add 2,000 people. I don't know if that's going to be the case, but we are fortunate to be in a position and have a training program set up where we can bring new people in on a very, just-in-time type of basis, where we're not having to put them on the bench for a period of time. We can sign a contract, know we're going to need resources in 90 to 180 days, and then bring those people on board, get them trained so that they're available to do that. And clearly, as we do more of the ITWorks businesses, we rebadge those people to Cerner. So we will, in that case, it will be chunk of associates that joined Cerner kind of en masse. So a part of that hiring that's going to approach 2,000 for 2011 relates to the ITWorks transactions that we did during that year. So there's 2 elements that are really driving that as I talked earlier, Services business and ITWorks. But I think we've -- certainly, if that's something that you're interested in doing as a profession, our resume factory is open.","Operator","Your next question is coming from the line of Donald Hooker from Morgan Stanley.","Donald Hooker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So I was intrigued by the momentum you guys have picked up in the ambulatory side. I know that's a small part of your business. I was wondering if you could provide a little bit, I'm just curious in terms of to what extent of that growth is replacing other vendors? You commented that there was some rip and replaces as you create more integrated health care IT systems. Is a large percent of that growth rip and replaces or is a lot of it greenfield?","Zane M. Burke","This is Zane. At -- on the large systems, those are typically a replacement marketplace, so you see that where you have our integrated delivery networks, they've typically have, made a selection, some sort of selection. Those are typically a rip and replace. There is a large amount of greenfield opportunity in the smaller physician practices out there as well. So there's -- it's divergent based on where you are in the demand curve.","Donald Hooker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","But you're basically marketing those ambulatory products almost exclusively through your inpatient customers?","Zane M. Burke","No, actually, we're not. We're in both spaces, very active in both.","Donald Hooker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And when -- then I'll just ask one more. I was also intrigued by the pickup in the international revenues. I guess for the past couple of years, international's been -- their global has been somewhat of a dilutive to your top line growth rate. As you look into next year and you gave some guidance there, is that -- is international growth going to kind of catch up to the overall consolidated growth? I saw you had a big deal in Qatar, and it seems like you had some good momentum there. Can you talk about the geographic mix for '12?","Marc G. Naughton","Yes, this is Marc. I think we'll -- it should be probably similar to what we saw in 2011. You certainly -- it's based on the economies of the countries. We certainly see -- saw in Europe in that area that they're not rolling out a lot of RFPs for new projects because of the lack of funding. The U.K., we're doing okay in, but there's not a lot of new projects coming online. We're well positioned when they do come online. But when you look at the Middle East, you look at Australia, you look at Canada. Those economies are doing well and they certainly are helping contribute to getting some growth in our global business on a year-over-year basis. I think probably the slight growth that we see in 2011 over 2010 is more -- as much a factor for relative to an easy comparable as it is to really great performance. But I think we've gone insane. We hope to see some, a little bit of growth in that business. I think when you look across some of those regions, there are potential for some significant procurements. Obviously, Qatar is a good example of getting countrywide support for a health -- from a health system perspective. There are larger countries certainly in that region that would look to do something similar. So I think it's going to -- global, I don't think it's certainly going to reach our overall revenue growth level that we saw as a company. But I don't think it's going to be a significant drag if we can continue moving that forward in mid to upper single digits, we'd be okay with that for next year.","Operator","Your next question is coming from the line of Atif Rahim from JPMorgan.","Atif A Rahim - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","If I could just follow up a little bit on that prior question about the ambulatory market. You talked about it for a couple of quarters now, but any way you could provide some tangible metrics on how large your footprint is there, what percentage of bookings it might be contributing, how you're actively going after the smaller market since, I think Zane, you mentioned that?","Marc G. Naughton","Yes, this is Marc. Relative to what it contributes, as we've indicated, it's a very small component of our total revenue profile. I think if you try to go say what kind of market share we have relative to all of our health system docs and all the independent docs that we pull up, it's going to be in the single digits or as a percent. So I think that overall, it's a good market. It's going to need IT. We don't have the big footprint in it. We have a nice footprint. We're pleased with where we're at. But the growth of that business on a percentage basis, while not being a huge mover to either [ph] on top line overall for the company, has got a great future potential. So I think -- it's if I'm not -- I think I'm not sure if I'm giving you that good of data, but fairly small market share here, expect to continue to grow and we're going to be pushing both on the health systems side and going basically door-to-door, if you will, and fighting for the individual providers who, to date, are still really, in our mind, a greenfield opportunity.","Atif A Rahim - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Got it. So probably view it as a tailwind, but not necessarily moving the needle at this point. Separate question, I guess, staying on that footprint, what's your footprint like on ITWorks or RevWorks just in terms of total hospitals at this point?","Marc G. Naughton","Really small in total. I mean, we have 11 ITWorks clients at this point, actually, 9 ITWorks clients at this point. So relative to the opportunity just in our base, we think that's -- that, that has the opportunity to expand. I don't know that it\u2019s exponentially, but we would expect by the end of the decade to have 50 to 70 of those clients up from the 9 we have today, and that wouldn't be getting all of our client base. So the interesting thing that we did not expect to see in the ITWorks business is that not only are we selling to existing clients to kind be their -- that next up to getting really going fast to getting an all Cerner shop. We're seeing a lot of new clients wanting to go directly into an ITWorks relationship because they go visit clients, that our existing clients that have it, they see the benefits of us managing all their technology from the outset and fixing some of their problems that they're dealing with at this point. So I think that's -- that gives you a little bit of a view. I think, clearly, when we have our Investor Day, we're going to give you a view of ITWorks in the future view that we did last time we've refined that a little bit. So we can kind of give you a 20\/20 outlook for what some of those businesses look like. But today, that's a very good progress to date on something that's very new for us. But we think that's got a lot of opportunity for growth.","Zane M. Burke","One interesting comment around the new client ITWorks that we added  this quarter is that was actually a selection that was made by -- a competitor selection about 15 months ago and they failed at moving forward. And basically, our ITWorks model being so prescriptive and having such a high level of both delivery of results and client satisfaction drove the new business and to make a change in the platform within 15 months. And so it's just -- it's proof of our theory and what we're seeing in terms of we think the marketplace is subject to change and up for grabs.","Atif A Rahim - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, that's very interesting color, helpful. So one last, clarifying question, if I could. Did I hear you say that the bookings mix from the long-dated contracts was about the same at 34% on a year-over-year basis?","Marc G. Naughton","Yes, you\u2019ve probably seen us around 29% on average if you go across. And this quarter, we were at 34%, so slightly over that. But it's kind of in that --","Zane M. Burke","On Q4 is yes.","Marc G. Naughton","Yes, on Q4.","Operator","Your next question is coming from the line of Ryan Daniels from William Blair.","Ryan Daniels - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Maybe for Zane and Marc, a lot of discussion on the call tonight about the move towards more shared savings models and increasing technology demands at Stage 2, Stage 3 Meaningful Use and how that will create opportunities. I'm curious, number one, are you seeing that as the stimulus checks are cut and some of the hospitals get those Stage 1 Meaningful Use dollars, is that when they're coming back to the market in the pipeline? And if so, is that a trend you think will accelerate in 2012 as more of the dollars start to flow to that client base?","Zane M. Burke","We are seeing where clients are interestingly using those dollars to actually procure even things that aren't related to Stage 1, Stage 2 or Stage 3. They've, in fact, lab was one of our \u2013- had one of our best years as a lab company. And lab is not specifically in the Stage 1, Stage 2, Stage 3 elements. But what we've seen is clients come and use those Meaningful Use dollars to come back and round out their solution sets in other ways, so yes, it's clearly is adding capital into the system as they've seen those dollars.","Ryan Daniels - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","What about if you look at the new footprints? I mean if you look at the potential disruption or turmoil in the marketplace and getting net new wins in the acute market, are you seeing a direct correlation to some of these clients getting Meaningful Use dollars and then making a switch to Cerner? Or is it not that directly correlated?","Zane M. Burke","They are directly correlated so that's why you're seeing the Stage 1 attestations coming forward and they're using those dollars to go out and make selections which will carry them for the long haul past Stage 1.","Ryan Daniels - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then another follow-up there. Just want, lot of talk again about the ACOs and population health management. Obviously, a big piece of that will be the care delivered outside of the ambulatory and acute markets so in post-acute care, Lpacks [ph], et cetera. Are you seeing a pickup in demand there? I know you had a nice contract with HealthSouth, but are you seeing more activity in the non-acute market as well, given all the things that are taking place in the reimbursement front?","Zane M. Burke","Yes, I actually have been engaged in a fair amount of activity and we're the best positioned of any of the major players in this space and particularly, our single primary competitor in both the homecare, hospice and long-term care space.","Operator","Your final question will be coming from the line of Sean Wieland from Piper Jaffray.","Sean W. Wieland - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","I want to go back to RevWorks. Did I catch you right and did you say that you took 31 hospitals live on patient accounting in the quarter or was that the year?","Michael R. Nill","That's correct, for the year.","Sean W. Wieland - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","That was for the year. Okay, so all right, that's -- that makes sense. So can you talk a little bit about what that competitive landscape looks like when you're competing for the patient accounting deals? And within your base of customer, who holds the largest footprint of patient accounting systems within the Cerner client base?","Michael R. Nill","Well the -- what we see is as many of our new clients are selecting Cerner revenue cycle as part of their selection process upfront, so many, if not most, of our new footprints include revenue cycle as part of that upfront. And so you're competing at the broad-based enterprise level, clinical and financial systems. In our existing install base, probably Seimens and McKesson would be the largest other financial systems providers, current state.","Sean W. Wieland - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay. And do you see -- would you say that there's an upper grade cycle overall, industry wide upgrade cycle underway there? How do you think about that market?","Michael R. Nill","I feel -- we feel really very good about that market, that there's going to be good opportunity there. There will be some elements around ICD-10, which may cause that marketplace to not accelerate as quickly as we would like it to see it, and think that, that may happen around some of the accountable care type elements which will drive a lot of revenue cycle selections in our minds. But ICD-10 has to be factored into the overall timeline there.","Marc G. Naughton","Sean, this is Marc. I think certainly, with ICD-10, with pay-for-performance, all of those elements, over time, people are going to want a clinically driven revenue cycle. And so we would expect our client base to, over time, evolve to a Cerner patient accounting system, Cerner revenue cycle. A lot of our clients today, that our existing clients might not have us in all their facilities. But it's certainly interesting that all the new clients a lot of them are purchasing to have a single platform to run both their financials and their clinicals, we think that's probably the trend going forward.","Sean W. Wieland - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay. And then just unrelated question, Marc, any thoughts on the outlook for bookings growth in 2012?","Marc G. Naughton","Yes, I think certainly, Q1 we're looking at double-digit growth relative to bookings. I think it's important from a bookings perspective to realize we just grew bookings 44% last quarter, $200 million over our guidance range. Q1's always the seasonally lower quarter, so double-digit growth in a quarter that the prior year had a 30% growth is we think, pretty good guidance. It is absolutely our expectation to grow bookings in 2012 over our 2011 levels. Thank you, all, for your attention. I appreciate it. Have a good evening.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day."],"5073":["Cerner Corp (NASDAQ:CERN) Q4 2019 Earnings Conference Call February  4, 2020  4:30 PM ET","Company Participants","Brent Shafer - Chairman & CEO","Marc Naughton - EVP & CFO","John Peterzalek - EVP & Chief Client Officer","Donald Trigg - EVP, Strategic Growth","Conference Call Participants","Robert Jones - Goldman Sachs","Kevin Caliendo - UBS Investment Bank","Charles Rhyee - Cowen and Company","Rivka Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley","Jeffrey Garro - William Blair & Company","Sean Wieland - Piper Sandler & Co.","Sean Dodge - RBC Capital Markets","George Hill - Deutsche Bank","Eric Percher - Nephron Research","Operator","Welcome to the Cerner Corporation Fourth Quarter 2019 Conference Call. Today's date is February 4, 2020, and this call is being recorded. ","The company has asked me to remind you that various remarks made here today constitute forward-looking statements including, without limitation, those regarding projections of future revenues or earnings, operating margins, operating and capital expenses, bookings, new solutions, services and offering development and capital allocation plans, cost optimization and operational improvement initiatives, future business outlook including new markets or prospects for the company's solutions and services and the expected benefits of certain of our acquisition or other collaborations. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements. Please see Cerner earnings release, which was filed with the SEC today and posted to the Investors section of cerner.com and other filings with the SEC for additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures discussed in the earnings call can also be found in the company's earnings release. Cerner assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information except as required by law. ","At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Brent Shafer, Chairman and CEO of Cerner Corporation.","Brent Shafer","Thank you, Delim, and good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the call. I'm joining the call from a client event, so I'll start the call with a few comments, then hand it over to the team in Kansas City, including our CFO, Marc Naughton; Chief Client Officer, John Peterzalek; and EVP of Strategic Growth, Don Trigg. ","2019 was an important and productive year for Cerner. We began the year by introducing a new operating model to refine our operational organizational alignment to enhance our client focus and to accelerate scalable innovation to make Cerner easier to do business with. We also initiated a company-wide transformation focused on operating efficiencies, business simplification, portfolio management and refining our growth strategy to position Cerner for long-term profitable growth. Further, we enhanced our governance through the addition of 4 strong Board members, who along with our existing members have been invaluable as we work through our transformation. ","Our 2019 progress is reflected in our fourth quarter results, which included good performance across all key metrics including exceeding our adjusted operating margin target and delivering record free cash flow. We also returned $1.4 billion of capital to shareholders in 2019 through our share buyback program and our first 2 dividend payments, all reflecting our commitment to delivering value to shareholders. ","Also significant in 2019 was the announcement of a multifaceted collaboration with AWS and Amazon. We view this relationship as an enabler to many of the growth strategies we've discussed on previous calls including Cerner's development of a cognitive platform and our evolution to become the Software-as-a-Service health care IT partner. Leveraging the powerful combination of Cerner technology, the AWS infrastructure, their artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities, we expect to create next-generation user experiences and innovations to deliver more predictive patient-centric care. ","Now before turning the call over to Mark, I'd like to discuss Cerner's position on the topic of interoperability, data security and privacy. For several decades, Cerner has been a trusted steward of health information and a leader in the pursuit of data interoperability. We've seen a vocal proponent of -- we have been -- excuse me, a vocal proponent of the 21st Century Cures Act and look forward to continuing our work with the ONC, with clients and with other key stakeholders to ensure a secure flow of information across disparate systems and health care entities. We do this because it's the right thing to do, and I'm reminded of it today, I started my career at Intermountain Healthcare, and this is where I spent the day today talking with other leaders about the future of health and care. And we talked a lot about the fact that health care is too important to stay the same. And I love the chance to get together and collaborate with other organizations like Intermountain, who are working to help people live the healthiest lives possible. ","We fundamentally believe it's wrong to ask patients striving to get better to manage a collection of faxes, PDFs and paper-filled shopping bags. It's wrong to ask providers to leave their workflows to review and leverage relevant patient information. It's wrong to waste hundreds of billions of dollars on the highest administrative costs in the world when we're in the middle of an affordability crisis in the United States health care. So we're going to continue to be a positive voice for change in the industry. Access to the right information at the right time in the right place continues to drive our advocacy in Washington and the global markets we serve. ","In summary, I'm very pleased with everything we accomplished in 2019. We consistently delivered against expectations we set while driving a significant amount of change throughout Cerner. So it's hard work. And I specifically appreciate all the Cerner associates' hard work throughout the year and their contributions to this progress. We have a lot more to do in 2020. We're off to a good start, and I'm optimistic we'll continue to advance our transformation. And more importantly, I believe the work we are doing will position us to create meaningful value in health care while also driving good long-term growth for Cerner. ","And now I'll turn the call over to Marc.","Marc Naughton","Thanks, Brent. Good afternoon, everyone. Before I begin, I did want to cover the most important numbers from the weekend, which are 31 and 20, reflecting the 11 point win for the Super Bowl Champion, Kansas City Chiefs. Go Chiefs! ","Now I'll cover our Q4 results and future period guidance. This quarter, we delivered all key metrics at or above our guidance. I'll start with bookings, which were $1.665 billion in Q4, exceeding the high end of our guidance. This is down from Q4 '18, which was the second highest bookings quarter in our history. Full year bookings were $5.99 billion, which is down from $6.721 billion in 2018. Decline in Q4 and for the year was primarily due to a decline in long-term bookings related to us being more selective on our outsourcing contracts, as we've discussed throughout the year. We ended the quarter with a revenue backlog of $13.71 billion, which is down 10% from a year ago, primarily due to the termination of a RevWorks agreement that I discussed on our Q3 call. Also recall that our backlog calculation of the new revenue standard excludes revenue from contracts with termination clauses, even though such clauses are rarely exercised. When you combine the expected revenue from our backlog and the additional revenue expected from contracts not included in our backlog, our revenue visibility remains at nearly 85% over the next 12 months. ","Revenue in the quarter was $1.442 billion, up 6% over Q4 of '18 and in line with our expectations. Total revenue for the year was $5.693 billion, reflecting growth of 6% over 2018. ","Now I'll go through the business model detail and year-over-year growth compared to Q4 '18 and full year 2018. Licensed software revenue in Q4 grew 5% over Q4 of $18 to $174 million, and full year licensed software revenue grew 11% over 2018 to $681 million, both primarily due to strong growth in our SaaS offerings. Technology resale of $60 million in Q4 increased 31% compared to a weak Q4 of '18. Full year technology resale revenue was up 1% to $247 million. Subscription revenue grew 7% in Q4 to $93 million. Full year subscription revenue was $359 million, up 10% from $326 million in 2018. Professional services revenue grew 9% in Q4 to $509 million, primarily driven by solid growth in implementation services and partially offset by approximately $23 million less revenue due to termination of the RevWorks agreement we previously discussed. Full year professional services revenue grew 10% to $1.992 billion. ","Managed services was up 3% in Q4 to $309 million. Full year managed services revenue was $1.214 billion, an increase of 5% over 2018. Support and maintenance was down 1% to $274 million for the quarter, which is our expectation range and reflects the impact of some past attrition that we discussed last quarter. Full year support and maintenance revenue was also down 1% for 2018 at $1.105 billion. And finally, reimbursed travel of $22 million was down 9% in Q4 and down 2% for the full year at $95 million. ","Looking at revenue by geographic segment. Domestic revenue was up 6% from the year-ago quarter at $1.276 billion, and non-U.S. revenue of $166 million was up 3% from the year-ago quarter. For the full year, domestic revenue grew 7%, and non-U.S. revenue grew 3%. ","Moving to gross margin. Our gross margin for Q4 was 80.8%, down from 81% in Q3 of '19 and 82.6% year-over-year. Full year gross margin of 81.2% is down from 82.5% in 2018. The declines in our quarterly and full year gross margin are both driven by higher third-party services largely related to our federal business and a lower margin mix within technology resale. ","Now I'll discuss spending, operating margin and net earnings. For these items, we provide both GAAP and adjusted or non-GAAP results. The adjusted results exclude share-based compensation expense, acquisition-related adjustments, organizational restructuring and other expenses and other adjustments that are detailed and reconciled to GAAP in our earnings release. ","Looking at our operating spending, our fourth quarter GAAP operating expenses of $982 million were up 2% compared to $965 million in the year-ago period. Full year GAAP operating expenses were $4.021 billion, up 10% from $3.654 billion in 2018. Our adjusted operating expenses were up 4% for the full year with the fourth quarter essentially flat compared to Q4 of '18, reflecting good progress on our cost optimization efforts. ","Looking at the line items for Q4. Sales and client service expense increased 1% in Q4. Software development expense increased 4% over Q4 of '18, driven by a 1% increase in gross R&D, a 7% increase in amortization and a 3% decrease in capitalized software. G&A expense is 15%, driven by a decline in both personnel and non-personnel expenses. Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles decreased slightly year-over-year. ","Moving to operating margins. Our GAAP operating margin in Q4 was 12.7% compared to 12% in the year-ago period. Our adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 20.3%, up from 18.7% in Q4 of '18 and 18.1% last quarter. Our Q4 adjusted operating margin is in line with our expectations and above the 20% adjusted operating margin target for Q4 of '19 that we committed to last April. Our GAAP operating margin for full year 2019 was 10.6% compared to 14.4% in 2018. And our full year adjusted operating margin was 18.5%, which is down slightly from 18.8% last year. ","We believe our ongoing business optimization efforts keep us on track for delivering our targeted Q4 '20 adjusted operating margin of 22.5%. I'd note that some of the margin expansion is expected to be back-end-loaded like last year due to the timing of our initiatives and some seasonality. However, our guidance, which I'll discuss in a minute, does reflect a full year adjusted operating margin of approximately 21%, which is about 250 basis points higher than 2019 and reflects the cumulative impact of all the optimization work we have done and expect to do this year. We also believe we can continue improving profitability beyond 2020 through ongoing optimization efforts and a longer-term opportunity to benefit from platform modernization. ","As we discussed, the benefits from platform modernization will be a multiyear process, particularly for Millennium. And most near-term benefits are largely offset by modernization investments. However, we expect the lower operating costs associated with this move, along with efficiencies and improvements we're driving in our development process, to meaningfully contribute to our profitability while also helping us deliver a differentiated solution to our clients at a lower total cost of ownership. ","Moving to net earnings and EPS. Our GAAP net earnings in Q4 were $154 million or $0.49 per diluted share. It is up from $0.40 in Q4 of '18. For the full year, GAAP net earnings were $529 million or $1.65 per diluted share. Adjusted net earnings in Q4 were $237 million, and adjusted diluted EPS was $0.75 compared to $0.63 in Q4 of '18. For the full year, adjusted net earnings were $862 million, and adjusted diluted EPS was $2.68, up 9% from 2018. Our GAAP tax rate was 19% for the quarter and year. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 20% for the quarter and year. For 2020, we expect our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates to be between 20% and 22%. ","Moving to our balance sheet. We ended Q4 with $542 million of cash and short-term investments, which is down from $633 million last quarter, with our free cash flow being offset by our $75 million acquisition available debt and $300 million of share repurchases in Q4. For the year, we repurchased 18.8 million shares for $1.3 billion at an average price of $69.06, keeping us on track against our plan to repurchase $1.5 billion by the end of Q1 of '20.","Moving to debt. Our total debt remained flat to last quarter at $1.038 billion. Total receivables ended the quarter at $1.14 billion, down from $1.155 billion in Q3 of '19. Our Q4 DSO was 72 days, which is down from 74 days in Q3 of '19 and 79 days in the year-ago period. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $438 million. Q4 capital expenditures were $83 million, and capitalized software was $63 million. Free cash flow defined as operating cash flow less capital purchases and capitalized software development costs was $292 million for the quarter. For the full year, operating cash flow was $1.313 billion. Capital expenditures were $472 million, and capitalized software was $274 million. Full year free cash flow was $568 million, which is down $166 million from 2018, driven by higher capital expenditures and restructuring costs. For 2020, we expect some level of restructuring costs to continue, but we still expect higher operating cash flow and lower CapEx to drive strong free cash flow growth. ","Moving to capital allocation. As I indicated, we repurchased $1.3 billion shares of stock in 2019 and remain on track to meet our targeted level of $1.5 billion by the end of Q1. In December, we announced that our Board authorized the repurchase of an additional $1.5 billion of stock, bringing the total authorized amount available for repurchase up to $1.7 billion. We intend to continue funding these repurchases with a combination of cash from operations and debt, and the timing and amount of repurchases will depend on how much funding is used for other purposes such as acquisitions or investments. ","Moving to our dividend program. We paid our first three quarterly dividends of $0.18 per share on July 26, October 9, January 9. Our quarterly dividend payments and the increased authorization in our share repurchase plan reflect our continued commitment to return capital to shareholders and the belief in Cerner's long-term potential. ","I'd also note that we completed our acquisition of AbleVets in Q4 and have begun to integrate their service offerings into our portfolio to accelerate our success in the federal space. As we've discussed, we expect to be more active in M&A, as we believe there are opportunities that could be foundational to our growth in several of the markets our strategic growth organization is pursuing. I'd also note that our portfolio management efforts are expected to lead to some divestiture activity as we look to create more focus in areas most aligned with our refined growth strategy. ","Now I'll go through guidance. We expect revenue in Q1 to be between $1.415 billion and $1.465 billion. The midpoint of this range reflects growth of 4% over Q1 of '19. For the full year, we expect revenue between $5.725 billion and $5.975 billion with a $5.85 billion midpoint, reflecting 3% growth over 2019. The midpoint of this range is slightly below consensus growth of 4%. We expect this could be due to estimates not fully factoring in the impact of reduced levels of outsourcing bookings in 2019 and our continued approach of being more selective with those types of contracts. ","Also, I'd like to walk you through an organic growth view of 2020. If you adjust for exit from the Adventist Health contract by taking that revenue out of 2019, our 2020 growth would be over 5%. Adjusting our AbleVets revenue would bring pure organic growth back to 4%. But we don't view all of the revenue for AbleVets as inorganic because we expect to leverage their associates and performing on the VA contract as it ramps up. This normally would have been done through organic hiring, but we believe there is value in leveraging their highly qualified workforce. As we've discussed, there will likely be additional actions we take this year that could result in revenue reductions. There is also the potential that we do M&A, which could serve as an offset to divestiture activity. Overall, we do expect there to be several moving parts on the top line in 2020, but we believe the actions we take will set us up for solid and profitable growth. ","Moving to EPS. We expect Q1 adjusted diluted EPS to be $0.69 to $0.71 per share. The midpoint of this range is 15% higher than Q1 of '19. Our adjusted diluted EPS guidance reflects a ramp-up throughout the year that is similar to last year, with the biggest sequential increase in Q4. This reflects the expected timing of ongoing efficiency and operation efforts. For the full year, we expect adjusted diluted EPS to be $3.09 to $3.19, with a $3.14 midpoint reflecting 70% growth over 2019. As I mentioned, we also expect our adjusted operating margin to ramp during the year, with Q4 expected to be slightly higher than our 22.5% target, due primarily to a lower mix of outsourcing revenue. ","I'd also note our expected full year non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 21% is 1% higher than 2019, impacting EPS by about $0.04. ","Moving to bookings guidance. We expect bookings revenue in Q1 of $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion. The midpoint of this range reflects a 3% decrease compared to the first quarter of 2019, driven by an expected decline in long-term bookings. ","In summary, we are pleased with our strong results in the fourth quarter and believe we've made a lot of progress this year. There's a lot of hard work left to meet our profitability and growth targets, but we have a good plan in place and expect to execute it in 2020 and beyond. ","Before I wrap up, I'd like to remind you that we will host our Annual Investment Community Meeting at HIMSS on Tuesday, March 10. If you plan to attend and have not registered, please do so through the link at the top of the Investors section of cerner.com. If you are unable to attend in person, there will be a webcast available. ","With that, I'll turn the call over to John.","John Peterzalek","Thanks, Marc. Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I will provide results, highlights and an update on our federal business. I'll start with our bookings. As Marc mentioned, we delivered bookings ahead of our guidance range for the quarter, driven by strong contributions across multiple segments such as investor owned, academic and IDNs. We also had good contributions from revenue cycle solutions and across our strategic growth businesses, which Don will discuss. ","Consistent with recent quarters, we had a lower level of long-term bookings compared to last year, which drove the decline in overall bookings. For the quarter, the percent of bookings coming from long-term contracts was 29% compared to 38% in Q4 of last year. Long-term bookings for the year represented 28% of total bookings compared to 36% last year, with this decline in long-term bookings driving total bookings down for the year. Bookings excluding long-term contracts increased slightly for the full year. ","Looking at the broader marketplace, many of the same trends continued to play out during 2019, with health care cost growth outpacing the economy; elevated levels of industry consolidation; rising consumer expectations around cost, convenience and service; and the continual gradual evolution of reimbursement models adding to pressure on providers to lower costs and advance their risk-based strategies. These forces are contributing to an overall challenging macro environment. Providers are simultaneously seeking to grow key service lines, drive operational efficiencies to make money at Medicare rates and build out the competencies required to take and effectively manage risk and participation in value-based reimbursement models. Information technology is seen as an enabler of these efforts, which represents an opportunity for Cerner. At the same time, the lower-margin nature of provider businesses can make it difficult to fund required investment, make it important for solutions and services to have a clear return on investment. ","As we look at 2020, we see solid opportunity both in our installed base as well as continuing to gain new clients. This opportunity is reflected in our pipeline, which is up year-over-year for both new business and opportunities for sales back into our base. In our base, we are focused on getting our clients current while also filling out their Cerner solutions suite with a focus on increasing penetration of revenue cycle solutions and solutions supported by our CareAware and HealtheIntent platforms. Our CommunityWorks pipeline remains strong, and we have opportunities outside of our traditional provider base in areas such as state government, employer and long-term post-acute care. ","We also have opportunities to continue growing the presence of our EHR-agnostic CareAware and HealtheIntent solutions beyond our EHR base. ","Moving to our federal business. We continue to advance both our VA and DoD projects. On the VA project, Cerner, along with our VA and our partners, remain focused on initial operating capability, or IOC go-live. We have completed initial integration validation and are doing a significant amount of training and site preparation activities ahead of the scheduled go-live in March. Looking beyond the initial go-live, we also expect to go live at additional IOC sites in 2020 and continue to just steadily scale our work to provide additional value and capabilities to VA in the upcoming quarters. As Marc mentioned, we expect to leverage the AbleVets team as these activities ramp throughout the year. ","We're also making good progress on DoD. We successfully completed the code upgrade during the quarter and kicked off the Coast Guard project in 2 additional deployment waves. Go-lives for these waves are slated for late 2020. ","With that, I'll turn the call over to Don.","Donald Trigg","Thanks, John. Good afternoon, everyone. Our strategic growth organization launched in 2019. Our ambition was a simple one: scale a set of focused business units that position Cerner beyond the hospital, beyond our Cerner Millennium EMR and beyond the traditional fee-for-service payment model. The 6 business units that make up strategic growth, each target large addressable markets in excess of $3 billion, with a path to meaningful share in each market. They gain leverage from existing Cerner assets ranging from the industry-leading data processing and aggregation capabilities of HealtheIntent, to our subject matter expertise around the last-mile EMR workflow. Regulatory requirements are understood, surmountable and offer opportunities for differentiation. All 6 businesses are overweight on recurring revenue and high gross margin potential. And finally, strategic growth leaders focused squarely on speed to revenue as they pursue larger category-leading positions. ","For full year 2019, our strategic growth businesses generated $520 million in revenue, representing 22% growth year-over-year. We believe we can deliver similar growth in 2020 and look forward to our Investor Day at HIMSS in Orlando, which will afford us the opportunity to review the long-term targets for each business. ","As we look at areas of particular strength in 2019, cybersecurity frames our strategic approach. U.S. health care has seen data breaches at a rate of 1 per day. Our technologies are core to how CIOs and CSOs are building out their enterprise strategies. Cyber is an area of growing internal competency, driven in part by our critical work to support armed services and veterans. As a result, our security revenue from health systems grew nearly 40% in 2019. Our provider communications business, leveraging our EMR-agnostic CareAware platform, also benefited from strong market tailwinds and delivered record bookings in 2019. CareAware Connect solution adoption was strong with an over 100% year-over-year increase in utilization to almost 75,000 monthly users. ","We also were pleased with the full year progress in the long-term and post-acute care market with 23% year-over-year growth. Our behavioral health solution within our LT pack suite was a particular bright spot. It delivered almost 40 new footprints, with 80% of total bookings revenue coming from outside our Millennium base. Our unified behavioral health solution is not only strongly differentiated in the market, it also was announced Friday as the 2019 best-in-class category leader. For individuals and families that seek help, our unified Cerner solutions strives to make it easier for providers to deliver the integrated care that successful treatment demands. While LTPAC is an area we sell at the point solution level, it also fits solidly into our larger strategic push to build out our health network strategies in every MSA in the United States and all 5 of our focused global regions. At the technical platform level, our HealtheIntent platform is a strategic lynchpin of our health network efforts. Our market-facing push to drive adoption of HealtheIntent continued to progress in 2019, bringing us to 175 HealtheIntent plants worldwide, including the addition of leading providers like Prospect Health and DaVita health. ","As Brent noted in describing our AWS partnership, HealtheIntent was built as a native cloud platform, is EMR-agnostic and has been recognized by industry analysts like Chilmark as having the best product capabilities in the category. It also has been at the heart of our work with AWS. ","As we move nearly all of our non-federal HealtheIntent clients to AWS public cloud in the first half of 2020, it will establish the clear value proposition of cloud technology approach for provider health care. We also see it as a key enabler of our health network strategy and focused global markets such as England, as the NHS accelerates its push to advanced integrated care systems. ","Finally, with the content of health care digitized, we also are advancing a set of strategies around data services. Art Glasgow and the team -- and our team launched a learning health network concept in 2019 to make it easier for patients to be identified and participate in clinical trials. The new clinical research institute partnership announced in 2019 played a central role in generating research opportunities for Cerner clients. And top health systems, such as MedStar announced yesterday, are helping us to activate a network we believe can make it less expensive to create the next-generation of life-saving therapeutics. ","Across all six business units, our efforts to drive strategic growth fit into an emerging enterprise discipline around portfolio management across Cerner. In 2019, we were as intentional about the things we decided not to do as the things we decided to do. Several important strategic growth partnerships helped tell that story. Our partnership with ResMed offers new revenue-generating opportunities in post-acute care and advanced analytics around Sleep & Respiratory. It also featured a decision to make ResMed's Brightree home health offering, our preferred go-to-market solution. ","Similarly, our partnership with GetWellNetwork embedded their health Loop asset into our consumer application framework. It also came with a portfolio decision to not invest further in our myStation patient engagement solution in favor of GetWell's industry-leading offering. We believe a combination of thoughtful billed by partner assessment will bring us closer to our long-standing vision to build a system of health and care with the individual at the center. It's a system where consumers not only have a right to their data but also have the ability to mobilize it in pursuit of better health. We believe the entrepreneurial opportunity is at the intersection of health care and IT have never been greater. We're excited about what 2020 and the 2020s hold for setting an emerging area of strategic growth for Cerner. 2019 performance, for its part, laid a solid foundation for moving further, faster in the quarters to come. ","And with that, let me turn the call over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Robert Jones from Goldman Sachs.","Robert Jones","I guess, Marc, just to go back to some of your comments, you highlighted 4% growth ex AbleVets addition and less the revenue cycle service contract that you guys exited. I guess, just out of curiosity, as we frame the year and understanding that 2020 has been put aside as kind of a transition year, how much of that remaining growth came from federal? And then, clearly more importantly, and I know we'll hear more in March, maybe just some of the major building blocks that as you think about returning to profitable growth in the future? What are the pieces we should be at least starting to frame out as we think about growth beyond 2020?","Marc Naughton","Yes. No, this is Marc. I think from a -- certainly, as we look at the year and trying to get apples-to-apples will be a little bit challenging in 2020 -- '20. We're going to do our best job to do that. It's a little bit why we try to talk a little bit about organic growth. I think if we get back to the overall view of top line growth, we've talked last year about kind of that being the 6% to 9% range. Clearly, the outsourcing selectivity and certainly the Adventist contract could impact that. And I think as we look through that, that's probably 100 basis point potential impact, which would put you some place in a 5% to 8% top line growth level, I think that's certainly something that we would expect to be doable for us. ","I think from the things that are going to continue driving, certainly, federal will be part of that growth as that contract, the VA contracts ramps its way up to $1 billion a year of annual revenue. That's $250 million or so of additional annual growth in revenue that's just coming out of the VA contract, depending on the time period. So that's certainly a good driver. ","And then strategic growth is obviously another area that we're expecting to see growth out of, that will take the -- to $500 million to $600 million business it is today and continue to grow that at strong growth rates. We also look at the opportunity that we have just within our existing base business. So our core business, the opportunity to sell revenue cycle solutions back into that base, the ability to go attack the white space, all of those are things that we think, overall, are elements that contribute to us having overall top line growth. And that really, all of those things I've talked about are primarily organic. We've talked in the past that we also expect there to be a level of inorganic growth for us and some M&A that will support primarily the opportunities in strategic growth. ","And depending on the size of those opportunities and the size -- the revenue impact they bring, that certainly could be accretive to those -- to the top line growth that we've talked about. But certainly, as we go -- get to HIMSS and can have a little bit more time with everyone, we'll try to take you through a more detailed view of strategic growth and the elements of those businesses and how we've got the opportunities for growing the top line, kind of just in the range that we've traditionally discussed. But I think to your point, we have talked about 2020 being a reset year. We are looking at opportunities to divest certain things as we do our portfolio management. That's going to negatively impact revenue. The M&A will positively impact revenue. And what we'll try to do on a quarterly basis is kind of give you an update as to where we're going. Obviously, we'll be giving you quarterly guidance if there's any adjustments. But right now, we think the guidance we provided for the year is really solid.","Robert Jones","No, Marc, I appreciate all that. I guess just a quick follow-up on your comments then would be around those potential further divestitures and potential M&A. Are those contemplated in the 2020 guidance? Or is this kind of best case of what we know today is just where the business stands?","Marc Naughton","Yes. The way we did our guidance was basically kind of on a same-store basis, so it does not contemplate any of the divestitures. It does not contemplate any of the M&A potential activity because that's still, as of today, something to be determined. We think it's going to be more effective as those items occur that we can talk about them at that point. Keep in mind that the AH, if you will, divestiture or that RevWorks business going away is by far the largest item that was on the list. Those items after that would be smaller items. So whether they even impact the overall guidance, to a great extent, will be something we determine at the point they occur. But right now, the guidance is based on current course and speed, and then we will adjust as we -- as anything comes up in that space, one way or the other.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kevin Caliendo from UBS.","Kevin Caliendo","I know you don't guide for bookings for the full year, but given the shift away from LT service bookings, when do you think it's reasonable for you to assume you can return to year-over-year bookings growth? And when I look at the ones you guide, is there any additional content waiting for the shift? Or do you view the year-over-year long-term bookings compares already normalize entering the year?","Marc Naughton","Yes. I mean, I think, clearly, we don't guide beyond the Q1 because we do want to be pretty accurate relative to our guidance. I think as you -- the solid results that we delivered in Q4, actually delivering above our guidance range, with the opportunity based on some opportunities to pull things in to the quarter based on some of the timing of our clients and their year ends, that is going to impact Q1 a little bit because those things would have normally been landing in Q1. But I think we're still normalizing for some of the outsourcing elements in the bookings. ","So I think for 2020, while it's kind of a year for resetting the top line from a growth perspective, I think it's fair to say that the bookings, we'll get through the full year of 2020, and then we should get some pretty comparable bookings to be able to do apples-to-apples growth thereafter. But Q1 is still being impacted by the more focused view of anything that we're going to do on the services side that might be in the outsourcing space.","Kevin Caliendo","And one quick follow-up, if I might. So we were reading that a VA Deputy Secretary was let go yesterday, and I guess he was the one who was technically in charge of VA implementations. I was wondering if you had been in contact with them, with leadership over there since that decision was made. Is there any concern or any issues about timing or potential bottlenecks for the implementation of the VA contract?","John Peterzalek","Yes, this is John. I won't comment specifically on that activity, but what I would say is that both the veterans, VA, the modernization project, they have significant bipartisan support. And the fact that there are changes in political activity, it's not a surprise or unexpected. And from the beginning of this project, we took great effort in making sure that we had broad support throughout The Hill, the VA, veterans groups and other constituents and supporters to ensure when things like this do happen, or political activity occurs, it doesn't impact where we're going. So we don't anticipate any impact from that, and we think that our broad base of support is incredibly solid, and we're just going to continue on.","Operator","Our next question comes from Charles Rhyee from Cowen.","Charles Rhyee","Maybe you want to touch on -- I think, at the beginning, you guys talked about the interoperability rules, the final rule is right expected soon. Any thoughts on sort of the -- I know there were some concerns, particularly on providers around compressed time lines or perceived compressed time lines for implementation. How do you view those challenges? And what is -- what would you talk -- I guess, say, about your preparedness to help clients to work through that? And any thoughts on maybe seeing a phased implementation schedule put in place instead?","Donald Trigg","Yes. So this is Don. I think, first and foremost, just to echo Brent's comments. This is a space that we've been very vocal on and pushed aggressively on for a number of years. So we have a lot of, I think, personal passion around interoperability, semantic interoperability and what this space needs to look like for patients and providers and payers. So that's first and foremost. ","I think, secondly, we feel like we're very well positioned to meet the implementation time lines that are being discussed, both from a technical and a nontechnical business perspective. We'll obviously finalize those strategies as the final rule comes out and they're completely understood, but we think they're manageable and that we're well positioned to do that. ","And I think, finally, just to reiterate some of the framing on the call, we think there's going to be a ton of business opportunities associated with these elevated rates of data liquidity. So when I think about the types of things that we're doing to enable our strategies around Medicare Advantage, alternative payment models like bundled payments and BPCIA, the opportunity to think through the technical strategies required to help provide our organizations make those business models work, we think create tons of opportunity for Cerner, and frankly for the industry as a whole.","Charles Rhyee","Great. And maybe if I could just follow on, in terms of sort of the strategic -- the new model that you're working on. I'm not sure if I might have missed it, but I didn't hear any mention of Lumeris. Just curious on an update on how that partnership's working.","Donald Trigg","Yes. No, I appreciate it. We think we're making a ton of progress there, and I'll tether back to the comments I just made. So first and foremost, really, the thing that was -- one of the things that was super exciting to us was to take the methodology, sort of the best-in-class methodology of Lumeris for Medicare Advantage, our technical capabilities and their service expertise and use it to bring a total solution offering to the market. ","In terms of progress made around that, we were very excited to use HealtheIntent as a foundational platform for running a provider-sponsored plan, focused on MA, and we over-attained against those IP milestones over the course of 2019, and now we're deploying the solution as part of the go-to-market strategy for Lumeris and Cerner. ","And again, just to come back to the topic around information sharing, if you think about the 4-star MA plan that Lumeris runs in the St. Louis market, 14 different practices, high degrees of technology, heterogeneity and how do you think about elevated rates of data liquidity, both to drive through your strategies for activating that network as well as integrating their best practice capabilities into the last-mile workflow of the physician, it's nicely complementary to the regulatory trends that are playing out. And we think it represents one of several very big business model opportunities for us going forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser from Morgan Stanley.","Rivka Goldwasser","Going back to the revenue growth guidance and some of the comments, Marc, that you made. So first of all, just to clarify because I might have missed it. I think at some point, you said 5% to 8% is doable for longer-term revenue growth, and I just tried to understand the building block there. That's one. ","Second of all, I think you highlighted that the VA is a long-term revenue opportunity, so I just want to make sure that we hear it right that you expect it to grow, that $250 million that you mentioned beyond the term of the initial contract. ","And then lastly, as we think about the potential divestitures that are not included in this guidance range that you provided us today, who's making the decision? Is this a decision that you are making based on the margin mix? Or is this something that the client, when the contract is up for renewal, decides to not renew? I just -- just if you can just clarify why is this taking such a long time to make the decision of what contracts are being divested or not?","Marc Naughton","Sure. First of all, the 5% to 8% was really just discussing the long-term growth we kind of provided last year at HIMSS of 6% to 9%, with a little bit of 100 bps haircut based on the lower amount of outsourcing activity that's going to happen. So we're going to be -- as I indicated, a little bit earlier, at HIMSS we'll be taking you through that long-term growth rate, what that looks like, where it's coming relative to our core businesses, our strategic growth businesses, our federal businesses, so you'll be able to see how it lays out. And then we'll give you some more details as to the strategic growth businesses that underpin all of those growth assumptions. So our goal is to lay out a very clear path that kind of falls within that range, with the opportunity to over-attain depending on what we do from an M&A perspective. ","Relative to the VA contract, when we first talked about it being a $10 billion contract and it's a 10-year contract, the math would say that's $1 billion a year. Obviously, there's a ramp-up period. And when we talk about it -- and when we talked about it, we said it ramps up over a 4-year period, growing about $250 million a year until it gets to the $1 billion. So my reference to that $250 million increase was basically the revenue we're going to be ramping up to in that contract that gets us to the $1 billion run rate. We have talked about the opportunities to certainly sell more of our solutions and services to the VA, which could increase the $1 billion to a bigger number. But certainly, the $250 million I reference is just kind of current course and speed, ramping up the projects, doing more and more in implementations and how that drives that revenue stream forward. So nothing new there. That's just really reiterating what we've talked about. It's another piece of the growth puzzle that is -- we talked about and does drive a good amount of growth. ","And finally, on the divestitures, AH was a little bit of an anomaly in that space. That was really a business we're looking to kind of decide whether we want to be in or not. They were our largest client in that outsourcing. So that was more of a client contractual agreement. Going forward, it will be much more of us reviewing relative to our portfolio management, relative to our growth options for the business, where do we want to focus our attention. In those areas that we don't want to -- don't think are the growth areas for the company we want to focus on, we're going to consider divesting as one of the options. We'll consider divesting. We'll consider partnering. ","There are a variety of things that we'll consider. But those divestitures will be, in many cases, of an existing business. It won't be a specific client relationship that will be unwound in some way. It will be an existing business that we will basically go out to market and look for opportunities to say, here's this asset. It's something we're willing to let go. And some of these assets have significant value. So I think -- and from a why-is-it-taking-so-long standpoint, there is a lot of work we've done in our portfolio management to decide what are the key things we want to drive as we talked, that work really was a lot of the 2019 work and really was kind of finalizing as we ended the year. And certainly, some of these activities on divestitures are already underway, and ideally will be things that we can share with you in the very near future.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Garro from William Blair.","Jeffrey Garro","I want to ask a little bit more about the AWS partnership and maybe putting aside the very important work around migration and those long-term benefits of efficiency and lowered TCO for our clients, more curious on the consumer experience innovation side and what type of milestones, either IP milestones or bookings-related milestones that we can look for in 2020 from that partnership.","Marc Naughton","Yes. It's a great question, Jeff. Thanks. So let me talk to kind of multiple pieces of it. Just in terms of one, the framework for the relationship, I think, one of the things that we were excited about from an AWS and Amazon perspective was not just the opportunity to think through technical migration to the public cloud but to really think about broader opportunities around the Amazon relationship and what it would look like, in particular, to leverage their deep competencies around the consumer. Coupled with their strong interest in being part of the health care ecosystem. So that was a, I think, a design feature of the relationship. And I think we've been very happy with our opportunity to kind of engage with them and to look at key strategies around approach, whether those are publicly disclosed activities around how they think about their employee population and some of the things that they're doing in concert with JPM and with Berkshire portfolio of companies or acquisitions that they've made around capabilities like PillPack. So we've had good visibility to that. We think it's an exciting piece -- potential piece of the relationship and an important part of how we want to think about making the partnership work going forward. ","Secondly, from a technical perspective, I talked a little bit about the fact that HealtheIntent has really been a tip of the spear, if you will, relative to the migration to the public cloud. Most of that work will be completed in the first half of the year. CareAware, similarly, is part of that early strategy and path. And I think we've been very transparent in terms of saying that the time frames around Millennium will be more elongated. ","Finally, in terms of what this is going to look like in terms of targeted bookings or revenue impact I think there's businesses within strategic growth that are very excited about the potential pull-through impact relative to revenue. I would say our consumer and employer businesses in particular have a lot of energy here and have been real drivers around the strategic collaboration, but we're probably not at a point in the life cycle of the dialogue where I can put out a revenue target or a bookings target that we would feel confident we could hit or over-attain.","Jeffrey Garro","Great. That's very helpful. One quick follow-up, maybe on the technical side on HealtheIntent and CareAware in this first half migration. Maybe just some more specifics around where the benefits are for Cerner with those migrations and where the benefits are for clients.","Marc Naughton","Yes. Well, first of all, I think just the ability to be able to stage and think through the migration to the public cloud has had a real value proposition for us as we try to think really comprehensively about not only the technical components but also how we have this conversation with our clients, how we think about innovation potentials in concert with our provider clients as part of the dialogue and the approach. ","In terms of benefits, I think there are clear and demonstrable benefits that our clients are going to see. There's a performance -- system performance benefit that's very real. There is a benefit around latency and how we think about the path to near-real time data assets that I think could be very important around strategies like hospital operations. And I think this is also relevant as we start thinking about growth opportunities like cybersecurity where clients need our competency and expertise around how they manage hybrid environments with on-prem and cloud. So I think real benefits that we're deriving from a performance perspective, from a data and utilization of the data against business strategy and some really interesting, from my perspective, conversations around capability that we have that create white space opportunities for growth.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sean Wieland from Piper Sandler.","Sean Wieland","So on the restructuring costs that you're talking about Marc, you said 2020, your restructuring costs are going to continue. Can you quantify the impact that these costs are to the operating margin that you're forecasting, both in 2019 and 2020?","Marc Naughton","Well, the operating -- the restructuring costs that we're incurring that are the restructuring costs currently are being adjusted out of earnings, so our adjusted earnings, there is 0 impact on that, and that is the number on which we have based our operating margin targets.","Sean Wieland","Okay. And then -- that's helpful. And then a quick clarifying question. You said you're going to move almost all your hosting clients to AWS, first half of '20. That's consistent with what you've said, but does that impact the revenue or profitability cadence throughout the year? Or are you going to be backfilling that with government tenants?","Marc Naughton","Well, for the most part, the -- moving to AWS, the primary impact is freeing up hardware and space in our data center, and that will absolutely be used to support our federal clients as well as other clients we have that are hosted by us and on a Millennium platform. All of these devices are basically interchangeable relative to the various architectures we use. So that will be the savings is the impact on capital.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sean Dodge from RBC Capital Markets.","Sean Dodge","Maybe staying with the platform modernization for a moment. Understanding that the entire project's going to be a multiyear effort, and ultimately long-term positive for margins, can you give us a little more insight into the impact it will have on margins in the interim? The investments you're going to have to make as part of this, can you put some bookends around how big, how much? Are they going to be consistent or chunky? And are there efficiencies you're going to be able to garner in the meantime that'll help offset some of it? Or is this something where the margin lift really doesn't come until the entire project is done?","Marc Naughton","Yes, this is Marc. As John kind of went through the -- each time we move an element to AWS, there is some savings garnered. So certainly, from a -- as we move HealtheIntent, being able to manage that in the AWS environment, it has a savings on the people it takes for us to run those environments in our data center. So there are -- they are incremental. They aren't significant, but they are incremental. The investment we're going to make relative to our cloud investment on the other platform, primarily Millennium, that's part of our R&D expense, right? Part of our portfolio management goal is to free up dollars that we're spending on things that we don't see as long-term growth opportunities, and put that into some of the things that are going to be growth opportunities such as the cloud environment. ","We are still actually going through the exercise and the process of deciding exactly what the path to modernization is going to entail, exactly what's going to move in exactly the timing, so it's a little bit hard for me right now to give you an idea of what those dollars are. But our expectation is that much of that work is going to get funded out of our normal R&D spend, that will be focused on those efforts as opposed to potentially some other efforts on things that we're going to not be moving forward with. So there is -- that's -- it's going to be a refocus of it, so we're not going to garner some of the savings that we might have from some of those divestitures, although we will get -- gather some. But we shouldn't have a large influx of costs relative to this effort. And it will, as Don said, be a period of time before that gets there. Now once we get there, the benefits are significant. We've got well over $100 million of annualized costs for hosting our clients in our data center just from software that we run them on in our data center that we won't need to use when they go to the cloud. There will -- the advantages of running a single version of the software in the cloud is a significant decrease in the costs we have for supporting our clients. They will get a much better experience, so your clients' stack goes higher, so the appetite for more solutions goes higher. ","So those are harder to quantify at this point other than the actual cost savings from sublicensed software. But I think for the most part, that's the goal. Those benefits aren't going to happen in the next 2 or 3 years. That's -- we have to get through a lot of work, and we'll be able to give you more of an update on that as we do our work to make -- to identify the path forward. But it isn't something I think is going to be a big expense impact. But the benefits will be a little bit longer-term relative to margin improvement. And that's one of the things we've kind of talked about is, we've got our path, we delivered '19. We have our path to 2020. How do you keep delivering thereafter? You continue on the optimization. And then the next iteration is going to be basically platform-based that you bring these other additions and other opportunities to increase operating margins.","Sean Dodge","Okay. That's great. And then maybe on margins more broadly, you're still expecting to exit 2020 around the 22.5% level. You said maybe even a little bit better. I think you touched on it briefly in the prepared remarks, but could you just walk us kind of quickly through what you see being the primary levers or buckets of opportunities you can take out to get you from the 20% you just printed to something north of 22.5% in the next four quarters?","Marc Naughton","Yes. I think the key to remember is, a lot of what we did in '19 really started impacting us late in the year, right? It really -- there's margin improvement from Q3 to Q4 was significant. So -- but we have in place over 50% of the actions we need to go drive the margin uplift for 2020. The next set of things that are going to happen are going to happen toward the end of 2020 as we do things based on location of associates and things like that, that will drive kind of some of those next year benefits for us. So the reason that Q4 and 2020 will be a little bit of a, back-end-loaded once again is because those are the next tranches, and it takes time and effort to go get those in place. ","But I would point out that, basically after Q1, we'll be delivering about 250 basis points of margin improvement each quarter year-over-year, Q2, Q3 and Q4 and basically for the full year. So that level -- those margin improvements are the continuation of what we put in place in '19, then delivering on the next phases that occur in 2020. ","Just to clarify, before we get to the next question. My comments around 5% to 8%, it seemed like there's a little bit of confusion on people that talk about that comment. I'm just trying to -- the indication that I was trying to portray is that if you took our previous 6% to 9% target and lowered it for the impact of outsourcing, it would reduce the range by 100 basis points. So I was just doing math, and subtraction is one of the skills I do have, and we basically were taking those down to the 5% or 8%, just based on what our prior view was and kind of what the impact of the outsourcing that we've talked to you about is. But certainly, at HIMSS, we'll give you a more detailed view of what we think the right answer is and how do we get to that right answer. So I just want to clarify that because there's a little bit of confusion.","Operator","Our next question comes from George Hill from Deutsche Bank.","George Hill","This might be one for Don. I know Don, historically -- this is an interoperability question. Historically, interface management has been an attractive part of the business with pretty good margins. And as we think about kind of changing interoperability regulations, that will probably create some opportunities, but can you talk about how much business risk there might be to parts of the legacy business?","Donald Trigg","Yes. It's a good question, George. I think -- I think we're pretty comfortable that, that business -- I mean, you're right, it's relatively small, and it does have a good margin profile. I think we're relatively comfortable that the things that we've been doing on SMART on FHIR enablement and our code program, mean that the net impact is de minimis. ","And I think more to my earlier point, we think it's actually enabling to some of the bigger swing business strategies that we're advancing inside strategic growth. So while I can't perfectly net that out for you, I think we look at it and say it inures to our advantage into the upside relative to where we want to go from a top line perspective.","George Hill","Okay. That's super helpful. And then, Marc, maybe just 2 quick number follow-ups. Can you talk about -- can you give maybe any color around the CapEx guidance for 2020? You talked about the number coming down from the $471 million in number in 2019, maybe just something about that. And is any share repo assumed in the 2020 EPS guidance?","Marc Naughton","Yes. I think that from a CapEx perspective, you could take $100 million out of that number. It would be kind of the range that we would expect as we look at 2020 for CapEx based on our buildings being slowed down or basically being completed. And I think the repurchase, we obviously have $200 million scheduled for Q1 to complete our 12-month. And I think going forward, certainly, our capital allocation, we'll look at investment M&A opportunities and other things relative to the use of capital. But I would think at least $200 million a quarter of repurchases would seem to be kind of a base amount that we would then adjust relative to what our M&A is. Why don't we take one last question?","Operator","Our last question comes from Eric Percher from Nephron Research.","Eric Percher","A question on federal contracts. And I know that early in the uptake, you've had third party service. That appears to be weighing on the margin. As we think about 2020 versus 2019, does that level of third-party support remain about stable? Or is there any increase or decrease?","Marc Naughton","Yes, this is Marc. For 2020, it will be about the same. We continue to leverage our partners in that space. Clearly, AbleVets was one example of us working to bring a larger workforce quickly inside Cerner that we can then move to focus on the VA. As some of the -- as we work through their existing projects, which are relatively short-term and get them on the VA. That will allow us to bring that down, but that's probably more of a 2021 event at this point.","Eric Percher","That's helpful. And then last, on the ex U.S. 3% growth last year, as you look to 2020, I don't think that was part of the items you ticked off on growth opportunity. But what is your perspective on growth ex U.S.?","John Peterzalek","This is John. I said I think it will be consistent with previous years. There's still a lot of opportunity outside the U.S. in the form of new business, new regions, countries and those type of things, which we will look at, pursuing each one of those opportunities that make a decision. But similar to the U.S., we're also doing portfolio analysis on non-U.S. as well. So we're going to look to be -- follow the same process and become much more focused and outside the U.S. as well. So we may see both ups and downs outside the U.S. as well.","Marc Naughton","Hey, this is Marc. I want to thank everybody for participating. One last comment, there still might be a little confusion about our long-term top line growth target. The 5% to 8% I mentioned is absolutely something I think we can deliver. Absolutely. And in fact, I think there's upside to that. So I think the number -- something closer to the 7% range is probably more reasonable. But once again my point is, we really want to take you through it in detail, show you what the building blocks are, so you're not just blindly putting a number in, but the 5% to 8% level is a level that I have a great deal of confidence in. So with that, I want to thank you for attending this afternoon and look forward to getting together with you at HIMSS on March 10. Until then, have a good evening.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."],"5065":["Cerner Corp.

Cerner assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information except as required by law.","At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Marc Naughton, Chief Financial Officer of Cerner Corporation.","Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Thank you, Kevin. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the call. I'll start with a review of our numbers. Zane Burke, our President, will follow me with the results, highlights and marketplace observations. Our Chief Operating Officer, Mike Nill, will provide operational highlights. And then our new Chairman and CEO, Brent Shafer, will provide closing comments.","Turning to our results, for the most part, Q4 was a solid finish to 2017 with record bookings, revenue in our guidance range, strong cash flow and earnings slightly below our expectations. Our bookings in Q4 were $2.329 billion, an all-time high and up 62% from the $1.437 billion in Q4 of 2016. Bookings came in more than $300 million above the high end of our guidance range due to several large deals that Zane will discuss.","Full year bookings were $6.325 billion, which is up 16% over $5.446 billion in 2016. We indicated at the beginning of the year that the large and complex nature of the opportunities in our pipeline set us up for the potential for large quarterly swings in bookings. This did play out and, except for Q3, the volatility was reflected in upside relative to our guidance with the end result being a very strong year of bookings.","Our revenue backlog ended the year at $17.545 billion, which is up 10% from $15.927 billion a year ago. Revenue in the quarter was $1.314 billion, which is up 4% over Q4 of 2016. The revenue composition for Q4 was $363 million in system sales, $262 million in support and maintenance, $661 million in services and $28 million in reimbursed travel. For the full year, total revenue grew 7% over 2016 to $5.142 billion, which is in the range we provided at the beginning of the year.","System sales revenue for the quarter was up 3% compared to Q4 of 2016 driven primarily by growth in licensed software. Our system sales margin percent of 65.5% was down year-over-year and sequentially due mostly to lower margins on technology resale related to a higher mix of device resale and lower subscription margins related to the mix of subscriptions having higher third-party costs. For the full year, system sales revenue grew 7% and margin increased 6% from 2016.","Moving to services, total services revenue, including professional and managed services, was up 6% from a tough comparable in Q4 of 2016 when services grew 18%. Full year services revenue was up 9% over 2016 reflecting good execution by our service organizations. Support and maintenance revenue increased 3% for both the quarter and the full year, which is in line with expectations.","Looking at revenue by geographic segment, domestic revenue increased 4% over the year ago quarter to $1.154 billion and non-U.S. revenue of $160 million increased 10%. For the full year, domestic revenue grew 8% and non-U.S. revenue grew 3%.","As a preview to the annual update of our detailed business model that we'll provide at our investment community meeting on March 7 at HIMSS, I'd like to provide you with the total revenue and growth by business model for the full year 2017. Licensed software increased 11% to $612 million. Technology resale was flat at $274 million. Subscriptions increased 6% to $469 million. Professional services revenue grew 10% to $1.592 billion. Managed services increased 7% to $1.047 billion. Support and maintenance was up 3% to $1.047 billion and reimbursed travel was $101 million, which is up 15%.","Note that a portion of the strength in licensed software and the lower growth in subscriptions is related to a shift in how we sold some of our content during 2017. This shift in approach meant more content was sold as a license. The higher license revenue in 2017 creates a tough comparable for licensed software in 2018 and lowers the run rate of subscriptions.","Moving to gross margin. Our gross margin for Q4 was 82.6%, which is down from 84.1% in Q3 and basically flat compared to a year ago. The sequential decline is largely due to a lower mix of services as a percent of total revenue compared to Q3 and the lower technology resale margins I previously mentioned. Full year gross margin of 83.4% is down slightly from 83.8% in 2016.","Now I will discuss spending, operating margin and net earnings. For these items, we provide both GAAP and adjusted or non-GAAP results. The 2017 and\/or 2016 adjusted results exclude share-based compensation expense, share-based compensation permanent tax items, acquisition-related adjustments, tax reform impact and voluntary separation plan expense, all as detailed and reconciled to GAAP in our earnings release.","Looking at operating spending, our fourth quarter GAAP operating expenses of $866 million were up 4% compared to $831 million in the year-ago period. Full-year GAAP operating expenses were $3.328 billion, up 7% from $3.106 billion in 2016. Adjusted operating expenses were $815 million, which is up 9% compared to Q4 2016. This growth was primarily driven by an increase in personnel expense related to revenue-generating associates and non-cash items.","Looking at the line items, sales and client service expenses increased 9%. Software development increased 11% driven by non-cash items as we had $1 million less capitalized software and $9 million more amortization than Q4 of 2016. G&A expense was up 2%. Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles decreased 5% year-over-year. For the full year, adjusted operating expenses were up 9% to $3.138 billion.","Moving to operating margins, our Q4 GAAP operating margin was 16.7% compared to 16.9% in the year-ago period. Full year GAAP operating margin was 18.7% compared to 19.0% in the year-ago period. Our adjusted operating margin was 20.5% in Q4, which is down from 23.3% in the year-ago period due to the previously discussed technology resale margins, revenue mix and non-cash expenses.","In addition, as I mentioned last quarter, we did have higher operating expense in Q4 tied to upfront investments on some large projects that won't contribute to revenue until this year. The lower Q4 margins contributed to a lower full year adjusted operating margin of 22.4%, which is down from 23.6% last year.","Another factor impacting our margins all year was our net software capitalization, which ended the year about $20 million lower than we had originally anticipated as we capitalized less software than expected while increasing amortization as planned. So it had a larger than expected negative impact on our margins and earnings this year.","The lack of margin expansion in 2017 is consistent with our original guidance, although the decline is slightly more than expected due to the reasons I discussed. Going forward, we still see an opportunity to resume expanding margins but we do face headwinds in the near term that I discussed throughout 2017.","These include the following: a large expected increase in non-cash software amortization and depreciation related to large investments in software development and facilities to support our growth. Currently, we expect these expenses to grow approximately $80 million in 2018. The growth of these items should begin to slow in 2019. Another factor is that we expect traditional software revenue to be relatively flat due to the maturing EHR market, a shift to more SaaS models and the tough comparable created by our strong software growth in 2017.","The impact of this lower software mix is exacerbated by the recent success of our Works businesses, which contribute to good revenue visibility, but carry a lower margin than our overall margins. We are also making investments in our Works business this year by creating a bigger workforce in Kansas City. Longer term, this creates the opportunity to centralize more functions and improve the profitability of our Works businesses, but it is dilutive near term.","Finally, some of the investments in projects ahead of revenue being recognized is expected to continue into 2018. Because of these factors, our 2018 guidance reflects a decline in operating margins instead of the roughly flat margins implied in our initial 2018 view. I do think many of these factors are temporary in nature, that we do have opportunities to improve margins as our non-cash expense growth slows, we get return on investments we are making in our Works businesses and our SaaS revenue related to population health ramps and balances the increase in the mix of Works revenue.","In addition, as a leadership team, we have begun a process of looking across our entire business for ways to leverage our resources and support our growth in an efficient manner. The significant long-term growth opportunities we see in front of us create an environment where we believe we can attain economies of scale and improve our margins.","Moving to net earnings and EPS, our GAAP net earnings in Q4 were $337 million, or $1 per diluted share. Note that our GAAP net earnings includes $115 million net income tax benefit primarily driven by the revaluation of our net deferred tax liability because of the tax reform bill that was passed in December. For the full year, GAAP net earnings were $867 million or $2.57 per diluted share.","Adjusted net earnings in Q4 were $196 million and adjusted diluted EPS was $0.58 compared to $0.61 in Q4 2016. For the full year, adjusted net earnings were $805 million and adjusted diluted EPS was $2.38, up 4% from 2016. Our GAAP tax rate for the quarter was negative 52% primarily driven by the revaluation of our deferred tax liability. When excluding the tax benefit adjustment and share-based compensation permanent tax items, the Q4 tax rate was 28%, which is slightly below our full year 2017 rate due to some smaller tax benefit items in Q4.","For 2018, we expect our tax rate to be approximately 24%. This reflects the decrease in our federal rate from 35% to 21%, slightly offset by the Section 199 deduction going away, the fact the lower rate only applies to domestic income and increase in the effective state rate since the benefit of deducting state taxes goes down due to the lower federal rate.","We are investing the majority of the benefit of this lower tax rate so it does not fully pass through to our 2018 guidance, which I'll discuss in a minute. Primary areas of investment include increased R&D, hiring a local workforce of more than 600 people to support our Works businesses and expanding our facilities including the next phase of our Innovations Campus.","Before moving on to discuss our balance sheet, I wanted to mention part of the reason for our earnings being below our guidance. Recall that on our last call we indicated we expected the VA to sign in Q4. This was based on indications pointing to the signing by the end of November. Our plan assumes we begin working on initial task orders in Q4 and then ramp up workforce quickly through 2018. As you likely know, the signing did not occur in Q4. While we didn't factor in a significant amount for Q4, this timing, along with lower upfront revenue than expected on some of the larger fourth quarter contracts, did impact our results. Clearly, this is not significant in the scheme of the overall opportunity, but I did want to note this impact.","Now I'll move to our balance sheet. We ended Q4 with $1.003 billion of total cash and investments, which is up from $964 million in Q3 primarily due to strong free cash flow, partially offset by use of our cash for our stock repurchase program. During the quarter, we finished the remaining $77 million of stock repurchases authorized in November of 2016 and executed $73 million of the $500 million stock repurchase authorized in May of 2017. For the quarter, we purchased a total of 2.3 million shares at an average price of $65.48. For the year, we repurchased 2.7 million shares for $173 million, at an average price of $65.33.","Moving to debt. Our total debt, including capital lease obligations, was $527 million, which is down slightly compared to Q3. Total receivables ended the quarter at $1.043 billion, which is up from $1.021 billion in Q3. Our Q4 DSO was 72 days, which is up from 69 days in the year ago period and down from 73 days in Q3.","Operating cash flow for the quarter was strong at $349 million. Q4 capital expenditures were $100 million, and capitalized software was $64 million. Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less capital purchases and capitalized software development costs, was $185 million for the quarter.","For the full year, operating cash flow was $1.308 billion, capital expenditures were $362 million and capitalized software was $274 million. Full year free cash flow was $671 million, which is $179 million higher than 2016.","For 2018, we expect an increase in capital expenditures of more than $100 million primarily to support our facilities requirements, including the start of another phase of our Innovation Campus. However, we expect this increase to be more than offset by growth in operating cash flow, which should lead to another strong year of free cash flow.","Now I'll go through the guidance. We expect revenue in Q1 to be between $1.315 billion and $1.365 billion, with the $1.340 billion midpoint reflecting growth of 6% over Q1 of 2017, which was the quarter with the highest growth in 2017. For the full year, we expect revenue between $5.45 billion and $5.65 billion, with the $5.55 billion midpoint reflecting 8% growth over 2017.","We expect Q1 adjusted diluted EPS to be $0.57 to $0.59 per share, with the $0.58 midpoint reflecting $0.01 less than Q1 of 2017, which is also our toughest comparable quarter from an EPS standpoint. The lack of growth in Q1 is related to the higher level of expenses and lower expected software mix I previously mentioned. For the full year, we expect adjusted diluted EPS to be $2.57 to $2.73, with the $2.65 midpoint reflecting 11% growth over 2017.","Moving to bookings guidance. We expect bookings revenue in Q1 of $1.250 billion to $1.450 billion. The $1.35 billion midpoint reflects 8% growth compared to Q1 of 2017.","Now I'd like to discuss the differences between our preliminary 2018 outlook and the guidance we are providing today. Our revenue guidance midpoint is $15 (sic) [$50] million less than our initial outlook. This small difference primarily reflects refinement of our outlook after we finalized backlog and locked down our plan. It does reflect a decrease in expected revenue from the VA contract compared to our initial outlook, which contemplated a Q4 of 2017 signing, but this is mostly offset by revenue associated with our strong Q4 Works bookings.","Our adjusted EPS guidance is $0.05 higher than our initial outlook, but this is approximately with $0.24 of benefit created by our expected tax rate going to approximately 24% from 30%. The reasons for the approximately $0.19 decrease on a comparable basis include the following. First, as I discussed, we anticipated revenue from our work on the VA contract in Q1. We are also absorbing expenses for the workforce we have in place to begin project work as we intend to be ready to deliver as soon as the contract signs. We believe being focused on project readiness offsets any negative from carrying the additional costs.","The other primary factors impacting our guidance I mentioned when discussing operating margins, including the expected lower software and higher Works mix in our revenue, investments in local workforce for our Works businesses and other large projects where we're incurring expenses ahead of revenue. We also expect some growth in our R&D investment, including work related to global opportunities and population health, which, along with the non-cash growth, will impact our overall spending growth.","In addition, our other personnel expenses are expected to be higher than our original plan driven by higher health care costs and variable compensation.","Most of the remaining difference in our EPS guidance compared to our initial outlook was the result of our normal process of finalizing a more detailed, bottoms-up version of our plan, which results in more precise estimates we use to give our best view for the year.","The final factor I'd like to discuss is the expected impact of the new revenue accounting standard, or Topic 606. We currently estimate the amount of adjustments to retained earnings under the new revenue accounting standard will be less than 1% of annual revenue. This estimate is preliminary and subject to change as we finalize our implementation of the standard.","Relative to the income statement, our initial view is that, for 2018, we expect the difference created by more favorable treatment in some circumstances will be roughly offset by items less favorably treated under the new standard.","In summary, while we realize you may have expected to see more of the tax benefit pass through as incremental earnings, we view most of what is not being passed through as investments back into our business in areas that are important to our future growth. And I expect these investments to position us for good earnings growth next year.","One final thing I'd like to mention before turning the call over to Zane is that we expect to report our Q1 and Q2 results later than our normal schedule to allow us more time to do the work necessary to report under the new revenue standard. Tentatively, we are planning on Q1 and Q2 release dates of May 10 and August 2, respectively. For Q3 and Q4, we will target being back on our normal schedule, which is expected to be October 25 and February 5, 2019, respectively.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Zane.","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","Thanks, Marc. Good afternoon, everyone. Today I'll provide color on our results and make some marketplace observations. I'll start with bookings. As Marc discussed, we significantly over-attained our bookings target, which led to a record level of bookings for Q4 and for the year. This quarter included closing key deals that had pushed from Q3 as well as success at closing other large details forecasted in Q4.","Multiple large transactions contributed to the strength of our bookings. In fact, we signed six contracts that were greater than $75 million in Q4. These included the expanded relationship with the Adventist Health, which was announced early this month; another large ITWorks contract at an academic health system on the East Coast; an expansion of services and solutions, including population health, with a major children's hospital; and two different IDNs expanding solutions, services and sites; and an expanded global relationship.","Looking at bookings mix, as you'd expect with the strength of our Works business, the percent of bookings coming from long-term contracts was higher than normal in Q4 at 46%. Even with this mix, we still had strong growth in the non-long-term bookings of 28%. For the year, the percent of long-term was 35% compared to 30% last year.","From a competitive standpoint, we had a good quarter and year. This quarter, 22% of our bookings were from outside our core Millennium installed base. While this was lower than most quarters, it is still strong when you consider the volume of Works business which was all back into the base and drove most of our over-attainment. Overall, we maintained our greater than 50% win rate this year and continued to have success against our primary competitor in an environment where prospects are focused on return on investment.","In the ambulatory market, we had another very good quarter and year. For the year, ambulatory bookings grew 15%, and we had 27 displacements of our primary ambulatory competitors.","In the smaller hospital market, we continue to do well with our CommunityWorks offering. Our CommunityWorks bookings grew more than 30% for the year driven by the addition of 29 new clients and higher average deal sizes compared to past years as we've been able to move upmarket with this offering. We now have more than 180 CommunityWorks clients across 39 states.","We also had a good year in revenue cycle, with 15% revenue growth and over 50% bookings growth. This was driven by inclusion of revenue cycle in almost all new EHR deals as well as increasing penetration of revenue cycle in our base. For the year, we had 25 displacements of various competitors' revenue cycle systems.","The year also included record services bookings driven by the Cerner RevWorks expansion at Adventist Health. In population health, we continue to make good progress at adding clients to the HealtheIntent platform and ended the year with 144 unique clients. For the year, population health bookings grew 42% and revenue grew 20%.","We have been able to continue growing in an environment that includes uncertainty regarding when the broader shift from fee-for-service to value-based care will occur because of our platform's ability to help clients optimize fee-for-service models while also preparing them to the shift to value-based payments.","A noteworthy population health win in Q4 was signing with our first commercial health plan. This plan will use HealtheIntent to enhance their service to more than 300,000 Medicaid and Medicare Advantage lives. They are using HealtheIntent solutions to support their growing risk-based arrangements and give their providers a single source of truth for risk metrics and clinical information. A key differentiator in the selection process was HealtheIntent's ability to aggregate a wide range of clinical and claims data from multiple sources and turn it into actionable information.","Moving to our business outside the U.S., we had a good quarter with 10% revenue growth. The 3% growth for the full year that Marc mentioned reflects a soft first half of your being offset by a good second half. Looking at bookings, our non-U.S. bookings were an all-time high in 2017. The record bookings combined with a strong pipeline position us well for good revenue growth going forward.","Next, I'd like to provide an update on our federal business. Last quarter, I indicated we are live at our four sites that comprised the Initial Operating Capability, or IOC, program for the Department of Defense MHS GENESIS project. We also mentioned that the next step is a review process that identifies where the system can be optimized. Some media coverage suggested this exercise represents a setback in the project, but this is a planned exercise. The next milestone is a full deployment decision which is expected the summer, and we remain on track to begin full deployment later this year.","Note that IOC sites represent the first successful deployment of a commercial, off-the-shelf comprehensive EHR solution in the federal space. Additionally, the project has led to a HIMSS Level 6 designation with all four sites using functionality they didn't have prior to implementing Cerner, such as advanced clinical decision support, proactive care management, structured messaging, business and clinical intelligence and the capability to share data with the community-based EHR. MHS GENESIS is also driving patient engagement as patients can now access the portal from multiple devices.","I'd also like to provide an update on our opportunity with the Department of Veteran Affairs. As Marc mentioned, our contract did not sign in Q4 as we expected. The delay was primarily related to the VA's decision to conduct an external validation process to ensure their interoperability requirements can be met. We welcome this review as we're confident in our interoperability capabilities and believe it's good to have the requirements clearly defined. We also like that the VA is focused on pushing for interoperability across the industry, something we have long supported, as you know.","This delay does not change the magnitude or importance of the overall opportunity, and we believe the contract will sign soon. We look forward to providing more details at that time.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike.","Michael R. Nill - Cerner Corp.","Thanks, Zane. Good afternoon, everyone. Since we have more content than normal on our call today, I'm just going to make a few brief comments about our Works businesses and then turn the call over to Brent.","I'll start by discussing the expanded relationship with Adventist Health that Zane mentioned. This included significant expansion of our RevWorks relationship with Cerner and an initial ITWorks relationship. We will soon be taking over day-to-day management of their revenue cycle and clinical applications IT staff and will ultimately manage all applications that involve a patient, including clinical EHR, revenue cycle, CareAware and HealtheIntent.","We will also build on the foundational work of our Value Creation Office that was established to optimize clinical and operational performance levels across their enterprise. I believe this will create a more aligned and embedded relationship where we can be more effective at addressing the challenges of today while also innovating so we are in a position to excel in the future.","Looking more broadly at our ITWorks and revenue cycle businesses, the strength in our fourth quarter led to both achieving record levels of bookings for the year. I believe this could be the beginning of a ramp in our Works businesses as both ITWorks and RevWorks align directly with our clients' needs to get more of their existing spend in the current challenging operating environment to providers.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Brent.","Brent Shafer - Cerner Corp.","Thanks a lot, Mike. The team has done a great job of covering the results. I'd just like to make a few comments before we go to Q&A.","First of all, I'm very excited to join Cerner at a time where there is so much impact we can have together. I spent my career in healthcare and I've always been aware of Cerner's successes and Neal Patterson's role. In my view, he was without peer in terms of his passion and the way he shaped the development of the health IT industry. Together with the other founders and the team they built, they created a remarkable company.","For someone like me who's worked in healthcare and has seen so much of the unaddressed need, it's impossible not to be excited about Cerner's position in the market. The investments in platforms and services have been well timed, and as you know, in the U.S. and globally, healthcare spending continues to rise, consumer expectations of technology are at an all-time high, and the payment models are shifting toward paying for value. Together with our clients, we have a huge opportunity to impact cost, quality and satisfaction in healthcare.","In the short time I've been on board, I've been extremely impressed with the talent of Cerner's leadership team. I did have the opportunity to spend a significant amount of time with the team leading up to my official start date last week, including a number of one-on-ones with key senior leaders and the opportunity to meet most of the top 100 executives in Cerner.","I've had the opportunity to meet with leaders of our client organization and the chance to sit in on the first quarter's progress reviews. I plan to spend the first 100 days diving deeper and talking with as many clients as possible. As a leadership team, we'll be focusing \u2013 working together to review three-year priorities for investments, refining our strategies and identifying opportunities to optimize our business so we can keep our strong forward momentum and achieve our goals for innovation and profitable growth.","Cerner is incredibly well positioned and I'm optimistic about our future. I look forward to meeting many of you next month at HIMSS.","And with that, let me turn the call back over to the moderator so we can begin Q&A. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from Charles Rhyee with Cowen.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC","Yeah. Hey, thanks for taking the question. Brent, maybe I can start with you, just as you come on board, and obviously, you've only had a limited time kind of surveying things, but maybe you could share for us sort of your thoughts of where you think the market is going overall, where healthcare technology is going and the sort of the role, obviously, Cerner has a leading position there, but \u2013 so where you think things can go from here.","Brent Shafer - Cerner Corp.","Well, thanks. I appreciate the question and it's been very short, so I'll make my observation brief as well. But I think given what's happening with consolidation and chronic conditions and the need to deliver value, Cerner's positioning is really fantastic. I think we're in a great place. And I see that, much of what Zane covered in his discussion, there's a lot of opportunity for us in the marketplace to expand into \u2013 globally and domestically and to go deeper in our key client relationships. And I think it's a critical time for us as well in healthcare. And with the position we have with the work that's been done here in the fourth quarter and the year, I'm very optimistic about the opportunity it holds.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. And, Zane, maybe if I can follow up, it sounds like RevWorks, a lot of good growth here, but one announcement obviously came out a little while back Intermountain going with a competitor on sort of a 10-year deal. Can you talk about that since you do have a strong relationship with the organization in other areas?","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","Sure. As you know, Intermountain is a great partner of Cerner's, and we are aligned with them on a multitude of elements. This was a arrangement they've had a longstanding relationship with that particular organization and, in fact, our investors in that organization. And so that was an anticipated element of how that \u2013 for that relationship moving forward.","I think there's plenty of other opportunities for us to think about how to continue to move the cost curve and bring our scale along with Intermountain as we move forward. So I think you could look forward to more items in that space, but that's an area that we were very well apprised of.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC","Were you able to gain things out of that? Because if I remember, you were \u2013 when you guys announced that several years back, you were talking about developing things for the RevWorks platform, even if they made that decision, were you able to still gain knowledge and capabilities from that? And I'll stop there. Thanks.","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","Yeah, so absolutely, so from a solution perspective, they're utilizing our full solution set, all our rev cycle solutions, and we are continuing to develop the software side of this. This really reflects the outsourcing and services component which they already had a relationship existing previously, and then they expanded that relationship and that was part of what we anticipated. We will continue to drive software innovation on the revenue cycle side as we move forward.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ross Muken with Evercore.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","Good afternoon, guys. So, just on the cost side and the investments, obviously, we've seen sort of some chunkiness in the bookings and obviously had some great success on the ITWorks side, and we're still sort of waiting I guess on VA. How hard is it, given the mosaic and maybe some of the lumpiness on the bookings front, to kind of plan for or forecast the cost needs, because I'm guessing some of this is people and ramp ahead of the revenue come-through.","So just help us think through that, and then in that transition into 2019, what is the real element that sort of ramps down in terms of cost? Is it really just these software cap lines or is it some of the people side as well?","Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Yeah. This is Marc. The investment component, you are correct that there are elements of these large projects that we are starting that we have ramped up ahead of time to be prepared. We are spending time both from a project readiness, from a services side, to an IP side preparing for some of these large contracts. And we've made the decision that we were going to ramp up ahead so that we were prepared and we can deliver.","So there is an expense impact to that, but we made that decision and we expect that near-term impact to be relatively brief as we go \u2013 those contracts get signed, begin to drive revenue and begin offsetting the costs, which we've invested in ahead of time.","So, I think as we look \u2013 so you're exactly right. We made that decision. Lumpy bookings, very big transactions obviously can make a difference and \u2013 but we'll err on the side in this case when we have these large opportunities of ensuring we deliver even if it's a near-term impact on the income statement.","I think, as you look to 2019, I think certainly the things that are hitting us as part of the increases this year from relative to the non-cash expenses, relative to some of the investments in these projects that we've made, relative to some of the R&D, I think all of that growth moderates when we get to 2019, and that's why we see 2018 really as an investment year. I mean, we're very fortunate that the federal government gave us a fairly significant amount of capital to invest in the business, and we're actually doing that in 2018 with the expectation that, as we get to 2019, we should be set up for growth again.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","That's helpful. And maybe on the market just in terms of rev cycle, it feels like we're kind of hitting inflection. I think you kind of called it out. I mean, it seems like a business that should have maybe come sooner, and the benefits are obvious. So, what's actually transpiring at the provider level that's making them sort of more open to some of those more substantial transactions? And what's sort of the impetus? And is it sort of unusual to see so many occur maybe at one time?","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","Ross, this is Zane. I think there's multiple things going on, but the biggest of which is, when you look at this space, there's a significant amount of cost in the administration of the claim. And it is incredibly labor-intensive. And that labor tends to be a maturing labor workforce, a less educated workforce, that is the right spot for the tech-enabled services organization to help solve problems for our clients.","And so, I think what you're seeing here is really a timing of clients that are trying to get their cost structure in order and get to a high performance on collections and on those pieces, and we can offer a scale to that. And I think the focus going from the meaningful use environment kind of exclusively to here are some other things that we can work on also plays into that revenue cycle focus as well, because it allows some of the attention to go on to some solutions that have been there for 30-plus years, and now they need to get onto the current applications. And then as you're thinking about getting onto current applications, how do I think about what my workflows ought to look like on a go-forward basis versus how have we done it for the past 30 years. So there's kind of a multiple effect there, and I do think we are on the front side of a very strong buying wave in that space. And I really like our position.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","Thanks, guys. Very helpful.","Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Thanks, Ross.","Operator","Our next question comes from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.","Lisa C. Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks very much. Marc, can I just start first with a question around tax? So it looks like you're raising numbers by about $0.05 for tax, but talking about really spending the incremental. Can we talk about what the actual tax benefit is? Is it something that's closer to what we projected maybe $0.15 to $0.20? How do I think about what the actual tax is and how that potentially impacts 2019 as you talk about some of these investments rolling off in 2019?","Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Yeah, Lisa. We would look at the number to be kind of between $0.20 and $0.24, so delivering $0.05 of that to the bottom line means that we're basically taking $0.19 of that and putting it towards investments. And especially in this year when those investments are things like large projects, pre-work, the 600 people that I'm putting into basically a Works business center in Kansas City to help drive that business, as the last question talked about the opportunities that we see in that space. So that is the impact relative to what \u2013 if we hadn't invested any of that, you would've seen between $0.20 and $0.24. And if we \u2013 based on what we are investing, we're taking about $0.19 or $0.17 or so of that and putting it back into the business.","Lisa C. Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And so, as we think about the future periods, my expectation would be that you would recognize some of that in earnings once these investments are done?","Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Clearly, as we start getting return on those investments, the tax rate is going to stay the same. The benefit from that is going to be an annual recurring item, but today, it's helping us play forward a little bit on those investments. And then, absolutely, that's why I look at 2019 as say we should start getting returns on those investments starting in 2019 and I'm still driving the same tax benefit. So, yes.","Lisa C. Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","That's perfect. And then my second question just was around the VA. I understand you'll sign it soon, talk about it when it's done, but do you have anything currently in the guidance for 2018 as it pertains to VA?","Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Yeah. I think as we look at our 2018 plan, we certainly have, as we did before, we had elements of the VA in there. We have revised those elements and we certainly have some of that in the revised 2018 plan certainly with a lesser impact than we did originally.","Obviously, I can't provide any more color than that on kind of what that amount is. We're still pending obviously signature of the contract. And once we get more information and have more facts, we'll be able to kind of share a little bit more detail. But at this point, it is included but certainly at a lesser amount than we originally \u2013 after a Q4 signing was in our projections.","Lisa C. Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thank you for the comments.","Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sean Wieland with Piper Jaffray.","Sean W. Wieland - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Hi. Thanks. So just to follow up on Lisa's question, because I'm a little confused and I'm not trying to play got you here, but the transcript from last quarter says our guidance does not assume a significant booking for the VA contract. And in this quarter, you're saying plan had assumed work would start in Q4. So I'm just trying to reconcile those two statements.","Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Yeah. When we're talking about bookings in Q4, were we thinking there was going to be a $300 million, $400 million coming through from the VA? We absolutely didn't think that. Did we think there was going to be an initial task order or set of task orders that would be in lesser amount to allow us to get working, would allow us to start driving revenue from that, yeah, that was our expectation. Certainly, our expectation was that by the time we kicked off this year, we have that workforce in place, they would all be working on the project, and we would kind of be up and running kind of on a \u2013 certainly the initial phase kind of running full speed. So that's \u2013 we certainly in Q4 didn't expect a big number, but we did expect to get something out of that.","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","And I would just add we would've anticipated additional task orders coming in 2018 because of the Q4 signing, which obviously all those pieces would have fallen out. So 2018 would've had a significant impact. So the timing is significant here.","Sean W. Wieland - Piper Jaffray & Co.","So, if the fax machine started buzzing in your office right now with that order, would that drive an upward revision to guidance at this point?","Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Well, if it was only up to a fax machine, but I think the reality is \u2013 the good news, Sean, is it's very public, right, you're going to know when it gets signed. You're going to know when the task orders get issued. So it'll be very visible to you when those things happen and you'll have actually a pretty good sense of the magnitude of what's happened. And once that happens, then we can kind of give you some guidance as to when that flows into revenue in our income statement.","But until we get to that point, and we're being appropriately in our mind circumspect, and certainly, when we have a \u2013 when we get an updated view, we certainly will adjust our estimates relative to that updated view.","Sean W. Wieland - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Okay. So there is an adjustment when the deal is signed?","Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp.","If it varies from what we already have in our plan, then there could be an adjustment. What we will do is certainly update our plan for what happens, and if that results in a change to our estimates, we'll certainly provide that. Keep in mind, I did say that there is an element of VA in the 2018 numbers, so it's not like it's \u2013 the number is zero, so \u2013 but depending on what happens, depending on what task orders get signed, that can vary from our plan, and we will certainly adjust estimates as appropriate if necessary based on that change.","Sean W. Wieland - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Okay. Thank you.","Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from George Hill with RBC.","George Hill - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey. Good afternoon, guys, and thanks for taking the question. I guess, Marc, I want to kind of focus in again on this investment. And I guess, if I heard you right, it sounded like part of the investment was for Works deals that are coming on and part is for the VA. I guess, first, I just want to make sure I heard that right.","And then the second part is kind of, how do we think about visibility and operating leverage as we go from 2018 to 2019? And I guess what I'm trying to figure out is what portion of the expenses related to future expected revenue? Are we already recognizing such that we understand the profitability of this revenue when it rolls on? Kind of how far out ahead of the revenue recognition, and if there's any way you can tell us, order of magnitude, ROE with the incursion of the expenses versus the expected revenue?","Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Yes. I think the incursion of the expenses ahead of revenue, I think 2018, the revenue streams will turn on relative to a significant portion of that investment certainly on the project side of the house so that, by the time \u2013 and that's why, in 2019, by the time we hit 2019, we should be making money on all of those resources that are now basically a pre-existing investment.","I think the 600-person investment that we're making in Kansas City for our Works offering, that will begin to \u2013 that will help us drive business in 2017 and should be contributing to delivering the 2018 because, in many of those Works businesses, centralization is the key to driving efficiencies. And by creating that centralized location in Kansas City, to begin doing that work right away rather than waiting for it to occur over a five-year period of time, we're trying to accelerate that efficiency and our ability to centralize into one or two locations something \u2013 activities that might be occurring at 10 to 15 of places today.","(46:47)","George Hill - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. So, if we just use the 600 number that you used then, I guess, I would ask how many of those people have you already sold through on Works deals and how many of those people are capacity for deals that haven't been sold yet?","Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Well, most of those people are \u2013 and keep in mind, on the Works deal, we rebadged the existing workforce. So for the most part, those 600 people aren't rebadged, they are new Cerner associates, and therefore, they are cost today. As we sign new business and are able to start putting them on projects and using them to facilitate existing projects, that's when we'll start getting the pull-through from them. I do expect most of that to kind of occur in 2018 setting us up for 2019, but there is an impact as we kind of roll through 2018.","George Hill - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. All right. I'll hop back in the queue. Thanks.","Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matthew Gillmor with Robert Baird.","Matthew D. Gillmor - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hey. Thanks for the question. Maybe following up on some of the margin comments, I think you've talked in the past about 50 bps to 100 bps of expansion in a normal year and I know you've got these investments for 2018 in the non-cash items. But as you think about getting leverage off of that, is that still a good number to think about in 2019? Or does some of the revenue mix items you've also discussed impact that range in a normal year?","Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Yes, no, I think obviously a great question. The business we've always talked about 50 bps to 100 bps being what we think should be able to be driven. I think it's certainly one of the things \u2013 and part of the investments we're making is to help drive the efficiencies and drive those \u2013 the margins in the businesses and get those projects started on a quick pace so that we can start driving the revenue from those projects quickly and the margins related to that.","It is going to be dependent somewhat on the mix because, if the Works businesses takes off and goes absolutely crazy and software basically is flat or slightly up, then that mix is going to at least impact near-term margins. I think our goal \u2013 and that'd be a great high-class problem if we're growing the top line of that business really quickly so that it was actually impacting our margins in that way. Our goal and our target is those Works businesses over time we continue driving efficiencies and enhancing those margins.","So, if I can basically, without growing margins, bring in a bunch of top line revenue and then start increasing those margins, those 50 basis point to 100 basis point increases that we talk about should be attainable. But I think you make a very good point that it is going to dependent on risk and we'll continue to try to provide our view of the mix of the business. That's why we give you the business model view that we'll talk about at HIMSS more in detail to let you kind of see what the mix of the business is and how it's impacting the margins.","Matthew D. Gillmor - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. And then on the revenue performance, Marc, you've talked about and you've given some numbers around the portion of revenues from backlog and bookings on an annual basis. Can you just give us a sense for how that came in for 2017? And did you see any better or worse conversion out of backlog versus bookings versus what you thought?","Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Yes. I mean, 2017 was just almost exactly on what we were expecting from backlog. So it was actually \u2013 felt really good, I think we delivered what we thought we would deliver from that revenue side. As we look at our 2018 plan as we went into 2017, we were looking about kind of somewhere around 82% of our revenue coming in from backlog for the year. As we go into 2018, we're at that same 82%. So I think we're still on a bigger revenue number, we're still driving a significant amount of that coming from our backlog, and I think that's probably 26% of our total backlog that we'll look to trigger in 2018.","So it's a very similar look. The one thing that, as you look at that number, it actually is maybe even a little better than the 82% we had in 2017 merely because the revenue standard does take some of your backlog away from you and this basically takes it out of some of those future periods. The rough standard (51:03) also kind of the offset to the income statement is it will give you a little bit more one-time revenue from certain transactions. So net-net for 2018, it's not going to be a material impact one way or the other, but from where the revenue comes from, there'll be a little less from backlog and a little more that comes from our normal current signings. So we feel pretty good as we look at 2018 and how it's set up relative to how much of the revenue is coming at it from backlog.","Matthew D. Gillmor - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thanks, Marc.","Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from Stephanie Davis with Citi. Stephanie, if your phone line is muted, could you please unmute the phone line? Again, Stephanie Davis, your line is open. You can ask your question.","Stephanie J. Davis - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hey. This is Stephanie Davis on. Thank you for taking my question. I just wanted to hear a little bit more about the commercial health plan win on pop health. Is this a bit of a one-off or how should we think about the expansion into this end market?","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","This is Zane. This is a part of the market that we have turned our attention to in pretty good order and I would anticipate we'll see \u2013 I mean, we're competing today on a number of those scenarios and we're competing very well. This particular win was a multistate environment and we have a couple of those that look very similar to that in our pipeline and progressing well.","So, our view is really HealtheIntent is an incredibly powerful tool that we can utilize in many ways and it's whether it's in our provider clients, payer clients and I think some non-traditional places where access to healthcare data, creating longitudinal health care records, taking the data from multiple systems, normalizing that data and creating actionable items back into the workflow, there's a lot of applicability in a lot of marketplace for that. And I feel very good about the market position that we've put ourselves into and I think there's only going to be growth in the addressable market for that toolset as we move forward.","Stephanie J. Davis - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","All right. That makes sense. And then one follow-up for that. Could you \u2013 just given the recent traction you're seeing in pop health and RCM bookings and if some of them would be (53:25) longer term, but could you walk us through the puts and takes of your longer-term margin expansion?","Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Well, clearly, we talked a little bit about the target that we've traditionally had of trying to grow margins 50%, 100% \u2013 or 50 basis points, 100 basis points annually. And I think you make a good point as was made before that the more that \u2013 more of those businesses \u2013 that growth is predicted somewhat on the mix of business. And the more we have of the Works type businesses, those can be somewhat lower margins on the services component. The more we have from the pop health business which tends to be higher margins because of the software and the tool and cloud nature of the tool brings us up to where those increases and margin can be greater.","So, as we look at our mix and we look to grow both the Works business and our pop health business, kind of on our 2025 view, we end up with the Works businesses are strong contributor, but almost about the same size you see pop health. And on that scenario, you should see us be able to expand margins as we go forward.","Stephanie J. Davis - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","All right. That makes sense on a mix standpoint. Thank you so much, guys.","Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks for the questions. Just wanted to go back to overall market demand. Marc, I think you described the EHR market as mature, which isn't necessarily new news, but we have seen some soft updates from some of your ambulatory peers recently. So just curious maybe if you could share what you're seeing out there from an RFP standpoint, has your win rate trended up or down? And if we maybe put this in the context of Cerner system sales, are you expecting growth as we look across 2018?","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","Robert, I'll take the first crack. And if Marc wants to do any cleanup, he can. I'll look at it and say, we are seeing very strong activity in community hospital marketplace, the small hospital marketplace, those are for all-in EHR systems, clinical, revenue cycle, administrative, ambulatory, in those spaces. And actually, those remain at near record, actually at record highs in terms of numbers. The size of those deals are smaller. But we also have some very large items like the federal government and state and local opportunities. So we're actually seeing demand at kind of that record pace side of that, but much of that is we have the lumpiness on some of the bigger items. And then much of our activity is a little bit smaller deal sizes.","So we still see good market opportunity in over 2,000 sites that are not on a currently marketed EHR solution, and that is really reflective of a little less than half of the marketplace in the U.S., total \u2013 needed to buy (56:22) a current contemporary electronic health record. So while we obviously view it as a more maturing situation, there's still quite a bit of runway in that space.","I think what, I'll let Marc comment on the reflection in our guidance. I think given you will see some smaller deal sizes with the exception of some of those big items, that is reflective in the guidance as we move forward.","Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Yeah, this is Marc. Relative to system sales, I think our 2018 plan would assume that we are growing system sales. So, the components of that, even in a mature market, you have different impact on \u2013 obviously had a stronger year this year in traditional license, but even the things we sell on a cloud basis or an ASP basis had significant growth.","So I think as we see that our SaaS business continue to take off, that's always going to go in there. And my expectation for growth in system sales basically assumes that tech resales basically is flat. It doesn't contribute to any of that growth. So that growth is coming primarily from the other elements of system sales, which are primarily software delivered in some form, either SaaS or through normalizing this (57:35).","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay, no, that's really helpful. And then I guess one quick follow-up on Adventist, congrats on the contract expansion there. I was hoping maybe you could just give us some sense of the scope of the expanded relationship and then maybe any context around how much this particular expansion contributed to the really nice bookings in the quarter.","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","Well, this is Zane. I'll comment as it relates to what the scope of it is, and then I'll let Marc decline your second part of your comment. The scope of this is a full revenue cycle outsourcing. So it's a full rebadging of all the personnel for Adventist Health. And previously, we were doing some work with Adventist around the RevWorks side of this and outsourcing, but this is actually a full rebadging. So, on the rev cycle side, it's all in with Cerner Corporation.","In addition to that, they also did a portion of their IT shop and outsourced part of that and created ITWorks business as well. So kind of a full all-in on the revenue cycle and then a big step in around the ITWorks side, but there's more to be had there. And that's reflective probably more broadly of what we're doing from our Value Creation Office and really how we're partnered with Adventist around driving value overall.","And so it's a true trading partnership and relationship in terms of the trust to what we're doing and the value they're receiving that they are so heavily invested now with us, both on the full outsourcing revenue cycle side and the partial ITWorks outsourcing side.","Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Yeah. As far as quantifying team, (59:21) it was an expansion. So you're not going to see the whole amount come in. But it's certainly a good sized deal, one of the deals over $75 million that we had during the quarter. So it's a good size, but once again, it was an expansion from the RevWorks side.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks for all that.","Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mohan Naidu with Oppenheimer.","Mohan Naidu - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Thanks for taking my questions. Marc, a quick clarification around the numbers, and I think on the system sales side you noted shift in some sales. I think you said content from subscription to license. Can you elaborate on that a little bit?","Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Yes, I think it was just \u2013 as we look at the performance that we had in 2017, we had a strong, certainly strong license. As we went into 2017, the sale of our content, we actually changed a little bit on how we sold some of that content. We can \u2013 so it was structured as a license, which put more of that revenue into the license, less of it into the subscriptions.","Once we go into 2018, that change won't be in place. So I think, as we go forward and look at 2018, we're just kind of making the point that big growth on licensed software, less growth on subscriptions. Those probably reverse a little bit so that there would be some growth on the license side and maybe a little bit more growth on subscriptions as we come into next year.","But overall, both ways are just ways of selling intangible properties. So, as long as we're \u2013 when we look at and we kind of combine those two, but as you guys look at them, they might be \u2013 you'll hear, see two different numbers, and we talked about license sales being a separate number. So just want to make sure you understood that that number was up this year. It's not going to grow as much next year. Subscriptions wasn't up as much and that likely grows more next year.","Mohan Naidu - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Got it. I'll keep it to that. Thank you very much.","Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Sure. How about we take one more question?","Operator","Our next question comes from Jamie Stockton with Wells Fargo.","Jamie Stockton - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks for squeezing me in. I guess, just, Marc, with the margin headwinds that we're certainly seeing in 2018, what are your thoughts about getting a lot more aggressive on the buyback front? Your balance sheet's clean. You guys are generating good free cash flow. Could we see maybe that used as a lever to improve the trajectory of earnings if we see these margin headwinds?","Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Well, certainly, margin headwinds are something that we're focusing on addressing in and of themselves from a business standpoint because I think these investments have got to drive more increased margins in the future. And that's why we're making them or we wouldn't make them.","As I said my comments, the board had approved \u2013 the latest approval was for $500 million of stock repurchase authorization. I think we spent about $70 million of that. So we still have that available. I think we've \u2013 last year, the year before, we were very aggressive, bought back a lot. Last year, a little less. I think, right now, we still are focused on buyback enough to offset any dilution that we have relative to options and other stock-based compensation.","But I think, given our free cash flow, we're certainly investing a lot. But even with that investment we're going to make from a capital standpoint, we still expect to grow free cash flow. We'll continue to look at ways to invest our capital. We'll continue to look at opportunities from an acquisition standpoint, although, as we've talked, there's just not that much out there that that interesting of size that would be something we'd be looking at.","So, given that those options are less likely, the way we use our capital would be to do stock repurchases.","Jamie Stockton - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","All right. Thanks.","Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp.","I appreciate everybody's time today. We thank you for being with us and we hope you have a good day. Thank you. Bye-bye.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's presentation. You may now disconnect, and have a wonderful day."],"4957":["Cerner (NASDAQ:CERN) Q1 2014 Earnings Call April 24, 2014  4:30 PM ET","Executives","Marc G.

Today's date is April 24, 2014, and this call is being recorded.","The company has asked me to remind you that various remarks made here today constitute forward-looking statements, including without limitation, those regarding projections of future revenues or earnings, operating margins, operating expenses, product development and new markets or prospects for the company's solutions. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements.

Please proceed.","Marc G. Naughton","Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the call. I'll lead off today with a review of the numbers. Zane Burke, our President, will follow me with the results, highlights and marketplace observations. Mike Nill, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, will discuss our imperatives. And then Jeff Townsend, Executive Vice President and Chief of Staff, will provide an update on our focus on innovation with Intermountain Healthcare. Neal Patterson, our Chairman and CEO, is with a client today.","Now I will turn to our results. Our total bookings revenue in Q1 was $910 million, which is an all-time high for a first quarter and reflects 14% growth over our previous Q1 record results in Q1 of '13.","Bookings margin in Q1 was $824 million or 91% of total bookings. Our bookings performance drove a 22% increase in total backlog to 900-point -- $9.24 billion. Contract revenue backlog of $8.45 billion is 24% higher than a year ago. Support revenue backlog of $796 million is up 6%.","Revenue in the quarter was $785 million, which is up 15% over Q1 of '13. The revenue composition for Q1 was $207 million in system sales, $175 million in support and maintenance, $382 million in services and $21 million in reimbursed travel.","System sales revenue reflects a 4% increase over Q1 of '13, due to the growth in software and subscription revenue, which offset another decline in technology resale. The tech resale decline was, in part, due to a tough comparable in our global business where we had a large hardware sale in the year-ago period. But the rest of tech resale was also below our expectations. Our forecast reflects growth in tech resale for the rest of the year.","Q1 system sales margin dollars grew 21% over the year-ago period, driven by continued strong levels of the higher-margin system sales components of software and subscriptions.","Moving to services. Total services revenue was up 25% compared to Q1 of '13, with strong growth in managed services and professional services and good contributions from ITWorks and RevWorks. Support and maintenance revenue increased 9% over Q1 of '13.","Looking at revenue by geographic segment. Domestic revenue increased 21% for the quarter. Global revenue was down 16% from Q1 of '13, which, as I mentioned, was a tough comparable for global. Zane will discuss our global outlook for the rest of the year, which is very good.","Moving to gross margin. Our gross margin for Q1 was 83.5%, which is up from 81.3% in Q1 of '13, reflecting strong software and subscription levels and a lower mix of technology resale.","Looking at operating spending. Our first quarter operating expenses were $463 million before share-based compensation expense. This is a year-over-year increase of 20%. Sales in client service expenses increased 23% compared to Q1 of '13, driven by an increase in revenue-generating associates in our services businesses and growth in depreciation.","Our investment in software development was up 12% compared to Q1 of '13. As previously discussed, the growth in software development is due to increased focus on investing in growth initiatives.","G&A expense increased 15% compared to Q1 of '13, driven by increased personnel expense related to our strong growth and higher amortization expense, related to recent acquisitions and acquired intangibles.","Moving to operating margins. Our operating margin in Q1 was 24.6% before share-based compensation expense. This is down 10 basis points compared to Q1 of '13, due to slightly higher growth in operating expenses. Our forecast for the rest of the year reflects approximately 100 basis points of margin expansion, with less than that next quarter and more in Q3 and Q4.","As you know, this can vary based on revenue mix, and we will focus on delivering predictable levels of growth in gross margin and earnings dollars, which we did this quarter without margin expansion.","Moving to net earnings and EPS. Our GAAP net earnings in Q1 were $119.5 million or $0.34 per diluted share. GAAP net earnings include share-based compensation expense, which had a net impact on earnings of $9.6 million or $0.03 per diluted share. Adjusted net earnings were $129.1 million, and adjusted EPS was $0.37, which is up 11% compared to Q1 of '13. Recall that Q1 '13 had a lower tax rate that benefited adjusted EPS by $0.01. If you adjust Q1 of '13 for this, our normalized growth this quarter would be 14%.","The Q1 tax rate for adjusted net earnings was 34%, which is in line with our expected effective tax rate. For the remainder of 2014, we expect our effective tax rate to remain within 50 to 100 basis points of 34%.","Now I'll move to our balance sheet. We ended Q1 with $1.47 billion of total cash and investments compared to $1.43 billion in Q4. Total cash and investments include $1.03 billion of cash and short-term investments and $437 million of highly rated corporate and government bonds with maturities less than 2 years. Our total debt, including capital lease obligations, is $160 million.","Total receivables ended the quarter at $564 million, which is down $19 million from Q4. Our DSO in Q1 was 66 days, which is down from the Q4 DSO of 67 days and down from 69 days in Q1 of '13.","Operating cash flow for the quarter was $156 million. Q1 capital expenditures were $70 million, and capitalized software was $45 million. Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures and capitalized software, was $42 million for the quarter.","Looking at capitalized software, the $45 million of capitalized software in Q1 represents 40% of the $111 million of total investment in development activities. Software amortization for the quarter was $25 million, resulting in net capitalization of $19 million or 18% of our total R&D investment.","Note that operating cash flow was impacted in Q1 by the timing of tax payments and other working capital elements, which reduced operating cash flow by over $80 million as compared to Q1 of '13.","Also I wanted to point out that we received a $48 million cash grants in Q1 from the Kansas Department of Commerce in connection with the construction of our Continuous Campus. While this will show up in the financing section of our cash flow, it's not really debt, and I view it as another element of cash flow. Looking at the rest of the year, we expect stronger operating cash flow and, as a result, stronger free cash flow.","Our outlook for capital expenditures and capitalized software remains the same as what we provided last quarter. We expect capital expenditures to be $260 million to $280 million for the year, which is down from $353 million in 2013. We expect capitalized software to remain in the mid-$40 million range throughout the year, which will lead to it being flat or slightly higher than the $175 million capitalized in 2013. This reflects a reduction in the use of third-party developers, which will be offset slightly by an increase in our own developers.","Regarding our share buybacks. We purchased 1.3 million of shares for approximately $75 million during the quarter, and now have $142 million remaining from the $217 million that was authorized in December.","Now we'll go through Q2 and full year 2014 guidance. For Q2, we expect revenue between $790 million and $830 million, with the midpoint reflecting growth of 14% over Q2 of '13. For the full year, we expect revenue between $3.25 billion and $3.4 billion, reflecting 14% growth at the midpoint. This is up from our prior range of $3.2 billion to $3.4 billion.","We expect Q2 adjusted EPS, before share-based compensation expense, to be $0.39 to $0.40 per share, with the midpoint reflecting 16% growth over Q2 '13 adjusted EPS.","Q2 guidance is based on total spending before share-based compensation expense of approximately $470 million to $480 million. For the full year, we expect adjusted EPS between $1.63 and $1.67, with the midpoint reflecting 17% growth. This is up slightly from our prior range of $1.62 to $1.67. Our estimate for the impact of share-based compensation expense is approximately $0.03 in Q2 and $0.11 to $0.12 for the full year.","Moving to bookings guidance. We expect bookings revenue in Q2 of $1.0 billion to $1.06 billion, with the midpoint reflecting 10% growth over Q2 of '13, which is our toughest comparable of the year, having grown 33% over 2012.","In summary, we're pleased with our results in Q1 and believe we are positioned for a good year. With that, I will turn the call over to Zane.","Zane M. Burke","Thanks, Marc. Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll provide Q1 highlights and discuss marketplace trends.","Starting with our results. Our bookings revenue in Q1 of $910 million reflects 14% growth over Q1 2013 and that's a record for a first quarter. This growth was achieved despite another weak quarter of technology resale.","In addition, we had no new ITWorks or RevWorks deals in the quarter, but we did have contributions from scope expansions at existing ITWorks clients and good sales of Revenue Cycle solutions. For the quarter, we had 23 contracts over $5 million, including 13 over $10 million. The mix of long-term bookings was 28% in the quarter, which is lower than recent quarters because of less contribution from the Works businesses. Note that our pipeline is strong for our Works businesses, and we still expect to have a very good bookings this year.","25% of our bookings this quarter came from outside of our core Millennium installed base, reflecting ongoing competitiveness. As we highlighted at our recent Investor Day, we continue to have significant opportunities to gain share, as we believe we are in the early stages of another wave of EMR purchases that will disproportionately go to Cerner or our primary competitor. With our win rate against this competitor significantly improved, we are positioned for good share gains in coming years.","The volume of potential new business was also very apparent at HIMSS this year, where we interacted with more potential new clients than we ever have.","Now I'll cover some of the specific areas that contributed to our Q1 results. I'll start with Revenue Cycle. While we didn't have a RevWorks deal in Q1, contribution from Revenue Cycle was still good. This was driven by ongoing sales of our broad suite of Revenue Cycle solutions. Our forecast for the year calls for ongoing strength in solution sales and increased contribution from RevWorks.","Overall, the outlook for our Revenue Cycle business remains positive, as revenue and costs are top of mind for all providers, and the importance of Revenue Cycle being integrated with clinical solutions continues to increase as the industry shifts to at-risk models.","The opportunity is significant in our installed base, as many of our large clients are still on antiquated Revenue Cycle solutions. Revenue Cycle is also part of almost every opportunity for our business outside our base, and the improvements we have made in recent years have been an important part of our increased competitiveness.","In addition, we think the delay in ICD-10 will be a slight positive to our Revenue Cycle business because we had some prospects that were going to wait until after the deadline to install new solutions that can now consider installing them before the new deadline.","Our population health organization also delivered strong results, driven by demand for HIE, Patient Portal, Enterprise Data Warehouse and clinical process optimization. In addition, we had additional sales of our new Healthe Intent Smart Registries solution and have a strong pipeline for the year.","Moving to the ambulatory space where we had a strong Q1, with our clients continuing to favor our integrated offering over standalone solutions, we had 6 significant displacements of our key competitors and 2 strategic Business Office Services deals during the quarter. We also had a very good quarter in the small hospital market, adding 5 new CommunityWorks clients, bringing 8 clients live, and hosting a record level of prospective clients in our Vision Center.","Outside of the U.S., we had a strong quarter from a bookings standpoint, driven by contributions from the Middle East, Canada, Australia, Ireland and England. However, revenue declined by 16%, largely due to a tough comparable related to technology resale.","For the year, we still expect double-digit revenue growth outside of the U.S., driven by the strong bookings in Q1, a good bookings forecast, and an easier comparable period for the rest of the year.","In the Middle East, we brought our pilot site live for the Ministry of Health in Saudi Arabia in just 9 months, which is a record for a global go-live. This is no small feat. It is a 500-bed hospital where we automated inpatient and outpatient physician and nursing workflows across emergency, surgery, laboratory, pharmacy and medical record departments. We also had 6 more hospitals in the Middle East achieve HIMSS EMR Adoption Stage 6, giving us 13 compared to just 1 for all other competitors combined. We believe this success positions us for more business in the region.","Now I'll cover a couple more marketplace observations. Health care providers remain focused on controlling costs and increasing quality, while juggling requirements for Meaningful Use, health care reform, Value-Based Purchasing and ICD-10. We believe IT is this -- the biggest lever to help providers navigate these changes and facilitate a transition to an at-risk model that incents keeping people healthy.","We also expect that as providers focus on controlling costs, they will continue to look at acquisitions to attain scale. As we've mentioned, this trend has benefited Cerner because our clients have been the most active acquirers, and we expect this to continue. Each of the last 2 quarters have included bookings contributions from clients buying solutions for acquired hospitals.","In summary, Q1 was a solid start to the year, and I feel good about a highly successful 2014.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike.","Michael R. Nill","Thanks, Zane. Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'm going provide a quick update on our corporate imperatives. Recall that our imperatives are captured in the long acronym, PPR\/CIM+1, with the PPR representing our focus on physician, population health and Revenue Cycle, and the CIM+1 representing continuum of care, intelligence, member engagement and personalized medicine.","I'll start with physician experience. With physician productivity being key to a clinical enterprise and Meaningful Use accelerating physician adoption, having solutions that optimize the physician experience is critical. As a result, we have invested and continue to invest heavily in physician experience and productivity. The record results for our physician solutions that we have experienced over the past 2 years are evidence that these investments are paying off.","We are also investing to support the evolution to a population health model in which the physician is going to take on a team managing thousands of people that are on registries. This brings me to population health. As you know, one of our development partners for population health is Advocate Health, who has over 500,000 lives for which they are financially at risk. So they are incented to keep people healthy.","We achieved a major milestone last year by releasing our Healthe Intent Smart Registries solution just 7 months from contract signing. Healthe Intent Smart Registries is part of our Healthe Intent cloud-based platform, which is a multipurpose programmable platform that aggregates, normalizes and standardizes clinical, financial and broader population data. While it is still early in the development of our population health solutions and the evolution of the market, we are pleased with our progress and believe we have the most comprehensive approach.","Third-party validation of this came in a Chilmark Research report about their experience at HIMSS, where they asked multiple purported population health solution providers to explain their process map for enabling a client to effectively move to a population health model of care. They indicated that Cerner was the only supplier to articulate such process map.","Moving to Revenue Cycle. We continue to have outstanding results that I believe are directly attributable to the large investments we have been making. While we have not added a full RevWorks client in recent quarters, our pipeline remains strong, and we expect 2014 to be another strong year for Revenue Cycle as a whole.","We also remain excited about the potential of our work with Intermountain Healthcare to build an activity-based costing system, which will further our differentiation.","Now I'll quickly cover the CIM+1 part of our imperatives. The first is continuum of care, which reflects the view that you have to include the entire continuum of care in any complete population health model. It's not just the doctor's office or hospital. Cerner has the broadest suite of solutions across the continuum, including solutions for home care, long-term care, skilled nursing facilities, behavioral health, rehabilitation facilities and employers.","In addition, we are proving the ability to connect to non-Cerner solutions across the continuum through our work with Advocate, where we are connecting approximately 70 data sources. Our ability to aggregate the information across the continuum, perform analytics and put the relevant information back into the workflow is a big differentiator.","Moving on to intelligence. Through the work with client partners, we have created industry-leading predictive capabilities for sepsis and readmissions that show our ability to embed intelligence in information technology. In the case of readmissions, the predictive algorithm we worked with Advocate to refine, performs 20% better than industry average and has been deployed at 120 non-Advocate sites.","Intelligence is also a large focus of our work with Intermountain Healthcare, where we have a huge opportunity to positively impact health care by embedding their care process models into our EMR-agnostic Healthe Intent platform.","Now I'll cover the member engagement. As organizations become accountable for not only the care but also the health of their patients, the way they connect to them will change. No longer are people just patients. Each person is now an important member of the client's population with whom they must engage and help manage their health and care needs.","In 2013, we enhanced our member engagement capabilities with the addition of PureWellness, a comprehensive wellness portal that reaches millions of members through employer, health plan and health system clients.","Finally, the +1 represents personalized medicine and the inclusion of the genome in diagnosis and treatment. Cerner has been focused on the power of genomics and its impact to the clinical processes, dating back more than a decade when we released Millennium Helix.","With the cost of genetic testing coming down, we are starting to see more opportunities in this area. For example, we announced in late 2013 that we are working with Claritas Genomics to advance personalized medicine by building tools to integrate ordering of genomic sequencing tests, laboratory processing, results interpretation and incorporation of the results into the EMR.","In summary, we are making great progress on all of our imperatives. This year, we expect to continue to advance these imperatives as we focus on helping our clients use our intellectual property as a lever to improve quality and safety while controlling cost.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeffrey A. Townsend","Thanks, Mike. As Mike shared, we've been accelerating our innovation and market validation through strategic partnerships. This is more than just traditional alpha site deployments. These are highly aligned engagements that enable us to work at the edge in a living laboratory environment that provides immediate feedback with short cycle times.","As we highlighted with multiple client presentations during our investor event at HIMSS, we have been given the opportunity to work side-by-side with these organizations as they transform towards a future state. For Cerner, this creates an environment where ideas and concepts can more quickly evolve into real world production solutions.","The byproducts of these relationships are much more than software solutions. It's about embedding the systemic framework for change, enabling what the Institute of Medicine calls a Learning Health System. To go a little deeper on what this looks like in practice, I'm going to provide an overview of what we are working on with Intermountain Healthcare.","When we announced the partnership, one of my early quotes was that this partnership could accelerate clinical computing by at least a decade. I still believe that. There are several areas of innovation that will contribute to this and over a few short months of engagement, the opportunity list continues to grow.","The first is around Intermountain's care process models. These are summarized guides to clinical decision-making, focused on both conditions and specific decision points within a care process. They are highly contextual, moment-in-time decisions that remove variance and produce the best outcome at the most appropriate cost, all in the context of the patient, provider and venue.","The system awareness of context is the most important part. It's what removes the clutter and noise. When done well, the system anticipates the next move. The ability to use a variety of trigger events to push the decision moments face up in the conversation makes the workflow dynamic. Think of it as a clinical navigation system, a GPS for medicine.","A big next step is making Intermountain's care process models EMR-agnostic, yet still inside the workflow. This will enable a new standard of care where we create the moment-in-time experience to support the decision, and at the right moment in time, it will surface contextually inside the workflow of the physician without upgrades, mapping of interfaces, or retraining of a workforce. This puts us on a path to accelerate a lot of the work done by the industry today by embracing and advancing current work more quickly.","We think these models have the potential to be the next generation of workflow, completely self-contained diagnostic, treatment, outcome and reimbursement containers. It could easily become the new transaction that replaces the claim in the fee-for-service world.","A key enabler, much of what we are doing, is our commitment to having the most open and interoperable EMR platform on the market. Most of the discussion today around interoperability is pretty basic and moving at a very slow pace. At HIMSS, Cerner and Intermountain showed the power of blending an emerging set of standards we have tagged Smart on FHIR. Using the SMART standard to provide plug-in web experiences within the workflow and HL7's Fast Health Interoperability Resources, commonly referred to as FHIR. We showed the ability to plug non-Cerner and non-Intermountain applications into the workflow contextually.","One example was showing a consumer-friendly growth chart app developed at Boston Children's, spanning both Intermountain's existing clinical system and Cerner Millennium to create a continuous story. This allows us to more rapidly unlock the same potential for open platform development that has been experienced in other industries, which we believe will disrupt the current paradigm of how an EMR is used in the delivery of health care.","What we were doing with Intermountain and what have already been done with Advocate around interoperability and realtime analytics is a big differentiator for Cerner. Many of you probably saw dozens of booths that HIMMS highlighting a data warehouse, showing elegant graphs that purport to provide great insight into the data. However, if you can't get that insight back into the workflow when the physician is making the decision, at what I call the moment of relevance, then you're just reporting the news versus making the news.","Another focus of our innovation with Intermountain is with their transformation lab, where multiple technologies and partners come together to innovate in a startup-style environment. One of the examples I talked about at HIMSS was advancing past device integration and the interoperability to environment orchestration with our CareAware platform. For example, with the ability to continuously stream vitals off of devices, the physician's order for IV meds can be placed to give a medication until a vital, such as heart rate, reaches a specific range, and once it gets into that zone, then taper back or stop the medication.","The ability to coordinate devices to create an outcomes-based ordering capability is very plausible, and will have a predictable impact on quality, cost and outcomes.","The last area of innovation I'd like to cover is what we're calling an activity-based EMR. The core component here is to dissect all the activities of medicine in LEGO-like components so that you snap them together around a purpose. Dr. Brent James at Intermountain has done a lot of work in this space and has componentized a large number of procedures, activities and what he calls risk force [ph], those number over 800, which are drivers for clinical care.","This ability to group things together into components and have the option to now snap together workflows that drive change rapidly into the clinical process while knowing costs, measures and outcomes is very powerful. What is unique about the approach we're taking together is the inclusion of goals and outcomes associated to the activities. If you look at just costing, with a pure resource or consumption-based model, you miss the fact that the activities were aligned to an expected outcome. In some cases, those outcomes are events or risks you're attempting to avoid.","While the cost of a manual capture of vital signs versus a wearable continuous device will be different, the ability to constantly monitor the patient's status continuously changes the outcome risk well beyond the comparable resource costs of collecting the data.","If you're going to attempt to impact appropriateness, costs and quality at the same time, you have to include expected and actual outcomes mapped to activities.","In summary, the most exciting part of this partnership isn't the individual innovations or the potential impact they can have. It's the next generation of Cerner's consulting methodology rooted in agile development techniques, being applied to support both the implementation of core solutions and the continuous overlay of new solutions and decision support capabilities.","A key objective is to move away from the traditional waterfall IT approach of static, one-size-fits-all projects, to a more nimble, continuous innovation environment that anticipates and embraces change. In the case of Intermountain, we are running on a 6-week model system release cycle, producing workflows, contents, solutions and education materials that come together into a comprehensive release.","This approach creates a culture of continuous improvement versus a one-time conversion mentality. The emerging toolkit from the methodology, combined with activity-centric design and componentized care decisions, on top of an open platform, are the foundational building blocks of the next generation of clinical computing.","This is very important work, and we have a sense of urgency driven by entrepreneurial impatience, sense of responsibility to improve the overall system and competitiveness. This urgency also comes from our belief that the rest of this decade will include more changes in health care than what has occurred in the last 6 decades combined.","The solutions will need to keep up. IT organizations will have to reinvent their methods, and provider organizations will demand a more dynamic and contextual experience. Our role has always been to anticipate the future of health care and create solutions to meet those needs, and now is the window to accelerate.","With that, I'll turn the call over for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.","Your next question comes from line of Richard Close with Avondale Partners.","Richard C. Close - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","So just a real quick question because I know there's probably a log jam here. But just on the RevWorks, you commented that you haven't seen anything in the last couple of quarters. Can you just talk a little bit, maybe, about what's holding up additional contracts from coming into the bookings? Are you seeing increased competition, the likes out there of Optum and Dignity, obviously, you got Conifer and Parallon and some of those. Just give as an update on your view of that -- the lay of the land in that area.","Zane M. Burke","Richard, this is Zane. I would actually describe it more as when we thought ICD-10 was going to occur, there was more of a natural holding in terms of when you would take one of those RevWorks opportunities from a transition perspective, when it would make sense. So with the delay in the ICD-10 piece, we think that it makes sense that some of those will actually come forward a little bit sooner now, and we see some really good opportunities in that pipeline. But so I don't see it really from a competitive perspective, it's really more of a natural progression in the timeline.","Richard C. Close - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And quick follow-up with respect to patient financial accounting system on the Rev Cycle. I think you mentioned the opportunity to be able to jam in some systems due to the delay. Is there any type of quantification you can give in terms of what you would expect, size of bookings, in that product area?","Marc G. Naughton","Yes, Richard, this is Marc. We wouldn't have any specific guidance relative to the Rev Cycle solutions. The demand is in our pipeline, and certainly, it would be reflected in the bookings guidance we provide. But it does feel like with ICD-10 being pushed, the people are starting to look at acquiring financial systems probably for implementation after ICD-10 goes live and we're starting to see that activity.","Zane M. Burke","Before. I'm sorry, before ICD-10 goes forward, not after.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mohan Naidu with Stephens.","Mohan A. Naidu - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Jeff, on IFC Intermountain, are you guys already replacing the health system they are using, or how far along are you guys before you can do that?","Jeffrey A. Townsend","We're still -- we're just a few months into the project. But the expectation is that we'll replace both HELP and the HELP2 system starting later this year.","Mohan A. Naidu - Stephens Inc., Research Division","All right. And just a follow-up on the same thing. On the care process models that you talked about in innovation, are you guys planning such a way that you can take that out and offer it to other clients? And how does that -- how do you expect that to work?","Jeffrey A. Townsend","Yes. So the plan is to not only develop them, the run-in type of systems here, but to have those externalized so that they cannot only be used by existing Cerner clients but non-Cerner clients, as well. And we have a short list of candidates we've started working with inside the base that will pilot that for us this summer.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Greg Bolan with Sterne Agee.","Michael P. Ward - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","This is Mike Ward in for Greg today. We just have one quick question. If you think about your current lot share of the installed base of hospital clients, how much room do you think there is to grow?","Marc G. Naughton","The question is based on, number one, our installed base, the opportunities within the installed base. Certainly, a lot of our growth is predicated on taking market share in addition to our installed base. I think the level of growth, when you look at just some of our newer offerings such as RevWorks and ITWorks, when you only have double-digit-barely ITWorks and single-digit RevWorks and 300 clients that could take those offerings over time, that's a pretty large opportunity. And it's actually dollars already coming of their wallets that they're already spending, that they would merely redirect to Cerner. Those are -- we use the pretty good chunks of dollars that would come into us. So I think relative to the -- to our current share of their wallet, while we're certainly an integral part of their IT strategies, many of our large clients don't even have Cerner throughout all of their hospitals. So it is a process that they've undertaken and continues to be underway. So there's opportunities to sell more into the base as they expand. Certainly as the market consolidates and they acquire more hospitals, there's more chance to expand. So I don't know that -- I don't see us limited based on our current market share of wallet. I think there's plenty more opportunities for us to go get more business out of the existing client base, in addition to the other opportunities we see out there.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette with UBS.","Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So with the ICD-10 delay, it sounds like it's opened up some conversations on new RevWorks projects, which is obviously positive. But I guess, I'm curious, is there any chance you've seen any uptick in conversations on new EHR projects since the delay? I mean, has there been any shift in the focus of clients away from RCM and back towards the EHR with the delay? Or is it maybe too optimistic to make that assumption? Just kind of curious to get your thoughts on that.","Zane M. Burke","This is Zane. We haven't -- I haven't necessarily seen whether that piece is out there yet. It's not reflected in our guidance at this point in time. But I think there is a sentiment as people figure out how they're going to shift their projects. They're clearly going to look at other things that they can go accelerate. And so that's a net positive. I certainly have been pleasantly surprised overall by the number of -- when we talked about the second buying wave. The second buying wave could accelerate some that long-term bubble that we see out in the future of clients that are -- or prospects that actually have achieved even as high as HIMSS Level 7 on other providers and are yet active in the marketplace, at -- looking at exchanging their EHR because they don't feel like the solution they have will suit their future needs. So I do think there are some opportunities in that with the push of ICD-10.","Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And I guess, so besides the RevWorks that you mentioned, are there any other product categories that are noteworthy and then you've seen an uptick in interest since the delay? Any other shifts that are worth mentioning?","Zane M. Burke","Not at this time. I think some of the integrated ambulatory -- because of the issues with the physician documentation requirements for ICD-10, I think we will see -- I haven't seen it yet, but I do think we will see that ambulatory uptick will continue for us and that we'll have continued strength in the ambulatory side. And that shift in ICD-10 could have a net positive to us from the ambulatory side.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Stockton with Wells Fargo.","Jamie Stockton - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I guess, maybe the first one, Zane, I think this is for you. Stage 2 of Meaningful Use, it doesn't seem like there's been a lot of attestations across any of the vendors so far. Can you give us some sense for how you feel like hospitals are faring in that?","Zane M. Burke","Sure. We did actually have our first attestation. And so, as you know, the publicly available data is lagging in terms of what else is out there, but I will tell you, we did have our first attestation in the first quarter. And we anticipate a significant number of clients here in the second and third quarters and tracking that very closely. And we're working with those clients to develop the plans for how they'll be rolling out. So I would anticipate you'll see Cerner clients in the second quarter, a very significant chunk of those attesting at this point. As far as competitors, I have not seen any other competitor that has attested for Stage 2 Meaningful Use yet at this point. But again, the publicly available data is lagging by about 60 days.","Jamie Stockton - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Has the experience of the hospitals that have been going through that attestation process, I mean, has there been any, I guess, unexpected hurdles that you have been hearing just from the feedback you've been getting?","Zane M. Burke","I think every time -- anytime you're doing new things, you get -- there's always some twists and turns and every environment is a little bit unique to the organization. And so as you go through that, there's some tweaks. But overall, our clients are tracking very well, and that we've got a discrete plan for every single client that we have out there around Meaningful Use 2 and we're -- to ensure that they achieve the dollars that they deserve to achieve.","Jamie Stockton - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just on CommunityWorks. From the hospitals that we've been talking to, it feels like maybe 2014 is kind of the first year where you're seeing a lot of the smaller facilities that are in the orbit of larger health systems start to look at transitioning to whatever system that large health system that's geographically closest on. Are you guys feeling that in the marketplace? Or has that already been a trend that's been going on for a while and we're just now picking up on it with our checks?","Zane M. Burke","Well, I think you are touching on one element that is becoming more about where health systems are identifying or kind of caught more of that feeder system to their overall broader strategies, and the Critical Access Hospitals are wanting to connect -- or the big systems want those connections to mature. And so we are seeing that out there, and I would call that probably more of a future development. Obviously, we've highlighted some of the acquisition activity, which there's kind of -- so there's sort of the 2 forms: the affiliation and tighter linkage, or acquisition model. And I think you're going to see more of joint ventures, more affiliations, along with -- I do anticipate an uptick again once -- because of the ICD-10 delay, I think you'll actually see an uptick back again on the acquisition side.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Francis with RBC Capital Markets.","David K. Francis - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","A couple of longer-term growth-oriented questions. I think, Zane, this one is for you. Understanding the need for care coordination and population health in the health care marketplace, as you look at your customers, how would you characterize where the provider market is today from both an operational and a cultural perspective, to actually be able to use the IT tools that you guys are developing for that part of the market today?","Zane M. Burke","It depends, very much, on the geography, so -- and the management teams, overall. So those geographies where -- and clients that are more risk-oriented are -- they're ready for the tools today. There are certain geographies and certain clients that are not either -- they don't have -- they're not necessitated to actually go swim towards a risk yet today because their model is more -- is still the fee-for-service and they don't see it coming. Or they're, frankly, hoping against hope that the old model will stay. And so those clients are not quite as far along in their thinking -- their thought process there. So I would describe is the early movers are ready for the tools today. Those that aren't the early movers, it's a little bit more evangelical conversation that we have with them.","David K. Francis - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And when you say ready, do you mean from a, we've bought into the concept perspective, or that we are structurally ready from -- in incentives, in a reorganization of the operating teams and all of that kind of stuff that needs to happen, as well?","Zane M. Burke","Yes, there's varying degrees. There are those on the very early side that are fully ready. They're absolutely moving towards the risk in advance of even the models being out there, so that such that they're prepared. And we actually have a number of clients today that are full incentives, changing their workflow models and changing, really, the way that they think. And they have one foot in the fee-for-service model and one foot in the risk side. They're fully in, so they're beginning to think about the at-risk even at the expense of the fee-for-service model because they know it's the inevitable future.","David K. Francis - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And as a quick follow-up, turning over to Revenue Cycle. To what degree have you looked at or are you changing your Revenue Cycle solutions to address the increase high-deductible health plans that are being sold in the market today and going forward? And the increase in direct patient payment portion of the overall healthcare spend as it relates to your clients' Revenue Cycle needs?","Zane M. Burke","We're always -- the ever-changing environment out there, there's continual revisions to the solutions and elements that we do. But it's -- that's not been a big driver in our immediate elements. But we're clearly very close to how the thought process is there and how the future is going to play out.","Marc G. Naughton","It's part of the reigning measures and mandates that we continue to see. This is Marc, and we just -- certainly, the software keeps up with all of the regulatory requirements that are going in the business, baked into the business needs of our clients. So we are ready for them.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Krueger with Barclays.","Eric Krueger","I'd like to ask about the international market. I know that you see strength ebb and flow in this market. I'm curious, hearing about the go-live in Saudi Arabia. How much of what you're targeting is advanced systems for hospitals versus other geographies where you may be looking at the most simple system to get through the door and up and running?","Zane M. Burke","That's a great observation. As you're obviously aware, certain global markets have lower levels of clinical automation. I would tell you that the Middle East has actually a very high level of clinical automation. So it's a very -- it's a much heavier depth of automation than many other global marketplaces. The Saudi space is very much -- and the Middle East space is very much a deep clinical thought process.","Eric Krueger","And are you going into areas where you are starting with a strong base, or is it that you're starting from scratch with a very high funding and bar to hit?","Marc G. Naughton","For Saudi, it was a single pilot. We were just [ph] selected. Their process was to select a single pilot. We've turned ours on and we've delivered. We don't know that any other pilots have even started in that process. So we believe that the first to market, first to install, first to see the benefits is going to give us an advantage. But currently, once again, they don't have a large procurement in place. They are doing it on a hospital-by-hospital basis. We're just very pleased that we have our first one up and running and doing very well.","Zane M. Burke","And I'll just -- for color purposes, in the rest of the Middle East, I think you see a lot of early demand for population health tools because those countries are thinking at the population health level. And so they are thinking about things just a little bit differently, and I think you'll see them move more quickly over time because they have the ability to do it in the contained, smaller environments and in a way that they can regulate. I think that there's quite a bit of demand in the population health side in the Middle East.","Marc G. Naughton","Eric, this is Marc. I would just point out that inside the tender we're in, we already have a lot with us, in multiple private hospital clients in Saudi. So we certainly aren't looking at our first footprint in the country, we have multiple footprints there. And if you look overall in the Middle East, we have an order of magnitude more HIMSS Level 6 clients in the Middle East, so I think that supports Zane's point of these are complex clinical environments, and I think that's supported by the HIMSS level we're seeing in our client base.","Eric Krueger","And could you just remind be the tender, your next step or the size of the opportunity you hope to address?","Marc G. Naughton","There's no prescribed next step once we deliver the pilot. It's up to them to take the next step. There are well over 200 hospitals that would qualify for this opportunity. And so that's kind of the order of magnitude.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Leo Carpio with HM Global.","Leo F. Carpio - HM Global Capital LLC, Research Division","I must -- I'm just going to change the tone of the conversation. What have been the competitive environments so far in terms of the deal flows you're seeing this year, in terms of who you aren't able to be competing against, and since you're anticipating a replacement cycle, it sounds like your prospect is that maybe a duopoly is just going to emerge and become the factor by next year in the market for you?","Zane M. Burke","I think you just answered your own question, which is we do see it as a duopoly, that principally who we are competing against is one other competitor. Sometimes you might have an incumbent that is given an opportunity in that particular organization, to have an opportunity to compete against the 2 of us in that side. And so that's typically how a typical arrangement would go. For us, we've seen a 20% increase in our pipeline since Q1 of 2013. So when we look at the opportunity side of this, we're seeing an acceleration of pretty dramatic opportunities across all segments of our business.","Leo F. Carpio - HM Global Capital LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just quickly, the ICD-10, you mentioned that this part could be a positive for you for this year. Is -- and that some cost probably [ph] will be reshuffling their priorities and figure out what products they want to move forward with. Is that more a case of the midsized hospitals? Or is it just, in general, that you're seeing that?","Zane M. Burke","It's, in general, that we're seeing that. So I think there is an ability for some of the midsized hospitals to move a little bit quicker because it's single projects, and their planning cycles can be a little bit different. But those ICD-10 resources can be reapplied somewhere else. And many of them were planning to do a Revenue Cycle selection after the ICD-10 element, which now allows them to think about doing it now. And the same thing goes on the RevWorks side of that conversation.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Garen Sarafian with Citigroup.","Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","First question is a pretty broad level and on EMR displacements. So I guess, I'm a bit surprised to hear the strength of the displacement market for the EMRs this year as we talked to industry participants. So I'm just wondering, could you just offer a bit more color as to what you're seeing versus maybe what you were thinking a few months back, or any changes in the pockets of opportunity? And I guess, also, just the vendor group that you're competing against, if there's been any changes?","Zane M. Burke","Well, we've been highlighting this second wave for quite some time and actually, we believe it's a 5- to 7-year wave of second buying. And I think that recently, Class actually verified what we have been saying as a second wave of buying decisions. And again, as evidenced by the 20% increase from my pipeline, which is also inclusive of my new client, which is actually in excess of 20% increase over Q1 of 2013, we're seeing it flow through and, again, it's -- the competitors are -- our principal competitor and the incumbent that exists out there, primarily.","Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. So -- it's -- but I guess, there's no change versus your expectations a few months back then. It's sort of as expected?","Zane M. Burke","I think the only thing that's evolving probably a little bit different for me is I've seen, as I mentioned then from a color perspective, some clients which you would say are highly automated today have reached a good level of automation with an incumbent solution. But they feel like that foundational solution won't last -- stand the test of time, are beginning to think about changing their core EHR solution. And I would say some larger organizations fit that model that I wouldn't necessarily would have been -- thought they would have been in the marketplace. And I can see them coming into the marketplace over the next 12 months.","Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Got it. Okay. And then secondly, just not to beat the ICD-10 topic to death. But at this point, would another delay beyond next year really matter for your business? I mean, what are clients saying at this point? Are they making any decisions around ICD-10 for next year?","Zane M. Burke","At this point, no, they're not really making any -- they're on -- they're kind of on standby to secretary discretion on how this works. And so they're just on standby. And I think they're going to begin the plan as if it's not there, would be sort of my -- for my sense. Now many of them had invested heavily to prepare, and we're advising our clients to stay on the prepared path because you don't want to waste the work. In fact, if it is -- actually comes in within a year, but I think most clients are -- will pretend as if it's not there unless they weren't ready for it at this point in time, in which if that's the case, that gives them an opportunity to take a second swing and get actually prepared for that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Charles Rhyee with Cowen and Company.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Marc, just had a quick question about the guidance going forward. You talked about your expectations on the margin expansion, 100 basis points, rest of the year. Did I hear you correctly when you said second quarter may be a little bit less than that? The back half a little bit more? And then if that's correct, in the back half, does that -- are you kind of thinking both quarters are like that, or wouldn't we just lump 2 of these together, in aggregate, it will be greater than 100?","Marc G. Naughton","Yes. No, I think on a quarterly basis, the expectation would be Q2, a little bit lower, Q3 and Q4, a little higher, so that for the year, we end up with our 100 basis-point improvement. I think it's important when you look at Q1 where we kind of actually have just, basically, flat operating margin percent, that even in a quarter where we had tech resale go down, which normally will help us with our margins, that the client tech resale actually was almost equally offset by a 27% increase in software. So our revenue line was solid, and obviously, I like the higher margin. But in Q1, we also had some significant investment in R&D expense and some increases in some G&A, along with the client services expense that increased, to support the strong increase in net revenue. I think from an overall standpoint, Q1 came out very good for us. We love the dollars we drove out. But certainly, a little bit lower on the margins. We think that will kind of settle back to the 100 basis points by the time we end the year, with Q3 and Q4 being at a higher level than you'll see in Q1 and Q2.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just 2. When I think about the back half because, obviously, you gave us what you think the expense -- the aggregate expense will be in the second quarter, should we think that the margin improvement, as we accelerate north of the 100 basis points, will be more from gross margin or is it more from taking expense out further?","Marc G. Naughton","Well, it should be, basically, the continuing -- you'll see more leverage from kind of overall spending where you're going to see revenues increasing at a rate that's higher than our spending's increasing. Traditionally, where you see that is in our leverage.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Cherny with ISI Group.","Michael Cherny - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Marc, first, one quick clarification. Did I just hear you right when you said 27% software growth in the quarter?","Marc G. Naughton","Correct. And in fact, I had a 27% decrease in tech resale on the revenue side. So it just so happened, from a revenue standpoint, those basically offset. Obviously, I'm really excited about the software increase and, well, disappointed that the tech resale was lower when we were getting to a point where we're not going to talk about that anymore. The pipeline for tech resale would indicate that it will get back to the levels we had -- basically, that we had expected where we were basically trending somewhere, where we were last year.","Michael Cherny - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Yes, I think we're all excited to stop talking about that. So think I'm in the same camp as you. And then one just quick question on the international market. We touched on Saudi Arabia and this great success you had there. As you think globally about the countries that you're in, maybe outside Saudi Arabia, just because of the recent focus, what do you think is the one country or region that you think has the greatest opportunity to pursue a U.S -like model, a broader-based digitization of the health system? Is it somewhere like Brazil? Is it somewhere like the U.K., finally getting their act in gear? I guess, what's the most optimistic international market for you guys?","Zane M. Burke","Well, this is Zane. I think the U.K. does represent, from a near-term perspective, one of the biggest and best opportunities. I think that people are -- in the U.K., as they come out of NHS trust model, are recognizing a need to actually have deep clinical systems. And I think those trusts that are more progressive and forward-thinking are headed that way. And I have spent some time with some clients recently who are -- who have come to that conclusion even at the risk of their having to pay significantly additional dollars from the -- as opposed to going to the open-source NHS model. So I think that represents a great opportunity for us. I think Australia is still -- is a very good market, broadly speaking for us, in addition to the Middle East. And I think Brazil is a longer-term play that we'll have to see how that rolls out.","Marc G. Naughton","And this is Marc. I think we're even seeing an aggregation of populations in Canada, as well as part of their health system is going more provincial and trying to get almost an entire province on a single platform so they can manage the health of that population. So -- and I think that Australia, obviously, with the Queensland activity, as they're doing an entire territory. So think those -- and then I actually talked earlier about Middle East being countries -- those countries aren't large and they can actually automate a population health strategy in the entire country without having to -- so lots of opportunities on the global side.","Operator","And the final question will come from the line of George Hill with Deutsche Bank.","George Hill - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just one quick question. Marc, I wasn't able to get the trend file open yet. Can you tell me what the percentage of bookings that came from new clients into the quarter was?","Marc G. Naughton","25%.","George Hill - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","25%. Okay. And then just kind of a follow-up question on the bookings. If we look at this quarter's bookings, I don't know if you can break it down into just broad buckets for us, but if there's 25% that comes from new, I guess, can you tell us like what percent is coming from cross-sell and what percent is coming from renewals, kind of what percent is coming from, what I would call like the meaningful client expansion -- call it, 2 buckets, right? Client expansion of people who buy more widgets from you and people who acquire facilities and then need to roll the technology out to acquired facilities? I guess, I'm just trying to understand what bookings mix is looking like these days?","Marc G. Naughton","Yes, this is Marc. I think from a view, keep in mind that most of our sales are perpetual license, so there's not so much a renewal element. To ours, we certainly have an element subscription business that's part of our revenue stream, but not a huge part of it. Most of the bookings are coming from new sales of software, they're coming from new sales and services, from implementation, from a variety of support services, Business Office. There are some minor amount of, say, hosting renewals that occur. But for the most part, George, I would say that the vast majority of those bookings are new agreements for new things to those clients.","George Hill - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then so, I guess, when you get the big Works deals and the bigger -- I guess, the bigger deals, we didn't see any of those this quarter, and that's what we'll see in the future, continue to drive the upside to numbers. And kind of a lot of these cross-sell opportunities are what should remain the kind of visible bookings opportunities, is might be the right way to think about it. Or the opportunities that will kind of be readily available from the installed client base.","Marc G. Naughton","Yes, I think that's fair. I don't know that the Works things do have some level of visibility because they're big. Certainly, they've got some risk-down factors, to the extent, as we're providing guidance. But I think that's a fair statement.","Well, I appreciate everybody attending the call today. Neal is not here for a wrap-up. So I just want to thank you for attending. I know we ran a little late. And I hope you heard a good story here. We're excited about the rest of this year as our pipeline is firming up well and we see a lot of opportunities. So with that, enjoy the rest of your day. Thanks for attending.","Operator","Thank you for your participation in today's call. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect, and have a great day."],"4964":["Cerner Corp.

Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Thank you, Vince. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the call. I will lead off today with a review of the numbers. Zane Burke, our President, will follow me with results, highlights, and marketplace observations. And then Jeff Townsend, EVP and Chief of Staff, will provide an update on Intermountain Healthcare and Cerner's innovation.","Now I will turn to our results. Q4 was a good finish to the year. Revenue, earnings, and cash flow were all at or above targeted levels. Bookings were slightly below our guided levels, primarily because we didn't have a Works deal in the quarter, but full-year bookings were very strong.","Our bookings revenue in Q4 was $1.35 billion, which reflects 16% growth over Q4 2014. While that is a healthy growth rate, it is below our guided range. There was an ITWorks deal and a large professional services contract in our forecast that would have led us to comfortably achieving our guidance range. While they didn't close in Q4, we do expect them in future quarters. For the full year, our bookings revenue was $5.43 billion, which is 28% growth over 2014, and reflects more than $200 million of upside to the bookings guidance we provided throughout the year, including Q4.","Our revenue backlog ended the year at $14.2 billion, which is up from $10.6 billion a year ago. Revenue in the quarter was $1.18 billion, which is up 27% over Q4 2014, and in the middle of our guidance range. The revenue composition for Q4 was $382 million in system sales, $247 million in support and maintenance, $528 million in services, and $18 million in reimbursed travel.","Revenue in the quarter includes approximately $245 million from Health Services. This is down from approximately $250 million in Q3, but note that the deferred revenue adjustment was higher in Q4, so Health Services revenue was basically flat sequentially on an operational basis, which is in line with our expectations.","For the full year, revenue grew 30% over 2014 to $4.4 billion and includes approximately $930 million from Health Services. System sales revenue reflects a 36% increase over Q4 of 2014, with the growth mainly driven by an increase in subscriptions, which is where the addition of Health Services has had the biggest impact, as well as strong growth in licensed software. For the full year, system sales revenue grew by 36% over 2014. Our system sales margin percent in Q4 was 68.4%, which is up from 67.5% in Q3 due to strong sequential growth in licensed software. Full-year system sales margin percent was 66.4%, which is basically flat compared to 2014.","Moving to services, total services revenue, including professional and managed services, was up 23% compared to Q4 of 2014. Full-year services revenue was up 28% over 2014. Support and maintenance revenue increased 25% over Q4 of 2014 and 35% for the full year, with the lower growth in Q4 due to the extra week in Q4 of 2014.","Looking at revenue by geographic segment, domestic revenue increased 28% over the year-ago quarter to $1.04 billion. And global revenue grew 21% to $134 million, both driven largely by the addition of Health Services. For the full year, domestic revenue grew 29% and global grew 37%.","As a preview to the annual update of our detailed business model that we'll provide at our investment community meeting on March 2 at HIMSS [Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society], I'd like to provide you with the total revenue and growth by business model for the full year 2015. Licensed software grew 24% to $564 million. Tech resale grew 21% to $330 million. Subscriptions increased 76% to $388 million. Professional services revenue grew 13% to $1.24 billion. Managed services increased 56% to $858 million. Support and maintenance was up 35% to $976 million. And reimbursed travel was $73 million, which is down 19%.","Moving to gross margin, our gross margin for Q4 was 83.0%, which is up from 81.3% in Q4 of 2014, reflecting strong licensed software growth. Full-year gross margin of 83% was up from 82.2% in 2014.","Looking at operating spending, our fourth quarter non-GAAP operating expenses, which exclude share-based compensation expense, voluntary separation plan expense, and acquisition-related adjustments, were $686 million, which is up 31% compared to adjusted Q4 of 2014 operating expenses. This growth was primarily driven by the addition of the Health Services business. For the full year, operating expenses before share-based compensation expense, voluntary separation plan expense, and acquisition-related adjustments were up 33% to $2.6 billion.","The total year-over-year growth for each expense category in Q4 on a non-GAAP basis was 26% for sales and client service, 33% for software development, and 59% for G&A. Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, the new line we added in Q2, was basically flat. For the full year, sales and client service grew 29%, software development grew 38%, and G&A grew 54%.","Moving to operating earnings and operating margins, our operating margin before share-based compensation expense, voluntary separation expense, and acquisition-related adjustments was 24.7% in Q4, which is flat to the year-ago period and up 20 basis points from Q3 of 2015. Full-year operating margin came in at 24.3%, which is basically flat compared to last year.","Moving to net earnings and EPS, our GAAP net earnings in Q4 were $166 million or $0.48 per diluted share. Adjusted net earnings were $2.2 million. And adjusted EPS \u2013 diluted EPS was $0.61, which is up 30% compared to Q4 of 2014. Adjusted net earnings exclude share-based compensation expense, which had a net impact on GAAP earnings of $13 million or $0.04 per diluted share, as well as the voluntary separation plan expense, which had a net impact on GAAP earnings of $861,000 or less than $0.01 per diluted share.","Adjusted net earnings also reflect adjustments related to Cerner's acquisition of Health Services, including: Health Services acquisition-related amortization, which reduced GAAP net earnings and diluted earnings per share by $15 million and $0.04 respectively; other acquisition-related adjustments, which reduced GAAP net earnings and diluted earnings per share by $4 million and $0.01 respectively; and the acquisition-related deferred revenue adjustment we have not included in GAAP net earnings, but increased adjusted net earnings and diluted earnings per share by $13 million and $0.04 respectively. For the full year, adjusted net earnings were $741 million and adjusted EPS was $2.11, which is up 28% from 2014.","The Q4 tax rate for adjusted net earnings was 27%, which is lower than the normal range primarily due to the R&D tax credit being reinstated in Q4. The R&D tax credit benefited EPS by approximately $0.04, with about $0.03 related to the first three quarters before the reinstatement of the credit. Therefore, we view our normalized adjusted EPS for the quarter as $0.58 instead of $0.61.","Now I'll move to our balance sheet. We ended Q4 with $686 million of total cash and investments, which is down from $766 million in Q3, primarily due to the use of cash for our stock repurchase program. During the quarter, we finished the remaining $145 million of stock repurchases authorized in September of this year, repurchasing 2.5 million shares at an average price of $58.40. For the year, we repurchased 5.7 million shares for $345 million, or an average price of $60.39.","Moving to debt, our total debt including capital lease obligations is $605 million, which is down slightly compared to Q3.","Total receivables ended the quarter at $1.03 billion, which is down $19 million from Q3. Our Q4 DSO was 80 days, which is an improvement of five days compared to Q3. We are targeting DSO in the 70's in 2016.","Operating cash flow for the quarter was extremely strong at $353 million, up from $272 million in Q3. Q4 capital expenditures was $107 million, and capitalized software was $60 million. Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures and capitalized software, was $186 million for the quarter, driven by strong operating cash flow.","For the full year, operating cash flow was $948 million and free cash flow was $321 million, with capital expenditures of $362 million and capitalized software of $265 million. As previously indicated, we expect capital expenditures to increase in 2016, primarily due to construction of the new campus. We still expect to generate solid free cash flow, with growth in operating cash flow offsetting most of the increase in capital expenditures.","Now I'll go through Q1 and full-year 2016 guidance. For Q1, we expect revenue between $1.15 billion and $1.2 billion, with the midpoint reflecting growth of 18% over Q1 of 2015. For the full year, we expect revenue between $4.9 billion and $5.1 billion, reflecting 13% growth over 2015 at the midpoint. We expect Q1 adjusted EPS before share-based compensation and acquisition-related adjustments to be $0.52 to $0.54 per share, with the midpoint reflecting 18% growth over Q1 2015 adjusted EPS. For the full year, we continue to expect adjusted EPS before share-based compensation and acquisition-related adjustments to be $2.30 to $2.40, as initially stated on our Q3 earnings call, with the midpoint reflecting 11% growth over 2015.","Moving to bookings guidance, we expect bookings guidance in Q1 of $1.15 billion to $1.25 billion. The midpoint of this range is flat to Q1 of 2015 bookings. Given the very tough comparable established in Q1 of last year with 32% bookings growth and 28% growth for the full year in 2015, there will be some quarters this year with flat overall growth. We do expect growth for the year, but note that even flat bookings will lead to a two-year CAGR of 13%. Also given that nearly 80% of our guided revenue is scheduled to come out of backlog, we believe we can deliver our revenue and earnings guidance even if bookings were flat.","With that, I turn the call over to Zane.","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","Thanks, Marc. Good afternoon everyone. Today I'll provide color on our results and make some marketplace observations.","Starting with our bookings, our bookings revenue in Q4 of $1.35 billion reflects 16% growth over Q4 of 2014. As Marc mentioned, this is slightly lower than expected primarily due to less long-term bookings, but still a strong level of bookings that contributed to our excellent growth for the year at 28%.","Bookings this quarter include another all-time high level of large contracts, with 46 contracts over $5 million, including 29 over $10 million. For the year we had 153 contracts over $5 million, with 102 of those being over $10 million. This reflects 37% growth in contracts over $5 million and 62% growth in contracts over $10 million.","For long-term bookings, we had a strong quarter for remote hosting, but did not have a new ITWorks or RevWorks deal. So the percent of bookings from long-term contracts was 27%, which is about 7% lower than the average of the first three quarters. For the year, long-term bookings were 32% of the total bookings, which is 2% higher than last year, reflecting full-year strength in the Works deals.","We continued our new business momentum in Q4, with 36% of our bookings coming from outside","our core Millennium installed base. 2015 was by far the best year in our history from a new business standpoint. During the year we signed more than double the number of new footprints than any year in our history, which we believe is evidence of our strong competitiveness and the large opportunity for competitive displacements.","Our success was very broad during the year, with new business coming from IDNs, regional hospitals, children's hospitals, community hospitals, state and federal, behavioral health, ambulatory surgery centers, and physician groups.","I believe 2015 was a breakthrough year from a competitiveness standpoint. I believe our success is driven by several factors. First, we are much better in key areas because of our R&D investments. In the past five years, we've invested more than $2 billion in R&D, with a focus on population health, physician and clinician experience, revenue cycle, consumer, interoperability, open platforms, and mobility. These investments are leading to much better performance in traditional competitions for EHR and revenue cycle and further differentiation in areas like population health and open platform capabilities. We have also focused on predictable delivery capabilities, cost of ownership, and delivering measurable value, which is critical in an environment where ROI is increasingly important.","Finally, the marketplace is becoming more aware of our primary competitor's higher cost of ownership, lack of system openness, and a lack of investment in cloud-based systems to support population health. We believe this is leading to more success against our primary competitor in EHR procurements and opportunities in their installed base for population health.","Turning to population health, 2015 was a great year. We had 30% bookings growth, and we now have 85 clients that have chosen the HealtheIntent platform to support their population health strategy.","A highlight of 2015 was success outside of our EHR installed base, with one example being Geisinger Health System choosing HealtheIntent to extend their data-driven population health capabilities. This announcement made a clear statement to the market and has already added to our long list of opportunities outside of our EHR base. We currently have more than 20 opportunities outside our installed base, most of which use our primary competitor's EHR. I believe this activity is validating the broad opportunity for HealtheIntent and the shortcomings of our primary competitor.","Another highlight was that we were recently selected to support the health insights of a statewide Medicaid population. The state will use HealtheIntent's enterprise data warehouse solution to gain insights and intelligence from claims and clinical information across the state's Medicaid population, which will enable them to manage outcomes at an optimal level. This is a new market entry point for Cerner and is an additional example of how HealtheIntent expands Cerner reach beyond our EHR base.","A key reason we are having so much success at selling HealtheIntent solutions is that clients who have already adopted them are getting great value and have become examples for the industry for how technology can enable a transition to quality and value-based reimbursement. A good example of this was captured in a January feature in Health Data Management magazine. The article covered Advocate Health Care's success at using HealtheIntent's platform to gather more than 60 different clinical and transactional data sources and use predictive algorithms to predict risks, improve patient care, and control costs.","Moving to our revenue cycle business, we had a very good year with bookings that were more than","double 2014 levels and included several of our large clients choosing Cerner for revenue cycle. Operationally we brought 39 acute care sites and 455 clinics live on Millennium revenue cycle, and we now have more than 1,800 live sites.","Our momentum in revenue cycle is also reflected in very strong organic revenue growth, with revenue cycle nearly doubling in the past three years. We expect continued strong growth going forward, with many large clients forecasted to transition to Cerner revenue cycle and a large volume of RevWorks and Extended Business Office opportunities.","Moving to the ambulatory market, where we had a strong Q4 and year, for the year ambulatory bookings grew over 50% and included 38 displacements of our primary ambulatory competitors. This included some of our largest acute care clients choosing to replace their existing ambulatory supplier.","We also had a strong start to penetrating the Health Services base, with 16 Health Services clients choosing Cerner ambulatory. Our ambulatory business office services offering also had a strong year that included our two largest deals to date, both of which were displacements of a certain cloud competitor.","We also had a strong year in the small hospital market with our cloud-based CommunityWorks offering, where we ended the year with more than 130 clients. This year's success was driven by a combination of traditional new footprints, extensions through our health system clients, and Health Services migrations. One highlight for the year was Great Plains Health Alliance selecting Cerner CommunityWorks for their 25 critical access hospitals across Nebraska and Kansas. Looking ahead, the small hospital market remains very active, and I expect 2016 to be another good year.","Now I'd like to provide an update on the Department of Defense project. I am pleased with the work","accomplished by the Leidos Partnership for Health Defense (sic) [Leidos Partnership for Defense Health] over the past several months as we prepare for the pilot site rollouts. Next month at HIMSS, the partnership will highlight many of the solutions that will be used in the implementation, including some military-specific workflows, first-responder applications, mass vaccinations, and theater synchronizations.","Our collaborative effort has led to solution enhancements and data portability that are essential to achieving the free flow of information across all venues of care and creating a system that works for healthcare organizations working to improve the well-being of individuals and communities. I believe this work can benefit the entire client base and the broader healthcare industry.","Moving to Health Services, we had a good first year at signing Health Services clients to migrate to","Millennium. Over the year, over 40 sites signed to migrate, including both IDNs and small hospitals. Operationally, I'm very pleased with how Cerner and Health Services teams have come together in the past year. Health Services associates have proven to be highly talented and are adding value in many key areas of our business.","Outside the U.S., we had a solid year. Full non-U.S. revenue growth was 37%, with most of this driven by the addition of Health Services, as organic revenue growth was limited to low single digits due to the extra week in 2014, the impact of currency fluctuations, and the lower activity in some markets where economies are struggling. Even though our non-U.S. results tend to be lumpier, we continue to believe global markets represent a large opportunity for both EHR and population health. And Cerner is well positioned for this opportunity with associates or offices in more than 25 countries and a strong market position in many of them.","Now I'd like to provide several marketplace observations. The first is that health systems are increasingly being asked to live in two worlds, a future state driven by reimbursement models aligned to risk and quality outcomes and a current state where fee-for-service is still the predominant model. To bridge the gap between the present and the future, health systems need to solve the same problem, how to effectively manage and make disparate data meaningful and drive appropriate action from it. Solving current state problems such as proactively identifying reimbursement opportunities, driving efficiency across venue-specific workflows, and true visibility into the quality of care being delivered are critical to enable health systems to outperform their peers in an increasingly competitive healthcare market.","To make the pivot, health systems will compete by proactively identifying populations at risk, redefining clinical engagement to preempt problems, and enabling the person to be a more active member of the care team. We believe clients are looking for a platform to help bridge these worlds: compete more effectively on quality and efficiency in today's environment, and more actively engage and manage populations in the future state, and HealtheIntent is a perfect fit for satisfying these needs.","Second, the EHR replacement market remains very active. While regulatory pressures and solutions being sunset by competitors continue to drive opportunities, we are also seeing more purchasing behavior driven by value and vision, which is positive for Cerner. Almost all EHR replacements also represent a revenue cycle opportunity, as providers prefer integrated clinical, ambulatory, and revenue cycle systems.","Third, consolidation in the hospital market has remained active, and this is creating opportunities for Cerner. In the past three years, Cerner clients accounted for nearly 50% of hospital buying activity, creating an opportunity for more than 100 new footprints. Consolidation is not isolated to the provider markets, with payers and HCIT suppliers also actively merging in an attempt to attain scale to compete in the evolving healthcare market.","Fourth, we believe that EHR will evolve from a transactional system to an intelligent activity-based system that will enable faster adoption of best practices, reduce variance, personalize care, improve outcomes, and the ability to identify unit costs, which will be critical as reimbursement shifts to outcomes-based and bundled payments. This is consistent with the direction Cerner has been headed and has been a focus of our efforts with Intermountain Healthcare.","Finally, we believe openness and interoperability continue to become increasingly important. This benefits Cerner because of our long-time commitment to interoperability and open systems. This commitment was recently advanced by our launch of our Cerner Open Developer Experience, which is an open site designed to enhance collaboration with third-party and client developers with SMART-on-FHIR applications. We believe this open platform has the potential to unlock future cutting-edge solutions that can benefit not only our client base, but the entire industry.","In summary, there is a significant amount of change occurring in healthcare. We believe more will change in the next five years than the last several decades, and Cerner is very well positioned to benefit from these changes.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeffrey A. Townsend - Cerner Corp.","Thanks, Zane. Today I'm going to provide an update on our collaboration with Intermountain Healthcare and what they refer to as their iCentra project and how it is advancing Cerner's methodologies and our pace of innovation.","After completing a second regional deployment in Q4 of 2015, we are now heads-down deploying an ever-improving model system design across Intermountain in 2016 while continuing to innovate and improve in parallel.","A component of how we're doing both at the same time will be a topic that Marc Probst, the CIO at Intermountain, and I will be co-presenting at HIMSS in an education session titled What IT Takes for Success, sharing our joint experiences and approaches to shift traditional information technology to improvement technology that will better align with Intermountain's journey to a learning healthcare system. By applying a hybrid of agile development concepts with continuous quality improvement, it has significantly changed the pace of both innovation and adoption.","As a byproduct of this work, the models and methods have continued to shape Cerner's next generation of continuous improvement methodologies, which are represented within our model system framework. The library of process models, workflows, configuration, and best practices are all part of a comprehensive kit that is applicable and measureable across our client base to speed our life cycle from innovation to adoption at scale.","As this foundation of techniques, tools, and measurements are utilized across multiple organizations, Cerner has continued to build on our ability to measure the experience of an end user as they navigate through our applications. This suite of analytics is called Cerner Advance, which includes a set of solutions that has leveraged our learning in the population health space.","The difference is that this is the population of clinicians using the system, and the health status is how effectively they're utilizing the features and preferences of the system within their workflow. It also allows us to identify and personalize improvement interactions at the individual user level, just like you would with care management for patients. We all learn at a different pace, in different ways. This technique applies an Amazon-like consumer profiling for clinicians, which we think is a key component of its accelerating adoption.","As I've shared before, a core component of our relationship with Intermountain has been the ability to advance innovation of clinical computing models more quickly. Within Cerner, we have started to use the term Model Practice to represent the focus on contextual clinical decision-making within the workflow as a seamless byproduct of patient care. In the case of Intermountain Healthcare, this is where their Care Process Models surface naturally. As Zane outlined, the evolution of reimbursement models is increasing the demand to remove unnecessary variance in both costs and outcomes, which is shifting the focus to greater predictability and intelligence within the EMR experience.","We are now far enough along in our journey together that we have represented the breadth of structured care models, from simple to complex, and have extended the platform capabilities with a small set of Cerner clients to cover the continuum of care models, guidelines, pathways, and predictive algorithms. This suite of clinical decision support solutions is called CareDecisions. This covers a continuum of capabilities that can range from highly contextual point-in-time decisions, like a patient with pneumonia presenting in the ED for treatment, to a series of nested pathways that would cover chronic conditions or diseases like cancer that could span several years.","The architecture of this platform is based on open principles, allowing for both portability of predictive models that run from the cloud across multiple clinical data sets that span enterprises to something we call a SmartZone, which is face-up within the physician workflow and contextual to the moment. It's through this coordinated set of CareDecision capabilities that we think we can deliver intelligence that would create what Clayton Christensen refers to as a facilitated network in his book, The Innovator's Prescription. We anticipate this configuration and collection of open systems will make up the Model Practice layer of our model efforts and enable clinical evidence to be sharable, portable, and programmable across Cerner clients and the industry.","Finally, I wanted to briefly share the growing capabilities of advancing an activity-centered design within the EMR. We have found that the ability to link measurements from application experiences, process variation, clinical evidence, and outcomes provide significant new insights into our ability to achieve business and clinical objectives. This too is becoming part of the evolution towards a learning healthcare system, with priorities being established based on desired outcomes versus implementation of technology. In many cases, this inverts the model that most have chased in the era of meaningful use.","What we found is that while independently a workflow may be followed, it may not be timely, which in turn impacts the effectiveness of adopting clinical evidence. This in turn produces a suboptimal outcome, even though several of the process-centered metrics may have indicated a good result. This concept is shaping a new understanding of critical thinking and how clinical integration evolves in an environment where everything is connected and instantaneously aware, with a depth and breadth of data that is significantly larger. As the boundaries move from patient-centered visits to the continuous engagement of population health, there's no question it will require this next layer of intelligence in context. Our ability to predict and dynamically adapt the healthcare ecosystem based on activities in context is what we think drives the next tier of outcome improvement.","Before handing the call over to questions, I wanted to provide a brief update on Neal [Patterson]. His initial treatments have gone well, and he is progressing as expected. He's very appreciative of all the well wishes that he has received from associates, clients, and investors, and pleased with the excellent care he has received. At Cerner, we have no doubt that his experience will further fuel his desire to continue to improve the system.","With that, I'll turn the call over to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question is from Jamie Stockton of Wells Fargo. Your line is open, sir.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Jamie?","Operator","One moment, sir.","Jamie J. Stockton - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","My first question, Marc, how much of the slowdown in bookings growth in 2016 is a result of long-term deals going down as a percentage of the overall bookings mix?","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Keep in mind we're talking about Q1, and the long-term bookings do have various impact on quarters. The deals we talked about relative to not happening in Q4 are not slated to happen in Q1. So we're not going to get those just rolling over a quarter. They're going to probably happen in the first half of the year.","So when we talk about Q1 bookings, likely it's going to be slightly lower, but it's not unusual for Q1 to be somewhat cyclical and a little bit lower than we've experienced. I think when we look at the first half of the year when we see the pipeline that we have, I think we're very confident that we'll see growth in bookings. So Q1 is more of a reflection of us telling you exactly what we're seeing without any of the carryover deals from Q4 benefiting us.","Jamie J. Stockton - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","When we look back at the last four or five years and that long-term component of bookings has been around 30%, is that a reasonable expectation for people to model out in 2016?","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","I think in 2015 it was probably closer to 32% or 34%, so it was a little over 30%. I think for the year it's 32%. So I think if you stay \u2013 if you're using 30%, you're going to be within range. We've got opportunities for Works deals. Some of them \u2013 a lot of the new deals that come to us have a long-term component. So I think using 30% is pretty reasonable.","Keep in mind, we don't expect for next year to have flat bookings. But our backlog currently will supply 79% of next year's revenue just coming out of that backlog. So from an income statement perspective, we're well suited even if bookings happen to be flat, as we always indicate when we talk about our guidance. But we do see the first half of the year certainly that gives us our best visibility, we'd expect to exceed and grow bookings for that period.","Jamie J. Stockton - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay, and then maybe just one other question. And I don't know if this is for you or Zane, but 2015 was a good year for Cerner. As far as footprint expansion is concerned, you guys touched on that with your prepared remarks. If we set aside the DoD deal because that seems to be relatively one-time and just look at the success that you had outside of that, can we expect 2016 to be as successful? Zane, I think you threw out a relatively large number for the number of facilities that you guys brought on with incremental deals somewhere in the 170 range at an investor conference earlier this year. Is 2016 going to be a very similar year the way that you guys are seeing it play out, or are we going to see it be a year where maybe there's a little bit of a slowdown and then in 2017 reaccelerates?","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","I would first start \u2013 thanks, Jamie, for the second question. I'd first start by saying the DoD accounted for eight sites for 2015. So in my count, we took the first work order, and that only represented eight sites that we accounted for, actually the 238 sites, so we're updating what we had said at a previous conference that would have been through the third quarter. We're at 238 sites for the year. So that represented eight of those 238, so a very small percentage of those were related to the DoD in 2015. As we have success moving forward with the DoD, we'd anticipate those additional sites coming into play.","We see great market opportunity in 2016, similar to 2015 in terms of the opportunity that we see, particularly as we look out at the first nine months of the year, and so I feel very strong about the opportunity and really our competitiveness in that. So I think we would expect to see similar numbers. It's hard to get it. With each opportunity, the number of sites is a little challenging because that can differ based on the mix that you have in there. But we see the same kind of levels of new market opportunity, so I think that kind of site-level performance will be pretty similar.","Jamie J. Stockton - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay, thank you.","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Cherny of Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Michael Cherny - Evercore ISI","Good morning, guys, and thank you for all the color so far on the call.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Sure.","Michael Cherny - Evercore ISI","So we're coming up obviously on the one-year anniversary of the Health Services acquisition. Actually we've passed it, but I'm more thinking from a P&L perspective. As you think about the business now versus where you were maybe a year ago or even when you announced the deal, can you maybe talk about the positives and negatives you've seen relative to the Health Services business being on-boarded and what it does on a go-forward basis related to what you think the true run-rate of this business is? And if you're going to update that at the Analyst Day, I apologize for getting ahead of myself.","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","This is Zane. We will be providing some update as it relates to Health Services, but I'll give you some of the \u2013 it's a great question. From a positive perspective, it's done what we've set forth to do, which is bring on the client base that the Health Services folks had, don't disrupt the growth of Cerner and the trajectory we're on, and make sure that we retain the talent at Health Services, which were critically important elements. And I felt very good about those components.","The number of migrations that we had, as I mentioned in my prepared comments, was over 40. If you looked at the previous five years combined, we had more conversions to Millennium than we had in the previous five years combined from just natural takeover of what happened from a migration perspective in the open marketplace. So I would look at that as incredibly positive on moving the traditional Siemens Health Services clients to a Millennium platform.","The combination clients that have Cerner as a core EMR solution and as a revenue cycle client, we have done a lot of work in terms of taking out the pain points for those clients for managing those two different databases now that we're under one company and able to help those clients and really kind of derisk that base from the revenue cycle perspective. So I feel really good about the overall performance of Health Services. And certainly from a financial performance, we've met or exceeded our targets in terms of what we were attempting to accomplish from a bottom line perspective.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Michael, this is Marc. Since Zane was going to point out the positives, I guess it would leave me to talk about anything that might be slightly negative. Clearly from our perspective, just being able to see the revenue line, their lack of a handle on the revenue number from their side, and therefore us having to go through that, and that impacted, as we talked about, some of our revenue projections.","The good news is that they have the same lack of visibility on spending, and that actually turned out to be better from a reduced spending standpoint than the lower revenue was. So we all ended up the year actually ahead of where we wanted from an OE perspective, as Zane said. But I think that's probably the thing I would point out as something that was a little bit lower than our original expectation, not significantly, but enough that it obviously impacted some of the guidance that we provided.","I think as far as the two companies coming together, that feels really good. I'm very impressed with both of our teams and the effort and time that they put in to achieving a One Cerner view of the world. And I think one year in, we just today upgraded our financial systems to PeopleSoft 9.1, and so we are all running on the same financial systems. And all that is pretty impressive to get done within this 12-month period from date of close. So other than the revenue side, I'm pleased as well.","Michael Cherny - Evercore ISI","And if I could sneak one more quick one in, you guys are talking a lot about the positive business momentum. Obviously, I think there's a dislocation between that and where the stock is both heading into today as well as in the aftermarket. Do you think any differently, given the cash flow generation, of addressing the market, particularly taking advantage of the depressed valuation to doing any type of ASR? I know you completed the buyback, but any thoughts there would be greatly appreciated.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Sure. Certainly every year we look at our capital and look to deploy it in the best possible manner. Certainly stock repurchases are one of the things we've been doing recently. I don't know if people \u2013 you guys track a lot of numbers, so you probably know it exactly. But we've spent \u2013 in 2013, 2014, and 2015, we spent $731 million buying back about 13.3 million shares. So I think that certainly indicates that we're going to go to the market.","Our normal philosophy is, obviously as we've discussed, purchasing shares to offset option dilution. I'm not sure if we would do an accelerated stock repurchase, but we might. Certainly, we have a board meeting in March, and I would expect the board to be looking at this year and looking at our available cash that we'd like to dedicate toward repurchase and doing as they have every year consider whether that's a good investment, which in the past we have certainly thought it was a good investment.","So we think the opportunities for the company are significant. We're going to be talking about our 10-year plan at our next board meeting. And I think based on what we see there and some of which we will actually share at HIMSS with you guys, I think that it makes sense for us to consider that.","Michael Cherny - Evercore ISI","Great, thanks.","Operator","Thanks. Our next question is from Garen Sarafian of Citi. Your line is open.","Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Good afternoon, guys, and thanks for all the color. I guess I wanted to just touch on the sales guidance for the year. The guidance now is \u2013 the midpoint is $5 billion, whereas last quarter it was over $5 billion. So I understand the bookings in the fourth quarter that didn't occur, but I'm wondering. Is there anything else that's changed in your view, whether it be some milestone payments that had come up I think last quarter that you're now not expecting in 2016, for example, or any other factor that's impacting the current sales guidance?","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","This is Marc. No, from a revenue perspective, our numbers have always been right around the $5 billion number. So clearly, in Q3 it was our preliminary view. This quarter is certainly more locked down relative to our plan. And in our minds, it's basically unchanged.","Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay, fair enough. And then you mentioned the bookings growth was impacted by an ITWorks deal that did not occur as well. I think you had mentioned another project which I didn't catch. But could you just elaborate on both? Because it sounded like at least the ITWorks deal you didn't expect it in 1Q, but you sounded very confident that it was to happen rather than if it would happen. So I'm just trying to get a little bit more clarity as to what was the delay and what gives you confidence that it will indeed occur.","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","This is Zane. We expect both of those opportunities to close in the first half of the year, and so that is the statement. So it did not \u2013 it was not a lose or a go away, but absolutely we expect both of those to occur. The timing of the ITWorks opportunities in particular can be somewhat tricky. And we actually entered the quarter with a couple of opportunities \u2013 entered the fourth quarter with a couple of opportunities to close. And neither of those came forward, but both of those are still in our pipeline, and we feel very bullish on closing those in 2016.","These are big decisions. They create lumpiness in our bookings because they tend to be very large numbers. And that's why when you track the \u2013 we're at 27% long-term bookings. And so that is reflective \u2013 the lack of ITWorks deals is reflected in that. It doesn't have a lot of near-term impact on the financials or our outlook of the business. It's more of a longer-term aspect. So it's very normal, but unfortunately these happen to be very large transactions and create some lumpiness in the model. That's why when we talk about first half of the year, I feel very good about bookings growth in the first half of the year.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Garen, this is Marc. Just to comment on ITWorks, just keep in mind we're rebadging the work force. And so it's not just doing a transaction. It is actually getting HR, just trying to time a variety of internal reasons that they might have relative to that. So they are by their nature lumpy. It's not something that we can push and make happen or not make happen. And sometimes it's hard to predict exactly when they'll land.","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","Sorry, Marc, the other piece I'd say, this is an ultimate relationship play.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Yes.","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","So you're playing for the long term. You're part of this organization's business. We become one. And so it's not subject to the similar kinds of end of the quarter or those types of elements. It's just one of those things where it will happen \u2013 and it's never fun when we're reporting every 91 days. We give our best view of that as we enter that period, but there's not going to be a lot of pushing on those kind of opportunities because it's the ultimate relationship play. And it is one of those things that we just have to live with in terms of the...","Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","So I guess just to clarify, it doesn't sound like it was a competitive situation in terms of the reason why it didn't go through. It sounds like there are some other \u2013 you mentioned relationship, you mentioned it's complicated deals in terms of structuring, not necessarily a competitive situation. So I just wanted to clarify. Is there any other \u2013 I understand the confidentiality of the specific relationship. But is there any other color you can share to just shed some light as to the validity of I guess my understanding of it so far?","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","Sure. These deals are typically non-competitive. So what you're really attempting to do is help that organization move faster, and what they're doing from an IT perspective, create a known expense stream to them, accelerate the capabilities of Cerner. There's a ton of work around it. So they're not competitive scenarios. They really are \u2013 and then I would say in both of the cases that we had here, it's not an if, it's a when conversation. And both of those are moving forward, and I think you'll see those come through in 2016.","Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","That's very useful, thank you.","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Charles Rhyee of Cowen & Company. Your line is open.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thanks, guys, for taking the question. I think Garen touched on it a little bit before. But around the milestone payments, I know, Marc, you talked about that being a little bit of an issue last quarter. The revenues came in line this quarter. Can you talk about how you're performing against those milestones, and maybe just to ask if \u2013 as we think about going forward, how much of a factor you expect that to play in 2016?","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","I expect it to play a zero factor, and we had none in Q4.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. And then just secondly, earlier you did talk \u2013 obviously, you're not planning for zero growth in bookings, but you can make the revenue numbers without it. Obviously you have a big backlog here. Can that extend also beyond 2016, or would you assume that we have to have some rebound in growth in bookings as we think further out? Thanks.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","If you look at our history, it tends to be we have a strong bookings growth year, and then the next year we have a strong revenue growth year. And if someone has figured out why that happens all the time, we're interested because it kind of comes in cycles like that a little bit, although when you grow the bookings over 30% in a year, growing the next year is going to be challenging on those tough comps, which we still believe we can grow.","So I think from our standpoint, I think the backlog is strong. It continues to grow. It's probably got an average \u2013 once you take out the initial component that supports 79% of my revenue next year, then then you basically probably have a 3.5-year average life of the remainder. So it will contribute significantly in 2017 absolutely from a backlog perspective. There's still plenty of medium-term elements in that backlog, particularly services, that roll out. And if we deliver the bookings that we expect, certainly for this year, if we even just deliver flat bookings and don't grow bookings, we not only deliver 2016 but we set ourselves up well for 2017.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC","And just for clarification, you said the two-year stack was 13% in the growth. If we think about what normalized without Health Services last year, would you say you were doing better than that or any color around that? And thanks a lot.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","The 13% was the CAGR for two \u2013 basically for this year and Q1 guidance next year. Keep in mind that the guidance for bookings is just for Q1, very targeted on what's in there, and we look forward to talking to you at the end of Q1 about Q2.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great, thanks a lot.","Operator","Thanks. Our next question is from George Hill with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open, sir.","George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey. Good afternoon, guys, and thanks for taking the question. My first one is for Zane. And I guess, Zane, I guess what I wanted to hone in on is where do you feel like we are in, like I guess in the demand environment and the demand cycle? And I don't know if you saw there was a chart that CLAS [Culturally and Linguistically Appropriate Services] had out there that showed that 2016 was going to be a spike year for EMR replacements, and 2016 and 2017 were sharply down years. I'm trying to reconcile that with the bookings shortfall expectation in Q4 and what would look like an expectation for a shortfall in Q1. And just are we at a point now where it's harder for Cerner to escape the gravity of the macro demand environment? I guess that's the question.","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","I'll start with the part of your assessment \u2013 thanks for the question, George. From a new bookings perspective, new footprints were actually very strong in Q4, so it was 36% of our bookings. So we overachieved actually our internal projections and plans around the new business side. So we saw very strong growth in 2015. What I would actually say, it was near 2011 meaningful use era type decision-makings in 2015. And we expect that to continue into 2016. So our experience was really very strong opportunity in 2015, 2016, and beyond. And from that perspective, we over-attained. When you really look at the one piece that didn't get done was really truly in ITWorks and a professional services deal that did in fact close. The professional services with that opportunity did not close, but will close. And so those aren't reflective of the marketplace.","So I wouldn't look at the bookings element and say that is reflective of the marketplace; I'm looking at the marketplace as hot as it's been in the past five-plus years in that perspective. And our competitiveness at all-time high helps us to feel very good about our position as we move then forward. I think there's great opportunity in a number of bases where client companies have either sunset their solution or they're trying to do upgrades to solutions and platforms to prepare for future elements, and there's just a lack of confidence in those companies' and organizations' ability to invest and deliver contemporary solutions. So the level of buying opportunity in 2016 and 2017 is very strong. And I think that will \u2013 our viewpoint right now is that it's a very strong marketplace, and over half of the marketplace is basically up for grabs.","In addition to that, our success around penetrating the non-Cerner EHR base with our population health solutions and our CareAware solutions is very significant. It represents a big opportunity on the upside for us as we move forward, and I think that's another area where we'll need to continue to provide more information for you so you get to understand the impact of what that means for us because we see the market unfolding probably \u2013 I don't think I've ever seen it as robust as it is today. And as I look forward, it looks incredibly robust. I just think the makeup of that will evolve in terms of both EHR decisions as well as population health and other solutions that we have.","George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, that's helpful, and maybe a quick follow-up for Marc. And, Marc, we've been talking about the backlog conversion to revenue for a while, and you talked about how 79% of the revenue for next year is going to come from the current backlog. Given the size of the backlog, can you talk about how many years of visibility do you feel like you have to that 79% of next year's revenue, which is I guess call it $4 billion? Should we think of the backlog as representing 3.5 or four years or whatever the right number is of visibility? Like you've basically got 80% visibility to four years of revenue, is that the right way of thinking about it?","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","No, I think that each year is going to be different. So next year, as I look at 2016, the 80% visibility that I have shows up in the backlog. But I've got long-term bookings. I think with all the bookings success we've had, I've added in a lot of long-term contracts. This year we're at 32% of our contracts are long term, so those aren't going to flow in to significantly impact as a percent of the bookings number of those deals hit 2017 or 2018. So no, every year it's important that I go out and deliver bookings to go feed the backlog to drive the next year. So I can't tell you that I've got 80% of the next four years' revenues into my backlog. That would be a really nice thing to have happen, but the reality is the average life once you take out the 2016 number is probably a 3.5-year average life, but you've got things that are 10 years and things that are shorter term.","So from a visibility, it still provides outstanding visibility from the backlog and especially from things that are in our bigger backlog, which includes support now. So I do have significant visibility, but it's not \u2013 it wouldn't be 80%. Certainly when I go into next year, I'm going to have delivered things from the $5.4 billion-plus of bookings that I expect to deliver this year that will then inform and help me on next year's number. But certainly I don't have a number that I could tell you right off the top of my head of the percent of revenue backlog today that will help 2017. But it certainly isn't 80% today, but by the time we get to the end of the year, my expectation is that number keeps going up, which is impressive in an environment where I'm going to grow revenue double digit next year.","George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, thanks. I appreciate your comments.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Sean Dodge of Jefferies. Your line is open.","Sean Dodge - Jefferies LLC","Good afternoon, thanks. Zane, you touched on this briefly earlier. But on the over 40 Health Services sites that have committed to migrating, can you talk about and maybe even quantify how the revenue profile of those clients are changing as they migrate? So how much extra Cerner-branded stuff have you been able to cross-sell into those sites as they migrate?","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","Great question. I will tell you that there were gaps in the Health Service offerings, particularly around things like population health and ambulatory, even some more mundane things, if you will, around surgery and a full-functioning ED solution. So as clients come in to do the migration, they will often procure additional software to fill out that solution set, and that's what we've seen. And then we have additional implementation services to implement the new Millennium software, and then the recurring tends to stay fairly similar to what it has been. So the additional pops are in the professional services and in the licensed software and any related support fees that would go with those pieces, so for the long term.","And then the traditional Cerner mode, most all our clients do remote hosting, so they will come through and do their remote hosting aspect to that if they \u2013 and many of the Siemens Health Services clients were remote hosted previously, but some of them were not. And so we see that trend picking up as well. So it's basically \u2013 it's not a cookie cutter in terms of what I can tell you here's the percentage increase that we see because all clients are not created equal in terms of what they've contracted for or what they want to go do moving forward. But generally speaking, you see us rounding out the full solution set and doing the implementation and doing the hosting and ongoing maintenance. So it does represent an uplift typically in overall revenues.","Sean Dodge - Jefferies LLC","Okay, so it has been a lucrative cross-sell. I think you guys have historically said that population health solutions currently comprise about 14% of revenue. What percentage of bookings would pop health be if you broke it out that way?","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","I don't think pop health is 14% of revenues. I think we've talked about pop health including various consulting elements that are in for quality improvement, et cetera that we roped into that. That would have been about $450 million, so closer to 10%, so just to clarify.","Sean Dodge - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Would the proportion of bookings be greater than that though?","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Not really. I think \u2013 keep in mind, given that that bucket includes service elements and other elements, a lot of the HealtheIntent-style population health that we're selling today is being acquired by our clients in small increments initially. So a lot of those, I don't know that they're pilots, but they're certainly smaller initial \u2013 I'm going to try this, I'm going to target a certain area that I want to use again. And obviously, some of our clients are not only looking at a risk population, but they're just looking at a way to go back into their \u2013 to identify a population where they could go and actually do some proactive services for which improves their revenue and also reduces the overall cost of whoever is taking over. So from a bookings standpoint, those have not been significant contributors.","So I'd say if you look at the total bookings, we give you percent of new clients, which most of which probably aren't having a significant component of HealtheIntent with a brand-new client. Our ITWorks clients and Works businesses, which are really not \u2013 they're separated out. And when you look at the long term being 30%-plus, you could look at the new clients being 30%-plus. You've got the bucket of things that are going into the base. So as a total, even if HealtheIntent is \u2013 even if it's 10% of that number, it's a smaller number relative to the total bookings.","Sean Dodge - Jefferies LLC","Got it, understood. Thanks again.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Jeff Garro of William Blair. Your line is open.","Jeff R. Garro - William Blair & Co. LLC","Good afternoon, thanks for taking the questions, a question for Marc. It's something that's been talked about throughout 2015, but I wanted to ask now after completing the full budget process. What's been learned about forecasting the Health Services business, and also what's been learned about forecasting the professional services piece of revenue?","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","I think Q4 was a good indicator that the processes that we put in place and the additional scrutiny and reengineering of some of those processes, particularly on the services side, have been effective. Given that our additional view of our revenue ended up, we delivered exactly at the midpoint of our guidance, which I'm happy obviously about delivering the number that we guided to.","So I think we certainly learned as we get bigger that you continue to scrutinize, you continue to look at the processes. Growth can mask processes that might not be as effective as they should be. And so that was a good wakeup call throughout our business that we need to make sure that we're diving deep into how we do things and make sure that we are not only doing them the most efficiently but we're also doing them in a way to get the best answers. So I think I was very happy that Q4 from a revenue and income statement standpoint was spot on. So those processes that \u2013 and the HS delivery was good as well. So those things that had impacted us early in 2015 feel like we're in a much better place now.","Jeff R. Garro - William Blair & Co. LLC","That's great, and then just a quick follow-up. You guys have talked about some success selling the model system or model practice, and it sounds like that should translate into better visibility. But does it create some type of variation in the professional services revenue stream that you might otherwise see from a more customized implementation?","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Not really. I think for the most part, we do fixed-fee implementations. So for the most part, we've got a bucket of hours, and we are working against that bucket of hours, and the revenue is that bucket of revenue divided by however many hours you think you're going to go hit adjusted as you gain experience in that project. So what the model system should do is create a more predictable, and not only a higher quality project, a better deliverable to the client, but more predictability.","So to the extent we have variances today and how long it takes to put in a system based on what we project, which is normally not too significant, the model system should make those even less. So from a revenue perspective, it should actually make our modeling better. And to the extent that we can use the model to get it done faster, then obviously that would help us on a fixed fee contract from a margin perspective.","Jeff R. Garro - William Blair & Co. LLC","Great, thanks for taking the questions.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Richard Close of Canaccord Genuity. Your line is open.","Richard Close - Canaccord Genuity Group, Inc.","Thanks. I think we're all trying to really figure out if we've hit the inflection point here. Zane, it sounds from your commentary that you're pretty excited about 2016 and 2017 from a new business opportunity. As we look like maybe beyond, as you think about two, three, four years out, where do you think the market is? Do you think population health and ITWorks, maybe RevWorks can step it up where you continue to show $5.5 billion in bookings or plus two to three years out?","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","Yes, and we will lay out some of our plans at the HIMSS conference coming up, so I'll plug for Marc and Allan [Kells]. So we'll actually lay it out as part of the HIMSS pieces. But I'm incredibly bullish about the marketplace and the need for healthcare technology and the need for the solutions that we bring. Organizations need our scale to help them move faster and to have access to data no matter where the person is. The things that we do both from a core EMR perspective as well as population health, which I think long term will drive more EHR growth back into all bases, in addition to the different Works pieces, are absolutely needed by our clients.","So the marketplace is very, very good. And in fact, 2015 was a great year. I look at 2016 should be a very strong, strong year. It's very hard to look out in the three to four-year range around the bookings numbers and say the exact bookings numbers, but we'll lay out exactly what we see in terms of those elements. There is just a strong need for more healthcare IT and the services that we provide.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","This is Marc. We've done okay in ITWorks. We're doing pretty well. We haven't got the one-a-quarter rhythm that I'm looking for. We really paused on the revenue cycle and the RevWorks deals with ICD-10. So those are all people in our client base that are interested in those services. It's a little bit a matter of not if they're going to go to some third-party service provider for some of that; it's when, and then we just need to be ready to be able to attack it and to attack that market. So I think the opportunities are out there.","The good news is that except for the top two competitors in the environment, no one else is stepping up and saying we're really going to be great. In our marketplace, certainly within the health \u2013 the hospital marketplace certainly, the people that have been not doing as well continue that trajectory. So there is the opportunity as we've seen in 2015 to go in and displace people, competitors who had a footprint and have not delivered, and I think that continues. We've got that continuing through 2016 and 2017. So I think it's difficult for us to tell you what our bookings are going to be in four years, but I think the elements of things that we will be selling, will be big booking opportunities. So it wouldn't surprise me to keep at that level.","Richard Close - Canaccord Genuity Group, Inc.","Does the global market really have to ratchet up, or is the commentary surrounding the U.S. market primarily?","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","I think in the three to four-year range, I think the U.S. market can drive a lot of the growth that we're looking for. I don't think we're reliant on any of the foreign markets to come up. I think they'll continue as their economies start to recover, assuming they start to recover. There will be a huge interest for them to do more with information technology. But I think until that happens, we don't need that to happen to drive our 10-year growth view, which is a view that we'll share with you guys an updated version at HIMSS.","Richard Close - Canaccord Genuity Group, Inc.","Thank you.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Sure.","Operator","Thanks. Our next question is from Greg Bolan of Avondale Partners. Your line is open.","Gregory T. Bolan - Avondale Partners LLC","Thanks, guys. So I guess, Zane, I think you had mentioned earlier, it struck a chord, this idea of health systems toggling between worlds, living in the fee-for-service, but obviously dreaming or looking into the future on the ACO side.","I guess does it feel like that that is going to create \u2013 are you guys basically describing a situation where \u2013 2015 obviously was a good public, good purchasing market just as a whole. You guys obviously gained share. It accentuated that growth rate in bookings. And then 2016 a lot of confusion, a lot of disruption coming, and 2016 is more of a market share gain year. And that's why there's a little bit of hesitancy in terms of \u2013 I know you've just finished a year you grew 28% bookings, but there's maybe a little bit more hesitancy as it relates to hey, we think we can grow bookings on top of the 28% growth year. This is just more of \u2013 I guess the evolution here is market share gain is focused on the confusion that's out there in 2016. Is that a fair assessment?","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","Here's how I'd look at it is the market \u2013 what we talked about from the bookings perspective was Q1-related only. So as we look at Q1 last year to Q1 of 2016, we're giving you our best guidance as it relates to that quarter.","As it relates to the year, I feel very strongly that we will see bookings growth for the year. We just are not providing guidance as it relates to the year bookings. There are great opportunities out there. In 2015 I see very similar \u2013 around the new business opportunities that we had for 2015, I see the same dynamics at play for 2016. So there are still competitors that are sunsetting solutions. There are competitors that have not kept contemporary architectures, and they don't age like a fine wine. And so those are going to become more and more at play in that. So I feel very good about the EHR market.","In addition, there are all the Works pieces of the business and the population health which continues to get traction. So my expectation is that we will grow bookings in 2016 on a very tough comparable from 2015. We're just looking at Q1 and providing the best guidance that we can as we look at the mix of the opportunities in there. And so the sway of one services piece and one ITWorks deal really shouldn't taint how we feel about the market and does not.","So my long-term view of the marketplace and frankly short-term view is very, very bullish, and I feel really good about that because there has never been a bigger need for healthcare IT solutions. It's that piece of living in the fee-for-service world and an at-risk model, it's coming slower. But the nice part is you can utilize our population health solutions to maximize both worlds. And really we're the only ones doing that, which is really unique, and it's creating a differentiation for us in the marketplace. And that's where I think as people begin to understand that, you'll see even accelerated growth on top of the great growth we've seen in that space.","Gregory T. Bolan - Avondale Partners LLC","That's great. That's all I've got, thank you.","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","Thank you for the question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Sean Wieland of Piper. Your line is open.","Sean W. Wieland - Piper Jaffray & Co","Hi, thanks. So the $564 million in licensed software for the year, can you tell me how much of that was selling Siemens products to Siemens customers, what I would classify as inorganic?","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Very little from new software sales, very little.","Sean W. Wieland - Piper Jaffray & Co","Okay, that's the answer that I was hoping I would get. So that number was up 25% year over year, which is about the fastest growth I've seen in licensed software in quite a while. If we could just focus on that for a second, what are the long poles in the tent of driving licensed software? And how sustainable is that kind of growth in 2016, and how did that number do relative to your expectations in 2015?","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","This is Zane. Software, as you mentioned \u2013 thank you for saying that \u2013 was fantastic growth in 2015, and it was directed by all the new footprints that we achieved in the year. And I think what you'll see is that fuels the rest of our businesses over the long term as well. So those new clients will fuel the businesses over the long term and add additional revenues above and beyond the original initial software purchases.","The sustainability is really how robust that marketplace is. And I just have commented multiple times on the bullishness of 2016 and 2017, the replacement market era, and we still have a lot of white space out there in our existing client base as well. So I feel really good. I feel \u2013 I'm very pleased with the results on the software line. Most all of that was what I call Cerner Solution. The Health Services piece was single digits, if that.","I don't have the rest of the single-digits, but a very small portion of that. That was Cerner Millennium and Cerner Population Health Solutions driving the growth in that space. And that's what I'm looking at from a marketplace. I feel great about the bookings and the trajectory we're on. And I apologize that we missed the number that we set forth, and it's really related to some of the lumpier side on the Works side.","Sean W. Wieland - Piper Jaffray & Co","Super, that's all I had. Thank you.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Why don't we take one more question?","Operator","Yes, sir. Our question is from Steve Halper of FBR. Your line is open.","Steven P. Halper - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Hi, thanks for taking the question. It's a two-part question. You talked about 79% to 80% of the revenue coming from backlog in 2016. How does that compare to previous years, let's say before the acquisition of Health Services?","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","It would probably be in the lower 70% \u2013 72% to 73%.","Steven P. Halper - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","So it would have been 70%-plus.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","I think coming in we were probably 74% was the last number before we did HS.","Steven P. Halper - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Okay, and obviously HS increases the number because of the base?","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","It certainly helps from some of their long-term contracts coming in. But it's also the sales. All of the projects we're signing up and all the services that are going to roll out of backlog to install those. So I think that's more related to strong bookings in 2015 and the strength that's creating our backlog as much as it is to HS. HS probably was a similar number relative to their contribution from backlog.","Steven P. Halper - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Okay.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","So that alone isn't going to move us up the five to six points.","Steven P. Halper - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Okay, that's very helpful. And the other part of the question is, again, we don't want to steal the thunder of the upcoming meeting, but post-Health Services acquisition, you talked about the company's ability to continue to grow revenue in the double-digit range. Are you still prepared to reiterate that comment?","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Yes, we are.","Steven P. Halper - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Okay, that's good. Thanks.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","All right. Hey, I want to \u2013 thanks, everybody, for being with us this afternoon. 2015 was actually a great year for us with the acquisition of HS and our strong competitive performance, as evidenced by bookings growing 28% year over year. Our pipeline begins 2016 at the highest level ever and higher than when we started 2015, even after we took the $5.4 billion out of it. So I think we are well-positioned for a strong 2016. And we look forward to sharing more about those opportunities with you at our HIMSS Investor Day. So have a good day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the program. You may now disconnect.

Today's date is October 23, 2014, and this call is being recorded.","The company has asked me to remind you that various remarks made here today constitute forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, those regarding projections of future revenues or earnings, operating margin, operating expenses, product development, new markets or prospects for the company solutions and plans and expectations related to the acquisition of Siemens Health Services.","Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements.

Please proceed, sir.","Marc G. Naughton","Thank you, Denise. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the call. I will lead off today with a review of the numbers. Zane Burke, our President, will follow me with results highlights and marketplace observations; Mike Nill, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, will discuss operations; Jeff Townsend, Executive Vice President and Chief of Staff is with a client; Neal Patterson, our Chairman and CEO, will be available during Q&A.","Now I will turn to our results. Our total bookings revenue in Q3 was $1.1 billion, which is an all-time high for third quarter and reflects 19% growth over our previous Q3 record results in Q3 of '13. Bookings margin in Q3 was $976 million or 89% of total bookings. Our bookings performance drove a 21% increase in total backlog to $10.16 billion.","Contract revenue backlog of $9.34 billion is 22% higher than 1 year ago. Support revenue backlog of $814 million is up 6%.","Revenue in the quarter was $840 million, which is up 15% over Q3 of '13.Revenue composition for Q3 was $224 million in system sales, $177 million in support and maintenance, $416 million in services and $23 million in reimbursed travel.","System sales revenue reflects an 11% increase over Q3 of '13, with 18% growth in software offsetting a flat technology resale revenue. The sequential decline in system sales this quarter is a result of a decline in technology resale that was greater than the sequential increase in software. Q3 system sales margin dollars grew 15% over the year-ago period, driven by continued strong levels of software.","Moving to services. Total services revenue was up 21% compared to Q3 of '13, with strong growth in professional services, managed services and ITWorks. Support and maintenance revenue increased 7% over Q3 of '13.","Looking at revenue by geographic segment, domestic revenue increased 16% for the quarter and global revenue grew 14% over Q3 of '13.","Moving to gross margin. Our gross margin for Q3 was 83.3%, which is basically flat compared to 83.6% in Q3 of '13.","Looking at operating spending, our third quarter operating expenses before share-based compensation and acquisition costs were up 14% to $487 million.","Sales and client service expenses increased 14% compared to Q3 of '13, driven primarily by a continued increase in revenue-generating associates in our services businesses.","Our investment in software development was up 17% compared to Q3 of '13 and continues to be driven by investments in our growth initiatives. We also had $4 million less capitalized software and $1 million more amortization that contributed to the prior -- the year-over-year increase. G&A expense increased 14% compared to Q3 of '13, driven mostly by growth in personnel.","Moving to operating margins. Our operating margins before share-based compensation expense and acquisition cost was 25.4% in Q3. This is up 30 basis points compared to Q3 of '13, which is slightly below our 50-plus basis point target for Q3 due to third-party services remaining slightly elevated. We expect over 50 basis points of margin expansion in Q4.","Looking forward to 2015, we expect the first year of incorporating our pending Siemens Health Services acquisition to result in our adjusted operating margins declining to the low-20% range, but we expect them to return to the mid-20s by 2017 based on ongoing leverage in our core business and as the accretion from the Siemens Health Services acquisition ramps.","Moving to net earnings and EPS. Our GAAP net earnings in Q3 were $129 million or $0.37 per diluted share. GAAP net earnings include share based compensation expense, which had a net impact on earnings of $10 million or $0.03 per diluted share. GAAP net earnings also include costs related to our pending acquisition of Siemens Health Services which had a net impact on earnings of $6 million or $0.02 per diluted share. Adjusted net earnings were $145 million and adjusted EPS was $0.42, which is up 20% compared to Q3 of '13. The Q3 tax rate for adjusted net earnings was 33%. For Q4, we expect our tax rate to be between 33% and 34%.","Now I'll move to our balance sheet. We ended Q3 with $1.56 billion of total cash and investments, which is up $90 million compared to Q2. Our total debt including capital lease obligations is $147 million, down from $155 million in Q2. Total receivables ended the quarter at $617 million, which is flat compared to $615 million in Q2. Our DSO in Q3 was 67 days, which compares to DSO of 66 days in Q2 and 66 days in the year-ago quarter. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $220 million. Q3 capital expenditures were $68 million, capitalized software was $44 million. Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures and capitalized software, was $107 million for the quarter.","Moving to capitalized software. The $44 million of capitalized software in Q3 represents 38% of the $116 million of total investment in development activities. Software amortization for the quarter was $25 million, resulting in net capitalization of $19 million or 16% of our total R&D investment.","Our outlook for capital expenditures and capitalized software remains the same as what we provided last quarter. We expect capital expenditures to be $260 million to $280 million for the year, which is down from $353 million in 2013. We expect capitalized software to be approximately $175 million, which is flat compared to 2013.","Regarding our share buyback, in light of our Q3 announcement that we plan to purchase Siemens Health Services, we did not purchase any shares back during the quarter, so our year-to-date total remains at 4.1 million shares repurchased or $217 million. We do still have $100 million of share repurchase authorization that was approved in May.","Now I'd like to provide an update on our pending acquisition of Siemens Health Services. We received regulatory clearance from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission that continued our integration and transition preparation since we announced the deal on August 5. All this work has supported our positive view of the Siemens Health Services business unit. At this point, we are targeting a close date of February 2, 2015.","Now I'll go through Q4 and full year 2015 guidance. For Q4, we expect revenue between $880 million and $915 million, with a midpoint reflected growth of 13% over Q4 '13. Our Q4 revenue guidance combined with year-to-date results put us at the high end of our previously provided full year guidance of $3.3 billion to $3.4 billion and reflects 15% full year growth.","We expect Q4 adjusted EPS before share based compensation and acquisition costs of $0.46 to $0.47 per share, with the midpoint reflecting 19% growth over Q4 '13 adjusted EPS. Our Q4 adjusted EPS guidance combined with year-to-date results reflects 17% full year growth.","Q4 guidance is based on total spending before share-based compensation and acquisition costs of approximately $520 million to $535 million.","Note that our Q4 ends on January 3 and includes 14 weeks instead of 13, which is why there is a higher than normal sequential increase in expense and revenue. Our estimates for the impact of share-based compensation expense is approximately $0.03 in Q4, which would lead to $0.12 for the full year.","And moving to bookings guidance. We expect bookings revenue in Q4 at $1.15 billion to $1.25 billion, with the midpoint reflecting 9% growth over Q4 '13 and 14% growth for the full year.","Looking at 2015. We are working on a combined plan that incorporates our pending acquisition of Siemens Health Services. Based on our preliminary view, we expect adjusted EPS to be in a range of $2.05 to $2.15 when you include estimated accretion from the acquisition. At the midpoint, this reflects growth of 27% over 2014.","For revenue, we expect a combined revenue of $4.8 billion to $5 billion in 2015. We view this guidance as preliminary until the acquisition is completed and we finalize our combined plan, but we want to give you our initial thoughts.","Finally, I'd like to mention that our earnings release dates will be later than our normal schedule next year; this is due to the extra week in 2014, which leads to each quarter starting a little bit later next year. And we also plan to add some time to accommodate bringing Siemens Health Services into our closing process. Per our normal approach, we will announce our earnings release date -- press release a couple of weeks before its release, but I wanted to give you a heads-up that they will be later next year. With that, I'll turn the call over to Zane.","Zane M. Burke","Thanks, Marc. Good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with our results and some marketplace observations. Our bookings revenue in Q3 of $1.1 billion reflects 19% growth over Q3 2013 and is a record for the third quarter. We had 25 contracts over $5 million. This includes 15 contracts over $10 million, 10 of which were more than $15 million. The mix of long-term bookings was 35% in the quarter, which is slightly higher than recent levels in the low 30s due to large ITWorks contract and strong managed services bookings.","New business activity in the quarter was good, with 27% of our bookings coming from outside our core Millennium install base. Our pipeline for new footprints is strong and we are well-positioned to continue driving 25% or more of our bookings from outside of our install base.","Overall, we remain pleased with our competitiveness. The significant investments we have been making in our solutions have led to a very strong offering for the present needs of healthcare providers, while also widening our differentiation in population health and other capabilities that providers will need as healthcare shifts away from a fee-for-service model.","As we have discussed, interoperability will be critical for these future models of care to be effective. Without interoperability, the return on the billions of dollars being invested in digitizing healthcare will be limited. As a result, our commitment to interoperability and having the most open EMR is an important competitive differentiator that is gaining more attention in the marketplace.","Now I'll discuss a few key areas of our business, starting with population health. Our population health organization delivered strong results again in Q3, driven by sales of HIE, Patient Portal, Enterprise Data Warehouse, clinical process optimization and Healthe registries. A noteworthy deal in Q3 was Cerner being selected by a large health system with no previous Cerner footprint for a broad suite of population health solutions, further validating that our approach expands our addressable market beyond our install base. In this case, the client prioritized their population health procurement even though they intend to replace their EMR in the future. We expect to compete for their EMR business and believe we are well-positioned, so that it could become an example of our population health capabilities leading to a new EMR footprint.","Another observation I'd like to make is that we continue to compete against numerous best-of-breed suppliers. Our comprehensive open platform approach is gaining attention. We have been having conversations with an increasing number of clients who chose a best-of-breed registry solution as recently as 18 months ago and are already considering a change to our platform because they aren't getting the value out of their niche solution. The niche providers have not taken on the significant challenge of aggregating and normalizing clinical claims and financial data across multiple systems. As a result, these competing offerings are using incomplete and latent data sets, which limits their value.","I'd also like to highlight an announcement that was made by a Cerner client, Sharp HealthCare, about how the Sharp HealthCare plan members are among the first consumers to take advantage of Apple HealthKit through HealthyNow app from Cerner Wellness. Cerner's integration with Apple HealthKit means HealthyNow users and their health team can seamlessly track information from any number of health and wellness applications together, resulting in an up-to-date view of personal health habits and wellness goals.","Another highlight of the quarter was good results in our Revenue Cycle business. Last quarter, I highlighted the success of our extended business office, which is RevWorks service that includes augmenting client staff with our associates. These associates specialize in areas such as billing and collection, denials management, coding and backlog and legacy follow-up and support all venues of care from ambulatory to acute and the post-acute. We have more than doubled our extended business office this year and now have over 300 associates. A highlight in Q3 was signing several acute care clients to assist them in their billing operations from our extended business office in Kansas City.","Moving to the ambulatory and small hospital market where we continue to do well. We had record ambulatory bookings and displaced several key ambulatory competitors as our large IDN clients continue to favor our integrated solution. We also established a key alignment deal with an investor-owned post-acute care company to do outsourced billing for their providers in several markets.","In the small hospital market, we gained multiple new footprints with our cloud-based CommunityWorks offering, winning against 4 different niche community hospital competitors and against our primary competitor's extension offering in these new footprints.","Outside of the U.S., we had another strong quarter from a bookings standpoint and revenue growth improved to 14% after a slow first half of the year. We had particularly strong performance in the U.K., Middle East and Canada. We have a strong global forecast for Q4, so I expect to finish the year on a positive note.","Also the strength of global bookings in 2014 which has included high levels of hosting and professional services should lead to more predictable global revenue growth in 2015.","One additional highlight is that Cerner client, Croydon Health Services NHS Trust, a 540-bed South London hospital, was recognized by HIMSS Europe as the first hospital in the U.K. to achieve Stage 6 certification.","Before turning the call over to Mike, I'd like to make a few comments on our pending acquisition of Siemens Health Services. In the 2.5 months since we announced our intent to acquire them, we've had time to do additional analysis and get feedback from the marketplace. I am pleased with the results of both. Additionally, we continue to be impressed with the quality of the clients and the people at Siemens Health Services. They will both be big assets to Cerner. Feedback from the marketplace has also been positive. Our existing clients see value in the increased R&D investment that result from the acquisition, and we've already seen instances where the pending acquisition has improved our position in potential new EMR footprint opportunities in the Siemens Health Services client base.","In summary, I'm very excited for the Siemens Health Services client and associates to join Cerner. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike.","Michael R. Nill","Thanks, Zane. Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I\u2019m going to discuss ITWorks and provide client success highlights. I'll start with ITWorks. As some of you may have seen when it was announced in August, we created a strategic partnership with Georgia Regents Medical Center that included our ITWorks offering. The agreement is designed to help them create a more efficient and cost-effective healthcare delivery model through technological innovation and advancement. The new alignment called Jaguar Collaborative, encompasses the health system, GRHealth, as well as some information technology services for the university. It also provides for improved information technology performance, EHR usability and client services. Cerner will provide remote hosting and add enhanced monitoring and system capabilities to provide increased security for the health system's electronic health data.","The third quarter also included our first non-U.S. ITWorks deal. This is a partial ITWorks engagement that will have the initial focus on the Millennium upgrade, technology and support assessments, solution roadmaps and physician experience enhancement. While this agreement is small compared to our other ITWorks contracts because it's just a limited engagement, it has a potential to grow to something much larger over time and we expect it to become a great proof point for our ITWorks model outside the U.S.","In summary, some of these -- each of these agreements represents good examples where we have significant opportunities to expand relationships with long-term clients as they look to keep pace with changes in healthcare, manage cost and position themselves as leading healthcare providers.","Similar to last quarter, I'd like to briefly highlight a client accomplishment. Today, I'd like to discuss Adventist Health who is rolling out Cerner Revenue Cycle solutions to all their hospitals and clinics and is also our largest RevWorks client. They're replacing 19 separate patient accounting systems with 1 standardized Revenue Cycle platform, which should eliminate duplicative processes and streamline workflows across this enterprise. Adventist Health has already launched the Cerner Revenue Cycle suite of solutions at 9 hospitals and related clinics. Their annual report noted a 39% decrease in accounts that were discharged without a final bill, as well as a 40% decrease in accounts that were discharged without final coding. The more efficient billing process also led to a $61 million decrease in accounts receivable and has helped Adventist Health achieve 100% of their cash collections goal. The key to their success has been having registration scheduling and patient accounting workflows on a single platform, which enables a more cost-effective and accurate billing and coding and is also more efficient for the users. Adventist Health has also implemented Cerner PowerChart ambulatory at 179 outpatient locations and has had a success rate greater than 90% for provider meaningful use at these stations. The progress the Adventist is making has not gone unrecognized. They were recently included along with about 80 other Cerner clients on Hospitals & Health Networks' Most Wired list.","As we have discussed in the past, the success of Adventist Health and other large integrated delivery networks are having with our solutions has been a key factor to our strong competitiveness in the marketplace.","With that, I'll turn the call over to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Dave Francis with RBC Capital Markets.","David K. Francis - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Could you guys give us an update on some of the bigger, new contracts that are out there in the marketplace, whether it be the DOD, Mayo and some of the foreign things that are out there on the horizon?","Zane M. Burke","Dave, this is Zane. Both of those opportunities are in different stages in terms of selection process. The DOD is just at the point where they are at the -- RFP responses are due this week after a couple of delays in the deadlines for submission of RFP. That's likely to be a selection in the first half of 2015, contract in the back half of 2015. So we feel well-positioned and are excited about the opportunity there. On the Mayo processes, it's not something that's probably appropriate to comment since it's not a public procurement, but it's actively ongoing. We feel well-positioned there and competing well.","David K. Francis - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And are there any mileposts we ought to be looking for relative to the DOD contract? Or is that something that's going to stay pretty much in-house there?","Zane M. Burke","It will pretty much stay in-house there with -- once the RFP responses are received, which, again, the deadline was extended to, I think, I believe, it was next week then they'll ask for clarification questions as part of that. But I don't think there'll be anything public that we'll know about until the first half of '15.","Operator","Our next question comes from Richard Close with Avondale Partners.","Richard Collamer Close - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","Just have a really quick one. On the investor-owned post-acute deal, can you go into a little bit more detail what the products were again? I think, you said RCM, I'm not positive there. And then, is this an existing customer or someone totally new to you guys?","Zane M. Burke","This is a new client for us. It's actually our business office services for physicians that we're providing the outsourced billing for those physicians. And this represents actually a pilot for them for about 50 to 100 physicians initially. And then, they have about 1,600 physicians. So once we have success, we have the opportunity to roll out more broadly. But this is a great first footprint for us.","Operator","Our next question comes from Garen Sarafian with Citigroup.","Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","First, a clarification question. Going back to the preliminary guidance that you'd given for next year of $2.05 to $2.10 -- $2.15, sorry. If you back into that number from the consensus, if you look at the $0.15 accretive assumption that you guys have made previously, the legacy Cerner number, it looks like The Street was either too high in their $1.97 I see, or is it that when you look at Siemens, that some of the assumptions you've made are more back end-weighted? Just trying to understand, was consensus for next year organic Cerner too high? Or are you seeing something different as you dig into Siemens where the accretion is more back end-weighted?","Marc G. Naughton","As we look at the numbers, there's no intent to indicate that our earlier view that we've discussed with you on Siemens has changed in any way. I think, if you look at what -- when we put in our numbers together, we're looking at $1.95 kind of as consensus when we come out of Q3, we don't have a final plan yet. So what we try to do is give you an idea, are we comfortable based on current status, what consensus looks like. We basically look at that as being $1.95, add in the $0.15 accretion from Siemens, we come up with $2.10, which was the midpoint of our guidance. So there's no deeper meaning in this other than this is consistent with our normal practice of before we get our plan, then I can give you accurate guidance in detail. That's what we've done. So does not mean to imply that there's any difference in any of the numbers that we've talked about previously.","Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Got it. No, good point of clarification. And then, as a follow-up. Just on a broader level, you obviously speak with a lot of hospitals and at least a good portion of the nonprofit at fiscal year June or September end. So at this point in the year, what are you seeing in terms of their upcoming IT budgets? And maybe if you can split that into 2. First, are overall budgets increasing or decreasing and by how much? And second, those that plan to spend the most, what shifts in spend patterns, spending patterns, are you seeing so far?","Zane M. Burke","This is Zane, Garen. Not a lot of 9\/30 year-ends in clients that I work with, mostly 6\/30 and calendar year-end. So many of my clients are in the middle of budget process as the ones on the calendar year-end elements. And they're looking at continued investment in IT as a lever to -- as ways to improve quality and lower costs and we're seeing pretty consistent mechanisms on the IT spend in those spaces. That's not a scientific study but that's merely the dialogues that I'm having on an anecdotal basis.","Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And any shifts in spend other than clients being in different points in the IT cycle?","Zane M. Burke","Yes. So it's where they are in their journey. So those that are further along in the journey are looking at -- they're turning their attention to thinking about more pop health elements and they're prioritizing that at the top of the list. Those that do not have strong foundational clinical systems are out to thinking about the strong clinical foundational systems. And so it's reflective of our pipeline which is at an all-time high.","Operator","Our next question comes from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Zane, you had mentioned that you won a large client for your population health service. First, can you talk about what specific products it's for? And then, second, I think, you also noted that this health system is planning to changing its core EMR. Can you point to any specific reason for that potential switch?","Zane M. Burke","Well, the first part is the solutions they are looking at from us, or actually, that they acquired from us were the Healthe registries solution and the Enterprise Data Warehouse. And then, they're very interested in some of the things that we're doing in the future. And it was really the -- this is what I call a 2.0 buyer. This is a client that has been taking risk in their marketplace and had some niche solutions out there, but those niche solutions were not meeting the needs as they tried to go take risk and have had to actually think about all the things that go into making up that risk. And as they look at our platform, they found it to be the most comprehensive out there. And so, it's really a -- they're going to be on the journey with us. So they're acquiring the things that we have in our toolkit today but they're incredibly interested in what we're doing in the future and the vision piece of that's very important to them. The second part of that was your EMR question. And they view that their foundational EHR is not what they need on a go-forward basis. So they have, in this case, 43 different ambulatory EMRs. And they've got a variety of things on the acute side and that they need to shore up their foundational solution, and the selection, I will say absolutely that the selection on the population health side is helping us from a competitive perspective in this EMR battle.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So on the EMR cycle, they move everything to your product or it will be a step approach? How do you think about that opportunity?","Zane M. Burke","Well, it's a step approach. They're going to do the population health pieces first because they have needs today around managing risk in them. So they're accepting risk today and they don't have the tools they need, so it's a burning business need. The second piece would be the EMR selection that will occur and we anticipate that to happen over the next 6 months.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Valiquette with UBS.","Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I guess, first, a little follow-up on Garen's question earlier, I think, I'm the one who's guilty of moving The Street from $1.95 to $1.97 because I already put the Siemens deal in my projection. So I guess, I apologize for being early on that. But really, my question was really along similar lines, just on the revenue front around the deal because you guys talked about $1.2 billion of revs previously and if we had that in for 11 months, that's $1.1 billion, so if you subtract that out, that's 3.7 to 3.9 for legacy Cerner and it seems to be in line with The Street consensus. So I just want to confirm that, first of all, if that's the right way to think about that?","Marc G. Naughton","That would be correct.","Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then, I forgot if you're able to disclose whether or not you have any synergies in there for 2015, either top line or cost synergies in terms of how you're getting to your bottom line number for next year.","Marc G. Naughton","Yes. I mean, as we talked about on the call when we announced, we look at 2015 and look at approximately $0.15 of synergies, primarily cost-driven, that we expect to see going to the P&L in 2015, that equates to roughly $80 million of pretax OE. So yes, we continue to see those synergies being things that we can drive and gain benefit in our P&L next year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Donald Hooker with KeyBanc.","Donald Hooker - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","My question was more around some of the gross margins in the quarter. So if I'm calculating this right, it looks like the support and maintenance and services, that bucket of revenues, I mean, the margins there were a little bit lower, I think, than last year and they seem to be trending down. Can you just maybe elaborate on that line item, on the gross margin there?","Marc G. Naughton","You're looking at the support and maintenance line?","Donald Hooker - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Support, maintenance and services and that drop through to gross profit, it looked there was 91.3. And it looks like it was...","Marc G. Naughton","You will see the impact on some third-party consultants that will come through on the gross margin lines, some of the projects that we talked about a little bit relative to our discussions in the script. So that could impact the gross margin that you're seeing coming out of the services line. It would hit us in Q2 and Q3.","Donald Hooker - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. Got you. Is that so that maybe comes back up a little bit in Q4?","Marc G. Naughton","Yes. It should be that -- those resources, we are less reliant on those going forward.","Donald Hooker - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Got you. And then, maybe just one other question. You talked about DOD and Mayo. And I guess, there's some interesting business in the Middle East as well, I guess, with Saudi Arabia. Maybe can you can elaborate on that a little bit, because I think that's another large opportunity for you.","Zane M. Burke","It is. Don, this is Zane. There is a great opportunity in the Middle East, but there's been some changes in the Ministry of Health and so we continue to do well and have some good business in the Middle East. But with some of those changes, the timeline -- the timing is a little bit questionable about exactly when those will come into the numbers. We have seen a ton of great activity in the U.K. and our performance in the U.K. has been strong as well, so we've seen that be very strong and we think that's going to have a very positive impact in 2015, as well as we think the Middle East will be strong, but the timing of that broader Ministry of Health opportunity is a little bit in question right now.","Operator","Our next question comes from Eric Percher with Barclays.","Eric Percher - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I'll continue on international front. So looking at the growth in the back half, do you feel like you're seeing a growth rate that you can sustain longer-term? Or is this just the high side of the variance? And then, as you look at what your business will become internationally with the addition of Siemens, I'm interested in the fact that you are very complementary in your geographic reach and has that been because there have been markets that weren't attractive to you previously? Or is it just a matter of you haven't been active in those markets as of yet?","Zane M. Burke","So I'll take the first part of that, Eric, which is around the sustainability of the growth. And we are feeling really strong about the growth prospects globally and sustaining that global presence. In fact, our pipeline for global was also at an all-time high. And in going through the details of that, I'm feeling very bullish about where we are on the global side of this. And so the opportunity there remains strong. As it relates to the Siemens Global elements, there are some markets where they played at a little bit of a lower end in terms of scalability of the solution. And so from a scalability perspective, they have some offerings that scale to a different part of the marketplace that we haven't been in. And it is very nice and complementary and will give us good entr\u00e9e into those countries. And many of those places are natural places that we would've looked to have gone over time and as we look at the portfolio.","Marc G. Naughton","This is Marc. I think, Zane's comments were right on. The interesting thing to be on the Siemens side is certainly Germany is their biggest market. They have a couple of offerings there, at least 3, actually, that cover various levels of cost and what's provided based on those costs. What we're hearing as we have initial contact with those clients is they're very interested in something that goes beyond the relatively low-end solutions they currently have, especially academic centers, some of the large hospitals. We also believe and have seen at the very start in Germany a push for paying for quality. Germany right now is -- basically that doesn't enter into the compensation program. Their Minister of Health is certainly focused on trying to move to a pay-for-quality environment, and the existing systems aren't going to be able to be effective if that actually becomes part of the reimbursement strategy. So it actually feels that there's a lot of opportunity not only to sell the existing solutions into the country, but to bring in Millennium on top of that for those organizations that are really looking to bring in a top line EMR.","Eric Percher - Barclays Capital, Research Division","That's really helpful. And just a quick follow-up is as you look at those markets, is there an element of services either from your side or the associates on Siemens side that is also in play in those markets?","Marc G. Naughton","I think, probably not. They're much more limited on their service offerings. So today, it's much more implementation-focused. So certainly, we would as we continue to expand our other service offerings, including the works businesses that Mike talked about earlier from a global perspective, we think those are going to be attractive to this client base, especially if they look to enhance their technology infrastructures.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Halper with FBR.","Steven P. Halper - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","As you think about the acquisition of Siemens, we appreciate the insight into 2015, what sort of incremental capital expenditures and capitalized R&D cost are you looking at for 2015?","Marc G. Naughton","Steve, this is Marc. Right now, anything I talk about would really not include Siemens because I don't have a really good view of what their capital requirements are going to be. So I think that -- I don't expect them to be significant. As we acquire these assets, there'll be some costs as part of the acquisition to get those settled and get them in places they need to be longer-term. But I think, what you'll see from our perspective is the drivers for our capital spend be -- at least from a building perspective, we are going to be developing the next phase of new space we need for our growth, that will be out of what we call our Trails Campus near our Innovation Campus as some of you may have visited. So this year, we have spent some on building CapEx. Next year, we think we'll spend more. Then we'll have our normal infrastructure capital spend. And then, capital software will be relatively similar, maybe slightly lower that's capitalized in '15. So if you're kind of looking at '14 and trying to extrapolate to '15, I think, the building CapEx could cost $75 million to $100 million more in CapEx. So I think, at a high-level, just looking at Cerner, not looking at Siemens, the cash flow that's going to -- for this year, free cash flow which probably is around $400 million, let's just estimate, that will increment up from there. But there'll be some in total because of our increased profits. But the total spend will be higher because of that development for the buildings.","Steven P. Halper - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Right. Just one follow-up. Was the historical Siemens CapEx as -- relative to Cerner, was it considerably lower?","Marc G. Naughton","Yes.","Steven P. Halper - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","And what did they do from a capitalized R&D perspective?","Marc G. Naughton","They capitalized R&D. They clearly did not have the level of investment on new projects that we have had recently. So they've got -- they have a CapEx component. I don't know that it would be lower than our percentage, but I don't know that I can give you an exact number because there will be some expectation that as we look at that R&D spend and some of their projects become Cerner projects as they -- we move some of that workforce over, focusing on what we want to codevelop, it will be harder to say which is in what bucket.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jamie Stockton with Wells Fargo.","Jamie Stockton - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Zane, I guess, when you think about the Siemens base and you've had a number of conversations with those clients at this point, I'm sure, do you have a good feel for when you might be able to start to convert some of that base? I mean, should we be thinking about a 1- to 2-year timeframe to start to see some material conversion? Or is this more of a 3- to 5-year timeframe before you start to see a number of those clients convert?","Zane M. Burke","The first thing is we're going to support Soarian for the next 10 years. So those clients that are on Soarian, we absolutely are committed to their success and making them as happy as possible. So I'll start with that. Those that are on some of the older legacy solutions. We do think that, that will play out over -- I do think it is a 3- to 5-year horizon as we move forward. The most important thing is that we earn the trust of those clients and we treat them very well in the service aspects and give them a roadmap for success in the future, and that's what we're beginning to do working with the Siemens Health Services folks.","Jamie Stockton - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. That's great. And then, Marc, maybe one. This ITWorks deal in Georgia, they threw out a pretty big number as far as the value of the contract. Can you give us a ballpark for what actually flowed through your bookings during the quarter?","Marc G. Naughton","Yes. I mean, when we -- if you look at our numbers, basically, I'd characterize it as a contract that's over $200 million, not the number that you're seeing out there.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Cherny with ISI Group.","Michael Cherny - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I'm sorry again as well, I think I had an early pro forma number out there but I was trying to model effectively. I wanted to dig in a little bit to the bookings number a little more, if you don't mind. And I wanted to dig a little different way. If I do the back-of-envelope math, I see roughly about $300 million of bookings, give or take, from outside the base. And I know you talked about a couple of big contracts. But as you think about that number and the total dollar number which obviously is a massive magnitude relative to the rest of the market, how do you think about the strategic rationale behind some of those deals? And how you think a little bit more about what is driving such a massive dollar growth number? Is it the services that you're now providing, education you're doing the markets to show how effective you are on happiness with the customers. Can you kind of bucket into the moving pieces that's allowing you to drive such strong outside your core bookings numbers?","Zane M. Burke","Well, the first piece does start in our core marketplace, which is the core EMR space. So those that had made selections probably in the 10 to 15 years ago and those organizations did not end up with a strong foundational EMR, those organizations are finding it necessary to make the new decisions or they're in the process to make new decisions or to enter processes to make new decisions. And I view that as a 5 to 7-year time horizon that the 60% of the marketplace that hasn't made a new contemporary solution decision will make those decisions over this timeframe.","Marc G. Naughton","Michael, this is Marc. I think, the other element is that when you have to bring in a new client into Cerner, they buy a lot. They buy a lot of services. A lot of them we're seeing actually people looking at works deals as some major award back-office deals which might not rise at the level of works deals. So they tend to be the bigger deal to come in during the quarter.","Zane M. Burke","I think, Marc's on a great point, which is the size of those deals typically reflect our managed services offerings that we're hosting, sometimes application management. So the size of opportunities are there. But the activity is frankly at an all-time high on the new business side. And we're seeing that across the community hospital marketplace, the critical access, our CommunityWorks marketplace, our physician office. And so, it's really -- it's a number of different segments that are driving it, but it's principally there. Then the other -- so those are kind of the new sort of -- sorry, the replacement market for EHRs from a foundational perspective. Then you have a broad set of people that are like the pop health pieces, so we're starting to see an uptick of new business that's purely in the population health space and so having some of those types of elements. And it's kind of the breadth and depth of what we do across the entire continuum of care, allows us to compete in multiple marketplaces and we actually create new marketplaces like behavioral health where we're being very successful in a number of behavioral health opportunities and using Millennium platform to scale into other areas. And so those marketplaces also have been successful for us. So it's literally that breadth and depth of what we do. And so it's a combination of replacement market and new markets that need automation in those new market areas. Does that make sense?","Michael Cherny - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","No, that does. That's very helpful. And just 1 quick clarification on the Population Health contract, I'm just trying to make sure I'm keeping an appropriate count. This is the second one that you have announced, with Advocate being the first. Are there any others that we missed that you'd want to highlight?","Zane M. Burke","Yes. From a Population Health perspective, we actually have about 38 clients that have -- are on the journey with us. This is, I believe, the second or third new -- totally new footprint that was a Population Health first footprint. So that's the highlight behind that.","Marc G. Naughton","We won't be highlighting every Population Health deal we do because they're actually becoming part of our normal expectation at this point.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sean Wieland from Piper Jaffray.","Sean W. Wieland - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","One more on Siemens. Do you have any thoughts on opportunities for bookings synergies? I understand you're committed to the Siemens product line, but there's a lot of other non-Cerner, non-Siemens stuff in that base that offers some interesting cross-sell opportunities. Any thoughts there?","Marc G. Naughton","Yes, this is Marc. I mean, when we -- when you look at certainly a Soarian client, their clinical solutions were not very broad, right, they were focused on EMR orders and a very core set of solutions. All of those clients are paying a third-party in many places a niche supplier a fair amount of money to -- for their ancillary solutions. So yes, one of the key rationales for this business obviously and the reason we want to retain that client base is, like for like, putting -- exchanging a Millennium for the Soarian, we have a lot of additional solution we can sell onto that base. And that's one of our expectations. I think, at the end of the day, is that Cerner bookings or Soarian bookings, it will be -- we're not going to spend a whole lot of time worrying about who gets credit internally because obviously our comp plans will handle that. But I think, there is a lot of ability for us to sell back into that base once we get that base over to Cerner. And it will be likely to be potentially when they replace Soarian, could actually be ahead of when they replace Soarian.","Zane M. Burke","I'd say, remember, the biggest opportunity is in the non-Soarian client base. So the biggest opportunity is in that MedSeries4 and Invision solutions that have been out there for quite some time. But Marc appropriately indicates that there are some opportunities for cross-sell. And just again, the breadth and depth of what we do versus the breadth and depth of the Siemens Health Services solution set does offer some great cross-selling opportunities and we'll work at ways to create the best integration that we can across [indiscernible].","Sean W. Wieland - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay. And so to be clear, those kinds of synergies are not part of your -- the accretion that you gave us for '15?","Marc G. Naughton","That would be correct. The focus primarily in '15, from our perspective, is some revenue synergies but primarily the spending side.","Sean W. Wieland - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay. And then, just one more. What are you hitting with regard to cultural challenges with the integration?","Marc G. Naughton","Interesting enough, I'll let Zane talk as well, but we're finding there's a lot of shared med people that are still in -- certainly in the U.S. side of this business, and they had a very similar culture to ours, a very similar let's get things done, let's not have a lot of bureaucracy and let's be successful and let's be the winner in our segment. And Siemens certainly was focused on doing the right thing, but they're a big company and big companies by their nature have to have a level of bureaucracy that a company like us and a company like Shared Medical [ph] didn't have. So almost -- we're -- at least, from my perspective, people are very excited about the chance to come to work for Cerner given the legacy of those people, lots of experience, they are coming with an excitement to be able to react quickly, make decisions quickly and get to market with the best solutions. So I think, it's actually better than I would have imagined to be.","Operator","Our next question comes from George Hill with Deutsche Bank.","George Hill - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","First one is for Zane or Marc. One of your competitors on a quarterly basis tends to break out the amount of bookings revenue that comes from Population Health targeted solutions. I was wondering if you guys would tell us either with the big deal that you guys announced this quarter, either what percent of bookings were Population Health-related in this quarter or how that's grown? And maybe how we should expect the mix to change and how we should think about that?","Marc G. Naughton","This is Marc. I mean, when you have a lot of bookings, when you have 1 billion-plus of bookings, breaking out something like pop health is a small percent of that, isn't all that relevant to us, it might be relevant to a competitor because that's all they're selling. But for us, it really isn't that relevant. I mean, we try to certainly provide some anecdotal information relative to successes we're having in different areas. This is something that's just in our portfolio. It's early. A lot of these things are pilot. So from a dollar standpoint, it's still not something that I would say is significantly moving the needle in any case. But as it gets to be a bigger part of our business, we certainly can look at providing some -- a little bit more detail between those 2. But at this point, I don't think it would be helpful in your analysis.","George Hill - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then, maybe just a quick follow-up, just to make sure. I don't know if I heard you correctly, but as we start to see the results come in for 2015, are you guys going to break out what was the growth of the legacy Siemens business versus the legacy Cerner business? Or are we just going to get it all together, because I thought that you had said in prior calls that for at least 1 year, you were going to give us kind of transparency into the 2 business segments?","Marc G. Naughton","Yes. I mean, I think, the goal would be to create the ability, certainly on the top line, to do some type of same-store view of the businesses. I think, from an earnings standpoint, as we go forward, that may be more and more challenged. The first report, we filed the 10-K from the first year will break out Siemens on a separate basis to an extent. So you'll get that information from a GAAP and of that view perspective. And I think, on revenue side, based on giving a sense of same-store sales, I think, that's relevant. From the expense side, it will be harder, just because there'll be synergies that we get that will come to the P&L, there'll be synergies that we get by being able to move people from Siemens over to our teams doing Cerner work. But we'll certainly -- right now, it's a little bit early. I don't know exactly what data I'm going to have and what's going to be helpful to you all. But certainly, as we talked about being able to break out elements of Cerner's and Siemens, my focus was on the top line.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Marc, I just wanted to go back to the original accretion outlook from Siemens, the more than $0.15 in '15. I was just hoping maybe you could talk a little bit about what could potentially drive that more than $0.15 part of that outlook, now that you guys have provided a more formal outlook for '15. Could you maybe just touch on where you're seeing the potential upside opportunities to that number?","Marc G. Naughton","Yes. I don't know that what we provided today is a more formal outlook. I mean, clearly, we'll continue to do work. We continue to do -- to look at the numbers we originally looked at and have confidence in them. So I'm not really here to go guesstimate what could happen in the future relative to them. I think, in our view, as we said on the call surrounding the Siemens deal, we feel $0.15 is a good number that we should be looking for and that investors should have confidence of our ability to deliver that. A variety of things could happen to provide upside to that, but I think we're going to be consistent with our early view that has been supported by additional work that, for now, $0.15 is the number.","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Fair enough. And then, I just wanted to switch gears over to Meaningful Use. It seems like you and your major competitor constitute about 3\/4 of the early Stage 2 attestation so far, while other vendors, at least early on here, seem to be struggling a bit. I'm just curious if maybe you could talk a little bit about Meaningful Use as a driver for either replacements or are we at a point where the CMS need to act in order to kind of keep this program moving forward?","Zane M. Burke","This is Zane. I don't see Meaningful Use driving any buying behavior today. So I think, the thing it does on an individual -- I mean, on an individual stage level. What I think it does is people are seeing how much harder it is if you're not on a contemporary solution to comply with those different Meaningful Use elements. So I think you'll see compliance with those Meaningful Use stages by other suppliers, but I think, how the difficulty by which those suppliers have to cobble things together and focus their resources on those, almost exclusively on Meaningful Use elements and not moving forward with the solutions is being noted in the client basis, and that's part of why the foundational solutions are -- the replacement market is very active. So I think that's really where that continues to play out. So the bar continuing to raise is a good thing for Cerner.","Operator","The next question comes from Charles Rhyee with Cowen.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Just 2 quick questions here. Zane, obviously, we've talked a lot about in the past and a little bit here today all the things you're doing outside of sort of, call it, core EHR. When we think about this market, can you help us -- and you might have done this in the past calls and I apologize if I don't remember, but can you help us sort of size what you think the opportunity outside the core EHR market? So -- because as we move away from the discussion just around Meaningful Use, do you envision that this market, the future markets will be larger than sort of the course of even [ph] selling and how big a thing that can be?","Zane M. Burke","Charles, we provided -- in our analyst meetings, we provided some views of what we think the future can look like in a number of those different lines of business, in particular the population health perspective, but there's a number of different lines by which we see that opportunity growing. And so I would refer you back to those investor slides.","Marc G. Naughton","Yes. I think -- Charles, this is Marc. I mean, we look at -- the pop health is one that's hard to quantify. We've seen various quantifications of $30 billion, $15 billion, whatever. There's lots of external views of that. I think, the more we work with clients, especially those taking risk and see how that is, they have to focus on how am I going to manage a population, improve the quality of what I provide and reduce my cost of providing that high-quality care. I think, Population Health is a no-brainer in the future world. So given the limited number of sizable players playing in that market, we think that's a big opportunity. And I think, the market -- I mean, I think, the potential market is as big as what we've seen in just doing the EMR, and Zane would tell us, it's probably -- it's bigger than that.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Yes. I mean, that's what I was really focused on, the population health side, I mean. So while it's probably a little nebulous today, it's fair to think that this could easily be as big if not bigger than the...","Zane M. Burke","Certainly, our view is this could be as big, if not much bigger, than the core EHR market.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And just a follow-up on the DOD. When we looked at the RFPs as they were being formalized and in the final RFP, obviously, the DOD made a lot of references to open system architecture and interoperability. It's not as clear to see, just reading the RFP language itself, how important those factors are to DOD, but as you sat in the user group meetings, sort of the vendor meetings heading into the RFP, can you give us more qualitative sense on what aspects are more important to them?","Zane M. Burke","I absolutely do believe that open interoperable is a key driver on what they're thinking about, along with the capabilities to deliver to our servicemen and women across the world and support them in the different theaters-of-war venues that they're going to be in. So I think, it's going to be a combination of that open interoperable. It's the capabilities across all elements. It's the capabilities of the partners that are driving, so it's not just an EHR discussion. And we really like our team a lot in terms of what we're doing with both in the partner side of that. So we think we have the best team on that side, and I think that's going to be incredibly important as you move from the current systems to what the new standards will be.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","If I could just add 1 more. It's not in the RFP itself, but has there been preliminary discussions or at least anecdotally about a view in the future to also connect that to VA, because I thought that was the initial reason DOD was trying to do something with VA in the past?","Zane M. Burke","There hasn't been a lot of dialogue about of late, and that's why the DOD went out for a separate. Initially, you're correct, Charles, there's going to be a -- with the VA and DOD. And then, they -- the DOD specifically went separate from the VA, and that's what's driving, and that's part of this decision. So supposing what may happen in the future, I can't really look at that. But the current course of speed is DOD on a standalone basis.","Marc G. Naughton","I want to thank everybody for attending today and appreciate the time. We're very excited about our results this quarter and continue to look forward to bringing Siemens Health Services into the fold in Q1 of next year. So with that, look forward to talking to you soon.","Operator","This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect.

Today's date is April 25, 2019, and this call is being recorded.","The company has asked me to remind you that various remarks made here today constitute forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, those regarding projections of future revenues or earnings; operating margins; operating and capital expenses; bookings; new solution; services and offering development; capital allocation plans; and future business outlook, including new markets or prospects for the company's solutions and services. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements.","Please see Cerner's earnings release, which was furnished to the SEC today and posted on the Investors section of cerner.com and other filings with the SEC for information on the most significant factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. Additionally, a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this earnings call can also be found in the company's earnings release available on cerner.com. Cerner assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information except as required by law.","At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Brent Schaefer, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Cerner Corporation.","Brent Schaefer","Thank you, Brian. Good afternoon everyone and welcome to the call. I'll spend the first few minutes providing some context on the quarter and then I'll ask our CFO, Marc Naughton, to walk through the results; and then our Chief Client Officer, John Peterzalek to provide additional highlights and marketplace observations.","Since our last earnings call, you've likely seen that Starboard acquired a position in Cerner and we announced the cooperation agreement with them. From the outset, we approached the conversation with Starboard in an open-minded fashion, just like we do any shareholder. Starboard's focus on operational improvements and Board refreshment was consistent with our objectives and plans and we had existing efforts underway in both areas. The cooperation agreement builds on and accelerates the work we've been doing and formalizes our commitment to improve operating performance, including specific targets that are aggressive, but attainable.","In addition, we added four outstanding new Board members, which we believe strengthens our governance. We strongly believe these operational and governance improvements are in the best interest of Cerner's clients plants, associates and shareholders. Since assuming the role of CEO in 2018, the entire Cerner leadership team and I have been reviewing all facets of our operations to improve financial performance and unlock the company's significant potential.","As we discussed in our last earnings call and at HIMSS, we rolled out a new operating model to streamline operations, become more client-centric and to enable improved focus on growth. We believe this work is foundational to our operational improvement commitments. As the next step toward driving improvements in Cerner's operations and cost structure, we engaged AlixPartners a leading outside consulting firm. Our goal is to uncover efficiencies without impacting important growth investments and commitments to Cerner clients.","Key areas we expressed -- that we expect to address include: to assess top management spend and layers; to continue the portfolio management we work -- we started in 2018; rationalize company facilities; review non-personnel expenses; and drive additional process improvements. The work is off to a good start and I have direct experience working with AlixPartners and I'm confident in their ability to help us become more efficient, while we become more focused and better position ourselves for profitable growth.","Marc will discuss our targets in more detail, but I want to make it clear they have balanced -- they have been balanced against Cerner's growth investments and client commitments. One of the other elements we evaluated last year was Cerner's capital allocation strategy. Based on the strength of our balance sheet, we wanted to enhance the return of capital to shareholders, which led to our announced quarterly dividend program and commitment to continued share repurchases.","Given our expectation that we will create value as we deliver on our operational initiatives, we increased our share buyback authorization as part of our agreement with Starboard resulting in a $1.5 billion currently available for repurchase. With respect to governance, we welcome John Greisch, Melinda Mount, George Riedel, Halsey Wise to Cerner's Board. These new members along with our existing directors bring invaluable counsel and insight.","Our Board supports management view that the actions we are taking can create shareholder value without putting the business at risk. To monitor the operational improvement efforts, a Finance & Strategy Committee has been established that will work closely with management to ensure execution against our operating targets.","Cerner operates in a highly competitive space and we will be measured in our approach with respect to client commitments, investments and considerations for our associate base. We believe the actions outlined will help us become a much stronger and more focused company well positioned for long-term profitable growth.","Now I'll turn it over to Marc.\\","Marc Naughton","Thanks, Brent. Good afternoon everyone. I'm going to cover our Q1 results and future guidance. I'll start with bookings which were $1.242 billion in Q1. This is $42 million above the midpoint of our guidance range and as anticipated, down from Q1 2018 booking of $1.398 billion, which included much higher-than-normal levels of large long-term bookings. As John will discuss, bookings excluding long-term contracts grew slightly over the year-ago period.","We ended the quarter with a revenue backlog of $14.87 billion, which is up 2% over a year ago. Recall that our backlog calculation under the new revenue standard excludes revenue from contracts with termination clauses, even as such clauses are rarely exercised. When you combine the expected revenue from our backlog and the additional revenue expected from contracts not included in backlog, our revenue visibility remains at approximately 85% over the next 12 months. Revenue in the quarter was $1.390 billion up 8% over Q1 of 2018 and at the midpoint of our guidance range.","I'll now go through the business model detail and year-over-year growth compared to Q1 of 2018. Licensed software revenue in Q1 was $154 million up 15% over Q1 of 2018 with good growth in both traditional software and SaaS offerings. The growth in traditional software benefited from a low comparable level in Q1 2018 which was the lowest software quarter of the year.","Technology resell decreased 12% in Q1 to $56 million but was up sequentially as we expected. Subscriptions revenue grew 10% to $84 million in Q1 in line with our expectations that the subscriptions business model would return to solid growth after being impacted in 2018 by the adoption of Topic 606.","Professional services revenue in Q1 grew 11% to $490 million driven by solid growth in both implementation services and our works businesses. Managed services increased 13% to $304 million in Q1 primarily driven by robust bookings in 2018. Support and maintenance was down 3% compared to Q1 of 2018 with solid growth in Cerner Millennium support not quite offsetting declines in legacy support and hardware maintenance.","Note that support and was flat sequentially and has easier comparable periods going forward. But we expect year-over-year growth to be flat to low single-digit for the remainder of the year. And finally, reimbursed travel in the first quarter was flat to both Q1 of 2018 and last quarter at $24 million.","Looking at revenue by geographic segment. Domestic revenue was up 8% from the year ago quarter at $1.231 billion and international revenue of $159 million was up $1 million from the year ago quarter. Note that our non-U.S. revenue growth was impacted by foreign currency rates and would have been mid-single-digit on a constant currency basis. Moving to gross margin. Our gross margin for Q1 was 81.8% down from 82.6% in Q4 of 2018 and 82.1% year-over-year due to slightly higher mix of third-party services.","Now I'll discuss spending operating margin and net earnings. For these items, we provide both GAAP and adjusted or non-GAAP results. The adjusted results exclude share-based compensation expense, share-based compensation permanent tax items, acquisition-related adjustments organizational restructuring expenses and other adjustments all detailed and reconciled to GAAP in our earnings release.","Looking at operating spending. Our first quarter GAAP operating expenses of $939 million were up 8% compared to $866 million in the year ago quarter. Our adjusted operating expenses were up 9% compared to Q1 of 2018. Looking at the line items for Q1, sales in client service expense increased 9% year-over-year primarily driven by an increase in personnel expense related to our services businesses. Software development expense increased 12% over Q1 of 2018 driven by a 7% increase in gross R&D, 12% increase in amortization and flat capitalized software. G&A expense is up 5% and amortization of acquisition-related intangibles decreased slightly year-over-year.","Moving to operating margins. Our GAAP operating margin in Q1 was 14.2% compared to 15.1% in the year-ago period. Our adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 17.5% down from 18.8% in Q1 of 2018 and 18.7% last quarter. As Brent discussed we are taking steps to improve our operating performance with a focus on cost optimization, process improvement and portfolio management. We expect these efforts to begin positively impacting our results in the second half of the year. We are working with AlixPartners to refine our list of optimization and process improvement opportunities and build a more detailed timeline.","We expect to be done with this work by the time we report our second quarter. And based on our preliminary work, we remain confident in our ability to meet previously announced targets for Q4 of 2019 and Q4 for 2020, adjusted operating margins of 20% and 22.5%, respectively.","This will be hard work particularly with the backdrop of a challenging core market environment, but it is necessary to make these changes to enhance efficiency and focus as we position ourselves for ongoing profitable growth. I want to be clear that we still believe we have good long-term growth opportunities driven by our federal business, opportunities within our large health system, base and our strategic growth initiatives that address adjacent markets.","As we work through our operational improvement efforts, we'll look to protect the investments necessary to drive this growth. The changes we expect to make revolve around focus. We are doing too many things and we believe we can do better if we target our attention on areas that represent the largest and most profitable growth opportunities and drive client satisfaction and retention. ","Moving to net earnings and EPS. Our GAAP net earnings in Q1 were $166 million or $0.51 per diluted share, which is up 6% compared to GAAP EPS in Q1 of 2018. Adjusted net earnings in Q1 were $199 million and adjusted diluted EPS was $0.61 compared to $0.58 in Q1 of 2018. Our GAAP tax rate was 19.5% for the quarter. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 21%. We expect our non-GAAP tax rate to be closer to 22% for the remainder of 2019. ","Moving to our balance sheet. We ended Q1 with $904 million of cash and short-term investments which is up from $775 million in Q4 of 2018. Our total debt was down $5 million from last quarter to $439 million.","Total receivables at the end of the quarter are $1.159 billion, down from $1.183 billion in Q4 of 2018. Our Q1 DSO was 76 days, which is down from 79 days in Q4 2018 and up from 73 days in the year-ago period.","Operating cash flow for the quarter was $317 million. Q1 capital expenditures were $119 million and capitalized software was $75 million. Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less capital purchases and capitalized software development cost was $123 million for the quarter.","For 2019, we continue to expect our operating cash flow to be impacted by higher cash outflows for taxes, our voluntary separation plan payouts and other expenses related to our organizational restructuring.","On the capital side, we expect an increase in capital expenditures primarily driven by work on the phase of construction at our Innovations Campus, which should be completed in the first half of 2020.","Due to a combination of these two factors, we expect free cash flow to decline in 2019. In 2020, we expect to return to normal operating cash flow growth, a meaningful decline in capital expenditures to lead to strong free cash flow. In addition, note that our capital spending is included in our operational review and we expect to identify opportunities to reduce capital spending going forward.","Moving to capital allocation. As we recently announced we increased our share buyback authorization to $1.5 billion. We expect to execute the majority of the repurchase authorization in the next 12 months subject to market conditions and other factors.","We intend to fund this with cash from operations and debt with the amount of debt depending on the timing of our repurchases and whether we use cash for other purposes such as M&A.","Regarding the dividend program we announced in February, we still expect to initiate a $0.15 per share quarterly cash dividend with the first payment expected early in the third quarter. We expect the board to officially declare the dividend at our May shareholder meeting.","Our expected initiation of a dividend combined with our significantly increased repurchase authorization reflects our commitment to returning capital to shareholders and our belief in Cerner's long-term potential.","Now I'll go through the guidance. We expect revenue in Q2 to be between $1.410 billion and $1.460 billion. The midpoint of this range reflects growth of 5% over Q2 of 2018. For the full year, we continue to expect revenue between $5.65 billion and $5.85 billion with a $5.75 billion midpoint, reflecting 7% growth over 2018.","We expect Q2 adjusted diluted EPS to be $0.63 to $0.65 per share. The midpoint of this range is 3% higher than Q2 of 2018. For full year adjusted diluted earnings per share, we expect to benefit from the recently announced operational improvement initiatives and expanded share repurchase program. The amount of the benefit will depend on the timing of operational improvements and share buybacks. But based on preliminary estimates, we now expect adjusted diluted EPS to be between $2.64 and $2.72, which reflects 9% growth at the midpoint and is above our previous guidance range of $2.57 to $2.67.","Moving to bookings guidance. We expect bookings revenue in Q2 of $1.25 billion to $1.45 billion. The midpoint of this range reflects a 24% decrease compared to the second quarter of 2018, which included the initial task order for the VA. As John will discuss, the primary reason for the projected year-over-year decline is we expect lower levels of long-term bookings.","In summary, we are pleased with our solid results in the first quarter and we remain focused on delivering improved operating performance and creating shareholder value as we position Cerner for long-term profitable growth.","With that, I'll turn the call over to John.","John Peterzalek","Thanks, Marc. Good afternoon, everyone. Today I'll cover our top-line results and discuss the marketplace. I'll start with our bookings, which are in line with our projections with growth in non-long-term bookings being offset by a decline in long-term bookings, which we previewed last quarter.","The percent of bookings coming from long-term contracts in the quarter was 30% compared to 40% in Q1 of last year. When you exclude the long-term component, bookings grew 3% compared to the year ago quarter.","As Marc mentioned, the dynamic is expected to continue in Q2 with another expected decline in long-term bookings and the impact is amplified by the fact that Q2 of last year represents a tough comparable as it was near an all-time high and included our initial VA bookings.","The lower level of long-term bookings in our forecast is in part driven by our decision to be more selective as we consider certain low-margin, long-term contract opportunities given the current operational review and our focus on higher margin growth. This is not expected to have a material impact on near-term revenue or earnings but we do expect the mix of long-term bookings to be lower for the year.","Our pipeline remains strong and we are well-positioned to deliver good long-term growth but willing to make sure we pursue high quality business that aligns with our focus on profitable growth.","Moving to new business mix. We had a solid quarter with 32% of bookings coming from outside our core Millennium installed base. In the federal space, our projects with DoD and VA are both progressing as planned. For DoD, we are continuing our work on the second wave of sites with go-lives on track for this fall. Similarly, our work with the VA has continued as planned, and we remain on track to steadily ramp our work on the project, as we go through the year and into next year, with the initial sites still expected to go-live in 2020.","Q1 was also a solid quarter for other key growth areas such as revenue cycle and population health. We also see material growth opportunities beyond the hospital, as we shift -- as the shift continues towards at-risk, value-based pay arrangements, providers will need better data and analytics to improve their economics. Cerner expects to help provider clients increase their top line revenue and win their ZIP code providing the Big Data and predictive tools to support better health care experiences and outcomes.","A few weeks ago, we announced an expanded partnership with naviHealth, a pioneer in post-acute patient management. We have worked with naviHealth for the past five years to streamline workflows for the post-acute discharge. We are expanding the relationship to create a new EHR-agnostic offering that drives improved clinical outcomes and financial results with a focus on addressing the latest bundled payments model for the CMS known as the bundled payments for care improvement advance.","As we build our health care network strategy, we will selectively add at-risk capabilities with key partners. naviHealth, for example, will leverage Cerner's HealtheIntent platform and allows us to drive higher-dollar, higher-margin economics around the provider health network. Because health systems leverage a portfolio of value-based risk models, the naviHealth relationship is highly complementary to our work with Lumeris, an important strategy for advancing our post-acute line of business.","Now I'll provide brief observations on the marketplace. While our core EHR market is mature, opportunities remain to replace legacy suppliers and cross-sell additional solutions, such as, revenue cycle and ambulatory into our existing client base. We believe we are well-positioned to act as partner to our clients, because we have the capabilities beyond EHR that align with their imperatives, which generally include optimizing revenue in both fee-for-service and value-based models, improve the health of population, enhancing quality and outcomes and creating operational efficiencies.","In summary, we believe we are aligned with our clients' needs and well-positioned to enable them to pursue their growth strategies and deliver against their imperatives.","With that, I'll turn the call back to over to Brent for closing comments.","Brent Schaefer","Thanks John. Well, as you've heard from us today, we're undergoing a lot of change. We have embraced the cooperation agreement as an opportunity to build on the work we've done over the past year, and move at a fast pace to make the needed improvements in our operating performance. We are very committed to delivering against the targets we have established, and we're confident in our ability to execute.","One thing that will not change is our commitment to clients and innovation. We're focused on supporting our clients by aligning around the following priorities. Intelligent innovation, which means delivering on our commitment to leverage the power of data to create contextual, intelligent experiences, new evidence-based insights and workflow interventions. Better experiences and outcomes, which includes intelligent health networks and relentlessly advancing client successes. Open and connected health care, which reflects our commitment to investing in rapid technology advancements to deliver tangible value to every patient, clinician, technologist and administrator. We believe open platforms that allow clients, partners and developers to innovate with us will allow us to solve health care's most complex challenges.","In summary, we believe we are making Cerner a stronger, more focused company positioned to have a positive impact on health care. Now I'll turn the call back to the moderator, and open up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you sir. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from the line of Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Robert Jones","Great. Good evening. Thanks for taking the question. Brent, you shared several areas that you highlighted as being evaluated to help you guys reach the operating margin targets shared in the cooperation agreement. But I was hoping maybe you could just give us a little bit more of a sense of order of magnitude. And I'm thinking if you take a step back R&D versus more of the traditional operating expenses, because I know you've highlighted things that kind of on both sides of the fence there.","And then within that, if you could just share the kind of line of sight, you feel like you have today into those cost savings, as we think about getting the operating profit level from what we saw in 1Q to that 20% exit rate that you guys had shared?","Brent Schaefer","Yes, okay. Good question. Well, it's early days, right? So we're a couple of weeks into the engagement with Alix. So we're in the data-sharing process and starting to really build out where to look.","The analogy, I've been using is in HIMSS Sumitt, a health care perspective is we're doing a full-body CT scan of everything, all aspects of the organization to look for opportunities. And it's a little early to identify exactly where we go.","But we do -- we certainly, we see opportunities as mentioned around, how we're -- it's fundamental structured around management span and layers. And we feel like we did some really good work last year on the portfolio, established a good baseline of understanding for us, quantified where the opportunities are and where some of the best opportunities are.","So, it's kind of -- in many cases going to the next step here of seeing that through, making strong decisions around those that maximize our growth opportunity, and help us find efficiencies.","And we know just as we discussed last year based on our scale and size that the operating model was intended to help set up some fundamental alignment about accountability and clarity throughout the organization. But we know there's opportunity for process improvement that comes with that.","And given that in Q1 we just rolled out the model kind of the next obvious step is to then really look for clear processes to work those for efficiencies through the whole organization. So, I hope that at it least gives you some directional sense of where we're going and there'll be more as we get into it for sure.","Robert Jones","Yes. No, Brent that helps. I guess just a quick follow-up. I thought it was interesting comments on the bookings guidance. It seems more conscious that you're not pursuing certain as you described lower margin long-term contracts. Is it safe to assume that that's on the work side of things? And if that's true maybe just an update on where you stand on the billing center. I know that was a big focus a big buildout last year.","Marc Naughton","Yes this is Marc. I think that certainly every transaction and agreement we look at is going to be reviewed in light of our focus. But relative to bookings keep in mind that long-term bookings which is the primary difference we're seeing in Q1 and Q2 relative to the year ago quarters, those tend to be lumpy.","And actually coming in the year we indicated when we talked to you about Q1 as we're doing in Q2 the funnel for those types of transactions just wasn't as big as it was a year ago. And that -- the funnel varies or opportunities in front of us that are fairly large that can certainly bring us back to a more normalized number relative to that.","But I think that for us the point we're making is we're certainly going to look at all of our businesses and decide which ones we want to focus our attention on and those are the ones that are going to be that we think help our clients retain our clients and drive profitable growth.","So, right now it's a little early to decide exactly what that's going to entail. But when you think about bookings I think that probably the more meaningful impact in the first half of this year is just a lower pipeline.","Robert Jones","Got it. Thanks Marc. Appreciate that.","Marc Naughton","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Ricky Goldwasser","Yes, hi good evening. When we think about 2019 and kind of at the topline growth what percent of revenue do you expect to come from the federal contracts where you're not changing your spend versus customer areas where you are planning on spending less on?","And then second a follow-up question on that is if you had a chance to speak with them to your hospital customers after your announcement? And what feedback are you hearing back from them?","Brent Schaefer","Yes, John do you want to take that?","John Peterzalek","I'll go first with the feedback from the client. This is John. I had the opportunity obviously to speak with many clients post announcements. And almost without exception it's viewed as a positive catalyst for us.","As we look at our new Board members and the focus on both technology and operational improvements that's very positive from our clients' perspective. We're accelerating some of the things that we are already doing around our operating model to become more efficient."," Our efficiencies it reflects well with our clients as well. It's easier for them to do business with us. We get solutions to market quicker all those types of things. So pretty much without exception it was viewed as a good catalyst for us to move forward and accelerate our plans that we already have.","Marc Naughton","Yes, and this is Marc. Working on your question kind of relative to revenue that has costs or doesn't have costs or obviously we're early in determining where the opportunities are here. But I think key element when you're thinking about revenue and the impact of our efforts on revenue is that as we went into the year and we continue to see based on the 12-month view out of backlog and those contracts that are not in backlog, but are going to roll out in the next 12 months that 85% of our revenue is still visible to us.","So that is going to be rolling through. Most of the activities from our services which a lot of the VA revenue comes from those people are generating revenue and clearly you're not going to go cut costs for people that are generating revenue. So, I think from a revenue perspective the efforts we're taking from a efficiency standpoint aren't going to make a material dent relative to 2019.","Ricky Goldwasser","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Lisa Gill","Thanks very much and good afternoon. I just wanted to follow up on the cadence of the margin improvement. Marc if I look at -- I know you don't give specific margin guidance but if I look at the implied margin for the second quarter it looks like it'll be down again year-over-year.","So, can you maybe just talk about how quickly this will ramp to get to that as Brent said aggressive but attainable target of 20% by the fourth quarter? Is that -- does that mean that all of these efficiencies will really come in the third quarter and fourth quarter?","A \u2013 Marc Naughton","Yes Lisa, this is Marc. I mean clearly the efforts we're undertaking are fairly recent. We got a lot of analysis to do. And then we have to go take the steps that are going to start driving those. So I think it's certainly in our view, in the plan we have is a material amount of that happens in Q4 for this year because it's going to take us time to get those projects underway and start realizing the benefits. So your synopsis that is most of that going to be happening certainly in the last half of the year and much of it in Q4, I think is a realistic one. I think certainly all the work we're going to be doing in 2019 is then going to set us up well as we roll into 2020 and put us on a good path for the 22.5% we expect to see in Q4 of that year. But certainly from -- exiting Q4, you will see a pretty steep ramp from a quarterly operating margin percentage as more and more of these initiatives start hitting the P&L as we get toward the end of the year.","Q \u2013 Lisa Gill","And then, just so I understand, in the updated guidance around the share repurchase, how much specifically do you have in the updated guidance for share repo?","A \u2013 Marc Naughton","We haven't given any specific number. It clearly depends on the timing of the repurchases which will be subject to market conditions et cetera. So we haven't really defined when we plan to do all of those repurchases. We just indicated that over -- certainly over the next 12 months, we expect to do the majority of that authorization. We're serious about bringing those shares and getting that repurchase done. But we haven't set a timing as far as when that's going occur and therefore relative to how it will impact EPS over that time.","Q \u2013 Lisa Gill","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Jeff Garro with William Blair & Company. Your line is now open.","Q \u2013 Jeff Garro","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. I want to ask more about bookings and the idea that you guys are getting more selective in some of these long-term opportunities. Maybe the way to ask it might be, what types of long-term opportunities are you still really interested in pursuing? Is it with some of the market leaders? Is it with some of your tightest partnerships? Or is it more strictly based on margin potential?","A \u2013 John Peterzalek","Yes. This is John. We're going to continue to look at all of our opportunities. It's just going to be a path of which ones we believe are going to benefit the client the most and get them -- move them forward as well as with our added scrutiny around making sure that the margins are right long-term for us as you expect to come to the big mix. But it doesn't mean you're only going to focus on the largest ones. It'll be throughout our client base where we'll have great opportunities to align both where we deliver tremendous value for the client and provide higher margins for Cerner. So it's not one specific area that we'll be looking at all of them with sort of just a revised look at them. But it should be brought throughout our entire client base.","Q \u2013 Jeff Garro","Got it. That helps. And then as a follow-up, thinking about the 4% year-over-year bookings growth in the kind of near-term bookings category and want to ask, what you see the pipeline supporting for the rest of the year given a bit of change in philosophy of those longer -- around those longer opportunities. Can you set some level of expectation around how near-term bookings are going to unfold for the rest of the year?","A \u2013 Marc Naughton","Yes. This is Marc. This -- once again bookings is a number that we'd like to have roughly to our rigorous forecast process and have a view on before we share a lot of color around that. So at this point, I think it's a little premature to give guidance as far as what we see the non-long term versus the long-term in the second half of the year. Certainly, we'll be able to serve more of that as we get to our next call. But at this point, consistent with what we've always done, we're not going to provide a whole lot of more color based on those breakdowns.","A \u2013 Brent Schaefer","I think it's fair to say that the pipeline is robust.","A \u2013 Marc Naughton","Yes. As we look at the market, the market's strong.","A \u2013 Brent Schaefer","I would add to that and I'd mentioned that in my comments as well, there isn't a material change in our pipeline at all. We still have a very strong pipeline top to bottom both in solutions services and other things. So I am highly optimistic about the pipeline itself. It continues to grow and it continues to be very broad throughout our solution mix and services mix.","A \u2013 Marc Naughton","And this is Marc. Just as a reminder that when you look at the bookings, you do have to keep in mind a little bit of a context in that in 2017 we grew 16%. And in the last year, we grew pretty significantly in bookings as well. The prior year actually we grew zero. So I think there is some lumpiness to this, but the reality is based on our backlog it's grown significantly from those two years of strong bookings. The revenue line is in pretty good shape relative to visibility. And the good news is that the pipeline is strong in a market that is seeming -- deemed mature, we have a lot of opportunities within both our existing client base and new clients to go after market share. So we will continue to do that.","Q \u2013 Jeff Garro","Thank you all, very helpful.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Eric Percher with Nephron Research. Your line is now open.","Q \u2013 Eric Percher","Thank you. Brent, can you speak to your hope for how the Board's Finance & Strategy Committee will interact with management and Alix goes a little bit off the functional \u2013 how that will function?","Brent Schaefer","Yeah. One, I think if you look at the bios of the four new Board members we're adding they're all operators with a lot of diverse experience, who've been through multiple business cycles different stages in business. So I think having their insights and as part of this will be a real benefit to us to have these new folks and then combined with our folks from our traditional Board who \u2013 especially a couple who have very deep insights to the market and operations that we're in, I feel good about that. So I think it's mostly a question of perspective and experience interacting with management as we work through these changes and helping us to avoid pitfalls and mistakes as we work our way through it. It's a lot \u2013 as you know this kind of work is a heavy lift and we need to make sure we do it well, and keep our priorities straight. So I expect it to be very helpful for us as we move forward.","Eric Percher","And sounds like you see them working with the management team broadly more than just advising you and the Board?","Brent Schaefer","Well, no, I mean, they're Board members. So I expect them to advise absolutely. It's an advising role right as Board members. But the breadth of experience that they bring, I think is a benefit as we work through this. So yeah, but it's an advisory role.","Eric Percher","Thank you.","Brent Schaefer","Yeah. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Ross Muken with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","Elizabeth Anderson","Hi. This is Elizabeth Anderson in for Ross. Can you discuss your openness to improve efficiencies in your R&D organization? So for example, how do you arrive at the proper level of investment or measure it given the lack of revenue acceleration in certain of your end markets?","Brent Schaefer","Yeah. This is Brent. Let me turn in and maybe you can add some Marc as we go. But I think the steps we started last year around just a disciplined approach to portfolio review was really fundamental. Marc mentioned, the way I think we've mentioned this, a couple of times we felt like we were trying to do too many things simultaneously. So the first piece is having a robust process around setting priorities, and that I feel like we've got a good start there. There's a lot more work that we can do. But I think this is a very good start.","And then within the R&D and how assets are deployed and how we work through a cycle I think the business model we put in place should help us because we found that we were developing some great new functionality and then really never getting it to market and scaling it through our client base, because the way it was developed we weren't seeing it all the way through. So there's opportunity there. And then I think when you come back to the topic now about really process improvement, I think that's kind of new ground for us. We've got the model in place. We've got a portfolio process in place. Now really looking for how can we find efficiencies throughout that development processes is work ahead for us. So I think all of those are ongoing opportunities for us at this point. So hopefully, that gives you a little color on it. Is there anything you want to add Marc?","Marc Naughton","Yeah. I think that's exactly right. Certainly, every \u2013 there is nothing off the table as we go through and do this work. Certainly, the focus is delivering for our clients and innovating. So R&D has been a key part of that spend. But certainly, everything we do as a company is going to be reviewed to make sure that the process is right and the level of resourcing is appropriate and the focus of those resources is appropriate. So \u2013 ","Elizabeth Anderson","Perfect, that's very helpful. My final question is how are you going to message your clients your intent regarding margins? And how do you counteract how competition is likely to position that?","John Peterzalek","Well, this is John. We know that there's going to be some competitive messaging around this whether it's accurate or inaccurate on the competitive side. But, our clients look at our margin in my opinion is more how efficient we are. And I've stated, before, I think that our clients need us to be more efficient because we need to bring our solutions to market more quickly and efficiency drives to that though they will welcome the fact that we'll be more focused and not spend as much time around the periphery of some things. And they'll welcome the fact that some of the great ideas and innovations we have will make it all the way through being deeply embedded in our clients.","So I think messaging, the reality to our clients will be very positive and then we'll see some very positive things come out of it in terms of how effectively we work with them. And we'll just have to deal with the competitive messaging. We'll be proactive about it, but communication is the best thing we can do with our clients, and let them know what we're doing, what to expect. And Brent has been very clear and we all have been very clear, this process will not impact our client. The commitments we have to our clients will not impact the innovation they expect from us and will not impact what we deliver.","Brent Schaefer","I think I'd just add to that John. I appreciate the points. I think in the clients that we serve these are generally very long-term partnerships. And so they depend on us to be a strong partner a healthy partner and to continue to innovate and help them move forward. And so a strong Cerner is something that they want, all right? They want to know we're positioned well for the future and can continue to deliver on our commitments. And so I think that's -- I think there is a pretty good understanding of that in our client base. But thanks for the question. I appreciate it.","Elizabeth Anderson","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from David Larsen with Leerink. Your line is now open.","David Larsen","Can you talk a little bit about your revenue works efforts? I think you brought on about 600 rev cycle FTEs in 2018. That obviously put some pressure on the margin there. But now what I'm hearing is the level of large service engagement wins has kind of slowed. Just any thoughts on your RevWorks efforts, Marc?","I think at one point you mentioned you wanted to make sure that Adventist was up and running and perfect before bringing on large new ones. Is that still your thought process? Thanks.","Marc Naughton","Sure. I think yeah, we basically opened up our billing center in Kansas City and that is fully staffed. It is beginning to take over roles that are opening up from attrition from some of our signed clients. So it is actually operating as it was intended to operate at this point. And I think we still look at that business and want to make sure that we are really good at it before we take it a whole lot broader.","That's one of the activities we're doing relative to this -- to the work we're doing around efficiencies and profitability. But certainly, I think the -- clearly that office -- that business office in Kansas City has turned out as we'd expected. We're getting the leverage from it. And I think we're going to have to continue to be able to leverage that office for new opportunities as they come up.","Once again those are probably even lumpier in the case of opportunities from a long-term bookings perspective. But currently right now that business is operating out of that service center and meeting our expectations.","David Larsen","Okay. And then just one more quick one for me. In terms of like the VA and sort of the rolling on of the VA, can you remind me how many waves are there? I thought there were like more than 40 waves and I think waves one and two are scheduled to go-live in like 2020. So my impression is that a lot of the VA revenue and bookings are still ahead of Cerner. Is that correct or not?","Marc Naughton","Yes. A little more color would be that -- absolutely correct.","Brent Schaefer","You're exactly right. There are a bunch of waves. And once we get further into the project, there will be multiple ways progressing at the same time. Right now, they are they're set to be kind of single waves as you get to proof-of-concept and those other elements. But as we roll forward and particularly as you start looking at kind of the bookings future view of bookings you do have to keep in mind that really kind of VA we had some initial bookings from them. This year we'll have some additional bookings. But there's -- the real increase in VA bookings comes when they really start rolling out multiple waves they start contracting for those projects.","And our statement has been we expect that revenue stream to grow kind of in $250 million increments until we get to around $1 billion a year. To get to a $1 billion year, you're going to have to have a significant amount of bookings come through to be able to support that revenue level. So you will see the revenue continuing to grow from VA. And therefore the bookings growth from VA as we move forward kind of on that four-year timeline we discussed.","David Larsen","Great. Thank you.","Marc Naughton","Thanks for the question.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Richard Close with Canaccord Genuity. Your line is now open.","Richard Close","Great. Thanks for the question. So on this profitable growth commentary, it sounds like you're deemphasizing some products or services, maybe RevWorks is one of those. Does that change your long-term thoughts on revenue growth by maybe deemphasizing some of these things?","And then if not, what are the areas that you see the most growth potential in over maybe the next five years?","Marc Naughton","Yeah. This is Marc. I think at HIMSS we kind of laid out some of the opportunities for growth that we were looking at. Certainly the government growth area is a huge area for us to grow. You talked -- we talked about naviHealth today. There are opportunities in the top health space that we continue to look at opportunities to grow from a top line perspective. The reality -- the focus on profitable growth that can be across almost any business. I mean some of the work that Brent referenced from a portfolio management perspective is that we're spending a bunch of money on something that's never going to grow to be a sizable contributor to revenue. But it's taking cycles of intention and it's taking people.","So if there's a lot of those types of things that are not just in categories, but are individual areas that we need to go adjust and either decide we're not going to do those anymore spin that off whatever approach is going to be. But I think from an overall standpoint, we have elements of growth that are out there that will continue to be able to provide avenues.","So, today, if you look at RevWorks if that was your kind of your focus question that might be a couple of hundred million dollars of revenue to us today. So that's -- well that's sizable. There hasn't been huge growth in that from a bookings perspective or more recently from a revenue perspective.","So I think while that's an avenue of potential growth, we have lots of other avenues of potential growth. This process will help us define, which of those we actively pursue and invest in, which of those we decide not to.","John Peterzalek","And I think we're jumping to specific business lines, which I wouldn't do right now. And I would not use the word deemphasize. I would use what we said in our comments, which is selective that some of these long-term growth areas are still very important to us. We're just going to make sure that they add to the product. We're very selective in terms of profitable growth the comments we made before. There are lots of opportunities out there, we can make sure they align both with our clients' needs, the value we drive and profitable growth for Cerner. So I would be hesitant to use the word deemphasize and I would continue with what we're going to be selective in what we\u2026","Marc Naughton","Yeah. Keep in mind one of the key elements of these works business is to more tightly align the client to Cerner. And that tight alignment brings with it a lot more software sales, a lot more high level services sales. So that is -- the overall contribution from those efforts is what we're looking at. We\u2019re not going to go pigeonhole, just a piece of that business and say this doesn't make sense. It's got to be in the overall profitability relative to a client. And that's always been the focus we've had. But we want to be selective in, which ones of those we pursue, making sure it does deliver on that promise.","Richard Close","Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from Stephanie Demko with Citi. Your line is now open.","Stephanie Demko","Hey, guys thank you for taking the questions. First one is just what drove your view of a nonlinear margin path at the recent Analyst Day? Or I guess put another way how much of that was a conscious decision to avoid any impact on top-line or bookings growth versus something else?","Marc Naughton","Yeah, I don't I mean, I don't think there was any intent to avoid an impact on the top-line. We at our HIMSS meeting said, our goal was to be over 20%, 20% plus. We clearly as Brent says spend a lot of time working on structures and we're getting to a point where we were prepared to start doing the deeper work to go drive those efficiencies. Clearly our agreement with Starboard accelerates that process. We're now adding detail. We're doing it at a faster pace. So I don't know that it's inconsistent with what we were talking about relative to getting over 20% margins.","The good news is 22.5% is over 20% and we're getting there probably more quickly than many people would have expected us to get there. And that's absolutely ourselves and Starboard, which is actually aligned with many of our investors and shareholders. We're all in alignment on that goal.","Stephanie Demko","Understood. So with that in mind, are there any near-term opportunities that you are looking at they're just being offset by mix over the next quarter or two? Or you're more staying on the sidelines until the consulting analyst finishes? Just to take a more social approach there.","Marc Naughton","We are -- once again, we've been doing work on this in this space for a while. We certainly love the work we're doing with AlixPartners, the collaboration and it's actually been very -- they've been well received within our organization, so that's going very well.","But there are things that we already had in process and in thinking through that we are going to be able to start the action in on. Depending on what those are, it may have a nearer term impact, but many of these are going to be something that even if you're getting something kicked off immediately, real impact is going to be toward the last part of the year. And that's the reality of the situation at this point.","Stephanie Demko","All right. It\u2019s very helpful. Thank you.","Marc Naughton","Sure. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Matthew Gillmor with Robert Baird. Your line is now open.","Matthew Gillmor","Hey, thanks for the question. I just had one last one. On the buyback program and just if you can update us on your future outlook there. And I guess the perspective would be that once you complete this repurchase authorization, do you intend to keep repurchasing stock at a similar pace? Or should we think of the $1.5 billion more as a one-time large repurchase and then you go back to the prior cadence? And I know M&A if you execute there that would obviously be influenced. But just trying to understand the philosophy at this point?","Marc Naughton","Sure. This is Marc. I mean our capital allocation approach is something that we review all the time. I think the working -- we will certainly work through this authorization by the board and get that done. We've always had the position that we are going to at minimum do repurchases at offsetting dilution.","And for the most -- a lot of the view of on the stock repurchase is how attractive our market conditions and what's the share price look like relative to what we think the value is. So I think you'll see us complete this large purchase.","And keep in mind, we've bought a lot of stock back over the last five or six years. So this isn't inconsistent with that. It's a little larger than our prior authorizations. But we'll certainly look at it once we get this done and determine based on our capital allocation at that time. If we do another sizable one, we just continue doing offsets of dilution do we have other investments. So little early for us to tell that this is going to be a plan of attack. I think capital allocation is something you've got to do on a kind of more of a temporal nature than a long-term plan nature.","Matthew Gillmor","All right. Fair enough. Thank you.","Marc Naughton","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Michael Cherny with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Michael Cherny","Thanks so much for taking the question. The thing about the cost cuts in the investment cycle from a little bit of a different angle. I think you've outlined at least the beginning pieces of what you plan to attack in terms of margin expansion. How do you think about positioning the company? And when you think about not just protecting revenue, but also looking to expand revenue in a world where hiring talent in the tech land becomes so much more challenging, so much more competitive. How do you think about the culture that you want to bring to the organization against the backdrop of driving through some of these cost cuts to make sure that you're staying at the forefront given your competition, not just the dynamics of what's in the competition in terms of selling against you, but what's the competition in terms of developing new products and new platforms against you?","Brent Schaefer","Maybe I'll -- a couple of comments here. You're asking about culture, and I think that's a great one to emphasize, because I think we \u2013 this is amazing. As a relative new comer to Cerner, there's an amazing culture here, and a real emphasis and a real desire to innovate and contribute and improve health care. And I think as far as attracting global talent to be part of that, I think that is a very strong asset for us and something we need to continue to build and reinforce and we want to do that.","And if you look at some of the facilities that we have in place, our innovation center, I don't if you've had a chance to tour, but it is world-class. It is a world-class environment for innovation and to attract talent. So I understand the nature of your question is do we scare away talent? I think honestly we want to reinforce that this is a great place to be and a great culture to be in. And we're here to contribute to improvement in health care. And what better mission is there than that? So we'll be careful about balancing the need for efficiency while attracting talent and driving that culture that we want to maintain.","Marc Naughton","Yeah. This is Marc. I think in some cases, there are areas in the company that we -- because of how we've grown up and some of the silos we've created before, we changed the operating model. It was harder to get things done inside Cerner. So I think the culture will evolve to one where it is easier to get things done. And I think that's important. I think the clearly one of the pillars of our organization is strategic growth. So we are focusing an entire organization just on finding new areas to go grow the company.","So I think rather than that being dispersed throughout the organization having a single focus of that group on it makes it more likely that we're going to be successful in innovating. And this was one final comment I would point out to be Innovation Campus that Brent referenced as being just world-class is being completely paid for by tax incentives from the State of Missouri and the city of Kansas City.","Michael Cherny","Thanks.","Marc Naughton","Well, we take one more question.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question will come from the line of Steven Valiquette with Barclays. Your line is now open.","Steven Valiquette","Great. Good afternoon, everybody, and also let me just say congrats on reaching the Starboard agreement. It's definitely a positive, no matter how you slice it. I think the additional good news really is that the majority of the investment community believes that the opportunity to get to 22.5% margin by the end of 2020 definitely exists within the company.","Nobody's really doubting that, but I think similar to an earlier question though, I think some investors are still really just trying to process the evolution of Cerner targeting 30bps to 60bps of margin expansion not that long ago, then just kind of backing off that a little bit but now you're obviously targeting a much larger 400 basis points in a pretty short time period.","And I mean this in a good way but in some ways the 22.5% margin target is really almost higher than it needs to be to satisfy investors. I think investors are really just looking for more color on how you arrive at that 22.5% as the right margin target for 4Q of 2020 during this whole process. Thanks.","A \u2013 Marc Naughton","Sure. No this is Marc. I mean we spent time early on with AlixPartners, actually to go through at a high level before they start doing their deep dives, give us a view of what they thought the opportunities were from an efficiency perspective. And we incorporated that into our thinking.","And we incorporated the thinking that we have relative to the business and opportunities. And yes no we think 22.5% is a strong stretch target. So we have a high level of confidence, in our ability to deliver on that target. I think the efficiencies are available. I think we'll be a healthy organization.","And you keep in mind when you look at the -- really the percent of cost that represents from -- as a percent of your total revenue it's not that high of a percentage. So, relative to the size of the company we're not doing anything that we expect to be draconian here.","So, I think where folks seeing certainly in the space of that 22.5% on cost reduction, things we can control. We're not expecting revenue growth to somehow add some basis points to our operating margin. So, I think all in that context we did the work to say this feels strong.","This is what we believe we can do and this is what we're willing to commit to. And I think it's a good target. I think it's something that investors should hold us to and focus on. But I don't -- perhaps a smaller target would've been something that people would've been okay with.","But I think this sends a message to both investors and our associates that we need to increase the health financially of this company. And so, we're very comfortable with the 22.5% target. And I think that is our target. And we will continue to be marching towards that.","We love the start we have on it and I think we will continue to do the work that we need to get there. And it's not -- it's something that the business can handle. We just have to be doing business more efficiently and better.","Brent Schaefer","And I would add and as we have taken a number of steps to set ourselves up for this work, from the work that was done last year and rolled out in first quarter, so the timing's good.","We know we had more to do. And it's an ambitious but achievable set of goals. And I think the team's ready to take it on and go after it. And that's what we intend to do.","Q \u2013 Steven Valiquette","Okay. I appreciate the extra color. Thanks.","Brent Schaefer","Thank you. Thanks, Steve.","Brent Schaefer","With that, we thank you all for attending. And we hope you have a good afternoon. Take care.","Marc Naughton","Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude today's program, and you may all disconnect.

Please proceed.","Marc G. Naughton","Thank you, Cheverly. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the call. I'll lead off today with a review of the numbers. Zane Burke, Executive Vice President of our Client Organization, will follow me with sales highlights and marketplace trends. Mike Nill, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, will discuss operations and our 2013 areas of focus. Jeff Townsend, Executive Vice President and Chief of Staff, will follow Mike and discuss strategic initiatives. Neal Patterson, our Chairman, CEO and President, will be available during Q&A.","Now I'll turn to our results. We delivered excellent results in the fourth quarter and for the full year 2012 with strong growth across all key metrics. Our total bookings revenue in Q4 was $1.02 billion, which is an all-time high. This reflects 13% growth over our previous record results in Q4 of '11 when bookings grew 44%. Bookings margin in Q4 was $888 million or 87% of total bookings for the full year. Bookings revenue was $3.14 billion, up 15% from 2011. Our bookings performance drove a 19% increase in total backlog to $7.27 billion. Contract revenue backlog of $6.53 billion is 21% higher than a year ago. Support revenue backlog totaled $738 million, up 5% year-over-year.","Revenue in the quarter was a record $710 million, which is up 15% over Q4 of '11. The revenue composition for Q4 was $252 million in system sales, $154 million in support and maintenance, $209 million in services and $13 million in reimbursed travel. For the full year, revenue grew 21% to $267 billion (sic) [$2.67 billion]. System sales revenue reflects 14% growth from Q4 of '11 and 28% growth for the full year. While this growth was largely driven by an acceleration of device resale during 2012, we also had strong contributions from software and subscriptions.","Moving to services. Total services revenue was up 20% compared to Q4 of '11 and 22% for the full year, with strong growth in managed services and professional services, with increased contributions from ITWorks and RevWorks. Support and maintenance revenue increased 8% over Q4 of '11 and 10% for the full year.","Looking at revenue by geographic segment, domestic revenue increased 21% for the quarter and 24% for the full year. Global revenue was down 17% for the quarter due to a tough comparable and up 5% for the full year.","As a preview to the annual update of our detailed business model that we'll provide at our Investment Community Meeting on March 5, I'd like to provide you with the total revenue and growth by business model for the full year 2012. Licensed software grew 6% to $345 million. This followed strong growth in 2011 and makes 2011 and 2012 the strongest 2 years of software growth in a decade. Technology resale was up 59% to $392 million, driven by growth in device resale. Subscriptions and transactions increased 22% to $166 million. Professional services revenue grew 25% to $686 million. Managed services increased 19% to $417 million. Support and maintenance was up 10% to $604 million. And reimbursed travel was $55 million, which is up 24%.","Moving to gross margin. Our gross margin for Q4 was 78.4%, which is up from 77.9% in Q3 and flat compared to Q4 of '11. The sequential increase in gross margin was driven by slightly higher system sales margins and strong services margins. For the full year, gross margin was 77.2%, which is within 100 to 200 basis points of where we expect gross margins going forward as we believe the mix shift tied to the increase in device resale has moderated.","Looking at operating spending, our fourth quarter operating expenses were $386 million before share-based compensation expense of $10 million. This is a year-over-year increase of 14%, which is below the growth of our revenue and gross margin. For the full year, operating expenses were $1.45 billion, up 14% from 2011. This compares to revenue growth for the year of 21%, reflecting ongoing operating efficiencies.","Sales and client service expenses increased 15% compared to Q4 of '11 and 17% for the full year, driven by an increase in revenue-generating associates in our services business.","Our investment in software development was up 7% compared to Q4 of '11 and 5% for the full year. As we have discussed, we have been hiring in our R&D organization and expect our R&D investments to continue growing. This will be reflected in increased gross spending and increased capitalized software in 2013.","G&A expense increased 27% compared to Q4 of '11 and 11% for the full year. The higher year-over-year growth in Q4 is driven by increased personnel expense related to our strong growth, higher amortization expense and a slight FX loss in Q4 of '12 compared to gain in Q4 of '11.","Moving to operating margins. Our operating margin in Q4 was 24.0% before share-based compensation expense and was up 30 basis points compared to Q4 of '11. For the full year, operating margin increased 70 basis points to 22.9%. This is slightly below our 100-plus-basis-point target, but we achieved this margin expansion on approximately $160 million more revenue in 2012 than we originally projected. So even with slightly lower margin expansion, we still drove approximately $0.14 more EPS than we guided to going into the year. While some of this upside was driven by lower taxes early in the year and a gain this quarter that I'll discuss in a minute, we still drove out good incremental earnings on very strong revenue growth.","Going forward, our plan reflects continued margin expansion even with the increased R&D investments I mentioned. We expect the margin expansion to come from leverage across many of our business units and moderation of the disproportionate growth of device resale that impacted our 2012 margin expansion.","Moving to net earnings and EPS. Our GAAP net earnings in Q4 were $112 million or $0.63 per diluted share. GAAP net earnings included share-based compensation expense, which had a net impact on earnings of $6 million or $0.04 per diluted share.","Adjusted net earnings were $118 million, and adjusted EPS was $0.67, which is up 22% compared to Q4 of '11. Note that our other income for Q4 included a $4.5 million gain resulting from the sale of a company in which Cerner had a venture capital investment. This gain contributed to approximately $0.015 of our EPS upside. For the year, adjusted net earnings were $421 million, and adjusted EPS was $2.39, which is up 28% from 2011.","The Q4 tax rate for adjusted net earnings was 34%, which is in line with our expected effective tax rate. We also expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 34% plus or minus 50 basis points in 2013. The tax rate will be lower in Q1 as there will be a catch-up for the 2012 portion of the R&D tax credit that was approved after our year-end, but we'll still base our guidance on an effective rate of approximately 34%.","Now I'll move to the balance sheet. We ended Q4 with $1.55 billion of total cash and investments, up from $1.5 billion in Q3. Total cash and investments include $1.04 billion of cash and short-term investments and $509 million of highly rated corporate and government bonds with maturities less than 2 years. Our total debt, including capital lease obligations, is $196 million.","Total receivables ended the quarter at $578 million, which is up $35 million from Q3 and driven by strong sales in the quarter. Contracts receivable or the unbilled portion of receivables were $48 million and represents 8% of total receivables.","Cash collections were a record $690 million. Our DSO in Q4 was 74 days, which is similar to Q3 DSO of 73 days and down from 83 days in Q4 of '11.","Operating cash flow for the quarter was $181 million, Q4 capital expenditures were $53 million and capitalized software was $28 million. Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures and capitalized software, was $99 million. For the full year, operating cash flow grew 30% to $708 million, and free cash flow grew 18% to $425 million, with capital expenditures of $183 million and capitalized software of $100 million.","Looking at 2013, we expect quarterly capital expenditures to remain in the $50 million to $60 million range as construction of additional space at our new Kansas City campus continues. At these levels, we still expect to generate good levels of free cash flow.","Moving to capitalized software. The $28 million of capitalized software in Q4 represents 33% of the $85 million of total investment in development activities. Software amortization for the quarter was $21 million, resulting in net capitalization of $6 million or 7% of our total R&D investment.","As I indicated, we expect capitalized software to continue increasing in 2013 as we invest in areas Zane, Mike and Jeff will discuss that will position us for strong growth through the decade. Note that much of the growth in capitalized software will be related to third-party developers we are using to accelerate development in certain areas. As a result, we expect the growth in capitalization to be temporary as we plan to moderate the use of third parties after 1 to 2 years. We view this approach, combined with our share buyback and small acquisitions, to be a good use of our capital.","Now I'll go through Q1 and full year guidance. For Q1, we expect revenue between $690 million and $715 million, with the midpoint reflecting growth of 10% over Q1 of '12. For the full year, we expect revenue between $2.95 billion and $3.05 billion, reflecting 13% growth at the midpoint. We expect Q1 adjusted EPS before share-based compensation expense to be $0.61 to $0.63 per share, with the midpoint reflecting 15% growth over Q1 of '12 reported adjusted EPS and 19% growth when you consider the $0.02 benefit we had from lower taxes in Q1 of '12. For the full year, we expect adjusted EPS between $2.75 and $2.82, with the midpoint reflecting 17% growth to our reported adjusted EPS. This reflects 20% growth when you adjust 2012 for a lower tax rate in Q1 and 2 and the gain on the investment sale we had in Q4. These items collectively benefit EPS by $0.075 in 2012, which we indicated when we reported the results during the year. Q1 guidance is based on total spending before share-based compensation expense of approximately $385 million to $395 million. Our estimate for the impact of share-based compensation expense is approximately $0.04 in Q1 and $0.16 to $0.17 for the full year. Moving to bookings guidance, we expect bookings revenue in Q1 of $720 million to $760 million, with the midpoint reflecting 13% growth over our strong Q1 '12 bookings.","In closing, we are pleased with our strong results in 2012, with us again delivering a year with strength across all key metrics. As the rest of the team will discuss, we are positioned for a strong 2013 and beyond.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Zane.","Zane M. Burke","Thanks, Marc. Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll provide sales highlights and discuss marketplace trends.","Starting with our results. Our bookings revenue in Q4 of $1.02 billion is an all-time high and reflects 13% growth over Q4 of '11, which is our previous all-time high. For the year, bookings revenue was up 15% to $3.1 billion. This growth is on top of our 37% growth in 2011, giving us a 2-year compound annual growth rate of 25%. It is worth noting that our record bookings in Q4 was achieved without an ITWorks or RevWorks contract in the quarter. We had 30 contracts over $5 million, including 17 over $10 million, driven by strength both inside and outside our installed base. The mix of long-term bookings was 33% in the quarter, which is in line with historical levels, primarily driven by very strong levels of managed services. For the year, long-term bookings represented 31% of total bookings, which is the same as last year.","A major highlight of our quarter and year was our continued success at gaining market share. This is reflected in the 35% of bookings in the quarter and 30% for the full year coming from outside our core Millennium installed base. Recall that in 2011, we had grown our bookings from outside our base by more than 50% over 2010. In 2012, we delivered double-digit growth over that tough comparable. And when you look at 2011 and 2012 combined, our bookings from new clients are approximately equal to new client bookings for the prior 4 years combined.","In Q4 alone, we had several signature wins against our primary competitor, including being selected by Los Angeles County Department of Health Services for a broad suite of solutions, services and hosting, making it one of the largest contracts in our history. In addition, the largest provider of health care services in Kansas, Via Christi Health chose Cerner to provide a broad suite of acute ambulatory and revenue cycle solutions and services to support their population health management initiatives.","We entered 2013 with a level of competitive momentum I have not seen since the early 2000s. This is driven by several factors, including our improvements and ongoing investment in key areas such as physician experience and revenue cycle; our proven and predictable services and operational capabilities; our ability to drive value, improve quality and performance, reduce costs and drive reimbursement; our leadership in population health capabilities and ongoing investments in our comprehensive operating system for population health, which is becoming more prominent in discussions with prospective clients; and we are also benefiting from the challenges faced by many of our competitors, including leadership turnover, integration challenges, platform limitations and issues with offering their clients a clear path to meet the rising bar for Stage 2 and Stage 3 of Meaningful Use and additional requirements for Value-Based Purchasing, ACO and population health.","The opportunity both in our base and for new footprints is very apparent in our pipeline, which increased substantially during 2012. The pipeline strength is well-balanced between new client opportunities and our installed base. In total, our pipeline has doubled over the past 2 years, which is particularly impressive when you consider the fact we have signed record levels of bookings out of the pipeline during that same time.","Now I'd like to provide some additional 2012 highlights. We continued to have strong success in 2012 at building our presence across the continuum of care. An important component of this is our traction in the physician market, where we had 29% growth and 30% revenue growth, which was driven by our improved solutions and our clients' increasing desire to expand their Cerner platform to employed and affiliated physicians. Beyond the physician office, we differentiate our ability to provide solutions for other venues such as ambulatory surgery centers, behavioral health, urgent care, home health, occupational health, rehabilitation hospitals and skilled nursing and long-term care facilities. As we have discussed, with reimbursement increasingly tied to quality and outcomes and more care shifting to different settings, the ability to coordinate care across multiple venues is becoming critical. These capabilities are also important to our population health efforts. Our current capabilities and comprehensive vision for population health are becoming a bigger part of the consideration process when we're competing for new business, and this is clearly a trend that favors Cerner.","Another area of noteworthy strength was in revenue cycle. Mike will provide an update on revenue cycle, but I wanted to note it, as the progress we've made in the past year and the ongoing investments we are making in revenue cycle are critical. Revenue cycle is part of almost every new business discussion, and our ability to deliver an integrated revenue cycle solution is a key competitive advantage. In addition, the amount of opportunity in our existing client base is significant, and we are starting to see that play out with some of our largest clients embracing our revenue cycle solutions and services.","Moving to DeviceWorks. As we have discussed throughout the year, our DeviceWorks organization made major contributions to Cerner's growth. Our clients' interest in using Cerner as a single source for connected devices continues to increase. In addition, more major device manufacturers are looking to Cerner to be resellers because they recognize the value of our device connectivity platform and the strategic relationships we have with our clients. I also remain impressed with the ongoing innovation within our DeviceWorks organization. As an example, we recently launched CareAware Connect, which is a nursing mobility solution that delivers communications such as voice, text and alarms, along with EHR workflow tools on a single smartphone device. I'd also like to point out that the growth in technology resale was not solely driven by devices. In fact, we had very strong growth in both hardware resale and sublicensed software. This balanced contribution to growth, particularly from sublicensed software, led to a strong growth in margin dollars from technology resale, so this business is contributing to more than just our top line.","Outside of the U.S., we continue to have good results in Australia, Canada and the Middle East. However, we did have lower revenue year-over-year in Q4 due to the ongoing soft global economy that impacts many of our markets. We also had a tough comparable, last year's Q4 having grown 35%. Full year growth outside the U.S. was 5%. While our results may continue to be lumpy, I remain optimistic about our global opportunities, and this outlook is supported by pipeline that is up more than 40% year-over-year.","Another highlight for us in 2012 was the success of our clients at demonstrating industry-leading levels of achievement with information technology. During the year, we had nearly double the number of client sites achieve Stage 6 or 7 status on HIMSS EMR Adoption Model than our closest competitor. We also have the most Stage 6 and 7 hospitals outside the U.S., with clients in 5 different countries achieving Stage 6 or 7 status in 2012.","Moving to some broader marketplace observations. Prior to 2012, there was clearly a major focus on Meaningful Use Stage 1. We have seen a shift to focus to Stage 2 and beyond. The focus over the past 3 years has been enough to create a clear distinction between the winners and losers in this industry. As providers look at the increasing complexity of compliance beyond Stage 1, more of them are reevaluating their supplier strategy. And many other suppliers, including our primary competitor, are showing signs that they will be challenged by the increasing requirements and have tried to push back on them. As a result, we enter 2013 with significant opportunities to displace other suppliers and in a stronger competitive position against our primary competitor.","In addition to Meaningful Use, the volume of measures and mandates our clients have to address is accelerating. With health care reform beginning to be implemented, along with countless other programs such as Value-Based Purchasing, quality reporting, ACOs, our clients are faced with an unprecedented decade of change. As they begin to experience the impact of these changes, they are looking to us for solutions and services that help them navigate these major shifts in the industry. One thing that became clear during 2012 is that our clients no longer need to be convinced they need a population health strategy. They now see it as the only way to address the inevitable shift to a model that incents quality and outcomes over volume.","The final industry trend I'd like to highlight is the ongoing consolidation among providers. Providers are looking for scale and to have more control over the complete continuum of care. As a result, hospitals are actively buying other hospitals, as well as buying physician practices and other outpatient facilities. This is the trend that benefits Cerner given our ability to offer integrated solutions across the continuum of care, and our strong market share, which includes a relationship with 7 of the 10 largest health systems in the U.S. and many more IDNs that are actively doing acquisitions.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Mike.","Michael R. Nill","Thanks, Zane. Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'm going to discuss ITWorks, revenue cycle and our other areas of focus for 2013.","I'll start with ITWorks. While we did not sign an ITWorks client in Q4, 2012 was still a great year for ITWorks. We added 3 ITWorks clients during the year, which is the same as 2011, but ITWorks bookings still grew 30% based on larger contract sizes and scope expansions.","Overall, 2012 was a year during which the value of strategic alignment created by ITWorks relationships became increasingly clear. Most of our ITWorks clients expanded their relationship with Cerner in some way. Several of them expanded the scope of their ITWorks engagement, bought more solutions and adopted our employer wellness offerings. We also had 1 ITWorks client become a RevWorks client, and this client is now fully aligned with both solutions and operational support across the suite of clinical and revenue cycle solutions.","Overall, our clients are embracing the deep relationship created by ITWorks and view it as a part of their strategy to be successful in this period of rapid industry change that Zane discussed. Benefits of strong alignment is also evident in the accomplishment of our ITWorks clients, as all of them have attested or are in the process of attesting for Stage 1 Meaningful Use, and almost 3\/4 of them have achieved HIMSS EMR Adoption Level 6 or 7.","This success and high client satisfaction is contributing to an increased pipeline for ITWorks, and I am confident, in 2013, we'll have another great year.","Moving to revenue cycle. 2012 was a very strong year for revenue cycle for both sales and operations. Revenue cycle bookings increased 26% in 2012, and this is following a strong 2011 during which bookings had more than doubled. The year included our fifth RevWorks client, which we announced in Q3, and it's our largest to date.","Operationally, we significantly advanced our revenue cycle portfolio of solutions and achieved a major milestone by surpassing 100 hospital sites in our patient accounting solution. As Jeff mentioned last quarter, we bought -- we brought 24 solutions within the revenue cycle suite to general availability over the last 18 months. Our expanded portfolio of solutions, coupled with our strong execution at delivering them, is creating momentum for us at a very critical time. Revenue cycle is part of every new business discussion, and it is essential to the success of our client base, because providers will be facing unprecedented changes in reimbursement structures in the coming years.","Further strengthening our position is that more of our large clients are beginning to fully embrace our revenue cycle solutions. For example, Adventist Health System, one of the largest and most respected health systems in the U.S., is deploying additional Cerner revenue cycle solutions to their 39 hospitals, with the first site going live last month. This builds on their existing Cerner access, scheduling, HIM and case management solutions and will result in them having a full suite of revenue cycle solutions in all of their hospitals.","Further validation of our progress in revenue cycle occurred in Q4 when another one of our large and prestigious clients, Adventist Health, a separate client from the Adventist Health System, signed a contract with us to implement a revenue cycle platform across acute, ambulatory and post-acute venues, with the first site scheduled to go live later this year. The scope of this project includes Cerner's end-to-end revenue cycle portfolio, remote hosting, application management and upgrade center. In addition to covering Adventist Health's 19 inpatient facilities, the scope of the project includes more than 150 clinics in 4 Western states. Note that in 2011, Cerner was chosen by Adventist Health to replace our primary competitor's clinical solution in their outpatient facilities. We are now their supplier for end-to-end clinical and revenue cycle solutions throughout all of their venues.","For both Adventist Health System and Adventist Health, their agreements represent a platform that will allow them to adapt to the changing reimbursement models while improving quality, patient safety and financial performance.","In summary, we are in a very strong strategic position in revenue cycle. Our comprehensive and integrated approach is unmatched in the industry, and I believe our revenue cycle business is entering a significant phase of growth that will last for several years.","Before handing the call over to Jeff, I'd like to share our areas of focus for 2013, which mostly build on the significant progress we made in 2012. First, we are going to increase our investment we are making in the physician experience. With Meaningful Use driving adoption at unprecedented level, we believe it is critical to provide physicians with solutions that are fast, easy and smart. In 2012, we brought PowerChart Touch, our native iPad app, from vision to reality by bringing the solution live at 13 early adopter sites. We are now working with 29 beta clients that have 1,800 ambulatory physicians and 3,500 inpatient physicians and are getting ready to roll out significantly expanded functionality.","In 2013, we are accelerating our investment in physician solutions, including continued expansion of functionality that will build out specialty workflows for PowerChart Touch. In addition, we're continuing to roll out improved workflows and a new look and feel across all of our solutions.","The second area of focus and increased investment in 2013 is revenue cycle. As I discussed, we had a great year in 2012 with rolling out additional functionality and getting our large clients to adopt our revenue cycle solutions. This progress has been well-received by our client base and is reflected in significantly improved KLAS scores, a large pipeline of revenue cycle opportunities in our installed base, and improved competitiveness for new business. In 2013, we continue to invest heavily in our core revenue cycle solutions and further differentiate and integrate clinical and financial platforms. Examples include advancements in computer-assisted coding and population analytics capabilities that enable aggregation of both clinical and financial data sets and support outcome-based reimbursement models.","Our third area of focus in 2013 is continued investment in population health. We have been investing in elements of population health for several years, and we increased that investment in 2012. Our clients are now committed to population health and are looking to us for solutions. We're going to increase our investment in population health and build a comprehensive platform that will clearly -- that will be clearly differentiated and superior to the current piecemeal approach that is evolving in the market today.","I believe these areas of focus and investment in 2013 will have a very positive impact on our competitiveness. By strengthening our physician and revenue cycle capabilities and advancing our population health platform, we will widen competitive advantage and expose the weaknesses of our primary competitor. We refer to these areas of focus as PPR: physician, population and revenue cycle. Jeff will detail additional initiatives that overlay PPR in his comments.","In summary, I am extremely pleased with our execution in 2012 and believe we will create significant differentiation in 2013 that will position us to continue our strong growth through this decade.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeffrey A. Townsend","Thanks, Mike. Today, I will build on comments Zane and Mike have shared, recapping our 2012 efforts around population health, as well as outline the next wave of strategic priorities being embedded into our focus for 2013.","In 2012, we made good progress at advancing elements I view as foundational to population health. These early accomplishments already differentiate Cerner. We advanced adoption of our Healthe Intent platform, with Chart Search adoption exceeding half of our client base and the adoption of our sepsis cloud-based algorithm accelerating and driving more widespread proof points where clients are significantly reducing sepsis mortality rates. Both of these initiatives have produced deep, rich understanding of the opportunities and innovations ahead as we innovate in a post-digitized EMR era.","A highlight of 2012 was the launch of our partnership with Advocate Health Care that has quickly led to joint development of a predictive agent for readmissions that has demonstrated a 20% to 30% improvement in predictive power as compared to the majority of existing models. We continue to see significant potential from working side-by-side with one of the most advanced population health organizations in the country.","The portfolio of solutions that support our population health initiatives had a very strong year in 2012. Our Cerner Network interoperability and HIE offerings, which support data liquidity, grew by more than 50%, and our Lighthouse Enterprise Data Warehousing and Quality solutions grew more than 20%. We also advanced our patient portal platform, PHR solutions and employer wellness offerings.","In addition to the PPR focus that Mike shared, we have added initiatives we refer to as CIM+1, representing the continuum of care, intelligence, the member and personalized medicine.","The C represents the continuum of care, focusing on a level or coordination and collaboration across all venues of clinical interaction. As part of this focus, we recently aligned additional groups under the population health umbrella, including home care, long-term care, retail pharmacy, research, workforce management and healthy athlete. By bringing these groups together, along with our existing quality, network, employer and consumer-focused innovations, we have created more focus on the entire continuum of care, allowing for new health and care delivery models to emerge beyond today's silo-based orientations. We think this is a very strategic direction that will leapfrog us ahead of traditional delivery models as we support emerging models of medical homes, chronic condition management and at risk for health business models.","Moving on to intelligence. We have continued to expand both our Millennium and Healthe Intent platforms to embed more sophisticated decision support within the workflow and data management layers of the architecture. Last quarter, we announced a clinical programming language called Synapse, which creates agents within the Healthe Intent operating system to trigger and coordinate health care programs across a population. In 2013, bringing the smart elements of population health inside the day-to-day workflows of both the physician and continuum of care efforts will emerge as a significant differentiation for those organizations focused on taking the variance out of care delivery. As more and more of the revenue cycle aligns with Value-Based Purchasing and outcome objectives, the ability to programmatically manage evidence-based care across a delivery system will be critical for those organizations taking on more risk.","The third of the layered initiatives is for member. Similar to the objectives around the continuum of care, the role of the individual and their family will be represented across the breadth of solutions. As new delivery models are emerging, the majority of them are designing beyond the boundaries of a patient to include a more lasting relationship before and after care is needed. The ability for the platform to know me is not only differentiating as organizations compete in their markets but is also fundamental to the ability to apply contextual intelligence to their individual needs.","Last is the +1, representing personalized medicine and the inclusion of the genome in the life cycle of individualized diagnosis and treatment. Cerner invested in this area early on with Millennium Helix and is now seeing an acceleration of bench to bedside activity as the procedure costs continue to drop. Much like the other initiatives, this too becomes a fundamental component of the broader platform to apply across the operating system for population health, well ahead of the marketplace.","Before closing, I'd like to discuss the importance of data liquidity as we've been increasingly vocal around our support for interoperability and the importance this will have on realizing the benefits of a digital health economy. As part of our commitment to universal data liquidity, Cerner has contributed tens of thousands of lines of open-source software, personnel and money towards the development of the Direct Project, which is a standards-based method for electronic sharing of encrypted health information. Going forward, we believe the industry needs to continue to step up to the challenges of interoperability, including the patient identification. We need to set aside the admittedly tough politics of this issue and do what is right for the health care consumer.","For the level of care coordination we envision in the future, comprehensive health data should be available in a secure and trusted manner to patients and providers regardless of where care occurs, and provider access to this data must be built into EHR technologies and available for use by a broad range of health care providers and the patients they serve.","In closing, this decade offers us the chance to put a true system in the health care. Some of our competitors argue we're moving too fast and that Meaningful Use is too complicated. We believe we cannot move fast enough, and the complexity is the nature of our industry. In our view, the pace of change is exposing vulnerabilities of our competitors' platforms and their inability to adapt to increasingly complex requirements. We believe this rising bar of industry requirements will play to our advantage, and our investments in 2013 are focused in areas that will ensure we continue to widen this differentiation.","With that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ryan Daniels with William Blair.","Ryan Daniels - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","A lot of conversation tonight about population health and kind of the changing end market environment and how that positions you competitively. Can you talk about, as you look at the pipeline, if that's manifesting solely in a higher win rate today on new accounts or if you're actually starting to see some competitive displacements enter that pipeline at this point?","Zane M. Burke","This is Zane, Ryan. What we are seeing is a bit of both of that, and what it is, is it's the vision for population health as we talk about a full operating system for our population health model. And we have a robust business today in the population health space but -- in terms of HIE and in terms of some of the analytics that we do today. But it's really the vision that we're taking them on, and we're seeing that in the win rates increasing, as well as we see that manifesting in the pipeline itself.","Ryan Daniels - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Given the investments that some of these larger systems have made with your primary competitor, is there anything you can do to make it more palatable to switch over? Or is it certain -- just going to be the urgency of the need for kind of better platforms and more data liquidity in the future that forces that move even if they sunk a lot of money into the system?","Zane M. Burke","The short answer is, there's never going to be a great time to switch, but there's not an opportunity to stand fast either because they are forced to make changes because of the -- the penalties are so great. I'm not really speaking about the Meaningful Use penalties as much as I think about the changes in their reimbursement environment. From a quality perspective and otherwise, the cost of these systems are insignificant in relation to the challenges they are faced from a reimbursement perspective overall around quality.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Marc, I was wondering if maybe you could just give us a little bit more color on some of the bookings in the fourth quarter. I think you talked about 10 deals being greater than $17 million, and I think you specifically called out the L.A. Department of Health. Can you give us maybe just a little more color around that relationship? And do you see other opportunities similar to that with other government-type relationships?","Zane M. Burke","This is Zane. So I'll answer, Lisa. Obviously, the L.A. Department of Health relationship is -- we've got a very strong client footprint in Southern California and a very active network there and have had a lot of success in that marketplace overall. And that's been an opportunity we've been working on for several years. There is -- the public health overall has the same challenges and needs that overall health care has. They've got to go and solve these broader problems around managing the population. In fact, they have the bigger impetus. And so I think there is a bigger marketplace both in the local marketplace, as well as the state and federal levels, for the types of technologies that we deliver and offer to provide value. And we see that as a market opportunity for us moving forward.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And Zane, just a follow-up on that. Is there another technology that's in there today and so you're coming in and you're replacing it, and that's going to be the opportunity for Cerner? Or is it that when you think about these public health entities, they have no technology at all today and it's a matter of convincing them that they need to move in that direction as the world just evolve?","Zane M. Burke","It's a combination of both, Lisa. It's -- in the case of L.A. County, there has a lot of replacement technology engaged in that situation. At the state level, they are in need of technology. They're in need of thinking about this -- about solving the problems they're faced in -- they're facing in a different way. And so -- and I would say that also applies at the federal government level. So those are net new technology areas.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And I think it started out by saying this was clearly part of one of the larger deals that you signed. Can you give us any other incremental color on some of the larger deals that you signed and your bookings in the fourth quarter? And I'll stop there.","Marc G. Naughton","Lisa, it's Marc. Basically, we had good segmentation of larger deals. As we said, the numbers were similar to what you would have seen. In the year-ago quarter, probably had 4 of them that were over $40 million. And so we had some significant transactions. I think the interesting thing to me was we had very strong representation in our hosting business. So something that we've kind of taken for granted that makes up one of the components of our longer-term bookings. And a quarter where we didn't have any RevWorks or ITWorks, we still delivered strong longer-term bookings because of some of these new relationships also adopting hosting as part of the overall view of operating Cerner Solutions. So I think that's probably the color I would add.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dave Windley with Jefferies & Company.","David H. Windley - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","So to follow up on the bookings, you said, I think, in the fourth quarter, your long term was 33%. It's run around 30%. Is your expectation that it will continue to run around 30%? Or would some Works contracts kind of catch up here in the absence -- and the fact that you didn't have one in the fourth quarter, will we see works get heavier and maybe drive the percentage up?","Marc G. Naughton","Yes, this is Marc. I think the last 2 years, you've seen our long-term bookings kind of be in the 30% to low 30%. I don't know that there's anything that we see in the pipeline that's going to materially change that. The ITWorks and the RevWorks bookings are good-sized deals, but there's -- they kind of are in our pipeline that roll out over a period of time. I don't know that we expect to see a flurry of them land in any single quarter. Certainly, if we did, we would give you some notice of that. But I think we're continuing to see that mix as we expect to continue growing bookings overall. I think the percent of those bookings in the long term will remain fairly consistent.","David H. Windley - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And that segued nicely into my next question, which is, your views for bookings growth for 2013, your first quarter in which arguably is your toughest comp, your guidance suggests a mid-teens bookings growth. Is that directionally how we should be thinking for the full year in light of comps kind getting easier? Or do the law of large numbers start to catch up with you over $1 billion?","Marc G. Naughton","Yes, this is Marc. Yes, comps are getting easier when we just booked a billion-dollar quarter. I'm not sure that those are -- if that would be the way, I would phrase it. As we do any time, the more detailed bookings guidance we can provide is on a quarter-by-quarter basis. We certainly expect to grow bookings in 2013 over 2012. I think that's consistent with what we said on our last call. I can't quantify that, but certainly, our guidance in Q1 would support that statement we made a quarter ago.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Stockton with Wells Fargo.","Jamie Stockton - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I guess maybe, Marc, the first question, just to follow up on the composition of bookings. You mentioned that remote hosting or remote services had a good quarter. Was there maybe a good-sized deal in the U.K. as you're renewing those relationships that contributed during the quarter or something like that?","Marc G. Naughton","Jamie, there's nothing in the U.K. that was a contributor to our -- to the big deals that we talked about, certainly, the 4 over $40 million.","Jamie Stockton - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then, I don't know, Zane or Mike, whoever wants to take this. I think for the last couple of years, you guys have signed a few Works deals in the third quarter, and I was just wondering if there was anything different that's developing today. I know that you spoke to the fact that the pipeline seems to be pretty robust. But to go from 3 last year to none in the fourth quarter this year, I was just curious if there was any change in the marketplace that would have been driving that or is it just purely a sense of timing?","Zane M. Burke","This is -- Jamie, this is Zane. It's purely a sense of timing. We see this as a great opportunity for us on both the RevWorks and the ITWorks side of the house, and we anticipate continued performance on both of those businesses. As you look at them on an annual basis, they tend to be a little bit lumpier because, again, it's a small number of transactions that get completed. As you might understand, they have quite a bit of process to them. And so we manage them very closely. We see a great amount of pipeline and feel very good about both those businesses. But we -- I anticipate continued -- a little bit of lumpiness just because of the nature of the types of contracts and transactions that they are.","Jamie Stockton - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Do you expect ICD-10 to drive a big acceleration for RevWorks in 2013? Or I guess maybe I should just say, do you think that there's a better chance of seeing a real inflection point in that business?","Zane M. Burke","I think the inflection points are really based on our performance. So more so than the ICD-10, which there will be additional work around that and whether that yields itself in full RevWorks out -- full outsourcing, there's additional services work that we certainly will see as a result of that. But I think what we believe will drive a bigger, higher percentage of growth is the sustained performance that we're having and experiencing with our existing clients today. And as that story becomes much more broadly understood, I think that will continue to drive bookings in a better way.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of George Hill with Citigroup.","George Hill - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I've got a question for Neal, if he's still on the line. Neal, business continues to chug along extremely strong. I'm just interested in the types of conversations that you're having with customers and having with counter-parties in this space. We read about your testimony down in D.C., Cerner moving from a position of vendor to thought leader in this space. I guess I would like your characterization of what you see is the opportunity both near term and medium term as based upon what you're working on.","Neal L. Patterson","George, I'm not sure that testimony I gave was actually going to change the perception of the marketplace with regard to Cerner, but I was very candid as always there. And broadly, I think the conversations I'm having in the marketplace are kind of reflective of how the marketplace is becoming basically -- there's a choice between 2 companies, and we certainly positioned ourselves and always have been as been one of the major innovators in this industry or the innovator in this industry, actually. So the number of those very broad conversations is increasing on my calendar, both as our current clients, as well as prospective clients. So it's a very good time.","George Hill - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And I guess maybe just a quick follow-up then for Marc. I guess can you walk us through again given the L.A. deal that was signed and the strength of the bookings in the quarter? What are we seeing with respect to how new business is booked and goes into the backlog and goes into revenue recognition? And I guess I'm just trying to understand, are we seeing a slower pull-through of the software revenue recognition as we're waiting for some of these customers to get deployed and go live? And I guess I just -- I would have expected to see more revenue pull through in the quarter from such strong bookings, from such a large deal like L.A. Maybe just walk us through that again for our benefit.","Zane M. Burke","This is Zane. As it relates to L.A. County and without divulging any of the confidentiality pieces of that, oftentimes, in government situations, you have many more milestone-based type arrangements. And so I do think it's a bit unique in that regard in that you have a longer-term process. And so I think that's part of what you're seeing in that particular situation.","George Hill - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then maybe -- well, just one more. Was that milestone-based process, was that part of your competitive ability to win? Was that something that you offered that competitor did not?","Zane M. Burke","No, that's part of dealing with a governmental entity. You're going to have that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sean Wieland with Piper Jaffray.","Sean W. Wieland - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","I want to squeeze in a couple of questions around your data and analytics initiatives, maybe what I'd call your Big Data initiatives. Can you quantify what level of R&D investment is going into these programs? Tell us what the technology platform is that you're using to deliver the new initiatives and what's the revenue model for the business?","Marc G. Naughton","This is Marc. Relative to the investment, I mean, it's kind of when you're certainly utilizing the Millennium platform for a lot of this and other platforms as well. The teams that are created to go pursue a lot of these innovation aren't large teams. It's more of a matter of the entire community of development that we work through. So I think from an economic standpoint, it's certainly part of our increased R&D investment that we talked about, that you saw us do in 2012 and you'll see us do again in 2013 as we push hard to get through some innovation projects that will position us well going to '14 and beyond. But Jeff, [indiscernible].","Jeffrey A. Townsend","Yes. So I'd probably put our Big Data efforts into 3 buckets. One, we've talked about for a very long time is our Health Facts data repository, which has 35-some-odd million patients covered over more than 10 years now. So you're accounting in a billions of rows type of metaphor there, which we use a fair amount in creating or validating published evidence. So as I mentioned, the readmission project with Advocate, we would have taken publicly available guidelines, validated those guidelines against that large database and then begin to develop new algorithms. So we have that as our backdrop. I think the other thing that's unique as we talk about population health is we don't look at Big Data as purely a repository to go run reports and do analysis off of. We look at that as a live, interactive environment that is capable of real-time decision support. So as we talk about things like sepsis, it is a very large database with lots of data sources hitting and, at the same time, constantly being monitored against health programs as we define it. And then the third area, as Marc kind of hit on, is purely the big -- is what we call Cerner Math. So that is discovering using mathematical techniques that other industries use heavily, especially in the financial area, to find patterns in the data that may not be current evidence to attempt to then convert that into executable knowledge.","Sean W. Wieland - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","That all sounds great. Can you just comment on the revenue or the business model behind this?","Jeffrey A. Townsend","The business model will vary there from a -- some of these capabilities are your traditional licensed software. So a client is buying an enterprise data warehouse with platform on top of it, and they're driving things like quality measures. Other elements in there will include things like our Lighthouse quality reporting initiatives, which is more around standardized mandates. And then the third around things like readmissions and new algorithms would be things that we would push out on more of a subscription basis. From a roll-up, I think we have it in here the number kind of broadly across that umbrella of the population health. Marc probably has the number in front of him.","Marc G. Naughton","Yes, I mean, right now, that business is about $150 million business for us from a revenue perspective as we continue to evolve and to kind of consolidate things into that space. We kind of expect it to be quickly a $300 million business, with some of that being existing businesses that we roll in, some of it being growth. So it's -- the big business model is stuff that we're still working on. So the true population health management, logically, it feels like it's going to be a per member per month so it aligns with the entities that -- how the entities are getting paid that are going to utilize these solutions. But that actually -- that's still to be determined at this point.","Jeffrey A. Townsend","Yes, the triggering event for that is when our clients begin taking more risk, and that's how they're getting paid, then you'll see our business model shift that way. But in the early stages of the experimentation of ACOs and the startup-type risk initiatives, it's a little bit more of a traditional model.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette with UBS.","Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So just a big picture question on competitive landscape. It seems like based on some recent channel checks, it's been growing feedback that some of your largest competitors are not succeeding in larger RFPs because of long lead times for implementation. So I guess just generally speaking, when we think about Cerner's implementation times on key product offerings, especially as it relates to Meaningful Use Stage 2, do you think this is accelerating as a variable for you to exploit as an advantage in RFPs over the next year or so?","Zane M. Burke","This is Zane. That's probably not the primary driver in the competitive side of this. I do think there are -- there certainly are -- there's a lot of work for people I refer to as a full employment act for health care IT professionals. So there is a ton of things to get accomplished, and our clients are faced with all sorts of mandates. And so staffing is certainly a consideration for many. We are well-prepared in that space to deliver, and we've proven over time that we know how to scale and grow in a different way. And that is one of the capabilities we provide. And so it's a level of confidence that our clients and prospects have in what we do that perhaps -- that others don't have some of those capabilities and operating efficiencies. But it's not the primary driver.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Halper with Lazard Capital Markets.","Steven P. Halper - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Marc, specifically, regarding your commentary on margins, I know the goal had been to increase margins 100 to 200 basis points, and we understand the impact of lower margin device resale and the absolute operating profit being better than expected. But are you backing down from that goal for 2013?","Marc G. Naughton","Well, Steve, I think the way I would state the goal, which is pretty consistent, I think, with what it's been is that we're going -- we expect and our guidance would reflect that we're going to drive greater than 100 basis points growth in 2013. So the impact of the significant increase in the hardware, as you mentioned, the devices that hit us in 2012 certainly made growing the percent of operating margin more challenging. But now that, that's normalized into the income statement, I think you'll see us be able to continue growing overall businesses, especially those businesses that are higher margin such as software. Zane gave an example of some contracts where some of that software is going into backlog, probably more than you might have seen us in the past. So we have actually software coming out of the backlog, which is high margin, something we wouldn't have seen 3 or 4 years ago. So we still, based on our guidance, based on our plans, would indicate that we'd expect to exceed 100 basis points. We wouldn't necessarily cap it at 200 basis points. But I think exceeding the 100 basis points is a consistent message with what we've been saying and reflective of what our guidance is.","Steven P. Halper - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Good. And then, Zane, just quickly, could you talk to some of the success that you might have had in the small hospital market in the last quarter or so?","Zane M. Burke","Sure, Steve. We did actually have some good success in our community works offering and actually are nearing 50 clients in that space. We had a couple of significant competitive wins over both the EPIC extensions, as well as the other principal competitors in this space. And so we actually see this as a very robust market for us.","Steven P. Halper - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Great. And are these wins replacements or new opportunities?","Zane M. Burke","Most often, they have some sort of technology in place.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of David Larsen with Leerink Swann.","David Larsen - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","As far as your base goes, is it fair to say that 85% are at Stage 1 as of now?","Marc G. Naughton","Yes, I think the -- if you look at -- based on the timing of attestations, when that comes up, by the end of Q1, 85% of our base will have completed the attestation process, the rest of them scheduled to occur in '13.","David Larsen - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","And then when we say 30% of bookings are from outside the Millennium base, are these typically hospitals that went with a competing vendor? They thought that vendor was going to bring them through Stage 1, and then they're now switching. Is that -- are those mainly Meaningful Use replacement wins, that 30% outside Millennium?","Zane M. Burke","They are typically a replacement of some sort of existing technology. And so as we think about it, it's really creating the platform for the future, which does include some of the Meaningful Use elements. But most clients are really looking at what they need to operate in a future environment around ACO initiatives, around bundled payments, et cetera. Meaningful Use is just another one of those elements that they have to factor into the mix.","David Larsen - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just lastly, the licensed software number, $345 million, up 6% year-over-year. I mean, is that 6% growth rate in 2013, is that a reasonable estimate going forward as well?","Marc G. Naughton","Yes. We don't really guide to the components of the income statement, but we are expecting bookings to grow. So you would expect elements on the income statement to grow as well.","David Larsen - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Okay. Great. And then if I can, just 1 more. As far as your rev cycle deals go, is there any way to size sort of what portion of the bookings those were in the quarter? It sounds like you've got the full solution set: acute care, ambulatory, post-acute. You've got the whole spectrum for population health management. Within that $1 billion of bookings, any way to size sort of what portion are tied to rev cycle? I'll stop there.","Marc G. Naughton","Well, clearly, we indicated that for RevWorks, which are bigger outsourcing-type deals, that there were none in Q4 for that. Relative to rev cycle and overall revenues, it would have been a normal component, along with our other solutions. Zane, do you have any other color on that?","Zane M. Burke","The other color I'd add is most new business includes revenue cycle as part of that. So you can pretty much look at the 35% of bookings. Of our new business bookings in the quarter, that revenue cycle was a key contributor as part of that process.","Marc G. Naughton","Appreciate -- this is Marc. Thanks, everyone, for being on the call with us. We expect to have a very solid 2013. We're very pleased with our 2012 results. We continue to enjoy being a company who's innovating and moving forward in a sector that seems to be very concerned about trying to deliver things that are in the rearview mirror for us. So with that, I bid you good afternoon. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

Today's date is August 2, 2018, and this call is being recorded.","The company has asked me to remind you that various remarks made here today constitute forward-looking statements, including without limitation, those regarding projections of future revenues or earnings, operating margins, operating and capital expenses, bookings, solution, services and new offering development and future business outlook, including new markets or prospects for the company's solutions and services.

Cerner assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information except as required by law.","At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Marc Naughton, Chief Financial Officer of Cerner Corporation.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Thank you, Shannon. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the call. I'll start with a review of our numbers. Zane Burke, our President, will follow me with results, highlights, and marketplace observations. Then Brent Shafer, our Chairman and CEO, will provide closing comments.","Turning to our results, overall we had a solid Q2, with all key metrics coming in at or above our expected results. Our bookings in Q2 were $1.775 billion, which reflects a 9% increase over $1.636 billion in Q2 of 2017. This is well above the guided range we provided, largely due to the initial task orders for the Veterans Affairs contract that was announced in May. Note that while the total contract opportunity is $10 billion over 10 years, the impact to our bookings, revenue, and earnings will be phased in over time as individual task orders are executed during the various phases of the process.","With the initial task order signed in Q2, we expect to receive the expected contributions from the contract in the second year that we discussed on our last call. (2:18) revenue backlog of $14.79 billion. Recall from our Q1 earnings discussion that the backlog calculations changed with our adoption of the new revenue standard, so it is not comparable to prior-year periods.","Revenue in the quarter was $1.368 billion, which is up 6% over Q2 of 2017 and above the high end of our guidance range.","I'll now go through the business model detail and year-over-year growth compared to Q2 of 2017. Licensed software revenue was $172 million, up 11%, primarily due to strong licensed software bookings in the quarter. Tech resale increased 3% to $75 million. Subscriptions revenue was $83 million in Q2 of 2018, down from $119 million in Q2 of 2017, but up 8% from $77 million in Q1 of 2018. Recall our comments last quarter that subscriptions were impacted by our adoption of the new revenue standard, which reduced subscription backlog and also led us to classifying a portion of subscription revenue as support.","Professional services revenue grew 13% to $447 million, driven largely by growth in our Works businesses. Managed services increased 9% to $286 million. Support maintenance was up 7% to $279 million, reflecting our expected low single-digit growth plus the previously discussed impact of the new revenue standard. And finally, reimbursed travel was $25 million, which is down 5%.","Looking at revenue by geographic segment, domestic revenue was up 4% from the year-ago quarter at $1.202 billion and non-U.S. revenue of $166 million increased 22% from the year-ago quarter.","Moving to gross margin, our gross margin for Q2 was 82.5% which is up from 82.1% in Q1 of 2018, but down slightly from 82.7% a year ago.","Now I'll discuss spending, operating margin, and net earnings. For these items, we provide both GAAP and adjusted or non-GAAP results. The adjusted results exclude share-based compensation expenses, share-based compensation permanent tax items, and acquisition-related adjustments. All is detailed and reconciled to GAAP in our earnings release.","Looking at operating spending, our second quarter GAAP operating expenses of $921 million were up 12% compared to $820 million in the year-ago period. Adjusted operating expenses were $873 million, which is up 13% compared to $771 million in Q2 of 2017.","Looking at the line items, sales and client service expense increased 14% over Q2 of 2017. This increase was primarily driven by an increase in personnel expense related to our services businesses, including the hiring of Adventist Health revenue cycle staff and hiring additional revenue cycle staff in Kansas City. Software development expense increased 18%, driven by an (5:11) percent increase in gross R&D, a 26% increase in amortization, and 4% less capitalized (5:20). G&A expense was up 4% and amortization of acquisition-related intangibles decreased 53% year over year.","Moving to operating margins, our GAAP operating margin was 15.2% compared to 19.3% in the year-ago period. And our adjusted operating margin was 18.7%, down from 23%. The year-over-year decline in operating margin is consistent with our guidance, which reflects items we have discussed, including the higher growth of non-cash expenses, investments in our Works businesses, and an increased mix of Works revenue. We do continue to believe that many of these factors are temporary in nature and that we can begin to expand margins in 2019.","Moving to net earnings and EPS, our GAAP net earnings in Q2 were $169 million, or $0.51 per diluted share, compared to $0.53 in Q2 of 2017. Adjusted net earnings in Q2 were $207 million, and adjusted diluted EPS was $0.62 compared to $0.61 in Q2 of 2017. Our GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 21%. Our non-GAAP tax rate was also 21%, which is slightly below our tax rate in Q1.","We'll move to our balance sheet. We ended Q2 with $1.004 billion of cash and investments which is down from $1.093 billion in Q1 of 2018, primarily due to the use of cash for our stock repurchase program. During the quarter we repurchased 4 million shares of stock at an average price of $58.75 per share, for a total of $200 million. We currently have $639 million of remaining authorization under our repurchase program after our board increased the authorization amount by $500 million in May.","Moving to debt, our total debt including capital lease obligations was $441 million, which was down from $446 million in Q1 of 2018.","Total receivables at the end of the quarter were $1.152 billion, up from $1.041 billion in Q1 of 2018. Our Q2 DSO was 77 days, which is up from 73 days in both the year-ago period and Q1 of 2018.","Operating cash flow for the quarter was $300 million. Q2 capital expenditures were $109 million. Capitalized software was $69 million. Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less capital purchases and capitalized software development costs, was $121 million for the quarter. We continue to expect strong operating cash flow for the year to more than offset the increase in capital expenditures leading to another year of strong free cash flow.","Now I'll go through guidance. We expect revenue in Q3 to be between $1.335 billion and $1.385 billion, with the $1.360 billion midpoint reflecting growth of 7% over Q3 of 2017. For the year, we continue to expect revenue between $5.325 billion and $5.45 billion, with the $5.388 billion midpoint reflecting 4.8% growth over 2017. We expect Q3 adjusted diluted EPS to be $0.62 to $0.64 per share. The $0.63 midpoint is $0.02 higher than Q3 of 2017. Note that while consensus EPS for the year is in line with our annual guidance midpoint, consensus estimates reflect a different quarterly ramp. So our Q3 guidance range is below the current Q3 consensus. For the full year, we continue to expect diluted EPS to be $2.45 to $2.55, with the $2.50 midpoint reflecting 5% growth over 2017.","Moving to bookings guidance, we expect bookings revenue in Q3 of $1.45 billion to $1.65 billion. The $1.55 billion midpoint reflects a 40% increase compared to Q3 of 2017, which was our lowest bookings quarter of 2017.","In summary, we are pleased with our solid performance in Q2 and our outlook for the rest of the year.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Zane.","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","Thanks, Marc. Good afternoon, everyone. Today I'll provide color on our results and make some marketplace observations.","I'll start with bookings, which grew 9% from Q2 of 2017 and was well above our guidance range. In Q2 the percent of bookings coming from long-term contracts was in the normal range at 35%. Multiple large transactions contributed to our bookings this quarter, with a record seven contracts over $75 million.","We're also pleased with the quarter from a new business standpoint, with 31% of bookings coming from outside our core Millennium install base, including a noteworthy win at a large academic medical center. This quarter included broad contributions across several areas that reflect the diversity of our offerings and end markets. We had good results from almost all our solution and service categories, large and small clients, U.S. and non-U.S. geographies.","Starting with smaller venues of care, our ambulatory business had a strong quarter, driven by ongoing penetration in the ambulatory settings of our large health system clients as well as adding a large independent provider. In the small hospital market, our CommunityWorks organization continues to execute well, with whole new footprints and delivering strong sales back into our base.","Moving to revenue cycle, we had a good quarter, driven by (10:48) inclusion in many new EHR business and selling to our base, as our existing clients continue to migrate from legacy systems to Cerner Millennium. Operationally, we are seeing early returns on enhancements we had made to our revenue cycle implementation methodology. Our approach includes more upfront assessments to identify potential implementation challenges, an enhanced pre-project design approach, conversion readiness assessments, and post-go lab monitoring and transition services.","We also had good contributions from Cerner ITWorks, including a new ITWorks client, scope expansion with existing clients, and good sales back into our ITWorks space. We have a strong outlook for the rest of the year with several more ITWorks contracts forecasted.","Next I'd like to provide an update on our federal business, starting with the Department of Defense MHS Genesis project. The optimization efforts we have discussed have led to many improvements in access and efficiency at our initial sites, and we remain on track to begin the next wave of implementations later this year. In addition, DoD announced last week that they are increasing the contract ceiling for MHS Genesis by $1.2 billion to include the Coast Guard and expand the scope of solutions and services.","Moving to the Department of Veterans Affairs, as Marc mentioned, we signed a contract in May with the VA as the prime contractor to replace the Vista system with one built off of the EHR we are deploying across the military health system. With VA managing one of the largest healthcare systems in the country, we believe there is great potential for a broad industry impact. At the core of this project, Cerner will enable seamless care through a single system that links both veteran populations totaling more than 18 million people, while also delivering a national interoperability to the commercial market. This will allow patient data to be shared between VA, DoD, and community providers through a secure system.","We also expect to accelerate our efforts in population health, open platforms, and telehealth, all of which have relevance to our commercial client base. We view this opportunity as a great honor, and we're well positioned to successfully deliver based on our experience with the Department of Defense project, our own delivery capabilities, and capable partners.","Moving to our business outside the U.S., we had another strong quarter with 22% revenue growth. Bookings were also a highlight, with noteworthy contributions from the Middle East and UK. Looking ahead, we can expect to have a good second half of the year, with Australia, Canada, Middle East, and Europe all forecasted to provide solid contributions to our growth.","The last topic I'd like to cover is population health and our recently announced collaboration with Lumeris. We had strong sales of HealtheIntent solutions to both new and existing clients in Q2. There continues to be steady progress towards value-based care models, which is a key driver of our population health sales. We also continue to have success at selling HealtheIntent to clients that aren't yet fully moving to value-based care models because of the platform's ability to help clients offer fee-for-service models while also preparing them for the shift to value-based care.","Now I'd like to tell you a little bit more about what we're doing with Lumeris, which we believe will strengthen and expand the scope of our offerings and contribute meaningfully to our longer-term growth. Lumeris is (13:58) company with a consistently highly rated Medicare Advantage plan, a proven methodology to help leading health providers advance value-based care strategies, and the subject matter expertise required to support those efforts.","We're launching an EHR-agnostic offering with Lumeris called Maestro Advantage. That will be designed to help health systems set up and manage Medicare Advantage plans, provider-sponsored health plans, and other risk-based arrangements. Additionally, Lumeris will adopt Cerner's HealtheIntent as the platform for its clinical methodology and advanced analytics, which will be the core to the operating model for Maestro Advantage to help drive better patient outcomes and lower costs of care.","We believe this offering, which will combine solutions and services from Cerner and Lumeris, will be differentiated in the market in several ways. We believe it will be the most comprehensive technology and service offering that leverages the experience of a proven 4.5-star Medicare Advantage plan. It will provide connectivity across the provider health plan and consumer, and will be designed to improve outcomes and lower costs by embedding actual insights into the provider workflow.","It will include a unique accountable care clinical model that supports a health system's development of a high-performing integrated delivery network and shared savings with providers through value-based incentive alignment. And finally, this offering is differentiated by Lumeris's long-term strategic partnership with Mutual of Omaha to deploy Medicare Advantage plans nationally utilizing Lumeris's collaborative payer model and Mutual of Omaha's marketing, distribution and funding.","While there's a lot of work ahead to realize the potential of the Cerner-Lumeris collaboration, the value proposition at the outset is high. For Lumeris, that means aligning an industry-leading technology partner that can bring national scale to their (15:40). It also gives access to our leading health system client base increasingly looking to Medicare Advantage as part of their value-based care strategies.","For Cerner, we gain a partner with a 4.5-star Medicare Advantage plan to build out the end-to-end capabilities required to run a provider health plan within HealtheIntent, the opportunity to be a larger participant in the per-member per-month [PMPM] economics in the provider-sponsored health plan space, and a new point of marketing non-Millennium leading health systems.","As most of you know, a major trend playing out on the provider supply side of healthcare is the creation of MSA-level health networks to advance existing and new business models. We believe Cerner is uniquely positioned to activate these intelligent health networks at a national level. With this collaboration, we are taking another step towards fulfilling Cerner's long-held desire to be a change agent within the traditional U.S. payment model, which we believe is filled with hundreds of billions of dollars of inefficiencies and massive consumer dissatisfaction. If we deliver on a better provider and consumer experience, we will disrupt a category in significant need of change.","Lastly, I wanted to highlight that this relationship also includes Cerner acquiring a minority interest in Lumeris's parent company, Essence Group Holdings Corporation, for $266 million. We believe this is a good use of capital, as the relationship and investment speeds our entry into tech-enabled services related to the value-based care, broadens our population health offering, and increases our addressable market.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Brent.","Brent Shafer - Cerner Corp.","Thank you, Zane. Good afternoon, I'm going to offer some closing observations on the second quarter on Cerner as a whole and on our recently announced collaboration and investment in the Medicare Advantage space.","Over the course of the last 90 days, I've had the opportunity to spend time with over 100 health system CEOs, including many at our annual CEO event. It's been a chance to listen. While health system CEOs are (17:33) unique issues in their respective markets and organizations, there are definitely some common themes. They're looking to grow key service lines, drive operational efficiencies on the expense line in order to make money at Medicare rates, and to navigate the uncertainties of risk-based contracting. They believe technology and data-driven process change are critical success factors, and they see Cerner as a critical partner for success.","While I don't have all the answers two quarters into my tenure, there are a set of things I know will be core to Cerner's success in the years to come. We are going to be obsessively focused on our clients' success. We will develop solutions that deliver the best possible experiences and outcomes. We will continue to be a transformative growth company focused on delivering on the top and bottom line.","Our leadership team isn't content with where healthcare is today, and we see opportunities for Cerner to make it better. We have a growing, diverse client base. We have a suite of technologies and services to solve provider business challenges. We have an amazing culture filled with tens of thousands of talented associates with ambitions to take Cerner well beyond the scope of where our business is today.","In my conversations over the last several weeks, I've been struck by the number of CEOs that have mentioned our collaboration and investment in Lumeris. They're excited to see us partner with an organization that has a 4.5-star Medicare Advantage plan. They're pleased our HealtheIntent platform will be core to the operating model for the combined market offering. And they're excited about the leverage they'll get from their existing Millennium investment as they build out their value-based care strategies.","We are in an enviable position with a balance sheet that allows us to invest for success in the current EHR market while also investing in new markets beyond it. Based on the ongoing work we've been doing as a leadership team to assess the marketplace and growth opportunities, I believe we will identify other opportunities to deploy capital in ways that support our growth strategies. I believe this deployment of capital along with our ongoing share repurchase program represents a balanced approach to capital deployment that supports our long-term growth while also adding value to shareholders in the near term. And I want to congratulate our team on a solid second quarter.","And I'll now turn the call over to Marc and the moderator.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","I think we're ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great, good evening, thanks for the question. Marc, you mentioned the bookings coming largely above the guidance range, driven from the VA. Can you maybe just share a little bit more context on how the bookings fared outside the VA? I'm just curious maybe where you saw traction away from that key client.","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","Robert, this is Zane. I'll take it and let Marc clean up my story here but what I'll first say is without the VA, we finished just above the highest end of the range without the VA. So we saw incredibly strong growth across global, across our population health solutions, and our core EHR marketplace both with a significant win at the academic side, as I mentioned in my prepared comments, as well as in our community offerings, so broad-based with that. We had our ITWorks clients that did well, this client as well as additional rev cycle in the RevWorks business. So we saw broad-based elements both globally and here at home in the U.S.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great, thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Matthew Gillmor with Robert Baird. Your line is open.","Matthew D. Gillmor - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hey, thanks for the question. I wanted to ask about the margin outlook and some of the comments Marc made, and I was hoping you could get us oriented for 2019. With the headwinds impacting the margins this year, is there an opportunity for you to be above the high end of the 30 to 60 bps range, or would you encourage us to stay within that range?","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","This is Marc. Obviously for 2019, we're just starting the planning process for that year, so it's a little early to provide anything that's more granular. Relative to that, I think we've talked about the ability that once we get through this significant investment year to be able to look at 30 to 60 basis points growth beginning in 2019, while certainly our starting point for that growth is going to be a little bit (22:40) where it was in the beginning of the year. That's our best view. Obviously, we'll update that in the Q3 call when we start getting into the first returns on our 2019 plan. But at this point, I would still hold it in the 30 to 60 basis points range until we can give you a little bit more visibility.","Matthew D. Gillmor - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Got it, and one quick follow-up. When do you expect the next task order for either the VA or the DoD? I'm just trying to understand when that will hit bookings next.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","We'll try to give you some visibility to the extent we can, but those task orders we've got \u2013 the first set of task orders, that usually carries you forward for a little while. So it will be dependent on the projects and when the next set of services and solutions need to be delivered. So that's about all we can provide for a view on that.","Matthew D. Gillmor - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Got it, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Lisa C. Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks very much. Just going back to your comments around the relationship with Lumeris, how do we think about that overall size of that market opportunity? Do we think about it HealtheIntent? Do we think about it the new Maestro Advantage EHR, or do we think about you taking on risk over time as we think about value-based care? I'm just trying to get my arms about how to think about and size that market opportunity for Cerner specifically.","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","Lisa, this is Zane. So first off, I think what you should say is yes, obviously it's a HealtheIntent play, but really the broad elements of this are this is a higher PMPM market that allows us to move from where we've been just a technology-only play in the $1 to $5 PMPM on an aspirational basis to playing more the nature of being upwards of $100 PMPM. Now we'll share in that. Lumeris at this point has the larger bulk of the offerings and the services that will be provided in that area, but it allows us to play at a much higher PMPM basis, bring all the attributes of what we do from a HealtheIntent perspective, bring the things to bear that Lumeris has, and then we'll go create some new offerings together.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","This is Marc. I think financially, you look at going from, as Zane said, $1 to $4 PMPM technology to probably $15 to $20 PMPM would be what we would work to develop and deliver on these clients. Anything relative to a success factor or fee would be on top of that. So we're not going at-risk from a negative standpoint. We are putting some of the economics at risk that we will deliver certain performance, and that performance will then be additive to the $15 to $20 PMPM once we get fully ramped up. So you can gauge the market however many million PMPMs you wanted to use, but it's obviously significant.","When we look at going forward on our 10-year model, if you will, and $1.8 billion that we're looking at, the key is it's not additive. This is part of the strategy for that $1.8 billion, and this business by itself would be 25% to 30% of that number by the time we get to that point in time, the end state of the 2025 model. So I think that would clarify at least for us what we think the ability to deliver an impact on our financials is.","Lisa C. Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And then, Marc, this is the way I understand this. Brent made a comment that as you think about your balance sheet and supporting your growth strategies, do you have what you need today to be able to support this growth that you talk about over the next 10 years, or do we think about internal investments or is it more M&A activity that you'll have to grow and procure certain products to be able to deliver on this?","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","I think the Lumeris investment is a great example of taking technology we've created, skill sets we're developing, but then finding a partner where we can go faster on development, we can go faster into the marketplace, we can get to those revenue dollars in a faster timeframe. I think that applies to the other businesses. You'll see us both investing internally, as always has been our history, but you'll also see us identify areas that could grow to be $100 million businesses, and maybe there's an opportunity to do an acquisition that gets us started doing that business and gets us to that $100 million level in a shorter period of time. So I think we're certainly not going away from investing internally. That's our key strategy and that will continue to be our key strategy. But we have a strong balance sheet, and I think the Lumeris investment shows that we're willing to use it to support our growth strategy.","Lisa C. Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","That's very helpful, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Charles Rhyee with Cowen. Your line is open.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hey, thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to follow up, continuing on Lumeris here. In their current M&A plan that they're offering, can you remind us how many lives they're currently managing? And then also, this is moving you further up the value chain here, certainly a little bit of a departure from your legacy business. But as you think about longer term as we move to value-based care, does this make you think about maybe what the next generation of Millennium looks like? How do you see the EHR itself having to be redesigned to think about more of an outcomes-based model of care? Thanks.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","That was a simple question, Charles. I think surely from the Lumeris standpoint, obviously they run a health plan today, and you can certainly get the sense of how big that health plan is. The opportunity here is really to go help our clients and non-clients who are going down the path, certainly in the Medicare Advantage space, prepare themselves for value-based care and ultimately for taking risk. And I think we see that market coming. It hasn't come as fast as we originally thought, and I think for most people in the selling population health solutions. But I think this will get us \u2013 allow us to be ready when that market hits to have the premier solution that's available in the marketplace.","I think from how does this relate to our traditional EHR business, it obviously is key to what we're going to do with Lumeris is gathering the data from a variety of different EHRs. So the interoperability we built into Millennium and built into HealtheIntent, the ability to pull data from Millennium, the ability to push alerts and information back into an electronic medical record that can impact the care that the patient and the person is receiving while they're in front of their physician rather than getting a text message or an e-mail later, all of that is contextual to really being able to move the meter on the health of the population.","So they're intertwined. Millennium as it is today is a perfect conduit for us to leverage. And those at HealtheIntent, as we've discussed, it lays over the top of not only Millennium but any EHR, and that's part of the strategy is that's the cloud-based option today is using that to pull all the data from all those different solutions.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC","And if I could just follow up, from an accounting standpoint, from a reporting standpoint, are you consolidating all the premiums, and then you kick back out \u2013 or can you talk about the ownership structure of how this joint venture would look like? Are they going to be booking all the revenues and you're just going to be getting a minority interest? How should we think about the bookkeeping of it? Thanks.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Let me just break it into two parts. We made an investment in Lumeris that's less than 20%, so that will have no impact on our income statement. To the extent we go to market, how it gets reflected in our income statement will depend on how the \u2013 are we basically the prime? Is Lumeris the prime? Is it all run through us? Is it all run through Lumeris? All of that will determine where the revenue sits. But certainly initially, a lot of the work there is going to be things that are components of the project because we're talking with (31:44) get to 20% of those dollars. Because initially as we start (31:48), we're not going to be at that level.","I'd also remind you that the ramp up here, when you're talking about creating and helping people create plans, that's a very cyclical business. It really hits in the back half of the year, so a plan can be stood up and operate the following year. So really until we get to 2020 and 2021, you're not going to see a material impact on the financial statements for this. This is a longer-term investment, but when it hits, it's going to be significant.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great, thank you. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jamie Stockton with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Jamie Stockton - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks for taking my questions. I guess maybe the first one, Marc, real quick, the strong license revenue during the quarter, was there anything notable from the VA in that number?","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","No. No, it was...","Jamie Stockton - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Once again, our expectation was that the VA wouldn't have a big impact on the quarter, and we delivered on that expectation.","Jamie Stockton - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","All right, that's great. The sales and client service expense did ramp pretty notably sequentially, and I caught your \u2013 I think it was your comment that you guys, you're hiring up in the Works business in general, but you also were taking on Adventist employees. Can you talk about whether there's been a really tight match of when you've taken on \u2013 maybe specifically the Adventist contract, when you've been taking on the expenses versus when the revenue is really flowing through, and maybe outside of Adventist with the rest of the Works business, what your expectations are there? Because it seemed like there was a big step-up in expenses this quarter but not necessarily a big step up in revenues. So I'm curious. Has the revenue step-up already happened, or are we going to see it in the future? Any color around that would be great.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Jamie, good question. In Q1, basically, we were in the process --we were running Adventist revenue cycles, so all of that activity was already occurring. Under ASC 605, the older rev-rec rule, all we could recognize is the net margin that we (34:09) under that. Under ASC 606, since we are controlling the employees that were doing the work, the revenue actually folded into the top line of our income statement, but the costs went into the cost of goods sold.","This quarter the revenue is still in that number, but now the costs have moved down to the expense line, so that the vast majority of the expense increase you saw is basically just moving that expense out of cost of goods sold and down to that line. And you see that when you look at some of the \u2013 a little bit of the impact on gross margins. Clearly on the expense side, we do have \u2013 we are (34:49) RevWorks to the Kansas City billing office. I think we're up to 400 associates now that we brought on board to work in that space.","We had some expenses related to VA, as we had in Q1. Q2 we're not getting paid for those either but we have those expenses. And even when you look at the net \u2013 the software cap, the net software cap rate was 9% versus 13%, so that's going down, and the amortization impact had an impact on expenses as well, which we've talked about before. But the biggest impact was moving the Adventist people down to be our associates and the operating expense as opposed to being cost of goods sold.","Jamie Stockton - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","All right. That's great, thank you.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mohan Naidu with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.","Mohan Naidu - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Thanks for taking my questions. Zane, Marc, on the non-federal business, if you can, parse out the upsell between your existing customers versus new market share gains. What are you seeing that excites you in both these segments? And is there a worry for potential slowing of spending within hospitals as they try to figure out what they need to do for these value-based models?","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","So, Mohan, this is Zane. I think what we're excited about is first off that we actually had such strength across all the bookings elements. And I think what we're seeing in the U.S. in particular is there is still a need for efficiencies and scale. And that drives a lot of our Works offerings \u2013 so both our ITWorks, RevWorks. And so those pieces of our business, we're seeing good growth in that space.","New marketplace it was, it's continued strength in the community hospital marketplace, but we had \u2013 we sprinkled in a very significant large academic medical center. And so we're seeing our competitiveness be very good in the replacement EHR market, so there's still a strength, there's still quite a bit of activity in the replacement EHR market. Many of those are community hospitals, so they tend to be a little bit smaller, but the activity levels are still very high.","And while we had our highest Q2 in the history of the company for bookings, we also had a growth in (37:17) at the same time, so we're seeing continued strength in the business across all segments at this point. And I think success is really in the execution and driving value for our clients. And so ultimately we feel like the closer we're tied to the outcomes of our clients and the more that we continue to drive towards helping them scale and to succeed and thrive in the future that we see continued growth opportunities. And I think that's reflected in our results and reflected in our pipeline and the activities as we move forward.","Mohan Naidu - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Thanks, Zane.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from George Hill with RBC. Your line is open.","George Hill - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, good afternoon, guys, and thanks for taking the questions. I guess, Zane, my first question would be around the deals over $75 million in the quarter. They're pretty large ones, I guess. Is there a characterization of what those customers typically tend to buy or what they look like, or is it spanning the range from new footprints to Works deals? I would just love to hear about what's going on in the big check size category.","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","It's a great question, George, and it actually is a full box of chocolates, and they're all very desirable. And so I'd look at them and say what you saw \u2013 obviously our federal business was very strong in the quarter, but you saw our IDN business where a major IDN who's looking to scale and grow in their markets investing, doubling down on Cerner in the future. You see an investment by clients that are a new ITWorks client in that space. You see a new academic medical center in that space. So again, it was quite a very strong quarter from a diversity of what was driving those activities. Most all of those are around how do I grow and scale into the future. And I think that's really how you have to think about it.","George Hill - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay, and then maybe a quick follow-up. I'm going to ask one more on Lumeris. I guess how do we think about how that relationship fits into I guess your other relationships? And I'm thinking competitively. Centene and Ascension announced a partnership this week on Medicare Advantage. You guys are working with Lumeris. Do you envision that you and Lumeris eventually wind up competing against Cerner Ascension, or are you guys the back end and helping build out Cerner Ascension? I'm just trying to figure out how you guys think the pieces fit together.","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","Here's how I'd look at it this way, George. We see it as an opportunity for growth across multiple service lines, across multiple areas. And I'd probably add just \u2013 I'm not going to compare and contrast what Centene is doing with what we're doing, but what I'd say is our relationship with Salesforce, for example, there are some significant business needs to accomplish for our clients and to help them succeed as the world changes and as we all work to empower the consumer of the future, in that we're going to partner with certain organizations to create that experience. We're going to help them empower healthcare in a different way.","We're in this case partnering with Lumeris to deliver a services offering that's based off our technology and their market-leading services and their Medicare Advantage plans. And I think you're going to continue to see us do that type of activity where we bring the biggest scale and really use Cerner's platform moving forward to be the world's most (41:01) healthcare platform. And that's really the way that we think about it. And we'll have to get into the competitive environment of each one of those scenarios as we move forward. And we're thinking about it very carefully. We don't want to be on the opposite side of our clients. We want to be on the same side as our clients as we move forward.","George Hill - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay, I appreciate the color. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Cherny with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Michael Cherny - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good afternoon and thanks for taking the question. Diving back into the margin question, some of the direct service costs, as you get more experience in some of the large Works and large consulting contracts, how do you think about any of the leverage if you can get it on the back-end costs, whether you can spread more of it over the RevWorks side or the ITWorks or whatever it might be so that going forward there is a little more predictability in some of those margin targets, I know, Marc, you want to hit.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Michael, clearly the concept of the Works business is to get scale and then to drive efficiencies into those businesses. One of the things you're already seeing as we move forward is we're investing this year in creating a 600-person Kansas City-based business office that will run at a much lower cost than some of the regional business locations that we're already using to support clients. So that's one area where we can look at bringing costs down. We certainly are going to look at any of our options. We have a large India presence. So there's a chance to be able to leverage some of those people that we have in some of the businesses as well.","So the whole focus of these businesses from a service component is how do I get leverage. In RevWorks, it's how do I get lower-cost humans, and the second set is how do I take this technology we've created, the clinically driven revenue cycle, and use automation, adding in AI to be able to significantly reduce the amount of human touches that are required to actually get paid in this environment. So I think all of those things are future opportunities for efficiencies.","We're at a point where we're trying to grow these businesses. We're trying to capture that business. These are dollars that they're spending today that we're trying to have them redirect to us. Once we get those captured, then we'll start worrying about becoming more efficient at it. And that's not any different from the hosting business when we started that out and we were single-digit margins, now we're well over 30%. So I think it's a similar thought. Maybe it doesn't get us over 30%, but that's the same goal that we're striving for.","Michael Cherny - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Excellent, thanks so much.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Garro from William Blair & Company. Your line is open.","Jeff R. Garro - William Blair & Co. LLC","Good afternoon, thanks for taking the question. I want to ask about Adventist. Marc, the bookkeeping a little bit there, but maybe more of a substantive thing, thinking about how the progress is going against the plan for the year and just the impact of them, RevWorks and a partial ITWorks client, and then how we can start to think about that impact being the more fully outsourced RevWorks pipeline.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Wow, you broke up a little bit on the question, but I think it was basically how does Adventist impact in the year out. Clearly we have ASC 606 coming into the year, we knew that we would get revenue from that client fully in our revenue and then have the cost coming in cost of goods sold and other expense line. So it hasn't changed our revenue guidance. It was all baked into our original guidance. So I think that's pretty consistent with the numbers we've been sharing is how it's going to impact this year. The good news is it's going to continue to impact future years. It's a recurring level of revenue that will be underneath a very long-term contract, so it will continue for some time.","Jeff R. Garro - William Blair & Co. LLC","Great. And then the follow-up is I was actually hoping for also a little bit more on the substance of the relationship and achieving greater value for them, where you're progressing there, and then how we can think about that relationship impacting the more fully outsourced RevWorks pipeline. Thanks.","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","Sure, this is Zane. So the project has been going extremely well. We've been delivering against our objectives. I think that's Marc's view of performance plan, so I'd just say it's gone very well. I think we have, from a value creation office, we've been hitting several tens of millions in the value creation office in terms of our value that we're driving together on an annual basis. And so the management team on that side is very happy with where we are, and I think that will lend itself to additional opportunity.","There's not a hard code in for hit this objective and then it creates the next trigger event. But success here will help us to get more success, both with Adventist as well as, obviously, throughout the marketplace because this is central to how we're thinking about the entire marketplace, which is add value, create value together with our partner and to be closer to the strategies of our clients overall.","And Adventist is a really good example of how we're driving value together, and we've seen continued growth and trust placed in Cerner to perform and execute on the services side of that. And I would anticipate that will help us both with Adventist as it relates to additional services offerings as well as other clients who are closely watching to see what happens here and how we perform over time.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Jeff, this is Marc. We've talked about them being our cornerstone client for this business. The fact that they rebadged all of their associates to Cerner in Q2 is a big statement by them in their trust on us to deliver, where folks are certainly reducing their cost to collect. We need to get some time in delivering on those targets to be able to prove to people that we can do this at large scale. So we're in that process, it's going well, but it's going to \u2013 it takes some time. Rebadging was a big milestone for us.","Jeff R. Garro - William Blair & Co. LLC","Great, thanks again.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Eric Percher from Nephron Research. Your line is open.","Eric Percher - Nephron Research LLC","Thank you. So Lumeris and your willingness to deploy capital for growth opportunities seems very significant. I understand Lumeris \u2013 the agreement with Lumeris occurred over a very long or fairly long period. I'd welcome perspective on how the transaction came to be and whether you think that's a path you should typically follow, or if Brent's comments around using the balance sheet suggest increased awareness of other potential opportunities to put capital to work.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","I think from my perspective, Lumeris was a little bit unique, because when we started working with him, we figured out hey, this is pretty cool. We like it. We want to be in this Medicare Advantage. We think it's a sweet spot as people start going to take risks and coming around to who's the best in our opinion in that. Lumeris having the services component and actually running a 4.5-star plan, which is kind of a big deal, caught our attention.","So we spent a lot of time just meeting with the people, understanding what it would take, how would we leverage our technology and our service offerings to be effective in that space. And as all those conversations kept going, it evolved from hey, we should work together to hey, maybe we could use some of your tools. And that's why that one took quite a while.","I think if we look at other maybe smaller levels of capital deployment to help us jump-start growth in an area that we think has potential for growth, I think those can occur more quickly. But I think we're still a company that likes to invest internally, but I think it's also \u2013 we are also \u2013 we're looking at our balance sheet saying we ought to \u2013 to the extent we have seven really good areas of growth, is there some subset of that that we could go invest some capital in and get us started faster, and therefore get us to that $100 million-plus business faster.","Eric Percher - Nephron Research LLC","That's helpful.","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","And this is Zane. If I may, just Marc talked about our ability for speed, which I couldn't agree more with. The flip side of that is we're being incredibly thoughtful about who we partner with and who we bring into our clients and what that means when we do that. And so I would just say these are very long-term plays, so we're being \u2013 the Lumeris conversation, I think it's appropriate that we spent a lot of time on how will this work and how can we deliver real value.","Our Salesforce arrangement is of a similar variety. We spent two years in the making to make that really come to life in the proper way because these are incredibly strategic decisions we're making to broaden the suite of solutions. But in our view, these are people we're bringing into our clients and we need to make sure that we fully vet the long-term feeling of that as well as the impact on Cerner over the long haul. And I think we're being appropriately judicious about how we look at these, but if there's a need for speed, I'm glad to hear Marc's ready to go with it.","Eric Percher - Nephron Research LLC","That's helpful to hear. And unrelated but a follow-up, it's been a year since we spent some time about LifePoint, and obviously they were in the news lately. Could we just get a bit of a progress report there?","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","Sure, the LifePoint engagement is progressing very well. I think we have our go-live coming up here in the very near term before the end of the year. And they're very pleased and they've been a good partner for us. And so we would anticipate it will be beneficial for both organizations as we move forward and an opportunity to expand. So we're excited about what they're doing and we think that's a great team and I don't anticipate their capital structure to really change the game here as it relates to what we're doing with them.","Eric Percher - Nephron Research LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Sean Wieland with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","Sean W. Wieland - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Hi, thank you, first a quick one on revenue cycle. The activity that you cited in the quarter, are you selling the Millennium revenue cycle or Soarian revenue cycle or a mix of the two.","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","This is Zane again. We market both solutions but principally it's the Millennium revenue cycle solution set. Most organizations are buying an integrated ambulatory acute and revenue cycle, and then many of our clients who have been a long-term Millennium client want to get on a single instance. But we have had Soarian sales. There's still a marketplace for standalone patient (52:55), and we offer that. But from a solution perspective, Soarian is architected to be very portable in terms of functionality and those pieces and we've taken much of the best things out of Soarian and been able to port those to Millennium. And that's been very helpful, and we would anticipate that we'll continue to utilize both those. But I would say the vast majority of the revenue cycle opportunity is on a Millennium basis.","Sean W. Wieland - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Okay, great, and an unrelated follow-up: How would you describe the appetite for two-sided risk models within your base? And do you see that as key to the relationship with Lumeris and overall population health?","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","I think in the population health space, there's an appetite for that dialogue. And we're tiptoeing our way appropriately into it, so we're not putting ourselves at significant risk, as Marc indicated. But most of these are upside opportunities as we've done that. And so we'll continue to work our way through that and mature how comfortable we get with all the risk elements of that before we get too far.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","This is Marc. We can do very well and grow to a significant number without having to take downside risk.","Sean W. Wieland - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Okay, thanks so much.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Why don't we take one more question?","Operator","Our next question comes from Donald Hooker with KeyBanc. Your line is open.","Donald H. Hooker - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Great, just a side question. A lot of questions have been asked, but I was curious how you guys think about telemedicine. And you guys have a partnership I know with American Well, and you've mentioned some work with the VA around virtual healthcare as well. But just how does telemedicine fit in your outlook for healthcare in your business model over the next few years?","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","This is Zane. Obviously, telemedicine is an important piece. I think the recent changes in reimbursement are very helpful for telemedicine. I think there's going to be more as it relates to the consumer aspects of really well care and utilizing the physician and acute settings for really high-acuity situations as opposed to these many situations where people have to go to the doctor's office and use valuable resources that are very costly. And so I think you'll see telemedicine. I think you're going to see the wearables. I think you're going to see a whole lot of different technologies on the go-forward, which puts the people that don't need to utilize these very expensive, very talented resources, we're not using those for those people that don't have a high acuity; that we only use those resources when there's a real need for high acuity.","And so we're going to continue to look for both. Telehealth is one of those pieces. But on the telemedicine side of that, we're going to look for other technologies which continue that strategy. Let's make sure that high acuity meets the high cost pieces versus the low acuity using up that bandwidth in the network.","Donald H. Hooker - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Got you, and maybe one last quick one. You guys have been press releasing a lot of wins in the smaller rural hospital space. So I guess, one, can you update us with where you are in terms of the number of hospitals, the footprint you have with that CommunityWorks offering in the sub-75 bed hospital area? And you had mentioned taking that multi-tenant offering up into larger hospitals. I thought that was an interesting development a few quarters ago. I was just wondering if there was an appetite for a CommunityWorks style offering as you move up into larger settings.","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","So this is Zane. We're well over hospitals in taking that live actually today, and we're well in the contracted and significantly in excess of that.","Moving up into larger settings is really one of those pieces around both M&A activity, around ease of use, and predictable cost models, and so we see that more as a delivery model than we do as a market segment. So instead of thinking just pure community hospital, it's also surgical centers, it's behavioral health. It's all those things. It's really a delivery model when we talk about CommunityWorks. And so it's much broader than that. We see there's quite a bit of applicability for that model, and we are competing and doing extremely well in that marketplace, and there's as much activity as there's ever been in that space. So it is very, very high activity level, and we're competing for more than our share.","Donald H. Hooker - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thank you.","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","Great, thank you.","Brent Shafer - Cerner Corp.","Thanks, Marc. This is Brent. I want to thank everyone for joining us today. I'm very pleased with our solid results for this quarter, and we will continue to focus on delivering against the expectations we set. My conviction is that Cerner has great opportunities to grow over the long term, and those continue to increase. I think we're taking the steps necessary to realize this potential, and we appreciate you being with us. Have a great evening.

Today's date is April 25, 2013 and this call is being recorded.","The company has asked me to remind you that various remarks made by here today by Cerner's management about future expectations, plans, perspectives and prospects constitute forward-looking statements for the purpose of the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements.","Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements may be found under the heading Risk Factors under Item 1A in the Cerner's Form 10-K together with the other reports that are furnished to or filed with the SEC.","A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this earnings call can be found in the company's earnings release that was furnished to the SEC today and posted on the Investor section of the cerner.com.","At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Marc Naughton, Chief Financial Officer of the Cerner Corporation.","Marc G. Naughton","Thank you, Kimberly. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the call. I'll lead off today with a review of the numbers. Zane Burke, Executive Vice President of our Client Organization, will follow with sales highlights and marketplace trends. Mike Neal, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, will discuss operations and our works businesses; Neal Patterson, our Chairman, CEO and President, will be available during Q&A. Jeff Townsend, Executive Vice President and Chief of Staff is traveling today.","Now I will turn to our results. We delivered excellent results in the first quarter across all metrics except revenue, which was impacted by reduced levels of low margin technology resale that has little impact on our earnings, which were above expectations.","Our total bookings revenue in Q1 was $801.6 million, which is an all-time high for a first quarter. Bookings exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range by more than $60 million, and we're up 23% from Q1 of '12 when bookings grew 24%. Bookings and margin in Q1 was $717 million or 89% of total bookings. Our bookings performance drove a 21% increase in total backlog to $7.58 billion. Contract revenue backlog of $6.83 billion is 23% higher than the year-ago. Support revenue backlog totaled $748 million, up 6% year-over-year. Revenue in the quarter was $680 million, which is up 6% over Q1 of '12. The revenue composition for Q1 was $199 million in system sales, $161 million in support and maintenance, $306 million in services and $14 million in reimbursed travel.","System sales revenue reflects a 12% decline from Q1 of '12, which has grown 61% over the prior year, creating a very tough comparable. The decline this quarter was driven by a significant year-over-year decline in technology resale, which overshadowed growth in subscriptions and software. As you may recall, in Q1 of '12 we had approximately $40 million of upside driven by strong hardware sales and strong growth in device resale. In Q1 of '13, hardware was at more normal levels, while device resale declined. Since device resales are often driven by the third-party sales force, our visibility to that revenue is not as high as the rest of our business. In some quarters, that has provided an upside to revenue, but this quarter the lower device resale revenue was below our expectations, resulting in revenue below our guidance range.","The good news is that hardware and device resale are low margin businesses, which allowed us to still drive 8% growth in system sales margin dollars on the lower revenue number. As a reminder, we have looked to increase our technology resale business as part of a strategy to focus our clients, while making all of their technology purchases through Cerner. This allows us to address more opportunities and provides a platform to discuss device related solutions like CareAware or iBus. As we look across the rest of the year, our expectations for technology resale to start increasing from current levels.","Moving to services. Total services revenue was up 18% compared to Q1 of '12 with strong growth in managed services and professional services and increasing contributions from ITWorks and RevWorks. Support and maintenance revenue increased 10% over Q1 of '12.","Moving to gross margin. Our gross margin for Q1 was 81.3%, which is up from 78.3% in Q4 of '12 and 75.4% in Q1 of '12. The increasing gross margin percent was driven by the lower mix of technology resale and strong services margins.","Gross margin dollars increased 14% over Q1 of '12, which is more reflective of our underlying business growth than the revenue growth.","Looking at revenue by geographic segment. Domestic revenue increased 4% compared to Q1 of last year, and global revenue increased 19%. The lower domestic revenue growth is directly tied to lower technology resale. This is evidenced by the 12% growth in domestic gross margin dollars, which was driven by growth in the higher margin components of our business.","Looking at operating spending. Our first quarter operating expenses were $385 million before share-based compensation expense of $11 million. This is a year-over-year increase of 11%, which was below the growth of our gross margin dollars, reflecting ongoing operating efficiencies.","Sales and client service expenses increased 9% compared to Q1 of '12, driven by an increase in revenue-generating associates and our services businesses.","Our investment in software development was up 14% compared to Q1 of '12. As we have discussed, we have been hiring in our R&D organization, as well as utilizing consultants for targeted development work and we expect our R&D investments to continue growing. This will be reflected in increased gross spending and increased capitalized software throughout the rest of 2013. G&A expense increased 21% compared to Q1 of '12 driven by increased personnel expense related to our strong growth and higher amortization expense.","Moving to operating margins. Our operating margin in Q1 was 24.7% before share-based compensation expense and was up 340 basis points compared to Q1 of '12. This was driven by a combination of ongoing operating efficiencies and the lower level of low-margin technology revenue. I would point out that even if revenue had been at the midpoint of our guidance range, without any additional margin, we still would've expanded operating margins by 250 basis points. We expect margin expansion to remain above 100 basis points for the year.","Moving to net earnings and EPS. Our GAAP net earnings in Q1 were $110 million or $0.62 per diluted share. GAAP net earnings included share-based compensation expense, which had a net impact on earnings of $7 million or $0.04 per diluted share. Adjusted net earnings were $117 million, and adjusted EPS was $0.66, which is up 22% compared to Q1 of '12.","The Q1 tax rate for adjusted net earnings was 32%, which is below our expected effective tax rate of approximately 34% due to a catch-up of the R&D tax credit, which was retroactively reinstated for 2012 in early 2013. Using a 34% tax rate reduces adjusted earnings per share by $0.02. For the remainder of 2013, we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 34% plus or minus 50 basis points.","Now move to our balance sheet. We ended Q1 with $1.52 billion of total cash and investments, down from $1.55 billion in Q4. Total cash and investments include $1.01 billion of cash and short-term investments and $516 million of highly rated corporate and government bonds with maturities less than 2 years. Our total debt, including capital lease obligations, is $182 million.","Total receivables ended the quarter with $512 million, which is down $66 million from Q4. Contracts receivable, or the unbilled portion of receivables, were $30 million and represent 6% of total receivables. Cash collections were a record $784 million. Our DSO in Q1 was 69 days, which is down from Q4 DSO of 74 days and 76 days in Q1 of '12 and at the lowest level in the company's history.","Operating cash flow for the quarter was $214 million. Q1 capital expenditures were $49 million and capitalized software was $34 million. Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures and capitalized software, was $130 million.","Looking at the remainder of 2013, we expect quarterly capital expenditures to be in the $50 million to $60 million range as construction of additional space at our new Kansas City Kansas campus continues. At these levels, we still expect to generate good levels of free cash flow.","Moving to capitalized software. The $34 million of capitalized software in Q1 represents 37% of the $93 million of total investment in development activities. Software amortization for the quarter was $22 million, resulting in net capitalization of $12 million or 13% of our total R&D investment. As I indicated, we expect capitalized software to continue to increase in 2013, as we invest in areas Zane and Mike will discuss, that will position us for strong growth through the decade. Much of the growth in capitalized software is related to third-party developers we are using to accelerate development in certain areas. As a result, we expect the growth of capitalization to be temporary, as we plan to moderate these to third parties after 1 to 2 years.","Similar to this quarter, our net R&D expense will still be growing throughout the year even with increased capitalization, as we aren't just capitalizing that higher percent of existing spend. We view this approach, combined with our share buyback and small acquisitions, to be a good use of our capital.","Regarding our share buyback, we've purchased 722,000 shares for approximately $63 million during the quarter and now have $107 million remaining from the $170 million that was authorized in December.","Now we go through Q2 and full year guidance. For Q2, we expect revenue between $705 million and $735 million, with the midpoint reflecting growth of 13% over Q2 of '12. The slightly wider revenue guidance range accounts for a wider range of results in technology resale, and reflects expected ongoing strength in other areas.","For the full year, we continue to expect revenue between $2.95 billion and $3.05 billion, reflecting 13% growth at the midpoint. Given the lower technology sales in Q1, we are currently biased towards the midpoint of the range, but that could change as the year progresses.","We expect Q2 adjusted EPS before share based compensation expense to be $0.66 to $0.68 per share, with the midpoint reflecting 14% growth over Q2 of '12 reported adjusted EPS and 22% growth when you consider the $0.04 benefit we had from lower taxes in Q2 of '12.","For the full year, we expect adjusted EPS between $2.78 and $2.83, which is up from our prior guidance range of $2.75 to $2.82. The midpoint reflects 17% growth to our reported adjusted EPS and 20% growth when you adjust 2012 for a lower tax rate in Q2 and the gain on the investment sale we had in Q4.","Q2 guidance is based on total spending before share-based compensation expense of approximately $395 million to $405 million. Our estimate for impact the of share-based compensation expense is approximately $0.04 to $0.05 in Q2 and $0.17 to $0.18 for the full year.","Moving to bookings guidance. We expect bookings revenue in Q2 of $825 million to $875 million, with the midpoint reflecting 21% growth over Q2 of '12.","In closing, we are pleased with our results in Q1. With the exception of low margin technology revenue, all our key metrics were stronger than expected and we are well-positioned for a very good year.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Zane.","Zane M. Burke","Thanks, Marc. Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll provide sales highlights and discuss marketplace trends. Starting with our results. Our bookings revenue in Q1 of $802 million is an all-time high for our first quarter and reflects 23% growth over Q1 2012. This increase was driven by strong growth across most business models, which more than offset the decline in technology we saw Marc discuss.","Looking at other bookings metrics, we had 25 contracts over $5 million, including 16 over $10 million. The mix of long-term bookings was 32% in the quarter, which is in line with historical levels. We had continued success in expanding our Millennium footprint, with 27% of bookings in the quarter coming from outside our core Millennium install base. As I discussed at our Investor Day in March, our competitiveness is strong and we have a very good pipeline of new footprint opportunities. This competitiveness was evident again this quarter in another head-to-head win against our primary competitor, where our improvements and position experience and revenue cycle were favorably received and our capabilities and population health proved to be the deciding factor.","In addition to success at getting net new clients, we also continue to have success with existing clients expanding their Cerner footprint by selecting us to displace other suppliers in sites where they don't have Cerner. This is driven by a combination of our proven ability to deliver and lack of execution by other suppliers and the desire of our clients to standardize across their delivery networks and prepare for future models of healthcare.","To give you a sense of how big this opportunity is, 7 of the top 10 health systems in the U.S. have a Cerner EMR footprint. And just within these clients, there are more than 300 sites that don't currently have a Cerner EMR footprint. This represents a substantial opportunity in the coming years.","The desire to standardized on Cerner is not limited to inpatient facilities or just clinical solutions. We also continue to see a trend to large IDN client switching to Cerner ambulatory solutions and expanding their use of Cerner revenue cycle solutions in both inpatient and outpatient venues. Clearly, the enhancements we have made to position and revenue cycle solutions are beginning to show up in our results. We're continuing to invest heavily in these areas, along with population health, which we believe will create substantial competitive differentiation in the market place.","Outside of the U.S., we had a good start to the year. In England we were selected by Lewisham Healthcare NHS Trust to implement a broad range of solutions and also had a good sales into our existing clients. In Canada, we substantially expanded our relationship with Vancouver Island Health Authority by creating an alliance to accelerate the deployment of our EMR throughout the island and across the continuum of care. In addition, Vancouver Island has become our second institute client with Tiger Institute being the first. Our primary focus will be jointly innovating in areas of population health and care for the elderly.","In the Middle East, we had strong results in Q1 and just received additional good news earlier this week from the Saudi Ministry of Health that we have been awarded the first pilot hospital for their national project. The pilot site is a recently constructed 500-bed hospital located in Riyadh. The scope of the national project includes 270 public hospitals across the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. We've been working towards this opportunity for a long time and are very focused on delivering outstanding results at our pilot site to position ourselves for future opportunities in the national project.","Moving to the marketplace. We continue to see the following marketplace trends. Several suppliers are struggling with execution, which is creating more clear separation among the 2 most successful companies and then the rest. The significant volume of measures and mandates continue to pressure our clients with Meaningful Use, healthcare reform, ACOs, Value-Based Purchasing, quality reporting and changes in readmission reimbursement, representing the initial steps toward a transition away from fee-for-service to providers being responsible or health populations. As providers face these challenges, we are seeing them more focused on getting value out of their investments, which has led to more interest in share savings models and then our works businesses that allow them to impact our costs. Providers are also increasing their focus on population health strategies, as it become more clear the industry will shift to an at-risk model but in a sense of health, not just care.","Another area that is getting increased attention is revenue cycle. As the lines between clinical and revenue cycle blur, clinically driven revenue cycle has become a requirement. All new opportunities want integrated clinical and revenue cycle solutions and our existing base is transitioning to Cerner's revenue cycle at a more rapid pace.","Finally, industry consolidation is continuing, with health systems buying hospitals, physician practices and other venues to control more of the continuum of care, as they position themselves for the population health era. All these trends have been positive for Cerner and we expect them to continue. We have been extremely successful so far in the EMR era, and we believe that we are well-positioned to significantly expand our EMR footprint in the coming years. At that point, the healthcare industry will be wired, which is when our ability to use data to create optimal outcomes will differentiate us.","Before handing the call over to Mike, I'd like to make a few observations coming out of HIMMS, which took place in New Orleans last month. We had a great show with our booth demos and meeting rooms at or near capacity most of the week. We tracked over 2,000 interactions with clients and prospects. I was pleased with our ability to balance what we call the now and the next at HIMMS. We had a good balance and have been showing great progress on now topics, such as physician experience and revenue cycle. We're also showing the most comprehensive view of population health, which represents a key next topic. We found that while there are plenty of pretty screens and dashboards for population health at other booths across the floor, most of them had a narrow focus and lack access to real-time, rich content that is necessary to really make the tools useful.","We clearly have the most comprehensive approach to population health and we expect to make significant progress this year through our increased R&D investment and our expanded relationship with Advocate Health Care. As a reminder, the first phase of our partnership with Advocate was to work together to build effective models and algorithms that change the cost and quality of care and populations. We are now working with them to automate the workflow of population health management across their system, which is the largest accountable care organization in the U.S. This involves creating rules-based health management programs to facilitate optimal care and workflow across a network of doctors, hospitals, home health, nursing homes, pharmacies and other stakeholders. We believe this work will be a great foundation for solutions that can create significant value for our entire client base.","In summary, I'm very pleased with our results in Q1 and I believe we are very well positioned competitively and the investments we are making will only strengthen our position.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike.","Michael C. Neal","Thanks, Zane. Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'm going to be discuss revenue cycle, ITWorks and our R&D focus areas. I'll start with revenue cycle. The highlight of the first quarter for revenue cycle was the expansion of our relationship with Adventist Health. As we announced in March, Adventist Health is transitioning responsibility for its revenue cycle management services to Cerner. As part of the agreement, members of the revenue cycle leadership team from Adventist have become Cerner associates.","The focus of the partnership will be decreasing variability and driving best practices to the standardization of revenue management technologies and business processes, as well as fostering discovery and innovation on Adventist Health's journey to population health.","Ultimately, this alignment allows for continuous innovation of software and revenue cycle management workflows to address both current and future reimbursement models. Their selection of RevWorks follows them choosing us last year to provide solutions and services for an integrated revenue cycle platform across their acute ambulatory and post acute venues.","An additional Q1 highlight for revenue cycle was another 1 of our large health system clients choosing Cerner RevWorks business-offered services for their ambulatory facilities. We will be responsible for business-offered services for nearly 800 physicians, making this our largest ambulatory revenue cycle client.","In summary, the tighter linkage between clinical outcomes and revenue cycle is leading more of our clients to evaluate our revenue cycle offerings in both acute and ambulatory venue. The recent endorsements from Adventist and other large clients is driving an increase in activity across our install base, as well as contributing to the success in new client opportunities.","Moving to ITWorks. Q1 did not include an ITWorks deal, but we are seeing the level of interest in ITWorks increase as our clients face ongoing pressures to address multiple industry requirements while also controlling costs. As a result, our pipeline is very strong, and we expect significant contributions from ITWorks in Q2 and for the year.","Now I'd like to focus -- now I'd like to discuss our areas of focus on R&D and our approach to accelerating innovation. Last quarter, I went -- when I went through our imperatives, which are focused on physician experience, population health and revenue cycle, or as we define it, PPR, as you would expect, a major portion of our R&D efforts are focused on these areas. We've already made significant progress in each of these areas, and we believe the window of opportunity during which we can leapfrog the competition in physician experience and revenue cycle and further our leadership position in population health. These investments are what will set up the next wave of growth, and we are going to invest heavily now while most competitors are bogged down with Meaningful Use and other regulatory requirements.","To go fast, we're supplementing our direct hiring of engineers with utilization of third parties in targeted areas. We're embedding these third-party resources into existing development teams so we can go faster without relinquishing control or losing efficiencies. In addition to the benefit of going faster, we believe this approach will allow us to moderate the spending after 1 or 2 years of elevated investment.","Before handing the call over for questions, I'd also like to make a few comments on interoperability and the CommonWell Health Alliance. As Jeff announced on our last call, we have been increasingly vocal around our support for interoperability and the importance that this will have on realizing the benefits of a digital health economy.","For example, Cerner's contributed over 50,000 lines of open-source code along with personnel and money toward the development of the Direct Project, which is a standard-based method for electronic sharing of encrypted health information. But a giant historical barrier to full and fluid interoperability has been the lack of a systematic method of identifying individuals. Without accurate identity management, large-scale interchange of records can actually lead to mismatched data and new sources of error. If we don't do something, the return on a significant investment in EMRs will be diminished. It would be like building a telecom network, but not having phone numbers.","The CommonWell Health Alliance, which was announced in March by Cerner and other founding members is aimed at addressing this problem. CommonWell is an open, nonprofit consortium, founded on the idea that patients and their care providers should be able to access their health information regardless of where care occurs. A central piece of CommonWell is an agreement to use a standards-based, cloud-based identity management service to help ensure accurate patient identification and to manage consent and keep track of the location of records.","CommonWell membership is open to all, and we are actively recruiting other healthcare IT companies and expect several more to join soon. We look forward to validating the concept through the pilot this year. This is the right thing for healthcare, and it needs to happen if we ever want to achieve the level of care coordination we envisioned in the future.","With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator for Q&A. Kimberly?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Charles Rhyee from Cowen and Company.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Marc, just had a quick question on -- really on the bookings. Obviously, a good strong quarter on international. Can you give us a sense in the bookings mix, what -- maybe how international bookings are looking relative to domestic? Looks like on the revenue side we're seeing good international growth, is that the same that we're seeing also in the bookings?","Marc G. Naughton","Yes, this is Marc. I think clearly from the bookings side, some of the deals we talked about with Vancouver Health Authority, Vancouver Island Health source and some other opportunities we had globally, there was a very strong quarter for global. So I think that's spelt good from a bounce back. We've talked on these calls about areas of the globe that do have strong economies and are in an acquisition stage. So I think that's positive. Clearly, the Saudi pilot announcement that we've been chosen to as the first selected supplier there to move forward is a very big deal in the Global Market. So I think we're starting to see some good contributions from global. Obviously, we're also seeing good strength in the U.S. But I think it's pretty reflective of the revenue growth from the global side that we're starting to see that bounce back.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then maybe just as a follow-up question on the tech resale, obviously, you kind of missed your expectation, but is it one of those things where maybe the deal didn't close in the quarter because of the -- the vendors themselves not getting it done. Does that mean that we just -- shifting these are maybe pushed out a little bit? Or not necessarily that the deal is dead?","Marc G. Naughton","Well, I think on the tech resale side it's usually not the result of 1 single big deal that's out there that doesn't get done. It's a series of smaller transactions. These transactions oftentimes are driven by the third-party sales force. So we don't get a lot of visibility to it. In some cases, we don't -- we may even be competing in some cases, which seems unusual, but that is how it works. So we even get less visibility there. I don't think that there's any pent-up deal that's going to fall in a different quarter. I think from our standpoint, we've always had a little bit of lumpiness in the tech resale. We looked in Q1 of '12, we delivered $40 million over revenue expectations in Q1. Q2  kind of Q3 and 4 were a little bit more in a tighter range. And I think we're using those as our best estimate of what we're projecting for Q1. I think the variety of things relative to timing of deals, rollout of new platforms by some of those suppliers, there's a bunch of things that can impact that. But there wasn't any single big deal that's going to come back in later. I think on my comments, I indicated that we do kind of think that this is a low point and then it will start ramping up, gradually, through the rest of the year. But we don't see -- Q2 won't have a catch-up, if you will, relative to what the '12 levels were. And once again, this is low margin stuff. To be able to kind of be that $10 million below our guidance range, $25 million off the midpoint and not impact our earnings at all was -- gives you an indication of -- that this is more of a strategic sale, part of our goal of having those clients buy everything we can from us, so that we can identify needs, be able to sell some of our device connectivity software into these clients rather than something that we're all looking to make a lot of money on.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Mike Cherny from ISI Group.","Michael Cherny - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","So I just want to dig in a little bit to the comment I believe Zane made about the trend you're continuing to see in terms of the large IDNs and converting over on the ambulatory side to more Cerner Solutions. I know that for a long time ambulatory is a place that you'd spend a lot of dollars investing in and really improving the functionality there. Now as we think about going forward, particularly with regards to Stages 2 and 3 Meaningful Use, is this more a push where you guys are educating these clients you may not have known about the success of your ambulatory product or more of a pull on their part in terms of they're trying to figure if the vendors that they have and obviously we that there are a lot of ambulatory vendors that have allowed their users to attach their Meaningful Use Stage 1, but they're realizing that for Stages 2 and 3, they may need something just a little bit better?","Zane M. Burke","I think it's a -- this is Zane. I think it's a little bit of both. It's a combination of one, that clients are seeing how strong our ambulatory offering is and it's actually a lead with solution for us today. And it's extremely competitive, and it's actually the best out there on a stand-alone basis, and that's becoming much more well known. But there's also the factors that you just referenced, which are some suppliers are having challenges as we look forward to some of the, not just Meaningful Use elements, but just the changes in what's going to happen in health care models. And there are people that are preparing for those changes and those larger IDNs are getting ready for the changes in Healthcare Reform much beyond just the Meaningful Use elements. So it's all those elements. We did see very strong growth again in ambulatory in the first quarter.","Michael Cherny - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Great. And then just one quick housekeeping question. I know you mentioned the Saudi Arabia deal. I assume that's going to be part of that 2Q bookings that you mentioned?","Zane M. Burke","Yes, that's in Q2.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Sean Wieland from Piper Jaffray.","Sean W. Wieland - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","So a lot of the providers have been talking about tough utilization trends. And I wanted to know if you have any thoughts on that and primarily any impact that you're seeing in your pipeline, as I read through there?","Zane M. Burke","This is Zane. We've seen some organizations with some utilization detriments and some of that -- and what's going on in their existing markets. But we have not seen that have an impact on value behavior. If anything, it gets them to think about what are all the other areas where I need to be really good in terms of ambulatory side, in terms of the other continuum of care spaces, which actually really helps Cerner versus our primary competitor.","Sean W. Wieland - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","All right. That's helpful. And then second thing is, tech resale used to be just hardware, now it's a more diversified business. Is there any particular areas within tech resale that were showing weakness?","Marc G. Naughton","Relative to this quarter, I think there was a -- certainly a -- some of the low margin hardware elements and then some of the device resale elements. Those are the 2 areas that were below what we would have provided relative to our guidance. Those are the 2 components. When you break down the lines and you go down to the hardware detail, there are elements of hardware that we get some pretty decent margins on. So you almost have to separate hardware to 2 different components of kind of low margin and then medium margin I guess would be what I would use for lack of a better phrase. So in this case, it was a lower margin, the lower margin hardware and the device resale, which tends to be low margin that impacted us.","Sean W. Wieland - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay. And specifically, what kind of hardware is the low margin hardware?","Marc G. Naughton","It will vary a lot. It's just some of the basic computer stuff that -- obviously the price points on that are continuing to decline. It's not necessarily the more complex devices that we sell. But once again, a lot of this resale is going through their client base, their sales force, and we're writing the deals on our paper. But the profit we get from that is very small, it's really just part of the strategy of being the one-stop shop to get -- to be able to act as that for our clients. And just to give you a little bit -- for a little more color, once again, that number has varied significantly just from Q1 of last year to Q1 of this year. We think, at this point, we'll be more conservative on guiding that as we're going forward and we have guided to expect that to kind of increase slightly as we go forward. And we think that's the safe way to do it.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Lisa Gill from JPMorgan.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I just had a couple of questions. Zane, I was just wondering, I know you said that 27% of the bookings were outside of your core base. But can you just give us an indication as to what you're seeing as far as greenfield versus replacement opportunities in that -- outside your base?","Zane M. Burke","Sure, Lisa. So most every -- most of our -- in acute-care setting, they were replacing some competitor. They have some form of automation, and so there's very few organizations I can think of that don't have automation. So these are replacement era elements. You may have some in the ambulatory space, pure greenfield, where the physician has adopted an EMR. So in that marketplace, you're still seeing a mix of greenfield and a mix of the replacement opportunities. And then in the acute-care setting, you're replacing somebody else's solution.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And is there one competitor that you're primarily replacing in the marketplace right now? And I think to an earlier question, there's north of 400 little EMR companies that are out there. Is that really where this next opportunity is, that they're not going to be able to meet Meaningful Use 2 and 3 and that's where you see the replacement? Or is it something else?","Zane M. Burke","And Lisa, when you refer to the 400, I'm assuming you're referring to the ambulatory setting.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Yes, the ambulatory setting.","Zane M. Burke","Okay. So I'll phrase it towards that. It's all competitors. We've replaced, literally, all the large top 10 competitors in the last 12 months. So when we go through that, all the top 10 we have come through and had a replacement for.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. Great. And then, I guess my last question would just be on Saudi Arabia and the opportunity and timing there. I mean you talked about there's a new pilot program that will be in bookings next quarter, but is there a way to quantify how big that market potential is?","Zane M. Burke","Well we -- in my comments, we talked about the 270 hospitals. We would anticipate there will be additional pilots by other competitors in that space. And so it's likely to assume that those additional -- that who succeeds in the pilot phase will get the lion's share of those other 270 hospitals that are available.","Marc G. Naughton","I would clarify, the pilot is just for the one hospital. So from a bookings standpoint, it is not going to be a significant contributor to our Q2 bookings guidance.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of George Hill from Citigroup.","George Hill - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Zane, I kind of want to start off with post HIMMS. We're all talking about population health management, Cerner's history in selling new clients has kind of been to lead with the vision. What I'm wondering if you can talk about is like talk about the degree to which you guys are marketing Synapse and Healthe Intent, how much clients are buying in as they see Cerner's vision of the future? How it impacts the sales process and kind of how it impacts the pipeline?","Zane M. Burke","Well it's absolutely the key differentiator. So we are leading with population health as our strategy, both from a core EMR solution, as well as the Healthe Intent platform itself. And so a lot of the organizations that are making decisions today, in fact most all of them, are making the decisions today because they need to get to a platform, which takes them to a better place over time, and that better place over time is how they prepare for those future healthcare reforms. So it's absolutely front and center a part of our marketing strategy and how we lead with and talk about those elements. And we can deliver today a number of things along the population health strategy today, so everything from our HIE to our member portals to what we do from a performance improvement perspective for those clients. So we can not only talk about the vision, but we can actually go execute today on a number of items, which get them on a journey towards population health.","George Hill - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And you talked about another win this quarter versus your key competitor. Can you say whether or not population health was a component of that?","Zane M. Burke","Absolutely was, front and center, a part of that.","George Hill - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then Marc, just a -- I guess, a bean counting question for you. Just on the tech resale side, do you feel like that is a one-quarter event that we've seen here? Or is that indicative of the trend of Cerner selling more web-based solutions, selling more hosted solutions? So I guess is this a one-off, or is this a secular thing that we should be keeping our eyes peeled for?","Marc G. Naughton","No, I think if you look at the history, we have a lot of hardware we sold. As we did more hosting, we sold less hardware and we kind of -- we got into device reselling as a way to kind of bring that back up, because we like that revenue stream and the strategy of being the one-stop shop. I think at this point, relative to the quarter, I think it's more just the marketplace and what was getting done out from the people that we're reselling, I think it can be a variety of things, both the market is still active. So I think it's more the technology and maybe some of our suppliers that we work with are rolling out new platforms that can lead to a pause in the buyers buying the next new thing. I think we're getting hit with that as much as anything else. So I think in that case, we kind of are level setting and resetting to the Q1 level, though using that as a place where we expect to grow from. So I don't think it's -- that that's all gone away. I think there's a cyclical nature to this stuff that we probably haven't seen enough history to know about. And I think now that we're seeing that history, we're level setting our expectations. So okay, Q1 lower level, we expect it to grow as we continue on through the rest of the year and we'll give you some -- give you updates, obviously, each quarter, as to where we stand on that.","Zane M. Burke","And George, this is Zane. I think you've seen some variability on the upside for this as well. So some of the over attainment on the upside that didn't necessary fall to the bottom line as well in terms -- because of the low margins in prior quarters. I think you see they reverse here. So there is some variability in that.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser from Morgan Stanley.","Zachary William Sopcak - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","This is Zach Sopchak in for Ricky. I wanted to ask first just about the trend of the hospital consolidation, what you've talked about in the past and mentioned there was accelerating here. And I was just curious, when you think about consolidation of hospitals, what kind of that maybe using a Cerner system, how should we think about a lag between when a Cerner hospital purchases another hospital and when you might actually see that business come through?","Zane M. Burke","This is Zane, Zach. It's a -- each situation is going to be unique and relative to that client strategy on how they -- whether they've developed a standard for their organization or whether they're contemplating using multiple platforms moving forward and where they are in the maturation of themselves that are the pure IDN in creating scale around that. Those that have developed standardization and have that as part of their core methodology and logic, I think you can expect that to drive growth in a 12- to 18-month window from when the acquisition closes, and you're seeing that in some of our activities to date. Those that have yet to mature in that space and really create a standard across their enterprise, I think that will be a longer-term benefit for us.","Zachary William Sopcak - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And then just 1 follow-up on that, too. You also talked about 7 of the top 10 systems are on Cerner, but there are 300 site opportunity, at least 300, that aren't at it. What drives that differential? Is it just legacy, acquisitions that haven't had a chance yet? Or is there some technical reasons why they may not have switched yet?","Zane M. Burke","It's mostly -- it's a legacy element and a -- and some parts of those are strategies where at one point in time they may have had a 2-supplier strategy going in. Maybe Cerner on the high end and someone else on the lower end. And then what they've learned over time is that Cerner, when you create a standard and use the scale of what we do and what they do, we can scale to -- across all of their enterprises. And so we've seen that play out in several scenarios, and that's part of where we see that. We also see some other elements where it's a prove your model. So prove that this works and -- so create some larger pilots and then be successful on those larger pilots and then we anticipate rolling out throughout the enterprise that way. So there's a couple of different flavors there.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Richard Close from Avondale Partners.","Richard C. Close - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","On the 800 docs revenue cycle ambulatory, can you talk a little bit how that gets booked? Is it just like 1 year worth of collections you estimate and that goes into bookings? Just talk a little bit about that and how we should think about that going forward, if you expand the revenue cycle for ambulatory?","Zane M. Burke","Richard, this is Zane again. It's very similar to what we do on the -- in a full RevWorks model here. So in this particular case, it's a full outsourcing deal for a several year period. And so it's reflective of that several year revenue cycle take over that particular business office. So given the size and nature of this organization, they had a pretty significant business office on the ambulatory side that we're taking over.","Richard C. Close - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","And were they using your ambulatory product?","Zane M. Burke","They were using our -- in this case, they were using our EMR solution. This also includes the selection of our revenue cycle solution on the ambulatory side.","Richard C. Close - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And a quick question for Marc. On the G&A, the growth, I guess, 20% year-over-year, if I'm looking at that. Was there anything onetime in there? Or can you talk a little bit about the G&A expense in the quarter and then going forward the remainder of the year?","Marc G. Naughton","Yes. Nothing unique in it, just we're getting to be a bigger company. We've got some higher level of personnel that are coded as administrative in nature. And then obviously, some of the amortization from the acquisitions we've done is going to be driving that number. But it'll be consistent going forward. It's not going to -- it's not a onetime hit that will come back out.","Richard C. Close - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","So modeling, look at about 7% of total revenue, that's a good ballpark? Am I looking at that right?","Marc G. Naughton","Yes, without looking at the numbers right in front of me, I think if that's consistent kind of with what this quarter was, then that would be an appropriate level.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Sandy Draper.","Alexander  Y. Draper - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","My question, Marc, is on the R&D side and your comments around in a couple of years, or a year to 2 years, tailing off on some of the using the outside people. I know that means your cap rate goes down. Would that mean your absolute software dollar cost would actually drop? Or you're just thinking moderated growth once you start to build -- to leave those -- let those go off?","Marc G. Naughton","Yes, Sandy. I think if you kind of do the math, you're going to have a period that we've talked about where we're going to be spending more money to get to our -- to go down our innovation roadmap at a quicker pace. That is going to create, obviously, capitalized software, and that software will start to amortize kind of in that next 12 to 18 to 24 month period. So as we start reducing the dollar cost of those people that are working on those projects and being capitalized, you'll start to see the amortization kick in as those projects go GA. Obviously, the goal is to get those projects to go GA faster and so that will start kicking in. So overall, the expense side, the net expense will grow and continue to grow, but when you do look at the gross dollars and then go through the cap and then the amortization, that growth is going to be kicked off a lot -- the amortization hitting us will be driving that growth more than the savings that we're going to realize because those people aren't here anymore. So there'll be a tail to them and their work, as we capitalize and amortize it. So it will be kind of a continual growth in that spend.","Alexander  Y. Draper - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And second question is maybe for Zane and maybe as well, Marc. When I talked to hospital executives across the board, whether it's CIOs, CFOs, CEOs, I would characterize it probably that it's the highest anxiety level I've heard in the close to 20 years I've been dealing with healthcare. Some of the things that Zane, Marc, commented on earlier sounds like it's a positive. Is it actually accelerating anything in terms of sales process? Or are there times where people are getting that \"I'm so confused that I know I need to do something, I'm slowing down?\" I'm just wondering is there any pace of change in the sales process because of this really high level of anxiety?","Zane M. Burke","This is Zane. It's actually creating, in many cases, buying behavior. And I think it's part of what Mike was referencing in some of his comments around the pipeline for things like ITWorks. Because they recognize there is so much work that needs to be done to get them ready for this new world. So I agree with you, Sandy, on the anxiety component. There's so much work that needs to be done, and they have -- they're facing cost pressures, et cetera. So how do they go about doing all that work? How do they get to where they need to be in terms of having access to all the information across the continuum of care given their current structures, given their current spend on that? And what we offer in terms of ITWorks perspective is the ability to come in and scale, to move them much more quickly than they would ever be able to move themselves and get to the other place in a way that has got a much more predictable cost model to it. So it's providing a level of assurance in terms of both cost and quality and we can deliver a lot more in terms of solutions. So it's a perfect example of where that anxiety is creating buying behavior. And so we're seeing things like the ITWorks come together much more quickly than they have in the past, and I would say that's going to be also true around the revenue cycle side that I think we'll see some accelerated elements around the RevWorks, around that.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Jamie Stockton from Wells Fargo.","Jamie Stockton - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Maybe just 2 quick ones. Zane, the 300 hospitals that you say are within those large health systems that are partially using Cerner today, my assumption is that a lot of those hospitals are meeting Meaningful Use with some other systems. So I'd be curious to get your view on kind of how those hospitals are going to transition off of those other systems now that they're having to continually meet these usage thresholds. Are the hospitals thinking \"hey we're going to move aggressively before we try to go to Stage 2\" in many instances? Or are they thinking \"let's get through this period where we're getting the incentive payments and then start to make the transition for these legacy systems\"?","Zane M. Burke","I think it's a blend on that. So there are a few where we are -- you have to obviously stage it out, right, so they'll say \"we're going to get to Stage 1 on our current supplier and then the plan is to get to Stage 2 on Cerner\". We have some that are now saying \"we'll get to Stage 2 on our current supplier, knowing what those rules look like and their level of comfort. But we need to do Stage 3 on Cerner.\" So we begin to plan for that and as particularly, these -- many of these are, like all of them, are very large entities where it takes multiple years to roll it out and so oftentimes, you're having a -- you have a plan that is reflective of the complexity of those organizations, and so you've got to go target the ones that are most at risk in terms of -- the sites that are most at risk, get those in the model, knowing that you're going to have your rollout in those scenarios. Does that make sense?","Jamie Stockton - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Sure. And then maybe just a quick follow-up, Marc, the sales and client service expense was down sequentially, I think it's been maybe 4 years since that's happened given how much your works businesses have been ramping. Can you talk about whether like there is new seasonality again that's going to be impacting that? Or was there anything unusual that caused that to be high in the fourth quarter or abnormally low this quarter?","Marc G. Naughton","Yes. I don't -- I think when you look at -- it's probably a combination of more things like depreciation, lower bad debt, hitting some of that stuff. There's nothing in the business, we're pretty much have continued to grow that workforce on the services side and continue to have the demand for their services. So there's nothing in the model that would -- and nothing I see that would say that there's a pause that's going on in the sales and client services component of that. So there's nothing in the business that would -- other than just those non-cash items that would impact it.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of David Larsen from Leerink Swann.","David Larsen - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Zane, I think you mentioned that you won a large site going head-to-head with one of your main competitors due to population health. Can you just give an example of what drove that decision or specific functionality within your population health system? Is it like the ability to look at pods by physician? Is it nutrition? And then, it sounds like you're hiring a lot of developers to build more software within population health. Can you just sort of give a little more granularity on that, please?","Zane M. Burke","Well, I'll give you some granularity around the individual opportunity and then see if Mike has some comments he'd like to make around the engineers on that and what they're doing. Around this particular opportunity, what they saw is that we were the first and only organization that came with a plan for the entire enterprise, and so a layer that's above all systems that are out there, whether they're Cerner or non-Cerner Solutions. In addition to that, they also were very intrigued by what we're doing from a value perspective and how we think about the different cost improvement initiatives that we could do in the interim time period, as well in our Lighthouse solutions. And so the 2 key elements was really that we weren't just an EMR organization, that we were working towards a bigger objective, and that bigger objective, the solution that we're proposing is different than what is out there from anyone else where there are a bunch of little niche piece parts and ours is actually an architecture for an entire enterprise and an entire system along that line, and that's what was very attractive to that organization. Mike?","Michael C. Neal","Yes, I think Zane covered it fairly well. This is Mike. I think the fundamental difference is, our approach is not a singular closed environment. We recognize that it's going to be a heterogeneous environment. And we need to build an architecture that allows us to aggregate data across a variety of sources and provide answers across the full continuum of care. I think they recognized that Cerner had not only a vision but a development plan to produce that and our competition did not.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Steve Halper with Lazard Capital Markets.","Steven P. Halper - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Just a quick housekeeping question. Marc, you indicated what you thought the quarterly CapEx would be for the remainder of the year, $50 million to $60 million a quarter. Can you sort of give the same absolute dollar number in terms of cap software recognizing that the percentage of the total is going to be higher than it normally is, but what dollar amounts are you looking at?","Marc G. Naughton","Well, I think, as we go through the year, Steve, that you're going to see CapEx relative to software will probably increase as we're kind of spending some more money in that space. So that will go up a little bit. I think if you're kind of trying to get the view of the cash flow and the free cash flow, I think for 2013 that we'd expect, with all the investment we're making, both on our new Kansas campus, capitalized software, other CapEx, that we be at or slightly above kind of what we did in 2012. So the 425 we delivered there. I think that's -- be our expectations, to be slightly above that for the year, keeping all the CapEx elements in mind. And that obviously refers to us spending on the Kansas campus, it's relatively high. That spending continues kind of through early '14, but then drops off once we complete that campus, so we would expect to kind of return to more recent levels of free cash flow generation relative to net income at that point. But I think that for '13, because of the investment, we'd probably look to be at last year's level or slightly higher than last year's level.","Steven P. Halper - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Right. But your expectation is that you're done with the campus on -- in the first quarter of 2014 and so your '14 free cash flow should be that much higher as that sort of winds down and you go back into more of a maintenance mode on the CapEx side?","Marc G. Naughton","Yes. We move into that -- the second building and final building on that campus in Q1 of '14. So there'll be probably some payments that come after that. But for the most part, that will be done certainly either first quarter or first half of the year.","Steven P. Halper - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","And when should the -- this elevated level of capitalized software start to ease as well?","Marc G. Naughton","As we said, the effort we're using related to the consultant component is kind of a 12 to 24 months. So we would expect it to continue into '14, but probably see that dropping down dramatically as we go into '15.","Neal L. Patterson","Okay. So, this is Neal. I'm going to do the close here. Marc wanted to do the close and talk more about tech resale, but I thought that was probably -- he's probably done enough here.","So just kind of zooming out here. We wake up every morning kind of at the intersection of healthcare and information technology. Probably the 2 most dynamic sectors in our society. And it's an exciting place to be. We built a fairly broad-based global kind of business platform and a broad set of business models to basically provide a set of solutions and services to healthcare.","Our clients, particularly in the U.S., but for the most part worldwide, have -- there is a lot of anxiety out there. There is an unquestioned attack on their revenues. Most of them feel huge pressures on reducing their kind of unit cost and the cost of their cost structures, and they're getting a tremendous amount of mandates on quality and most of the mandates have basically penalties, economic penalties if they don't meet them.","So there's just an awful lot of dynamics out there. It's going to be a very exciting kind of deck into this decade and there's going to be a lot of change. So we're going to be bold about how we approach it. We have -- I'm pretty sure we have the largest IT development organization in the world. And as you can tell from our numbers and from our comments, we're accelerating the growth of that. It's an example of our boldness.","We are on the physician side of the physician experience. We're basically attempting to leapfrog how physicians use technology. Quite bold. You can see in our works models a fair amount of boldness kind of how we are defining what we think our clients will need currently and in the future. And we grow organizations that are world-class to go -- to provide that service.","So -- and you can see from the CommonWell Alliance that we use our leadership position in the industry for the greater good, but also to basically highlight where basically we have bad actors around subjects such as interoperability.","So we're going to continue to be bold. We think there is an awful lot of opportunity. We think we're pretty -- we have a high-quality organization, and we think we have a lot of opportunity the rest of this decade. So thanks for your time and look forward to our next visit.","Operator","Thank you for joining today's conference. This concludes the presentation. You can now disconnect your lines.

The revenue composition for Q2 was $333 million in system sales, $257 million in support and maintenance, $604 million in services, and $22 million in reimbursed travel.","System sales revenue for the quarter was up 6% compared to Q2 of 2015, with strong growth in software being partially offset by a decline in hardware. While hardware did decline year over year against a tough comparable, it was up sequentially and in line with expected levels. Looking at system sales margins, it was up 150 basis points over last year, reflecting strong software and lower hardware.","Moving to services, total services revenue, including professional and managed services, was up 12% compared to Q2 of 2015. This is in line with our expectations and continues to reflect good execution by our service organizations. Support and maintenance revenue increased 1% over Q2 of 2015, reflecting a tough comparable. Support and maintenance is up 5% year to date, and we expect similar mid-single-digit growth for the rest of the year.","Looking at revenue by geographic segment, domestic revenue increased 8% over the year-ago quarter to $1.073 billion, and non-U.S. revenue grew 9% to $143 million.","Moving to gross margin, our gross margin for Q2 was 83.1%, which is up from 82.9% in Q2 of 2015, reflecting strong software and services and lower hardware.","I'll now discuss spending, operating margin, and net earnings. For these items, we provide both GAAP and adjusted or non-GAAP results. The adjusted results exclude share-based compensation expense, Health Services-related amortization, acquisition-related deferred revenue, and other acquisition-related adjustments which are detailed and reconciled to GAAP net earnings in our earnings release.","Looking at operating spending, our second quarter GAAP operating expenses were $769 million compared to $762 million in the year-ago period. Adjusted operating expenses were $721 million, which is up 9% compared to Q2 of 2015. This growth was primarily driven by growth in personnel expense related to revenue-generating associates. The total year-over-year change for each expense category in Q2 on an adjusted basis was 13% growth for sales and client service, a 2% decline in software development, 6% growth for G&A, and amortization of acquisition related intangibles was down 12%.","Moving to operating margins, our Q2 GAAP operating margin was 19.8% compared to 15.3% in the year-ago period. Our adjusted operating margin was 23.8% in Q2, which is down slightly from 24.2% in the year-ago period. This is in line with our previous indication that we expect margin expansion to be limited in 2016, but we do continue to believe we can expand margins 50 to 100 basis points annually after 2016.","Moving to net earnings and EPS, our GAAP net earnings in Q2 were $166 million or $0.48 per diluted share. Adjusted net earnings were $199 million. And adjusted diluted EPS was $0.58, which is up 12% compared to Q2 of 2015. The Q2 tax rate was 32%, which is in line with our expected range of 32% to 33%.","Now I'll move to our balance sheet. We ended Q2 with $720 million of total cash and investments, which is up slightly from $707 million in Q1, with most of our free cash flow being used to repurchase shares. During the quarter we executed $50 million in stock repurchases, buying back 938,000 shares at an average price of $53.30. Year to date we have purchased 3.7 million shares at an average price of $53.41, for a total of $200 million out of the $300 million stock repurchase program authorized in March of this year.","Moving to debt, our total debt, including capital lease obligations, is $585 million, which is down slightly compared to Q1.","Total receivables ended the quarter at $983 million, which is up $42 million from Q1. Our Q2 DSO was 74 days, which is an improvement of two days compared to Q1 and seven days better than a year ago.","Operating cash flow for the quarter was $255 million, up from $109 million in Q2 of 2015 and down from $327 million in Q1. The sequential decline is driven mostly by timing of tax payments and an extra payroll in Q2. Year-to-date operating cash flow of $582 million reflects strong growth over $323 million of operating cash flow in the first half of last year.","Q2 capital expenditures were $118 million and capitalized software was $80 million. Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less capital purchases and capitalized software development costs, was $57 million for the quarter. This is up compared to negative free cash flow in Q2 of 2015 and down from a very strong Q1 2016 due to lower operating cash flow and higher capital spending related to construction on our new campus. Year-to-date free cash flow of $209 million is in line with our expectations, and we expect solid free cash flow for the rest of the year, even with spending on our campus remaining elevated. Next year we expect a decline in capital expenditures, resulting in stronger free cash flow.","Now I'll go through Q3 and full-year 2016 guidance. For Q3, we expect revenue between $1.2 billion and $1.275 billion, with the midpoint reflecting growth of 10% over Q3 of 2015. For the full year, we expect revenue between $4.9 billion and $5.0 billion. This range reflects a tightening of our previous range, mostly to capture the lower hardware revenue in the first half of the year, but is still 12% full-year growth at the midpoint.","We expect Q3 diluted EPS to be $0.59 to $0.61 per share, with the midpoint reflecting 11% growth over Q3 of 2015. For the full year, we continue to expect adjusted diluted EPS to be $2.30 to $2.40, with the midpoint reflecting 11% growth over 2015.","Moving to bookings guidance, we expect bookings revenue in Q3 of $1.45 billion to $1.6 billion. The midpoint reflects a slight decline from Q3 2015, which was 44% higher than Q3 of 2014, and is by far the toughest comparable period from last year. The midpoint will still put year-to-date bookings above 2015 and we expect growth in Q4 as well, so we are still on track for our stated goal of full-year growth over what was a very strong 2015.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Zane.","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","Thanks, Marc. Good afternoon, everyone. Today I'll provide color on our results and make some marketplace observations.","Our bookings were a record for a Q2 and only second to our all-time high bookings of Q3 2015. As Marc indicated, our total bookings grew 9% despite lower contributions from long-term bookings from last year. The 28% of Q2 2016 bookings from long-term reflects contributions from both ITWorks and managed services, but were still below the elevated level of 35% in Q2 of 2015. The non-long-term portion of Q2 2016 bookings grew 20%, reflecting strong levels of solution and services sales both into our base and to new clients.","Bookings this quarter included several large contracts, with 45 contracts over $5 million, including 28 over $10 million. Thirty-four percent of bookings this quarter came from outside our core Millennium installed base. This high level of new business is a result of an active replacement market and ongoing success against our primary competitor. The keys to our success continue to be our improved solutions, predictable delivery capabilities, lower cost of ownership, ability to deliver value, and our population health and open platform capabilities. I believe we compare favorably to our primary competitor in all of these areas, and this was reflected in our win rate.","Overall, I believe Cerner is viewed as the safe choice for our current solution needs as well as the best positioned supplier to help clients achieve value from their investments and position them for success as the market shifts from a focus on care to a focus on health and wellness.","A good example of the opportunity in the marketplace and our competitiveness was Covenant Health selecting Cerner, which we announced last week. Covenant Health is a 1,900-bed health system based in eastern Tennessee, with 10 hospitals and nearly 100 ambulatory facilities. They will be deploying Cerner Millennium EHR and clinically-driven revenue cycle solutions as well as the HealtheIntent population health solutions across all venues of care. Cerner's integrated solutions across clinical and revenue cycle and acute and ambulatory, proven ability to deliver value at a predictable cost, and our population health capabilities were important differentiators for us when competing for this business.","Looking ahead, we believe the replacement market will remain active given the high number of hospitals on legacy platforms, many of which are being sunset. This opportunity is reflected in our leading indicators within our new business pipeline and sales activities at all-time highs.","Now I'll discuss Revenue Cycle. We had another great quarter. All new EHR clients included Revenue Cycle as part of their purchase, reflecting a continued focus by the market on clinically-driven revenue cycle. This preference was also reflected in ongoing success in our installed base, with several more large clients choosing Cerner for acute revenue cycle and ambulatory business office services.","In addition to a very strong quarter, we also made a great addition to our executive team. As we announced in July, Jeff Hurst will be joining Cerner on September 1 as Senior Vice President of Cerner Revenue Cycle Management and President of Cerner RevWorks. This is a new position, and the existing Revenue Cycle and RevWorks teams will report to Jeff. Jeff comes to us from Florida Hospital, a 2,700-bed acute care medical facility that is a member of the Adventist Health System, where he directed all financial and clinical revenue cycle functions and had responsibility for key organizational strategies. He is a respected industry thought leader and proven executive, and he brings an important provider perspective to Cerner.","As you know, we have made significant investments in Revenue Cycle that have led to very strong growth in recent years. Our hiring of Jeff is an indication that we believe we are still in the early stages of a significant growth opportunity as we help our clients navigate the rapidly evolving reimbursement landscape and that we're investing in talent that will help us capitalize on this opportunity and to contribute to the success of our clients.","Now I'll shift to discussing our Population Health business, where we had a great quarter. We added several new clients to the HealtheIntent platform, and we also expanded the scope of population health solutions at some of our largest existing clients. Our comprehensive approach to Population Health remains differentiated in the marketplace, and we continue to add solutions to the HealtheIntent platform. I believe we'll continue to displace numerous niche offerings because of the power of the platform and the ability to integrate with the EHR workflow.","The volume of clients that have purchased initial solutions on our HealtheIntent platform is impressive. We recently passed the 100-client milestone. We believe this positions us for a significant ramp in revenue in the coming years, as these clients add more solutions and lives to the platform, which will increase the per-member per-month [PMPM] rate and number of members. We expect the driver of this to be ongoing shifts in reimbursement that are leading to more risk assumption by our clients. And we believe the shift away from traditional fee-for-service is gaining momentum, with the Medicare Access and Chip Reauthorization Act, or MACRA, and the new merit-based incentive payment systems ramping in coming years as CMS continues its focus on value and quality payments.","Moving to the ambulatory market, where we had record results with strength in ambulatory EHR, practice management, and business office services, similar to recent quarters, our results include some of the largest acute care clients choosing Cerner's clinical and revenue cycle solutions for their ambulatory settings.","We also had a strong quarter in the small hospital market. Our cloud-based CommunityWorks offering continues to be competitive against all niche small hospital vendors. A recent noteworthy win for CommunityWorks was the displacement of a failed attempted go-live by a cloud-based vendor that has been making a push in recent years to expand from the ambulatory market to hospitals. We have several active opportunities to displace this same competitor in both ambulatory and small hospital settings, suggesting their approach of spending about three times as much on much sales and marketing as they do on research and development may not be the most effective approach for their clients.","Outside the U.S., despite some macroeconomic headwinds, we had a good quarter. Non-U.S. revenue grew 9% year over year, with noteworthy areas of strength including Australia, Germany, and the Middle East. As Michael discussed, the Middle East strength included ITWorks, which is a positive sign as it highlights a largely untapped global opportunity for ITWorks.","In summary, I'm pleased with our execution in Q2 and believe we are well-positioned to have a good second half of the year.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike.","Michael R. Nill - Cerner Corp.","Thanks, Zane. Good afternoon, everyone. Today I'm going to discuss ITWorks and Cerner's Model Experience initiative.","I'll start with ITWorks. We had a good quarter with one new ITWorks client, a large expansion with an existing client, and very strong sales back into our client base. Regarding our new client, this client is not only new to ITWorks, but they are a new EHR client as well, and the EHR win displaces our primary competitor.","The client is a new children's hospital in Dubai that was scheduled to implement our primary competitor's solution, but concluded Cerner is a better choice to meet their needs. Our ability to work quickly in order to enable them to be ready for the hospital scheduled opening date as well as provide full IT services through ITWorks were both key factors in us being selected. In addition, the success we've had with another client in the region was very helpful in demonstrating the value of the ITWorks model, something our competitor does not offer.","Looking ahead, our pipeline for ITWorks is significant and includes some very large clients. While the timing of ITWorks deals has been lumpy and will likely continue to be, we are confident it will remain a strong contributor to our growth. The value proposition to our clients is very appealing, especially in an environment where they have pressure on operating costs, limited access to IT talent, and increasing pressure in light of the industry issues related to security.","Now I would like to briefly discuss an initiative we call Model Experience. The Model Experience is an extension of the model system, which we have discussed in the past. The Model Experience represents a meaningful shift in our approach to implement our solutions, workflows, and standards at our client sites that presents all of Cerner's standards and content within a controlled environment, where the best practice for workflows and the latest capabilities are captured. Then each client system can be optimized based upon their specific needs.","The Model Experience goes beyond just focusing on the EHR. It also provides clients optimal recommendations for leveraging HealtheIntent, Millennium, and CareAware solutions. In addition, the Model Experience uses a continuous advancement approach for adopting recommendations, which ensures our clients will continuously be able to maximize the value of our solutions.","In summary, I believe the Model Experience positions us well for our clients to achieve value from their existing investments and keep up with the rapidly evolving healthcare landscape.","With that, I'll turn the call over to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question or comment comes from the line of Charles Rhyee from Cowen. Your line is open.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thanks, guys, for taking the question. Hey, I wanted to talk about the small hospital market. And clearly you're indicating that you're having a lot of success here downstream in the market. What are the characteristics that these smaller hospitals are looking for right now? And what do you think is right now really differentiating? Is it the ability to still retain control over how they workflow and how they practice delivering care, or can you talk about some of the characteristics when you're in discussions with them? Thanks.","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","Thanks, Charles. This is Zane. The characteristics are pretty straightforward. Healthcare is complex no matter how small the organization is. And so having the depth of a Millennium and Cerner full functioning system, our ability to deliver in a cloud-based environment, which allows us to have a lower total cost of ownership and a very fixed and predictable model is very appealing because they need a full functioning solution set to be able to be delivered in a cost-effective manner. And so those were the key criteria. Many of them are in a situation where they are forced to leave their legacy provider, and so they're looking for a replacement that takes them to a safe place as well as put them in good standing from the long stead to connect in the evolving marketplace for healthcare.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC","That's helpful. And, Marc, if I can talk about how that flows into the model, when you're selling down into the small hospital market in a cloud-based platform, is it a subscription model and does that show up in the long-term bookings, or is it because it's still a software sale, even if it's a subscription, it's not counted in that part of the bucket in bookings? Thanks.","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","All right, this is Zane. It is a typical hosting software license arrangement. Sometimes the models are \u2013 and it will include subscriptions as well, so it's our full functioning Millennium solution set that has all the attributes that that would have. The financial model maybe from a financing perspective may look different. But as it relates to bookings, it's going to flow through our model the same way.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay, that's helpful. Thanks.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","The long-term component is smaller because hosting is not as big a component of those deals.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay, that's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Ross Muken from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Ross Muken - Evercore Group LLC","Good afternoon, guys. I'm curious. In terms of the pacing of operating margin expansion throughout the year or what's contemplated in the second half guide, can you just help us understand in the face of what you do with revenue for the full year, how to think about the other mechanics that would get us to the upper end of the earnings range for the year?","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","This is Marc. I think the key thing relative to the revenue guidance was taking out the hardware component, the lower hardware that we've seen earlier in the year, and then flowing that through the rest. And that's why we took the higher end off the revenue.","I think as we roll forward, we still have a year where we expect our margins to be relatively flat year over year, and I think that's what we're seeing and what we're delivering. And I think that's still our expectations as we roll through. Obviously, to the extent that we increase our higher margin elements of the business, software, et cetera, there's a chance to increase the operating margins. But I think overall, given the mix we have, which feels like a pretty good mix between services, software, and the rest of our business, I don't know that we're going to have a big change in 2016 relative to margin expansion.","I feel very good as we roll into 2017 you'll start to see us get back on the track of the 50 to 100 basis points of margin expansion that you've seen us historically be able to do. But that's right now our view as we look out at the second half of the year. And given our guidance for Q3, I think we'd be relatively flat year over year as we continue to see basically low double-digit revenue growth.","Ross Muken - Evercore Group LLC","That's helpful. I guess what I was implying is it seems like it implies a little bit of improvement just because you've been down in the first part of this year that thus the second half has to have a little bit more expansion. But I guess one other quick thing, so on the international business, it looks like that improved sequentially. Maybe a little bit more color where you're seeing some of the demand there, and then I guess how you're thinking about that pacing through the rest of the year because the comps I think ease a little bit there.","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","This is Zane, Ross. As we mentioned in my comments, we saw strength in several areas. But heavily the Middle East, as referenced in Mike's commentary around the ITWorks perspective, and Germany as well we saw good performance there. And I think the piece around the Middle East is very pleasing given the price of oil in that marketplace. And really it's a proof point of the really good work that's being done by the teams in the Middle East as well as what some of that client had seen here by some of the ITWorks opportunities here that we've work within the U.S. So I think that model will continue to create good opportunities for us across the globe.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","This is Marc. I think we also see in some of our traditional markets, Australia, Canada, we've seen some activity beginning to percolate in the UK, which is a positive compared to where they've been. So the one place that's not growing a lot more post-HS, Germany is doing well, but overall Europe is still an area we think should grow as those economies recover. So we were pleased certainly with the Middle East activity this quarter.","Ross Muken - Evercore Group LLC","Great, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Sean Dodge from Jefferies. Your line is open.","Sean Dodge - Jefferies LLC","Good afternoon, thanks. So it sounds like you guys have been selling lots of Revenue Cycle software, but it's been a little while since we've seen a RevWorks deal signed. Can you talk about what's holding those back, and maybe more broadly the demand you're seeing for some of the intermediate stuff, the Extended Business Office services?","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","Sure, this is Zane. I think you hit the nail on the head in terms of we've seen great market opportunity around the business software services for physicians, and then really the extended business software services, doing more services along those lines. The growth has been very good in both of those areas.","As it relates to full outsourcing, we've really taken an approach of digesting the clients that we have and really being focused on making sure that the next opportunity is a really good one for us. And we view the EBO services and the business software services as a great entree into the future of those Revenue Cycle opportunities. So we still see full revenue cycle outsourcing as a good marketplace for us, but we think it will grow into those markets over time through the business office service and the EBO, which have been very strong in demand.","Sean Dodge - Jefferies LLC","Okay. And then on the third quarter bookings guidance, Marc, as you mentioned, you guys are lapping a really big comp there. There was a large ITWorks and professional services contract that was previously discussed and flipped out of the fourth quarter. Are either or both of those assumed in the target?","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","No, there's no anticipation that you're going to see our long-term bookings percentage do anything different as you did last year. We saw some mid-30%, even higher percent for long term. This year we've been below 30%. I think 30% is probably our target, so I think that's what you're going to see relative to bookings. We don't anticipate any large spikes from any deals that we've talked about before. Those deals are still out there, but I don't know that Q3 is the timing for either of those at this point.","Sean Dodge - Jefferies LLC","Very good, thanks for the color.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Greg Bolan from Avondale Partners. Your line is open.","Greg Bolan - Avondale Partners LLC","Hey, thanks for taking the question. So as I think about the \u2013 Marc, you talked about setting up well for margin expansion in 2017. Could you maybe just walk us through the variables, the stars that you see aligning to set it up for margin expansion next year?","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Yes, and I think for us the key is continuing seeing the demand in the marketplace, obviously, continuing to be able to sell software and sell the high-margin elements of the business that we have been seeing. If hardware continues to be at the current level once we get through \u2013 that's actually assuming we can continue to grow the margins double-digits, which we expect to do, that should improve the overall margin.","Historically, you've seen us leverage our spend. You've seen us leverage R&D growth relative to revenue growth. And those are the drivers that will kick in that you've seen traditionally for us that are driving some of that growth. I think even in our businesses, as we do the business model slide every year, you see slight increases in contribution margins from each of those. So if you really just look at our size and the expense components, if you grow R&D slower than revenue and you grow SG&A slower than revenue, it gets you 50 to 100 basis points. So really as long as we do those two things, we should get back on track.","Greg Bolan - Avondale Partners LLC","Okay, that's perfect. And then just lastly, Zane, you broke up for a minute there. With regards to \u2013 did you mention just with regards to the RFP pipeline or the business pipeline, I think you said all-time high or I can't \u2013 you gave some color. Can you just repeat what you said?","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","Sure, Mike. And my comments were the new business pipeline is at an all-time high, as are our key leading indicators for all sales activities.","Greg Bolan - Avondale Partners LLC","Okay, got it. And that's across both the inpatient and the ambulatory side of the equation?","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","That's across our entire business, so it's a gross pipeline number.","Greg Bolan - Avondale Partners LLC","Okay, got it. Okay, thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Donald Hooker from KeyBanc. Your line is open.","Donald H. Hooker - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Great, good afternoon. So you guys had great success it seems like displacing competitors, and you see that clearly in your data. I guess my question is, do the economics I guess with the second go-round of hospitals and physicians looking at their core software and systems, now that we're in round two I guess, is there a change in the economics of the deal in any way in terms of pricing? Are there more milestones? Are there more contingencies in the deals?","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","This is Zane. In terms of the economics, they're fairly similar in terms of economics. And depending on the situation that the client is getting out of, you may end up having some more milestone elements and some things around the contracts that may be a little more challenging for those that have failed to deliver. So, sometimes you pay \u2013 you have to account for the fact that there have been past failures by others. But for the most part, we're not seeing that broadly in our contracts to date.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","I'd say \u2013 this is Marc. I'd say the milestones \u2013 we referenced those maybe a quarter or two ago for some very distinct contracts that had the flavor that Zane talked about. Really since then, I can't recall any one that's had a milestone that was of any significance that would have impacted what we did. I think certainly they want to make sure that they're getting what they're paying for. Luckily, our reputation and our ability to deliver is minimizing the contractual requirements that we have that would impact the financials for the most part.","Donald H. Hooker - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Got you. And then if I may diverge and ask another question about CommunityWorks and the small hospital market, which seems interesting, I know you guys are generating business there both by displacing competitors and I guess migrating Health Services clients as well. Roughly speaking, how much of your growth there is one versus the other? Is it mainly migrating Health Services clients, or is it more displacing competitors? If you could, give us a rough sense of the market.","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","Sure, this is Zane. It's actually coming mostly from the displacement of other competitors. We have had great success on the Health Services migrations on the lower end of the marketplace. And our win rate for those is in the high 90% \u2013 90th percentile for that client base. It's been very successful, but the bulk of it is coming at the expense of replacing our competitors.","Donald H. Hooker - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","And that business is growing, obviously.","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","And that business has continued to grow. We're on track for our best year yet.","Donald H. Hooker - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Steve Halper from FBR. Your line is open.","Steven P. Halper - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Hi. As you sign HealtheIntent contracts, what percentage is on a PMPM basis versus a traditional software model?","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Steve, right now 100% of those are being signed on a PMPM basis. Once again, a lot of them are smaller pilots. But we want to introduce that payment model because the advantage to us from that model is as they expand PMPM for the applications they have signed up for, as they expand applications and they expand members, PMPM naturally grows that revenue stream. So that's why we go to market that way.","Steven P. Halper - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","And do the clients ask for a traditional software model, or is it just not an option?","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","This is Zane, Steve. What you'll see is, once you educate people through the difference in what they need over time because the content is ever changing, the hosted element of it, it's a true cloud-based platform. So it doesn't have the same characteristics as their former models have had. And most of our clients are getting comfortable with that type of model for cloud-based offerings.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","And much of the revenue they're expecting to generate or be helped by the system, they're getting paid in some form or fashion based on the number. So aligning the payments to their revenue stream is pretty logical to them.","Steven P. Halper - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","And so as you sign more \u2013 last question, as you sign more of these contracts on a PMPM basis, at what point do you start disclosing them? At what point do they become significant at least in the business model view that you would provide once a year? Do you have a timeframe for that?","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Steve, I don't have a timeframe in my head. I think when it becomes a big enough number that it makes a difference from the analysis. But once again, because of the size of most of these deals, we haven't reached there. And I don't know that I can give you a date by which we will reach that. But certainly when it becomes something that is notable. And the likelihood is when it gets to a level where it becomes notable, it's going to be on a fairly high growth trajectory.","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","And just a little color, we did have two deals that were actually in our significant bookings. So if you look at those contracts over $5 million, we had two Population Health deals which are over the $5 million mark. So we are seeing some increase in the size of those opportunities as well.","Unknown Speaker","Over time...","Steven P. Halper - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","So you calculate some sort of \u2013 I guess you have a time-based contract and you calculate the PMPM off of that, the full length of the contract?","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","They're committed per member per month.","Steven P. Halper - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Over however \u2013 whatever timeframe, whether it be five, seven, or 10 years?","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","The term of their agreement, which is typically a three to five-year agreement.","Steven P. Halper - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Got it. Okay, that's helpful. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of George Hill from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey, guys. Good afternoon and thanks for taking the question. I guess, Zane, if we talk about the Health Services base, typically in M&A in the space you see it. It accelerates the go-forward decision-making process. What percentage of the Health Services base do you think has made a go-forward platform decision, and what has the retention there looked like?","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","George, I don't have the exact numbers handy in terms as it relates to the exact numbers that have made a go-forward decision, so I'll have to provide that to you later.","As it relates to the win rates, I can tell you that we modeled out as part of the acquisition where we anticipated what our win rates would look like, and those have mirrored what our expectations have been almost exactly in terms of where we thought we would end up, both on the smaller end of the spectrum to the larger end of the spectrum. So our win rate has been actually quite high on the low end. And then on the larger upper end, it's been \u2013 it's a little bit north of our traditional win rate.","George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then, Marc, I guess my quick follow-up would be \u2013 it sounds like the retention has been in line with expectations, but we know that there has been some churn. I guess can you talk me through the synergy delivery and have the synergies on the deal thus far have been delivered, or has some of the churn in the client base eaten away at some of the synergy opportunity? And I guess I'm just trying to think about returns on the deal and whether or not the deal is measuring up to expectations.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Sure, keep in mind; certainly when we bought them and closed, there were already a small group of clients that had decided and notified Siemens that they were leaving the fold. Every one of those is still writing me their monthly check or owes me their monthly check for their contract duration, which can extend anywhere from three to five more years. So the impact of a client making the decision to leave actually tails off, has a very long tail to it. So from our business model perspective and certainly in the nearer term that we've been working through, the synergies primarily as we talked about were cost-related, and I think we've done a very good job of delivering on those cost synergies.","So I think overall, if you look at the bottom line of HS, we are ahead relative to an OE, slightly ahead of where we would have modeled ourselves. I think we're slightly ahead of what we would have expected from a retention standpoint. So, to date, we're actually very pleased at how it's modeling out and how these clients are starting to really get into the Cerner mode and see us as their provider, moving their allegiance over from the HS book. So, to date, things are working very well.","George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, I appreciate the color. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Jamie Stockton from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Jamie J. Stockton - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hey, good evening. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess maybe, Marc, on the support and maintenance line, I know you said mid-single-digit growth or somewhere thereabouts the rest of the year. That's a little bit of a slowdown. Is this just the law of large numbers, or is there any change in the way you're signing contracts that would be creating any headwind for that line?","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","No, there's no change in how we bill or how we sign contracts relative to support and maintenance. The HS acquisition obviously came in, brought a big bolus of support dollars there that came in Q2 a year ago. Those dollars were a little bit higher. They were a little bit lower in Q3, and then evened out as we rolled forward. So that's \u2013 when you look at this quarter, there's a little bit of a lower percent increase. But based on the size and the law of large numbers and basically, you know, as we continue to turn on projects at our normal pace, if you look at it, that number gets large, somewhere in mid-single-digits growth on that line.","Jamie J. Stockton - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And then maybe just as far as the guidance is concerned, if I take what you've done year to date and I back out what your guidance is for 3Q, there's a decent step-up in the fourth quarter to get to the midpoint of the annual revenue guidance. Is there anything notable that would be occurring in the fourth quarter that would get us to that number, like an unusually strong hardware quarter, anything like that that we should be keeping in mind?","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","No, there's nothing from a hardware perspective. I am past the time when I am counting on hardware to deliver anything to my top-line. So, no, that's just the strength of the business, a little bit of a Q4 impact. But we are getting into a time when you're seeing a little more of the cyclical nature of the business where we've had a traditional strong Q4. I think as we look at the backlog, as we do all the analysis that we do from our forecast meetings and forecast not only the next quarter, but obviously three more quarters out, Q4 is just lining up to be a good solid quarter with nothing unique driving that revenue increase. It's just the business and driving the revenue out of the backlog.","Jamie J. Stockton - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay, that's great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Jeff Garro from William Blair & Company. Your line is open.","Jeffrey R. Garro - William Blair & Co. LLC","Good afternoon, guys, and thanks for taking the question. Maybe to follow up on Jamie's question a little bit there, Marc, you seemed to allude to this a little bit already, but curious whether we'll return to the traditional seasonality of the business here in Q4 and really specifically in terms of bookings.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","I think as we look at Q4, some of the seasonality we see on the income side, you'll see it \u2013 certainly we expect Q4 to be traditionally a little bit stronger bookings quarter. I think Q3, our guidance is that we're going to actually have a really good bookings quarter. It's just against a comp that went up 44% in the year-ago quarter. So I think we're \u2013 once again, we don't talk about bookings outside of the oncoming quarter, but we're very comfortable that for the full year, we expect to grow bookings. And so obviously to do that, we'd expect to have a pretty decent Q4.","Jeffrey R. Garro - William Blair & Co. LLC","Fair enough, one more for me. We're coming up on almost a year of the announcement of the Population Health win from an epic customer, Geisinger Health. So I'm curious if that win has led to further conversations with epic customers about the HealtheIntent platform and if they're to the decision-making point yet.","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","This is Zane. We've actually had a number of big clients that have made HeatheIntent decisions and signed contracts, and we just have not disclosed those separately from that, so we continue to see that trend. We have a number of opportunities in our pipeline that we continue to work. And the success with our clients with our Pop Health clients in that space is garnering a lot of interest in that client base.","Jeffrey R. Garro - William Blair & Co. LLC","Great, thanks for taking the questions, guys.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","You're welcome.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Sandy Draper from SunTrust. Your line is open.","Sandy Y. Draper - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thanks very much. Zane, maybe a follow-up to your comment about \u2013 I think you said all of the people that are purchasing the Cerner Millennium platform on the clinicals are now are also purchasing the Revenue Cycle product. I'm just curious if you can give us any qualitative or quantitative numbers in terms of over the last couple years how that's trended and then how many have actually implemented versus to be implemented and how many are going big bang. Are they doing clinicals and they wait a couple years and then they come back to Revenue Cycle?","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Hey, Sandy, this is Marc. Just to set the stage, while Revenue Cycle is very active, about 25% of our base has Revenue Cycle. So while it's been very active recently, it's still a very low level of penetration into our base. So that's just from a perspective of we're doing really well. We still have a lot of runway left.","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","So Marc is referring to our installed base overall which \u2013 but most \u2013 I think what you've seen over the last couple years has been an integrated Revenue Cycle \u2013 clinical and Revenue Cycle decision. And that number has continued to inch up where this quarter was 100% of them selecting Revenue Cycle as part of that. And from an implementation perspective, we're into the thousands of ambulatory providers. We're into the hundreds of Cerner Millennium sites, so lots of scale across different sizes of organizations, so from small to extremely large organizations running Cerner Revenue Cycle across that, and that's helped with the credibility of the solution side as we move forward.","As it relates to individual projects, those really come down to the individual client situation themselves. Many are big bang model, so I would say half of those are big bang. And I would say the other half, they have some phased approach based on what their risk tolerance is, what the sunset solutions are that they're facing, and the key criteria that they're looking at operationally to solve. So those come down to individual client-based decision.","Sandy Y. Draper - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Great, that's really helpful. And then maybe just one quick follow-up for Marc on \u2013 could you just give the \u2013 I missed the amortization of cap software and capitalized software numbers. So if you can, just give those again. Thanks.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Okay, let me \u2013 sorry, Sandy. Let me give you a call and we'll get you that number.","Sandy Y. Draper - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","That's fine. I can just follow up with Allan [Kells] or e-mail Allan or you. Thanks.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Very good, why don't we take one more question?","Operator","All right, sir. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Richard Close from Canaccord Genuity. Your line is open.","Richard Close - Canaccord Genuity Group, Inc.","Great, thank you for slipping me in, just a clarification on the Population Health deals over $5 million. I just wanted to make sure that those are only Population Health. Is that correct?","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","That's correct.","Richard Close - Canaccord Genuity Group, Inc.","Okay. And my second question is talking about all-time highs pipeline. Is there anything with respect to the conversion of the pipeline into bookings that we should take into consideration, any changes in the current marketplace that maybe lead to faster conversion or slower conversion, things such as consolidation in the marketplace or regulations or elections?","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","Individually, all those kinds of things can impact any individual deal. But at a macro level from a pipeline perspective, we're not seeing any variance in our conversion rate as we progress through the stages of the pipeline. But as can happen with any individual particular deal, there can be a number of circumstances that impact that individual situation. But from a macro perspective, the trend lines have stayed the same on the conversion time.","Richard Close - Canaccord Genuity Group, Inc.","Okay, thank you.","Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp.","Certainly.","Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.","Thank you. I appreciate everyone's time this afternoon. We're very pleased with our results for the quarter. It was nice to deliver on all cylinders, and we look forward to talking with you next quarter. Goodbye.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference.

Today\u2019s date is July 24, 2014, and this call is being recorded.","The company has asked me to remind you that various remarks made here today constitute forward-looking statements, including without limitation, those regarding projections of future revenues or earnings, operating margins, operating expenses, product development and new markets or prospects for the company\u2019s solutions. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements.

Please proceed sir.","Marc Naughton","Thank you Glen. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the call. I\u2019ll lead off today with a review of the numbers. Zane Burke, our President, will follow me with the results, highlights and marketplace observations. Mike Nill, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, will discuss operations. Jeff Townsend, Executive Vice President and Chief of Staff, is with the client today and Neal Patterson, our Chairman and CEO will be available during Q&A.","Now I will turn to our results. Our total bookings revenue in Q2 was $1.08 billion, which is an all-time high for a second quarter and reflects 15% growth over our previous Q2 record results in Q2 of 2013.","Bookings margin in Q2 was $980 million or 91% of total bookings. Our bookings performance drove 21% increase in total backlog to $9.69 billion. Contract revenue backlog of $8.88 billion is 23% higher than a year ago. Support revenue backlog of $807 million is up 7%.","Revenue in the quarter was $852 million, which is up 20% over Q2 of 2013. The revenue composition for Q2 was $235 million in system sales, $175 million in support and maintenance, $413 million in services and $29 million in reimbursed travel.","System sales revenue reflects a 17% increase over Q2 of 2013, driven by a strong growth in software and technology resale. Q2 system sales margin dollars grew 19% over the year-ago period, driven by continued strong levels of software.","Moving to services, total services revenue was up 28% compared to Q2 of 2013, with strong growth in managed services and professional services. Support and maintenance revenue increased 7% over Q2 of 2013.","Looking at revenue by geographic segments, domestic revenue increased 24% for the quarter. Global revenue was down 4% from Q2 of 2013, due mainly to the timing of couple of global contracts. Zane will discuss our global outlook for the rest of the year, which looks solid.","Moving to gross margin, our gross margin for Q2 was 80.9%, which is down from 82.2% in Q2 of 2013. The slightly lower gross margin is mainly due to an elevated level of third party services, being used in this quarter to support a significant number of systems go live.","The highest level of go lives also led to a large increase in reimbursed travel revenue, which is zero margin and also impacts our margin percent, but not the absolute dollars of margin.","Looking at operating spending, our second quarter operating expenses before share based compensation expense were up 19% to $483 million. Sales in client service expenses increased 22%, compared to Q2 of 2013 driven primarily by continued increase in revenue, generating associates in our services businesses. Our investment in software development was up 18%, compared to Q2 of 2013, continues to be driven by investments and our growth initiatives.","G&A expense increased 8%, compared to Q2 of 2013, driven mostly by growth in personnel.","Moving to operating margins, our operating margin, before share-based compensation expense was 24.3% in Q2. This is down 80 basis points, compared to Q2 of 2013, due to the higher level of third party services and reimbursed travel revenue.","Our forecast for the second half of the year reflects between 50 basis points and 100 plus basis points of margin expansion, depending on mix. While this will put us below our original target for margin expansion this year, our earnings guidance is still higher than we began the year. As always our focus is on delivering predictable levels of growth in gross margin and earnings dollars, which we have done this year, even with that expected levels of margin expansion.","Moving to net earnings and EPS our GAAP net earnings in Q2 were $129 million or $0.37 per diluted share. GAAP net earnings included share-based compensation expense which had a net impact on earnings of $10 million or $0.03 per diluted share.","Adjusted net earnings were $139 million and adjusted EPS was $0.40, which is up 18%, compared to Q2 of 2013. The Q2 tax rate or adjusted net earnings was 33.7%, which is in line with our effective tax rate. For the second half of 2014, we expect our effective tax rate to remain within 50 basis point to 100 basis points of 34%.","Now I will move to our balance sheet, we ended Q2 with $1.47 billion of total cash and investments, which is flat compared to Q1 as we used our free cash flow for share repurchases. Our total debt, including capital lease obligations, is $155 million.","Total receivables ended the quarter at $615 million, which is up $51 million from Q1. Our DSO in Q2 was 66 days, which is flat compared to the Q1 DSO and down from 68 days in year-ago quarter.","Operating cash flow for the quarter was $248 million. Q2 capital expenditures were $62 million, and capitalized software was $42 million. Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures and capitalized software, was $144 million for the quarter.","Moving to capitalized software, the $42 million of capitalized software in Q2 represents 37% of the $115 million of total investment in development activities. Software amortization for the quarter was $25 million, resulting in net capitalization of $17 million or 15% of our total R&D investment.","Our outlook for capital expenditures and capitalized software remains the same as what we provided last quarter. We expect capital expenditures to be $260 million to $280 million for the year, which is down from $353 million in 2013. We expect capitalized software to remain in the mid-$40 million range per quarter throughout the year, which will lead to it being flat or slightly higher than the $175 million capitalized in 2013.","Regarding our share buyback, we purchased 2.8 million shares for approximately $142 million during the quarter, bringing our year-to-date total to 4.1 million shares repurchased for a total of $217 million. This completed the original amount that was approved in December of 2013, but we still have the additional $100 million of authorization that was approved in May.","Now I\u2019ll go through Q3 and full year 2014 guidance. For Q3, we expect revenue between $840 million and $870 million, with the midpoint reflecting growth of 17% over Q3 of 2013. For the full year, we expect revenue between $3.3 billion and $3.4 billion, reflecting 15% growth at the midpoint. This is up from our prior range of $3.25 billion to $3.4 billion.","We expect Q3 adjusted EPS before share-based compensation expense to be $0.41 to $0.42 per share, with the midpoint reflecting 19% growth over Q3 of 2013 adjusted EPS.","Q3 guidance is based on total spending before share-based compensation expense of approximately $485 million to $495 million. For the full year, we expect adjusted EPS between $1.64 and $1.67, with the midpoint reflecting 17% growth. This is up slightly from our prior range of $1.63 to $1.67. Our estimate for the impact of share-based compensation expense is approximately $0.03 in Q3 and $0.11 to $0.12 for the full year.","Moving to bookings guidance, we expect bookings revenue in Q3 of $1 billion to $1.1 billion, with the mid-point reflecting 13% growth over Q3 of 2013.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Zane.","Zane Burke","Thanks, Marc. Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I\u2019ll provide Q2 highlights and discuss marketplace trends. Starting with our results, our bookings revenue in Q2 of $1.08 billion reflects 15% growth over Q2 2013 as a record for a second quarter. For the quarter, we had 31 contracts over $5 million, including 19 over $10 million. The mix of long-term bookings was 33% in the quarter, which includes an ITWorks contracts and strong managed services bookings.","Our competitors in the quarter was strong with 32% of our bookings coming from outside of our core Millennium installed base. This reflects the continuation moment and has been building in recent years, including our record level of new over 200 bed hospitals with that hospitals in 2013. We believe we have a multi-year window to continue expanding our footprint, as other suppliers continue to struggle to help their client navigate the increasing regulatory requirements and changing healthcare economy.","This opportunity reflected in our pipeline, which is all time high across all segments. We are also gaining shares the ongoing consolidation industry that has been led by health systems that are Cerner clients. In fact each of the last three quarters has included booking contributions from client by Cerner solutions for hospital they acquired.","Now discuss a few areas of our business that contributed to our strongest results. I\u2019ll start the population health. Our population health organization delivered strong results again in Q2 driven by sales with HIE, Patient Portal, Enterprise Data Warehouse, clinical process optimization and our new Healthy Registry solution.","Coming out of this significant number of meetings on population health they both Cerner and non-Cerner clients in Q2 and even more confident that are EMR-agnostic approach, which spans the continuum care is the right one. Continue to compete against many best of re-suppliers. But none are following our comprehensive platform approach, so they are only effective in certain areas.","In addition, most of them have not taken on the significant challenge of aggregating and standardizing clinical claims and financial data across multiple systems. As a result, competing offering are using incomplete and latent data sets, which limits the value in our opinion.","Most importantly, we are achieving value with existing clients, with capturing major value statements across multiple areas of our population health portfolio. And these are strengthening our competitiveness with our prospects.","I\u2019ll move to revenue cycle, where we had another strong quarter driven by sales of our broad suite of Revenue Cycle solutions and services. Our Revenue Cycle business has grown more than 40% year-to-date, which is impressive when you considering we\u2019re coming off at 51% growth in 2013. This success is evidence that the significant investments we have made in our revenue cycle capabilities in recent years are paying off. We have now gone from simply trying to meet minimum expectations to having major differentiators in areas such as contract management and care management.","Operationally we are establishing scale and now have over 1,200 clients live on patient accounting, including approximately 200 hospitals and over 1,000 clinics. Importantly, we have been establishing through points at much larger clients and this success is leading to significant demand from other large whole systems. The momentum we are building through selling our solution portfolio is also helping build our pipeline for our full-service offerings.","Today I\u2019d like to highlight a subset of our RevWorks offering that have been growing in recent quarters. That offering is an extended business office or EBO, which is a service where we augment the client staff with our resources. EBO services offer greater flexibility and can be deployed to target a specific client need such as helping with legacy AR or coding backlog or a long-term staff augmentation strategy. As a result of this flexibility and a faster sales cycle then for RevWorks deals this business has scaled quickly. We currently have 250 associates in our EBO supporting over 100 acute and ambulatory clients.","In summary, our investments and execution of Revenue Cycle states have led to much stronger competitiveness, contributing meaningfully to our growth and created substantial pipeline of opportunities going forward.","Moving to ambulatory space, we had a strong Q2. We added over 2,000 providers in the quarter, bringing our total to over 65,000, which is approximately double the number of providers we had just four years ago. We continue to continually displace our key competitors as our large acute care clients favor a common platform for their affiliated and employed physicians. This competitiveness is a result of the significant investments we have made in our physician solutions and we expect our success to continue.","We also had a very good quarter in the small hospital market, adding eight new CommunityWorks clients and bringing 70 clients live. We have signed 13 new clients year-to-date and expect to easily exceed the 19 we signed in 2013. Outside of the U.S. we had another strong quarter from a booking standpoint, driven by contributions from Middle East, Canada and the UK.","As Mark mentioned, revenue was down slightly due to the timing of a couple of contracts. In addition, some of those booking strength came from hosting contracts, which don\u2019t have material upfront revenue, but they contributed to a more visible revenue stream going forward. In fact, we already have more global hosting bookings in the first half of the year than we did in all of 2013 and we expect this trend to continue.","Looking at the rest of the year, we expect improved revenue growth outside of the U.S. We expect this growth to be driven by the strong bookings in Q1 and Q2 and a good booking\u2019s forecast for the remainder of the year.","Now I\u2019ll cover a couple more marketplace observations. Overall, we believe marketplace dynamics continue to favor CERN. There are pressures on healthcare providers to control cost and increase quality and they continue to view IT as a key lever and helping them do this. While the meaningful use continues which we for the first adjustments of stage two meaningful use. Really don\u2019t change much. In the end bar remains high, which is an advantage for Cerner. In addition meaningful use is just one area of focus as providers are dealing with the impact of other major and mandate such as healthcare reform (indiscernible) and ICD-10.","The final observation I\u2019d like to make is the importance of interoperability is increasing. As you know, Cerner is committed to interoperability and having the most open EMR. It is becoming clear this is the right strategy. Our healthcare system has been done in times and the opportunity improvement with this data will not be fully realized unless all stake holders commit to interoperability. If not return on billions of dollars invested in systems to be limited and the opportunity to have major positive impact on the quality of healthcare systems will be wasted.","We believe that operating as it close systems more align and more. Yet, there are still major players that continue to operate this way. We are pleased the members of Congress have recently then demanding the tax per dollar not line the pockets of vendors that have develop business models around interoperability. We also acquired should be focused on delivering the value of true interoperability. We believe it is wrong for tax payer dollars to subsidize closer platforms consumers have a right to their data one of the primary reasons, Neal joined the our NC policy is insured that they will have it.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Mike.","Michael Nill","Thanks, Zane. Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I\u2019m going to discuss ITWorks and provide some operational highlights. I\u2019ll start with ITworks. This quarter we signed an ITWorks contract with the full service community hospital. It has 120 active staff positions practicing in 37 different specialties. They are on long-term Cerner client and are currently pursuing Global six recognition. Similar to most of our ITWorks clients, this quite concluded that ITWorks was a good fit after completing an evaluation of the resources needed to continue meeting regulatory mandate such as future phases or meaningful use in ICD-10.","These pressure are common across our client-based and the reason our ITWorks pipeline remain strong. As a media update on ITWorks financial contribution and outlook our ITWorks revenue is up over 50% year-today, that we expected to also have a full year growth of over 50%. This growth is driven by strong booking last year, bookings and scope expansions this year and a strong pipeline for the second half of this year.","Now, I\u2019d like to provide a couple of operational highlights and discuss some client achievements. I\u2019d like to start by giving you a sense for the volume and diversity of work we are doing with our services business. Professional services organization is the largest healthcare focused consulting business in the world. It has over 5,500 associates and will contribute over $1 billion of revenue in 2014.","In Q2 alone we implemented 2,507 solutions at 197 sites adding 174,000 new users. Our services capabilities create a competitive advantage over competitors that rely almost solely on third-party services. Through our Solutions Center implementation approach and best practice methodologies, we provide predictable results at a predictable cost to our clients.","In recent projects we\u2019ve incorporated what we refer to as our model systems approach. That approach jump-starts the project by starting with a fully built best practices system, which is then fine-tuned as users get hands-on experience and training. This approach has the potential to significantly reduce implementation duration and effort and can materially benefit new clients transitioning to Cerner platform, as well as reducing the cost of transition.","Of course we offer much more than just implementation and training services. In total, we offer more than 20 different lines of service including operational management, performance improvement, healthcare intelligence and analytics, strategy consulting and regulatory to name a few. This growing diversity of services and consulting offerings positions our services business for ongoing growth.","Finally, I\u2019d like to highlight a recent client accomplishment at HealthSouth. During the second quarter HealthSouth brought five additional rehabilitation hospitals live with their suite of millennium solutions, bringing their Cerner footprint to a total of 46 of their 103 hospitals. Since December of 2012, HealthSouth has launched Cerner solutions into roughly five facilities per quarter, with each facility taking on a full suite of more than 15 solutions. HealthSouth has 31 facilities in HIMSS level VI and anticipates that each newly added Millennium site will also qualify for the same recognition.","Going forward, there are 10 additional hospitals scheduled for conversion later this year and 25 facilities scheduled for conversion in 2015.","In summary, we are making significant accomplishments with our clients as we help them maximize their business in the present, while also preparing them for the future.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) And your first question comes from the line of Jamie Stockton with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.","Jamie Stockton \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC","Yes, good evening. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess maybe the first one, Zane. The Stage 2 numbers have continued to be pretty weak for everybody and just big picture. It seems like hospitals as they stayed in the meaningful use program, it kind of felt there on a tread mill. They have to keep qualifying with their current vendor. If we see a lot of hospitals, shake out first stage to is that the big catalyst that you guys are looking for that is going to drive market share your way or do you think that they will ultimately be a lot of hospitals that ultimately qualify for stage two.","Neal Patterson","","Thanks Jamie. I will start with our clients. We have the most stage two hospitals that have tested today to many other spire out there. So while not the large size numbers the most that are out there. And we had expect our clients to incredibly well on stage two at the station as things move forward here. And I think it\u2019s a little early to determine what the market impact is going to be, given those low numbers for everybody.","But I can look forward to our own numbers and know that our clients are in very good shape to a test moving forward. And I do think there are some plus and with winners that will struggle get through that hurdle. But I think it\u2019s still early to determine what that means in terms of the pipeline for us.","Jamie Stockton \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC","Have you seen an acceleration of hospitals coming to you say oh and we thought we are going to be able to handle stage II with whoever but now it\u2019s apparent that we can\u2019t. And therefore, we are getting off the treadmill and open to moving to other solutions.","Neal Patterson","Does it really occurred prior to this time period. So the buying today has been driven primarily by people that are looking to create platforms that are beyond meaningful use. So we are entering really the era of what\u2019s the foundational plumbing that I need to be more nimble and contemplate the future of healthcare decisions beyond just meaningful; use. So I would say to date not a lot of that in the current part of it something worth watching.","Jamie Stockton \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC","Okay, and then my question is on the population health that you highlighted that you were talking to both core clients and non-core clients. Can you give us some sense for the deals that you\u2019ve signed so far, some rough portion of that has been noncore clients enjoy everything you throw into the population health bucket?","","Neal Patterson","","There is a handful of clients to date, that we are seeing a lot of activity picking up in the pipeline and frankly quite a bit of activity in our own base which probably exceeding our early expectations for the year. And so that the trends are very good in terms of both what we delivered and then the pipeline activity in our current client base as well as some of those other clients. So I\u2019d anticipate you will see signings in the upcoming quarters and both our core client base as well as non-Cerner core EHR organization?","Jamie Stockton \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC","Okay, that\u2019s great. Thank you.","Operator","","And your next question comes from the line of Michael Cherny with ISI Group. Please proceed.","Michael Cherny \u2013 ISI Group","","Good afternoon guys. Congrats on nice quarter.","Marc Naughton","","Thanks.","Zane Burke","","Thanks.","Michael Cherny \u2013 ISI Group","","So I just want to dig into a little bit color on the trend file which Alan obviously nice enough percentage out as he always does. Looking at the deals for the quarter, looks like they were fewer deals so the average deal size, but my calc is pretty big. I know you\u2019ve mentioned by 19 deals larger than 10 million. As you think about that, think about the large deals you\u2019re going after. I guess how many opportunities are you seeing that are more near term and very urgent replacement in nature versus how many of those where you\u2019re actually might some greenfield for some of the particularly larger deals that you potentially go after.","Zane Burke","","Mike this is Zane, I would say that if you looked at the total deals which I do pretty closely that activity was actually quite for all transactions. There was sort of I\u2019ll call that midsized transaction anomaly where we didn\u2019t have as many mid-sized transactions in the quarter.","And I think that\u2019s reflective of a lot of activity it\u2019s going on where people are \u2013 some of the large buyers are making decisions either through acquisition, some of the acquisition activity, so you see some things in some of the large side to that \u2013 our IT works, our hosting opportunity, people that are filling out the rest of their portfolios and the rest of the EMAR and some of the larger size, I would tell you that community hospital marketplace we highlighted, the community works which was one of our strongest quarters ever and I see a whole lot of strength in the small community hospitals and in fact, I see that as a big growth marketplace for us as we move forward.","So I\u2019m not sure there is a trend there in that mid range piece, but I didn\u2019t note that myself is \u2013 point through the numbers as well. I think it\u2019s more just reflection of the deal mix for the quarter.","Michael Cherny \u2013 ISI Group","Thanks, that\u2019s helpful. And then Marc a question for you and when I\u2019ve some previous calls I apologize from repeating myself as the cash balance continues to build the ability to generate strong cash flow.","Have you rethought the strategic priorities will relative to capital employment, now you did a lot of buyback in the quarter, but as you think also about the new normal what your product offerings is going to be over the next five to 10 years. How much does M&A which has never been something that Cerner has been particularly play factor is that.","Marc Naughton","Mile this is Marc. I think the uses of cash that we\u2019ve always talked are pretty much the same as we\u2019ve been talking out we are going to invest in our business, you\u2019ve seen us do that, through the R&D, through CapEx relative to our growth infrastructure. So that\u2019s the same, we are committing more funds to stock buybacks. You saw we did $217 million this year-to-date basically spend all of our free cash flow for this quarter on our stock buyback and has some more to go to do. I think we\u2019ve always talked about if there is some element of strategic acquisition potential in our approach to use of cash. The key for us as we don\u2019t really have any gaps that we need to go fill.","So, we\u2019ll be continue to look at things that are interesting to complement Millennium that have good price the value ratio, but there is really pretty consistent. I think in our approach to cash as we talk about before.","Michael Cherny \u2013 ISI Group","Perfect. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Harper with FBR. Please proceed.","Stephen Harper \u2013 FBR Capital Markets","Hi, just a quick \u2013 we would like to have quick update on Intermountain activities as well as Advocate as you approach the end of that development cycle.","Zane Burke","","Hi Steve, it\u2019s Zane. I have just a quick update on Intermountain. We continue to there engage in the build process on the project process is going incredibly well. They are great client has been a very collaborative. They engage with us in a number of ways and we are really excited for them to continue to move forward with the projects, which remains on track and going well. Around Advocate we went live with the healthy registries and there are seeing significant benefit from that and we continue we\u2019ve actually had our second go live in Healthy Registry in our client base today as well.","So it\u2019s not just an Advocate story any longer, which is good and they but Advocate continues to be a leader in the space and that has a great proof point of what we can do.","Stephen Harper \u2013 FBR Capital Markets","Are you seeing increased activity in the pipeline regarding healthy registries.","Zane Burke","","Absolutely. In fact, it\u2019s as I have mentioned earlier its exceeding some of our early expectations around what that pipeline looks like both in our core plant base as well as our external client base and I would also say beyond the registry themselves as we rollout other capability the demand for some of the upcoming capabilities as very much in process of our prospects and existing clients today. So I feel very bullish about the past that we\u2019re on and is going to have a meaningful impact to Cerner as we move forward over the years.","Stephen Harper \u2013 FBR Capital Markets","Great, thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Lisa Gill, JPMorgan. Please proceed.","Gavin Weiss \u2013 JPMorgan","Yes, it\u2019s actually Gavin Weiss in for Lisa. I might have missed this in the prepared comments, but at Investor Day you showed a slide that outlined the potential wins for Cerner based on hospital M&A activity in 2013. So can you talk about where you are in terms of converting those potential wins and how is 2014 M&A activity looking for you?","Neal Patterson","","Good question. I did have some very brief prepared comments, but the M&A activity has picked up in 2014 pretty significantly. 2013 was a little bit lighter than some of the previous years. In first half of the year there has been about 70 hospitals that have changed hence. Cerner hospitals continue to acquire at a greater rate than any of our competitors and it was very consistent with kind of the previous three-year trend of Cerner clients buying at around 45% to 50% rate of all acquisitions.","Again last quarter, we converted some of those acquired basis into Cerner clients. So we\u2019ve had that happen each of the last three quarters where we\u2019re converting that element, but we have not yet disclosed some of that conversion rate. We\u2019re still kind of evaluating how fast those convert and how that works through the pipe. It continues to be a huge opportunity for us as we move forward.","Gavin Weiss \u2013 JPMorgan","","Okay. And then just in terms of the competitive environment it\u2019s been publicly reported that one of the hospital IT players has put their business up for sale. How does that affect those customers? Have you seen them come to market maybe with new RFPs or is it still too early?","Neal Patterson","","It\u2019s early, but obviously that can cause some folks that are on those basis to consider what their long-term strategies are. And so, I think that could provide some impetus for us and a little bit of tailwind for us. So we have seen some early conversations in that dialogue.","Gavin Weiss \u2013 JPMorgan","","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Larsen with Leerink. Please proceed.","David Larsen \u2013 Leerink Swann & Company","Hey, guys. Congratulations on a good quarter. There\u2019s been some recent news articles about interoperability between vendors such as like Athena and Cerner and quality systems in Cerner. Can you just talk about that and mention how to have sort of any interoperability engagements going on with Athena? Thanks.","Zane Burke","","This is Zane. So, as it relates to Cerner and Athena, specifically there is not a program there. What we\u2019ve done is have our industry group, which is called Commonwealth, which Athena is one of those partners. That group has grown from the original five partners, which if you may remember, is McKesson, Cerner, Greenway, Athena and Allscripts and has grown to almost 12-member, I think about 12 members to date including CVS and other HIT suppliers. And, so we\u2019ve got four proof points today in the marketplace on putting together that patient identifier, managing the consent and that\u2019s gone incredibly well upfront.","We are absolutely 100% committed to seeing that through and think it\u2019s a super strategic and a valuable thing and an important thing in our industry for us to do and for us all to collaborate on. And when I mean all of us, it means all suppliers in our industry, need to get on board and be part of solving interoperability challenges. Athena is obviously part of that Commonwealth initiative. So we have had success with them and they\u2019re part of those pilot projects.","David Larsen \u2013 Leerink Swann & Company","Okay, great. And then, just when you say part of those pilot projects, does that mean field to field bidirectional data interchange?","Zane Burke","This is solving a piece of interoperability. So this piece of interoperability is actually the lack of the national patient identifier in this country, which will not happen for mainly political purposes and really could and should be solved by industry at this point. And so, what we\u2019re doing is actually where are making it where we can share data based on that national patient identifier and that patient identification. And, so that\u2019s how the data sharing is occurring and the consumer themselves will have the right to determine who gets that information, where that information \u2013 whether they want to consent to that. So that could level interoperability that we\u2019re at.","David Larsen \u2013 Leerink Swann & Company","Great. Sounds like you guys have taken a great leadership role. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","Robert P. Jones \u2013 Goldman Sachs Group Inc.","Thanks for taking the questions. Marc, it sounds like the bolus of the go-live implementations and the related expenses what you\u2019re pointing to for the short fall in operating margins were the original goal for the year. I\u2019m just curious was there anything specific about these go-lives or the associated cost that was outside of your initial annual plan? And then, just on the back of that, anything we should be thinking about as we look forward as far as risks associated with additional go-lives?","Marc Naughton","This is Marc. The Q2 was expected to be a very big quarter for doing go-live. So it wasn\u2019t anything that was really outside our expectation. I think the upside in revenue over our guidance range was probably kind of driven half by additional third-party consultants. And half by the increased travel that we saw quarter-over-quarter. So nothing that was beyond our expectations or that makes us concerned about our expense model. I think clearly the height revenue impacts operating margin percent it certainly didn\u2019t impact our operating margin dollars which is our key focus. We really want to drive out the operating margin dollars. We\u2019re actually fine that the revenue grows a little faster than we would have projected, because we do have a pretty good history of being able to bring our and expand our operating margin percentages, as we go forward.","So nothing that I found this quarter that would concern me. It was pretty much a volume related item and a project specific relative to the use on certain projects a s in third parties. The clients would have requested, given as we talked about our the size of our consulting organization 5,500 people. We for the most part due to our, all of our own implementation work. So it\u2019s kind of a little bit at the edge element, but doesn\u2019t significantly my view.","Robert P. Jones \u2013 Goldman Sachs Group Inc.","","So no reason to think differently about the margin opportunity expansion going beyond this year?","Marc Naughton","Correct.","Robert P. Jones \u2013 Goldman Sachs Group Inc.","And I guess just to change gears a follow-up question on outside the U.S, you\u2019re thinking about the UK dynamics. Any sense you can us on the competitive dynamics there, anything updates as far as opportunities or market developments?","Zane Burke","","Sure this is Zane we had a great Q2 as we mentioned in my prepared comments. And we have seen a lot of activity with those coming out of the trust which is principally complete at this point. So those coming out of the trust program are principally complete. But there is a ton of activity in new business and within those clients that have come out and have gone Cerner\u2019s direction and joined with Cerner directly. We see the UK as the fantastic growth opportunity and very bullish on our growth in the UK.","Robert P. Jones \u2013 Goldman Sachs Group Inc.","","Great thanks so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of George Hill with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.","George Robert Hill \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.","","Hi, good afternoon guys and thanks for taking the questions. I think Zane or Mike this is either one for either you guys to feel. As you\u2019re talking to your clients about population health and kind of as they build the functionality stack, like what components of the functionality do they feel like they need to start with or by first, and kind of how do they move down the line? And like, so are they starting with data warehousing or they started with Dana analytics and moving down the end towards patient engagement or risk stratification? And so I\u2019m trying to figure out kind of where are we in the build of the functionality stack, where do you guys index against where we are in the build from a product offering? And kind of how far up the adoption curve do you think we are?","Zane Burke","This is Zane. I would say there\u2019s some core foundational elements which many folks have and they just the HIE and Portal Space which has broadly put in that. But as you refer to its George, it\u2019s really the next phase of that. So registries and data warehouse and analytics are the pieces that where clients are in their lifecycle buying thoughts, bigger contract management and the patient engagement side to that actually a full CRM for healthcare. Are really the future, and so there is the demand and the needs are there for this roadmap to layout over the next several years. And we\u2019re developing work on that today.","And so we\u2019re early in the delivery side of this and we\u2019re very, very pleased with this. But the thing that we have done different than anybody else, is create a platform by which of all of this is on one single platform and is not isolated in the single niche supplier. So we\u2019re coming out of from a broad platform perspective which we\u2019ve now built that broad platform and then we can build on the pieces of functionality for each one of the areas to satisfy the needs going forward. And so we are incredibly well positioned on a broad platform perspective whereas the competitors in the space have come from a niche perspective and know how to try to cut, figure out how to make that into a boarder platform and that\u2019s a lot harder way to run the railroad.","George Robert Hill \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.","Okay that kind of leads me to my follow-up. And if I think about Cerner\u2019s evolution on the clinical side and the financial side, I guess, I would ask from a Pop, if you look at your clients Pop Health wallet how much leakage do you guys think you have right now, or how much share of wallet are these niche competitors taking that you guys might have to go recapture in the future the way you went later in the adoption cycle and captured things like ED, and surgical, and cardiology and radiology impacts. I\u2019m trying to think about how much of the wallet is being committed now that you\u2019re not capturing, that you kind of comeback and catch in round two, and round three, or inning two, inning three and inning four?","Neal Patterson","Think it\u2019s a interesting element and I think it\u2019s an astute observation in what\u2019s occurred, because those that were early and had something that sounded like population health one kind of the first round of that in many cases. And so oftentimes we are back and in those niches you\u2019re already in inning two, if you will. And what I sound profound about this phase is the competitor of the day, it really is a competitor of the day dynamic who was the big competitor 12 months ago is not the competitor of the day. And so I\u2019ve never seen some of this move so quickly, and I think it depends on a lot where the client is in their evolution as well. So where you are in innings one or inning two depends on the client\u2019s evolution. So they were a Medicare advantage part of the Medicare Advantage programs or been one of the pioneer grants.","They have likely made some sort of purchase along the way and are much further along in their thinking of operationalizing population health. Those that haven\u2019t done that probably actually haven\u2019t made many of any purchases in the space. So you sort of have to bifurcate the marketplace and say where are \u2013 where is that organization in their life cycle of going at risk. And I thinking of at risk element, so it\u2019s a bit bifurcated in that space. Is that kind of make sense.","George Robert Hill \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.","Yes, so if I think about that analogy right and I\u2019m sorry that I am kind of go into (indiscernible) if we think about kind of later part to the top health technology structure like what I would call like provider network management and provider kind of provider evaluation managements. We might be in the first inning there but if I look at HIE, I feel like we mattered to be in the fourth innings because I\u2019ve already seen an handful HIE companies coming well. Is that\u2026","Neal Patterson","I think you have it exactly right, George so maybe HIE is obviously that most of sure if you will in that side and there has been there evolution in that side. I don\u2019t know that\u2019s where the buying is going. So the buying is really moving towards some of those other areas that we talked about. So the patient registry, the data warehouse elements and some of the analytics capabilities, analytics and reporting capabilities that\u2019s where the principle buying as referral management. That\u2019s where things are going.","George Robert Hill \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.","","All right. I\u2019ll hop off, I appreciate the color. Thanks.","Neal Patterson","Thanks.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette with UBS. Please proceed.","Steven Valiquette \u2013 UBS","Hi, thanks, good afternoon. So I guess if we think big picture about some of your biggest potential drivers of bookings and contract wins over the next two years or so, which you may include age or replacement and also RCM sales into the installed base, but maybe not PHM in big size just yet. I guess I\u2019m just curious is there general expectation from your random percent of contract dollars from new clients with that potentially move higher over the next few years and versus the current 30% trends or could that move lower, given you certain mix or just too hard to predict that metric at this time, thanks.","Zane Burke","I think our expectations for just remains some alone. And but again those given that the numbers continued to grow, the dollars on new business continues to grow significantly. So I think that\u2019s one of the elements, but I think we\u2019re anticipating it will be fairly similar at this point.","Steven Valiquette \u2013 UBS","Okay. And just quickly, last quarter it may have been a little bit too soon to get read on implications from market demand trends following the ICD-10 delay, but I guess now that another three months have passed, just curious if there\u2019s new or additional observations you may have regarding any market\u2019s shift just following that delay?","Marc Naughton","We saw very good performance in our Revenue Cycle solutions. So as I mentioned in our comments, we\u2019re at 41% growth over 2013, which is coming off of 51% growth over 2012. So I think we\u2019re feeling very good about where we are on revenue cycle and where our clients or how the clients are feeling about our solutions and they\u2019re able to navigate the ICD-10 element. And so they can plan on either side of that deadline today and we\u2019re able to accommodate that, but I don\u2019t see that as a driver of additional elements. I would say some of the [EBoP] (ph) that I highlighted earlier, some of those types of stock augmentation, some of that type of work I think does have some planar ICD-10 elements to it that we\u2019re hoping augment some staff and do some things like that.","Steven Valiquette \u2013 UBS","Okay. All right, got it. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dave Windley with Jefferies. Please proceed.","David H. Windley \u2013 Jefferies & Company, Inc.","Hi, thanks for taking the question. So, Zane, your chief competitor seems relatively uninterested or unmotivated in pursuing pop health based on some of the chatter in the marketplace. And given the size of their client base and the size of the client in that client base it would seem like they would be logical earlier buyers of some of those capabilities and that would make them a very opportune and rich target base for you to go after. I guess I\u2019m wondering in that context if there are kind of particular initiatives that you might call out to drive your pop health platform into the belly of the beast for a lack of their phrase.","Zane Burke","I think you make a very good assessment of the marketplace. So I think that\u2019s probably as much as I want to comment on that dialogue, which is we have solutions that the industry needs and our solution is EHR agnostic. And so we\u2019ll work regardless of who the competitor is and it makes sense that we are talking with some of those clients that may have made another selection on the EHR side. And I think you\u2019ll definitely see some fruit that as we look forward here, moving forward. So, we absolutely see at the same way you see it.","David H. Windley \u2013 Jefferies & Company, Inc.","Okay. Totally separate topic. On the EBO type opportunities mentioned in the prepared remarks, always understand that little better not sure exactly how far long you are on those, but have you seen any instances where a client starts with a \u2013 which sounds like a kind of a fraction of a RevWorks deal and moves into a full RevWorks deal. And if not can you talk to us about how you might see that evolves.","Zane Burke","We haven\u2019t seen that happen today, but we also \u2013 we do see that as an opportunity and a very likely outcome of get started, do good work and then, get hired to do more work. And that\u2019s a pretty much a fundamental that we try to operate center as proved the value and move forward. So, today as I mentioned about a 100 clients are utilizing our services today doing a number of different things. And we continue to grow our portfolio of services that we\u2019ll do on kind of standalone basis and I do believe that we\u2019ll drive additional growth on the full Revenue Cycle out sourcing.","David H. Windley \u2013 Jefferies & Company, Inc.","Great, thanks. And last question, conceptually with a number of cross selling opportunities that Cerner has, be it pop health or the works deals things like that beyond basic Millennium solutions I guess on interested in the context of capital deployment and M&A and so forth how the company looks at the long-term value of adding a member to your footprint be at buy organically and or acquisition and how you weigh the balance between getting that a substantial addition to your footprint quickly versus winning them by the once.","Marc Naughton","","This is Marc. I think the value of a member of client in our footprint I don\u2019t know to the source of that value where they client came is from is critical. The key for us and our strategy is how can we continue to add more value to that clients by more solutions, more services, more opportunities to help them improve. And to reduce their cost because that\u2019s what the two key things are looking to do so. For us it really doesn\u2019t matter where they come from it\u2019s really us going to the next key in our strategy. Zane (indiscernible) comment.","Zane Burke","And we do track the value of the new footprint. So I always say that new footprints are life blood of the company, because we are a growth organization. And we do a lot of things across the entire healthcare spectrum, conserve this in a number of way. And so tracking that value of the footprint is something that on an internal basis, is we do. And so adding new foot princes incredibly important and that is why we have big focus on it and served us very well.","David H. Windley \u2013 Jefferies & Company, Inc.","Very good, thank you, I appreciate it.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Ricky Goldwalker with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","Ricky Goldwasser \u2013 Morgan Stanley","","Yes, hi, good afternoon. A couple of follow-up questions here. I mean obviously interoperability is made for clients and the big current going forward. So from the conversations you\u2019re having with those hospitals that are not currents on our clients. And when you think about the pipeline, do you think that replacement opportunity around kind of like, from potential customers it is currently are with players who don\u2019t necessarily have that ability. Do you think that something that you could see in kind of like the next in the near term and the next 12 months do you think that these potential customers will first relate to a test for meaningful use to before they make the potential transition.","Mike Nill","","I view that as a very long cycle of things. I think it past that 12 months cycle on it and as we said previously I think this is a five to seven year trend of replacement EHRs, and so I think we are early in that five to seven years in that cycle. I do think that ultimately that will be important is durability to be interoperable. And to play a role I don\u2019t think that meaningful use to having a significant impact on a lot of the buying right now.","Ricky Goldwasser \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay and then can you just show us with your thoughts on just the Apple\u2019s announcement that it will collaborate with kind of like the player in the space that is not part of the Commonwealth?","Mike Nill","","I know that we have been real comments on what other players do. We see commonwealth as the key structure through which we will keep some identification information in the future. And I think that people are certainly welcome to join that organization regardless what other organization that they are members of. So it\u2019s not exclusive, it\u2019s all welcoming of all players. So you are going to see a lot of different announcements.","I think the key for us we are going to spend the effort in welcome the technology to make it happen. We are going to make it available to our clients and we are hoping that as we increase membership it will become the de facto standard. We\u2019ll take one last question.","Operator","And our last question comes from the line of Sean Wieland with Piper. Please proceed.","Sean Wieland \u2013 Piper Jaffray & Co.","Hey, thanks a lot. So I want to go back to Intermountain. Can you talk about how the work you\u2019re doing with Intermountain is going to translate into your competitive advantage in the marketplace? And when do you think the market or has the market started to realize what you\u2019re doing with Intermountain?","Neal Patterson","Well, I think there is a couple of things there. Intermountain is one of the leaders in being the lowest cost provider, highest quality and the work that they have done around creating the care process modeling and their level of diligence around becoming the best provider at the lowest cost are things that \u2013 and the innovation that they have done on a number of different areas. We\u2019re incorporating some of those things as we go. So we have an agile cycle that we\u2019re able to actually bring some of those things to bear early in our process.","Our clients are becoming aware of what we\u2019re doing there, but I think it will be more to come and certainly much of our client base and perspective client base are very interested in the outcomes that we bring at Intermountain and bring to bear. And the objective is to bring that to our client base and to the entire healthcare industry, some of the successes that they\u2019ve had and make that part of the solutions that we deliver.","So I would say there is a high awareness, obviously, of the project overall from our client base and from our prospects. They\u2019re already beginning to see some of the benefits of that. They\u2019ll see much more of that as you get to the end of the year and into the next couple of years. And our ability to go, harvest some of that information together with Intermountain.","Marc Naughton","Yes, Sean. This is Marc. Obviously Jeff is kind of on some of the calls, got on some of the calls. Our expectation is from the next quarter we\u2019ll have him be able to speak and present and I will obviously use that opportunity to go deeper in the Intermountain and what\u2019s going on there, how the benefits we expect to derive from that relationship. So more information, stay tune to just to give a preview.","Sean Wieland \u2013 Piper Jaffray & Co.","Super. Thanks a lot.","Marc Naughton","","I want to thank everybody for being on the call today.
