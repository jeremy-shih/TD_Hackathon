Welcome to the Q3 earnings conference call. [Operator Instructions]  We do remind you today's call is being recorded. Your host and speaker, Vice President of Investor Relations, Phil Johnson. Please go ahead, sir.","Philip Johnson","Good morning. Thank you for joining us for Eli Lilly & Company's Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. I'm Phil Johnson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Joining me this morning are John Lechleiter, our Chairman, President and CEO; Derica Rice, our Chief Financial Officer; Dr. Jan Lundberg, our President of Lilly Research Laboratories; Enrique Conterno, President of our Diabetes business; and Ilissa Rassner and Travis Coy from the Investor Relations team.","During this conference call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors, including those listed on Slide 3 and those outlined in our latest Forms 10-K and 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It is not intended to be promotional and is not sufficient for prescribing decisions.","We're pleased with our financial performance in the third quarter of 2012. In the face of significant reductions in revenue and earnings due to the Zyprexa patent expiration, we prudently controlled expenses and remain on track to meet our 2012 non-GAAP financial guidance and to meet or exceed our financial minimum goals through 2014. In addition, we continue to advance our pipeline and have begun to produce and communicate important data on key assets.","Let's begin today's call with a review of events that have taken place since our Q2 earnings call in late July. We've had a flurry of regulatory and clinical activity. On the regulatory front, we received FDA approval for a new use of Alimta in the continuation maintenance setting for advanced nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer, and for Tradjenta for use as add-on therapy to insulin in adults with type 2 diabetes. Strattera was approved in Japan for adult ADHD. While in Europe, the CHMP issued 3 positive opinions recommending approval of Cialis for once daily use for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia, or BPH; Trajenta for use as add-on therapy to insulin and adults with type 2 diabetes; and Amyvid as a diagnostic tool for imaging beta-amyloid neuritic plaque density in patients with cognitive impairment, who are being evaluated for Alzheimer's disease and other causes of cognitive impairment.","Turning to clinical news, we had multiple disclosures. We announced the decision to stop ongoing Phase III studies, investigating pomaglumetad methionil, also known as mGlu2\/3, for the treatment of patients suffering from schizophrenia. For Effient, along with our partner Daiichi Sankyo, we disclosed data at ESC from the TRILOGY study, a Phase III trial in patients who are managed medically without an artery-opening procedure. The study did not demonstrate that prasugrel was superior to clopidogrel in reducing cardiovascular events in these patients. We also announced that the Phase III POINTBREAK trial, comparing Alimta in combination with Avastin to Avastin alone, did not meet its primary endpoint of improved overall survival for patients with nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer.","We also disclosed encouraging data on 3 of our late-stage molecules. Specifically, we announced both top line and detailed results of the Phase III solanezumab EXPEDITION studies, Lilly's analysis showed primary endpoints, both cognitive and functional, were not met in the 2 Phase III EXPEDITION trials in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. However, a prespecified secondary analysis of pooled data across both trials showed a 34% reduction of cognitive decline in patients with mild Alzheimer's disease. We also saw a trend toward a reduction in functional decline in this mild patient population. The next steps for solanezumab will be determined after discussions with regulators.","We announced that the REGARD trial, a Phase III study of ramucirumab as second-line monotherapy in patients with metastatic gastric cancer, met its primary endpoint of improved overall survival and also showed prolonged progression-free survival. This is encouraging data ramucirumab uses monotherapy in a difficult-to-treat disease. We intend to discuss these data with regulatory authorities and expect to present detailed data at upcoming scientific meetings.","Finally, for dulaglutide, we announced that the primary endpoints related to reduction in HbA1c were met in the Phase III AWARD-1, AWARD-3 and AWARD-5 studies in patients with type 2 diabetes. Having met the primary endpoints, superiority for HbA1c was examined, and both doses of dulaglutide, 0.75 milligrams and 1.5 milligrams, demonstrated statistically superior reduction in HbA1c from baseline compared to exenatide twice-daily injection at 26 weeks in AWARD-1, metformin at 26 weeks in AWARD-3, and sitagliptin at 52 weeks in AWARD-5.","In addition to these data, over the next 12 to 18 months, we will generate Phase III data on multiple assets and indications. These data will provide the investment community with greater clarity on our future growth prospects. The data on solanezumab, ramucirumab and dulaglutide reaffirmed our confidence in and commitment to our innovation-based strategy.","Finally, there were 2 other noteworthy events since the Q2 earnings call. Following the completion of its acquisition by Bristol-Myers Squibb, Amylin paid Lilly $1.259 billion to fulfill its exenatide revenue-sharing obligation. Amylin also paid off $165 million loan, plus accrued interest. And the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed a prior district court ruling for the company's compound patent for Alimta is valid. The compound patent provides protection for Alimta in the U.S. through January of 2017. In addition, we have a concomitant nutritional use supplement patent expiring in 2022 that is also the subject of litigation.","Now let's discuss our financial performance for the quarter. As we've done on previous calls, we'll focus our comments on the non-GAAP results, which we believe provide insights into the underlying trends in our business. This view excludes certain items, such as restructuring charges, asset impairments and other special charges. Based on recent investor and analyst questions, I should point out that our non-GAAP results include ongoing costs, such as amortization and stock-based compensation.","On Slide 7, you can see that revenue this quarter was $5.4 billion or 11% below Q3 last year. This decrease in revenue was due to the loss of patent exclusivity for Zyprexa in most major markets outside of Japan, partially offset by growth from several other products, including double-digit growth in the U.S. for Alimta, Cialis, Cymbalta and our animal health products, and in both the U.S. and international markets for Effient and Forteo. This quarter, excluding Zyprexa outside of Japan, the rest of our worldwide revenue grew 2%.","Gross margin as a percent of revenue decreased 30 basis points from 78.2% to 77.9%. Lower Zyprexa sales had a significant negative effect on the gross margin percent. However, this is largely offset by the impact of foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold that increased cost of sales in Q3 last year but reduced cost of sales in Q3 this year. Excluding this FX effect from both 2011 and 2012, gross margin as a percent of revenue declined by 3.6 percentage points, from 80% in Q3 2011 to 76.4% in Q3 2012. In today's slide deck, you'll find a supplementary slide providing our gross margin percent for the last 10 quarters with and without this FX effect.","Moving down the income statement, this quarter's total operating expense, defined as the sum of R&D and SG&A, declined 3%. This reflects continued discipline in managing our operating expenses while investing in our pipeline to drive future growth. Specifically, this 3% decline is comprised of an 8% reduction in marketing, selling and administrative expenses and 5% growth in R&D expenses. The reduction in marketing, selling and administrative expenses was driven by lower marketing expenses and, to a lesser extent, by lower selling expenses. The growth in R&D expenses was largely driven by higher late-stage clinical trial costs. In addition, this quarter's R&D expense included the charge of approximately $20 million for estimated future period costs related to the termination of the pomaglumetad methionil Phase III program.","Other income and deductions improved from a net deduction of $83 million in the third quarter of 2011 to a net income of $1 million this year. This improvement is largely due to the recognition in this year's quarter of the gain on our sale of Amylin stock, as well as a charge taken in Q3 last year due to a partial write-down in the IP R&D value of Amyvid.","Our tax rate was 22.1%, an increase of 4.2 percentage points from Q3 2011, primarily due to the recognition in Q3 2011 of a discrete tax benefit, resulting from resolution of the company's 2007 IRS tax audit and the negative effect in 2012 of the expiration of the R&D tax credit at the end of 2011. At the bottom line, our non-GAAP EPS decreased 30% to $0.79.","In summary, our Q3 financial results reflect Zyprexa patent expirations outside of Japan. At the same time, we've continued to drive revenue growth for a number of products and to prudently manage expenses in the rest of our business, putting us on solid financial footing going forward. As we've discussed in past calls, we'll rigorously prioritize investments to achieve our midterm financial targets and position the company to return to growth post 2014.","Slide 8 shows our reported income statement, while Slide 9 provides a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS. As you can see, for non-GAAP results, we excluded pretax income of $788 million or $0.43 per share recognized in Q3 2012 as a result of the early payment by Amylin of the exenatide revenue-sharing obligation. So this income is related to U.S. exenatide rights. Currently, we expect to recognize income of approximately $490 million in early 2013, contingent upon transfer of exenatide commercial rights outside the U.S. We expect to exclude this future income from our non-GAAP results. Additional details about our reported earnings are available in today's earnings press release.","Now I'll turn the call over to Travis.","Travis Coy","Thanks, Phil. As you can see on Slide 10, the total revenue decline of 11% for the quarter, shown in the yellow bar on the middle of the page, was driven by a negative volume impact of 9% and a negative foreign exchange impact of 3%, partially offset by a favorable price impact of 1%. By geography, you'll notice that U.S. volume decreased 17%. This was due to Zyprexa sales erosion. Excluding olanzapine from both 2011 and 2012, volume in the rest of our U.S. business was up about 1%.","Similarly, in Europe, the volume decline of 12% was due to the Zyprexa patent expiration. Excluding Zyprexa from both 2011 and 2012, volume growth for the rest of our European products was about 2.5%. Please note that the 7% price decline in Europe is not fully reflective of government pricing actions. It is also influenced by the loss of Zyprexa exclusivity. Excluding Zyprexa, European price declined 4%.","Turning to Japan. Robust volume growth of 15% was driven primarily by Forteo, Alimta and Zyprexa. The negative 9% price impact reflects the biannual price decreases that took effect earlier this year, primarily affecting Alimta and Gemzar.","Within the Rest of World line, I'd highlight continued strong growth in China,, where sales increased 20% this quarter, driven by multiple products, most notably Humalog, Humulin, Zyprexa and Cialis.","More broadly, Emerging Markets sales declined 6%, driven by a 6% decline from weaker foreign currencies. Excluding FX, Emerging Markets revenue was flat despite a significant impact of generics, particularly in Brazil and Mexico. As we discussed when providing guidance in early January, in 2012 we expect generics to negatively affect our Emerging Market sales by about $250 million or roughly 10% of 2011 Emerging Markets sales. Excluding both FX and the effect of generics in Q3, our Emerging Markets business would have grown 13%.","Elanco Animal Health delivered double-digit volume growth of 10%. Overall, Animal Health sales growth of 6% was smaller than in prior quarters due to a number of factors, including annualization of revenue from acquisitions, stocking of Trifexis in prior quarters that did not recur in Q3, and weak September food animal sales. It's unclear if this was a temporary phenomenon or a signal of weakening demand. Elanco continues to outperform the broader animal health market and is poised to delivered double-digit income growth during the YZ years and beyond.","Finally, the 19% decrease in collaboration and other revenue is due to the transfer of U.S. exenatide rights to Amylin. Excluding exenatide, collaboration and other revenue grew 19% in the quarter.","Slide 11 shows the year-on-year growth of select line items of our non-GAAP income statement, with and without the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates. As was the case last quarter, FX contributed positively to EPS growth in Q3 despite weaker foreign currencies. While FX did have a negative effect on revenue, this was more than offset by the positive effect of FX on operating expenses and especially on international inventories sold, which flows through cost of sales. You can see that FX reduced revenue growth by 3 percentage points in Q3, while it reduced operating expense growth by 2 percentage points. In contrast to these more modest movements due to FX, you can also see that cost of sales decreased 10%, including FX, but increased 8%, excluding FX. In part, the FX effect is due to weaker foreign currencies reducing the U.S. dollar value of O-U.S. manufacturing expense. However, the vast majority of the FX effect is from the impact of foreign exchange on international inventories sold. Specifically in Q3 of last year, this FX effect substantially increased cost of goods sold, while this year, it substantially decreased cost of goods sold. As a result, at the bottom line, you can see that the Q3 EPS declined 30%, including FX, and 37%, excluding FX.","For your information, on Slide 12, we provided the year-on-year growth of select line items of our reported income statement with and without the effect of foreign exchange rates. Next, I'll provide a brief pipeline update before turning the call over to Derica.","Slide 13 shows our pipeline as of October 17. Changes since our last earnings call are highlighted with green arrows showing progression and red arrows showing attrition. You'll see that we began Phase III testing of our once-daily oral CETP inhibitor, Evacetrapib, being studied for the treatment of high-risk vascular disease. Our pivotal trial called ACCELERATE, began earlier this month. It's slated to enroll approximately 11,000 patients and could complete in late 2015. In addition, we began Phase II testing of a monoclonal antibody for potential use in migraine prevention and began Phase I testing of 3 potential medicines for insomnia and cancer.","Finally, as Phil mentioned, we terminated Phase III development of pomaglumetad methionil. We also terminated 1 Phase II asset and 3 Phase I assets. We continue to believe that our robust pipeline, including 12 potential new medicines in Phase III testing spanning oncology, diabetes, cardiovascular, neuroscience and autoimmune diseases, positions us well for growth post 2014. Our recent data readouts reinforce our confidence in the potential of our pipeline.","Now I'll turn the call over to Derica to cover some of the key events for 2012, our financial guidance and some closing comments before we open the call for Q&A. Derica?","Derica W. Rice","Thanks, Travis. First, I'll provide a progress update on key events we've highlighted for 2012. Now as illustrated here, the checkmarks show what we've achieved so far this year. We're pleased with the number of green check marks, indicating positive progress and outcomes.","Now since the second quarter earnings call, we received U.S. approval of the Alimta continuation maintenance indication, we started Phase III development of Evacetrapib in high-risk vascular disease, we've terminated Phase III development of mGlu2\/3. And we announced results of a number of Phase III clinical trials, including solanezumab in Alzheimer's disease, Effient in ACS medical management, the Alimta POINTBREAK trial, the REGARD trial of ramucirumab in second-line gastric cancer, and top line results of 3 of the Phase III trials for dulaglutide.","I'd also highlight that later this year, we plan to begin Phase III trials for baricitinib, our oral JAK1\/JAK2 inhibitor for rheumatoid arthritis, which we have in partnership with Incyte. In addition, we plan to disclose 24-week data from the Phase IIb trial of baricitinib at ACR next month. Along with Incyte, we will also host an on-site investor event to review the data.","Now as Phil mentioned earlier, we are pleased with the progress we continue to make in advancing our pipeline, and we look forward to continuing this momentum and sharing both top line and detailed results with the scientific and investment communities.","Turning to our 2012 financial guidance. Our continued solid performance puts us on track to meet our previously issued revenue and non-GAAP EPS guidance. You will see that we have made updates to a couple of line items primarily to reflect the income recognized in Q3 related to accelerated repayments of the exenatide revenue-sharing obligation. Please note that our GAAP guidance does not assume any additional income as recognized during 2012 related to the exenatide revenue-sharing obligation. As mentioned earlier, we do expect to recognize income of approximately $490 million in early 2013, which is contingent upon transfer of exenatide commercial rights outside of the U.S.","Moving to the individual line items. We still expect revenue to be between $21.8 billion and $22.8 billion; gross margin as a percent of revenue to be approximately 78%; marketing, selling and administrative expenses to be between $7.3 billion and $7.7 billion; and R&D expenses to be between $5 billion and $5.3 billion. On a non-GAAP basis, OID is now expected to be in the range of a net deduction of $75 million to $150 million. Due to the early payment of the exenatide revenue-sharing obligation, OID on a GAAP basis is now expected to be in the range of a net gain between $640 million and $715 million.","The non-GAAP tax rate is still expected to be approximately 21%, and the GAAP tax rate is expected to be approximately 23.5%, reflecting the income booked this quarter from Amylin's early payment of the exenatide revenue-sharing obligation. Both assumed R&D tax credit is passed before year-end and made retroactive to January 1. Should this not occur, our full year tax rates would be higher, and our full year EPS would be about $0.07 to $0.08 lower.","We still expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $3.30 to $3.40 per share. GAAP EPS is now expected to be in the range of $3.68 to $3.78 per share. Capital expenditures are still expected to be roughly $800 million. Also during the fourth quarter, we intend to repurchase the remaining $420 million of Lilly shares to complete our previously authorized share repurchase program.","Slide 16 provides a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS for 2011 and the associated growth rates from these numbers to our 2012 guidance.","In closing, I want to again recognize all my Lilly colleagues for their resolve in addressing this challenging period. They've continued to execute our strategy of advancing our pipeline of driving growth and improving productivity. As a result, we continue to deliver solid financial performance, and we are on track to meet or exceed our midterm financial minimum goals.","We also believe we're on track to realize the fruits of our innovation strategy. Now we know this strategy is not without risks, but we believe it is the best way to improve human health and to create value for our shareholders. We're very encouraged by the recent data we've generated for solanezumab, ramucirumab and dulaglutide. And over the next 18 months, we'll see even more clinical data that will help you better gauge our longer-term growth potential. As always, we'll keep you updated on our progress.","This concludes our prepared remarks. And now we'll take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] First question is from the line of Catherine Arnold, Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Catherine J. Arnold - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I just wanted to ask you a couple of product-related questions. On the ramu gastric study, I understand you have a combination trial that should be reporting on, I believe, next year. But I think you had potentially changed your plans it's filing. You may be filing for the monotherapy trial that you just press released. Could you confirm what your filing strategy is for gastric? And then I also wanted to ask you, in terms of your biosimilar Lantus program, do you -- can you confirm that you have one or both of those studies and how -- what are your plans are for releasing that data and if it met your expectations? And if I could just throw one more in, on baricitinib, you didn't identify that going into Phase III, but obviously, the Phase II data on ACR are actually very positive. I would assume that's just a function of conversations with your partner, if you could comment there.","Derica W. Rice","Absolutely. Catherine, thank you for the questions. I'll go ahead and handle your first on the filing strategy for ramucirumab gastric cancer, we'll have Enrique chime in on the trials for our insulin glargine product. And then, Travis, do you want to give us an update on [indiscernible] ACR as well on the baricitinib piece.","Travis Coy","Okay.","Derica W. Rice","So Catherine, as you mentioned, the original strategy was to have this gastric monotherapy trial to be a supportive trial for a submission that would include the gastric combination data once it matures in the latter part of next year. Based on the strength of the data that we've seen in the monotherapy trial, we will go ahead and discuss with regulators that data and the possibility of having a standalone application. And we'll keep you guys appraised of our progress in that regard. Enrique?","Enrique A. Conterno","Yes, thanks for the question. Regarding the new insulin glargine product, we are in the process of reviewing the data. We're not going to be announcing what the results of those studies are. But so far, I would say that the data looks encouraging.","Travis Coy","And with regards to baricitinib, Catherine, we're obviously very encouraged by the data we saw on safety and efficacy front for baricitinib. And we do anticipate the Phase III could start imminently. We look forward to disclosing more of that data at ACR at the investor meeting and also describing in more detail the Phase III development program.","Derica W. Rice","Catherine, this is Derica. We're able to and we do plan to start Phase III for baricitinib in the fourth quarter. That would also be one quarter earlier that we were anticipating, so credit to our development and regulatory group. That also comes with that a $50 million milestone payment that we would accelerate payment for as well to Incyte that was planned for Q1 that now will be moved into the fourth quarter.","Philip Johnson","And that is contemplated, Catherine, in the guidance that we provided as well for the full year.","Operator","And the next question is from the line of Greg Gilbert, Bank of America Merrill.","Gregory B. Gilbert - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","First, by when should we hear from Lilly what next steps are on sola? And then for Enrique, a couple diabetes questions. First on lin and log, was there any pressure on ASPs or inventory destocking in the quarter or anything else to comment on that franchise as it seems a bit soft relative to script trends? And lastly, the dulaglutide data shared to-date seems to support approvability but does not really help us understand whether the drug will be competitive against the market leader. Is there anything you can say about that other than just wait and see for the actual proof?","Philip Johnson","Greg, we'll have Jan take your first question on sola, then I'll go to Enrique for the 2 diabetes questions. Jan?","Jan M. Lundberg","First, we are encouraged by our data on sola showing slowing nano-cognitive decline in the mild Alzheimer population. What I can say is that we will provide you with an update once we have received the clear guidance from regulatory authorities on the next steps for sola.","Philip Johnson","Enrique?","Enrique A. Conterno","Greg, let me start with the dulaglutide. We are very encouraged by the results from AWARD-1, 3 and 5. We were able to demonstrate statistically superior in the reduction of hemoglobin A1C from baseline versus all of the comparators in some of the secondary endpoints. When we think about dulaglutide, I think what we basically see is a product that embodies the best attributes of the GLP-1s that we see in the market and the ones that we see coming. We have a very competitive efficacy on tolerability profile. It is a once-weekly dosing and a very user-friendly device. So from our perspective, we like what our chances are when it comes to dulaglutide competing in the GLP-1 markets. Now related to insulin, clearly this is a very competitive environment. In the U.S., we are -- we were and we are expecting the Q3 and Q4 will be tough compared quarters. As you may recall, we were gaining share in the first half of last year, and we lost share in the first half of this year. That makes Q3 and Q4 difficult from a comparison perspective on a quarter-to-quarter basis versus the previous year. What we see, though, is that our share in the U.S. has been stable, flat over the last 3 to 4 months, which is encouraging for us. Outside of the U.S., we've seen a little bit of a slowdown in the overall insulin market. We need to watch that a little bit further. But we continue when it comes to our share trends, we continue with our performance, which is basically some share gains in both the mealtime insulin market were the relevant market for us, as well as human insulin. It is difficult to say whether there's been destocking at the wholesaler or at the retail level. We clearly have a little more visibility in the wholesaler level than the retail level. But if you were to look at some of the script trends, I may agree with you. There might have been some destocking, but we don't have full visibility there.","Operator","Next question is from the line of David Risinger, Morgan Stanley.","David Risinger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I have 3 questions on the pipeline. First, can you just help us understand when we are going to see data on ramu versus a control arm that is on traditional cancer therapies? Second, with respect to the insulin glargine comment, could you just explain why you're not disclosing that data? It seems like Lilly has been disclosing more pipeline data this year, and I just wanted to understand why you're not disclosing that data. And then third, I was hoping that you could provide a framework for the upcoming CTAD conference next Monday on the upcoming disclosures and your plans for communication and discussion of the CDR-Sum of Boxes and biomarkers.","Philip Johnson","Great, Dave. Thanks for your questions. We'll have Travis take your question for the ramucirumab data disclosure, Enrique for insulin glargine, and I'll finalize it with the CTAD disclosures.","Travis Coy","Thanks, Dave. I'm assuming you're talking about the combination gastric cancer trial that we have in combination with paclitaxel. So we'll hope to see that data and complete that trial sometime mid next year.","Philip Johnson","Enrique?","Enrique A. Conterno","Yes. It's -- in this particular case, it seems what we're looking at is basically establishing comparability versus Lantus. For competitive reasons, what I -- we don't have any plans to basically disclose the different trials. As we have shared in the past, we expect to be filing this product sometime next year.","Philip Johnson","Great. And Dave, in terms of CTAD, as it was at ANA, the group that will be presenting the data is the ADCS group. It will be Dr. Rochelle Doody again presenting that data that they have analyzed independently. At this point, we don't know the specifics around what might be presented. You may recall that at the ANA meeting, she had mentioned that they'd likely be presenting biomarker data, as well as potential other secondary endpoints, like the CDR-Sum of Boxes. In terms of the expectations, we did on our call that Monday evening at ANA provide sort of a top line, if you will, of what we saw with biomarkers. Now with our slide 18, it was the second bullet point, where we had said that in our analysis, solanezumab did demonstrate target engagement. You should be thinking there are things like plasma and CSF Abeta 1-40 and 1-42 measurements. We did see evidence of an effect on plaque, there you'd be looking at things like differential effects on Abeta 1-42 compared to 1-40, as well as the Amyvid scans. And then we said we did not see evidence of an effect on the cellular pathology of Alzheimer's disease. I guess, a more complicated way of saying that things like phosphotal and your volumetric MRI did not demonstrate treatment effect. And again, more detailed data will be coming at CTAD, presented by the ADCS group. Finally, in terms of just data disclosures in general for ramucirumab, the gastric monotherapy trial that we had the top line release on, it's still unclear exactly what venues that will be presented in, but clearly, you can imagine that we'd be shooting for things like ASCO mid next year, as well as potentially the ASCO GI conference that's early in the year. And then that gastric -- or combination trial, excuse me, since it won't read out data internally until we get into the second half of the year, it might not have a scientific data disclosure until '14.","David Risinger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And on CDR-Sum of Boxes, Phil?","Philip Johnson","And Yes, CDR-Sum of Boxes, again, our guess is that there will be more details provided by ADCS. As you know from prior discussions and the presentation we have, we saw great consistency on a number of measurements across both studies, cognitive and functional, ADAS-Cog11, ADAS-Cog14 and MMSE for functional, as well as things like the ADCS-ADL and in particular, the IADL for the functional scale. The CDR-Sum of Boxes did not show a statistically significant result and did not behave as we had anticipated or hoped. Again, we're looking into why that may have occurred and some of the explanations. And again, it may be that the ADCS presents some of their specific data findings and conclusions on that at CTAD. I would say that in coming months, maybe even yet this year, but definitely early next year, you should expect to see additional presentations and publications likely both by ADCS and Lilly on the solanezumab EXPEDITION trials.","Operator","Next question is from the line of Mark Schoenebaum, ISI Group.","Mark J. Schoenebaum - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I had to hop off for a minute so I apologize if this was asked, but I think the next data point for ramucirumab is breast cancer. I was wondering -- and I think that the primary endpoint in that trial was PFS? I was just wondering if -- what the company's position is on the filability\/approvability of ramucirumab with just a PFS benefit given obviously the [indiscernible] experience. And then my second question -- my second and final question was if I could go back perhaps to the margin, longer-term margin guidance that you gave on your July call and maybe just a follow-up on that. Could you just clarify for us, is that margin guidance dependent on pipeline success in any way? And I guess I'll just leave it at that.","Philip Johnson","Great. Thanks, Mark. We'll have Travis handle your first question for ramucirumab. And then I'll ask Derica for the long-term margin guidance. Travis?","Travis Coy","Hey, Mark, with respect to ramucirumab and breast cancer, we expect to have that progression. So yes, I can confirm the primary endpoint for that trial is progression-free survival. We expect to have that data sometime mid-next year. However, I do also need to mention that we are also looking, in conjunction with the progression-free survival, for trends in overall survival. And specifically, we'll look at the interim overall survival results, which we intend to have about the same time as the final progression-free results. So and I -- when I say have those, I mean have those internally. So again, this may be similar to the gastric combination trial that Phil mentioned, where we may not be in a position to disclose those results externally until 2014.","Philip Johnson","Before we go over to Derica, in terms of the filability, Mark, our expectations would be that the ability to file based on the final PFS data and interim OS data will depend on the strength of that data. But yes, if it's extremely strong PFS data, and there's a very strong trend on the interim OS, that is certainly a possibility, obviously, subject to discussions with regulators. The trial is, in fact, powered for OS even though that is a secondary endpoint. So Derica, if you can comment on the long-term margin guidance.","Derica W. Rice","Sure. Mark, the -- we are committed to improving our margins beyond 2014 regardless. Clearly, at this stage, we're planning on driving growth, driven by the output from our pipeline. And we're very encouraged as we talked about earlier the data that we're seeing. This is always our -- part of our long-term strategy. And clearly, we still have other cards to turn over. But even if the pipeline wasn't successful or as successful as we had hoped for, we would still seek to take actions to improve our margins. So that longer-term guidance that we provided is really where we see taking the business regardless of the pipeline outcomes when we look beyond that 2014 timeframe. And I must say, today, when I look at the underlying growth of our business, 9% growth in the U.S., excluding Zyprexa; Japan is still growing 15% volumes; Alimta growing 13% volume; China growing 20%, we're very much on track to meet or exceed those minimum financial goals that we set between now -- for 2014. And that was also very important that we are -- our starting point is on the right bases. And we're very encouraged by what -- the trends that we're seeing.","Operator","Next question is from the line of Jami Rubin, Goldman Sachs.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just a couple of questions, and again, apologies if this was asked before I had to jump off. But the Humalog and Humilin sales were light relative to our expectations. And looking at insulin scripts, insulin scripts have been strong. So what's happening with the pricing environment? Is Novo taking or has Novo taken market share from you? If you can just provide a little bit more granularity on what you're seeing there. And also I don't know if you answered the question as previously on ramu for gastric cancer, what your filing plans are for that indication.","Philip Johnson","Great. Thanks, Jami. You did ask a little more detailed than had been asked on the prior question for Humalog and Humulin about -- from the pricing environment thing, so in the interest of time, if it's okay, we'll have Enrique answer that. We actually did answer the filing question for ramucirumab. So I'll be happy to follow up with you as soon as the call has concluded.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's fine. I'm sorry about that.","Philip Johnson","No problem. Enrique?","Enrique A. Conterno","Sure. We do see pricing pressure in the U.S. in particular. What we basically see is that the negotiations that we basically have with some of the major players are more difficult than we have seen. Their leverage increase, as they have the ability to be able to move share as they restrict access to products, given the contracts that they are able to establish. So yes, there is some pressure. As we see from our perspective next year, we expect to maintain the access that we basically have, if anything, maybe a slight net gain when it comes to the life for both human insulin, Humulin, as well as Humalog.","Operator","Next question is from the line of Tim Anderson, Sanford Bernstein.","Tim Anderson - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","On -- back on the insulin products that lost formulary positioning in the U.S., that contributed to weaker sales in the quarter. Can you talk about whether you think there might be further formulary slippage going into 2013? And then on Alzheimer's disease, I have a question, not on solanezumab, but rather on Amyvid, your imaging agent. You bought the company that developed the compound a couple of years ago, and you brought it in-house. And I'm trying to understand the strategic rationale for doing that, seeing as Lilly doesn't really have a diagnostics business. Are you expecting that Amyvid could be a significant product in terms of its sales potential as a stand-alone product? Or is the greater value tied to it somehow having synergies from the standpoint of developing your therapeutics?","Philip Johnson","Great. Thanks, Tim, for the questions. We'll go to Enrique, obviously, for the insulin question, and then to John on the strategy around Amyvid. Enrique?","Enrique A. Conterno","Yes. We do not expect to see slips when it comes to formulary. What we expect, if anything, net gain, a slight net gain, when it comes to lives that are covered when we look at both Humilin and Humalog.","John C. Lechleiter","With respect to Amyvid, the decision to acquire the company was one that we made independent of our assessment at that time of the likelihood of success with a therapeutic. We believe then and we believe now that it's going to be important to provide tools like this to help positions, make better diagnoses of people who are presumed maybe but not proven yet to have Alzheimer's. So this is a company that we invested in through our venture fund and sort of had a connection with already when we made that decision to acquire Abbott. I think the way in which this plays out, in other words, if the question is if there are going to be other PET ligands that we develop, other diagnostic tools that we develop, I will say that we are maintaining an active research program today at Avid across several different diseases, including Alzheimer's. And we'll continue to move forward with that and to consider the role that -- or the -- consider this in light of the fact that we have a pipeline that has a number of molecules and that they could emerge as therapeutic agents. I'd also like to note that in early October, CMS began what will probably be about a year-long process of looking at the question of reimbursability of these imaging agents in this category. Recall that over 10 years ago, a rule was put in place. It really limited the use of PET imaging reimbursement from the standpoint of Medicare reimbursement to the FDG-type applications. So this, as we've said all along dating back from the approval, is a very important aspect of us ultimately being able to supply Amyvid to people who could then get and hope to receive reimbursement through Medicare.","Operator","Marc Goodman, UBS.","Marc Goodman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Yes, a couple questions. First, Derica, can you just talk about, with respect to cost cutting, where we are for the immediate term? I know you mentioned a longer-term guidance, and obviously, those changes will be made according to the pipeline. But right now, when we look at it, have you made most of the cuts, or are they in the numbers, or are there still a couple more quarters from the original work that you were doing? Second question is if you could point to the Phase II pipeline, which you've got a lot of products in there, and just talk about 1 or 2 that are -- you're most excited about that we should be focused on. And then third, back to the GLP-1 market, if you could just talk about what's going on there in the market, what you're seeing, and how excited you are about your product? I'm looking at BYDUREON, Scripps, and they don't seem to be moving as much as you would've expected. So I guess I was curious how your product relates to that and about the overall market and your expectations.","Philip Johnson","Great. Thanks for the questions, Marc. Obviously, Derica for the first on the cost cutting. Jan will come over to you then for the Phase II pipeline. And then back to you, Enrique, on the GLP-1 market.","Derica W. Rice","Mark, in regard to cost cutting, as you see this quarter, our total expenses actually declined 3%. Now that's primarily driven by our SG&A. And then in fact, our R&D expense was up 5%. But the net decline was 3%. We still see further opportunities to continue to improve our cost base. We're still employing tools like Six Sigma, and we're still looking at other transformation opportunities. Obviously, as our pipeline plays out, that will also impact what our footprint and our infrastructure looks like going forward as well. But we have not let our foot up off the gas in terms of continuing to look for greater efficiencies and more prudent ways to run our business. And we think that that's really showing in the results that you're seeing. In regards to where we are versus where we had planned to be, I think we're actually ahead of schedule. We more than exceeded our $1 billion cost-reduction goals last year, by the end of 2011. We're very much on track to be consistent with the cost bases that we are anticipating in this '12 to '14 timeframe. So I'm very encouraged by the results and the trends that I'm seeing, Marc. Jan?","Jan M. Lundberg","Right. So let me start by mentioning again baricitinib, the oral molecule then for autoimmune disease developed together with Incyte. And as you heard, that will be presented in more details very soon. The next one is the beta-secretase inhibitor, which is an oral agent in the Alzheimer's disease space. Again, in the amyloid pathway, and there has been an interesting study presented now that shows if you have mutations in the amyloid precursor protein at the [indiscernible], you are protected against Alzheimer's disease, a study from the from the Icelandic population. And we believe our base inhibitor could mimic this genetic experiment, so to say, in humans. And we have a Phase II study ongoing, where we actually have imaging positivity for Amyvid as an inclusion criteria to directly study that population. The next one is glosuzumab [ph], a Sclerostin antibody where we have -- are receiving Phase IIb data as a bone anabolic, but it looks very promising. And finally, an oral agent in diabetes, a glucagon receptor antagonist, where we also see opportunities to lower blood glucose using this very well-established mechanism that actually never have been exploited in diabetes, particularly type 2 treatment.","Derica W. Rice","Marc, in addition -- this is Derica. One of the other things we're encouraged by is we don't have to rely on a single asset. So much like we talked about for our Phase III portfolio, where we've got 12 assets sitting there, we're not a one-horse bet here. Likewise, when we look at our Phase II pipeline, we've got 22 assets that are sitting there today. And you're talking about the breadth of both biologics versus small molecule. And therapeutically, we're looking at spans from oncology to still the neuroscience space, as Jan said, with BACE to also diabetes. And so we're able to also continue to maintain the breadth in terms of our portfolio outlook that you're seeing today in terms of our current business mix.","Philip Johnson","Enrique, for the GLP-1?","Enrique A. Conterno","Sure. When we look at the market for GLP-1s, outside of the U.S., I would say that we're seeing good growth, in particular, in markets where BYDUREON has been launched, whether it's Germany or the U.K. I think the growth overall I think is meeting expectations. When it comes to the U.S., we've seen somewhat of a slowdown when it comes to the GLP-1 market. I won't be able to comment on the BYDUREON performance in the U.S. That question is probably best addressed by Bristol-Myers and AstraZeneca.","Operator","Next question is Chris Schott, JPMorgan.","Christopher Schott - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","First set of questions, just on the -- following up on some of the insulin dynamics. I guess, my first question is just looking at U.S. insulin, you lost some share this year. It sounds like that's stabilized. You're commenting the pricing environment is getting a bit tougher. Can you just comment about what ultimately gets that business to reaccelerate as we think about the longer-term franchise? The second question in insulin, you mentioned some geographies you were seeing a bit of a slowdown in insulin. Just elaborate what geographies those are and what you think is behind all that. And then a final question, shifting gears a little bit to the pipeline. Talk a little bit about the clinical program for your CETP, how you're comparing that to anacetrapib, but I think it's running a very -- can be a bit different Phase III program, and how you see your CETP differentiating from anacetrapib.","Philip Johnson","Great. Thanks for the questions, Chris. We'll have Enrique handle the first 2, and then have Jan and Travis get into the CETP question you've asked. Enrique?","Enrique A. Conterno","Sure. When it comes to the insulin, the overall insulin market, what we basically see is a very significant adoption of DPP-4s. And we commented also on GLP-1s. To some extent, that is delaying the initiation on insulin and some of the earlier use of insulin. We believe that some of these impacts are more short term. I think we saw similar impacts when, for example, metformin was introduced in the U.S. many years ago. So my sense is that we will continue to see long-term insulin growth rates that are much more aligned with the historical rates, but we're seeing some depressed rates now. When it comes to the U.S., clearly, we do see some ebb and flow when it comes to the access in the payer environment. We do expect insulin units to continue to grow. People that are on insulin utilize about 2% to 3% more insulin every single year. So we see a growing market long term in the U.S. What we have to do is make sure that we have a level playing field when it comes to accessing in the U.S. Our position when it comes to access is one of open access and having the ability to compete in that environment. And we like our chances when it comes to both Humalog and Humulin within each of its relevant markets. Now of course, we're very excited about the pipeline that we have and the 2 insulins, the basal analogues, which for us is very significant because for us, all of that means incremental revenue. This is a segment of the market where we do not compete today. And not only will we compete there, but it will make us stronger in the other segments where we do compete today.","Philip Johnson","Jan?","Jan M. Lundberg","In relation to CETP inhibitors, our evacetrapib have shown, as you know, impressive elevation of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, HDL, and also a lowering of LDL, which you could say is relatively similar to what anacetrapib have been publishing. To directly compare them, though, it's harder to do it since we'd really need head-to-head studies. Both agents have also shown that they don't share the properties of torcetrapib, the Pfizer agent that failed in relation to blood pressure effects. The type of outcome trials that we have for evacetrapib is in 11,000-patient trials and with a MACE outcome that is somewhat different in relation to endpoints compared to Merck's trial. And we also have a higher-risk population for cardiovascular outcomes. We are considering potentially here to publish a design paper together with the study investigators to provide more details about this trial.","Operator","Next question is Seamus Fernandez, Leerink.","Seamus Fernandez - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","A couple of questions, one for Derica and John. Can -- you guys now are operating with a fairly significant net cash position, to my understanding, particularly when you consider some of the investments on the balance sheet. Can you just give us your thoughts on capital allocation going forward? You guys have opened up share repurchase possibilities, but that looks like it's going to potentially close out towards the end of this year. The dividend is obviously there, as well as potential M&A opportunities. So just wondering if you could update us as you kind of move towards a larger net cash position. And then the other question, for Enrique. Enrique, can you just maybe give us your thoughts on, again, the opportunity of the larger portfolio in diabetes and what that really -- not just what it offers, but the areas of the world in which you think that will be most impactful? And then just the last question on the Animal Health business, can you just, again, update us on the slowdown in the Animal Health business? And really, it sounded like it was coming from more of the feed additives portion of the market. Which markets in particular was the source of this weakness?","Philip Johnson","Great. Thanks for the questions. Seamus. Derica, you want to start us off with the net cash question and capital allocation?","Derica W. Rice","Sure. In terms of our capital allocation strategy, first, it has very much been tied to our business strategy, and it has not changed. Our first priority was always to make sure that are properly funding our R&D opportunities, and I think we're beginning to see the merits of that investment today, with the data that we've been able to begin to disclose. Our second element of our strategy was to make sure that we -- from a capital standpoint, that we were funding our growth opportunities. So you've seen investments we've made in Animal Health both organically, as well as some of the business development deals we've done. We've talked earlier with John about the acquisition of Amyvid, where we've been able to complement our existing molecular footprint. And those were our first protocols. Given that if we do continue to be very active in the business development space, we said historically we have not been interested in the large-scale M&A, but we have been looking for those opportunities where we can either complement our existing commercial footprint and augment it or bring additional scientific value in terms of portfolio. Having exhausted all those opportunities, our last protocol then will be to begin to return some of that capital back to shareholders. Given our -- the execution of our business strategy and where we stand today and the fact that I believe that we're actually ahead of where we thought we'd be, this is what enabled us to be able to announce our share repurchase resumption back in June. And well, obviously, as we stated at that time in terms of future share repurchases, that's a conversation we'll have, well, with the board, and it will have to be approved each year. But lacking other investment opportunities, we will seek to return that capital to shareholders.","Philip Johnson","Enrique, for the opportunity for the larger portfolio and diabetes?","Enrique A. Conterno","We do see significant opportunities in diabetes across the globe. We are pursuing a broad and comprehensive portfolio of medicines. As we think about, for example, the oral classes, we expect the DPP-4 class and the SGLT-2 class to be the largest oral classes by revenue by the end of the decade. We are pleased with the progress that we're making with Tradjenta. We are gaining share consistently across the world. In particular, in some of the emerging markets, the product where we have comparable access or out-of-pocket market, that product seems to be performing very, very well, and we have some of our high shares in the world. And I think this speaks very well to what the product can offer in a playing field where we basically have comparable access, which is something that we're very much working and improving in the U.S. market. We continue to be encouraged by the data that we see on empagliflozin. We have spoken quite a bit about the GLP-1. And then we have a broad range portfolio of insulins. The critical mass that this portfolio is going to provide to us is very significant. We'll be able to have a very significant reach, which is critical when it comes to geographies all over the world because primary care today is the gatekeeper when it comes to diabetes treatment. So we will have the right portfolio and the right commercial presence to ensure that we're meeting the needs of people with diabetes everywhere.","Philip Johnson","Ilissa?","Ilissa Rassner","For Animal Health, we saw growth of 6% in Q3, which was less than the significant double-digit growth that we saw in previous quarters. In the U.S., the growth was 16%. And outside the United States, we saw a decrease of 4%. The growth was -- the slowing of growth was primarily due to the annualization of revenue from our acquisitions. So last quarter, that contributed 9 percentage points of growth. In this quarter, it only contributed 1 percentage point. We also have mentioned on the call, we saw stocking of Trifexis in prior quarters, which we did not see in this quarter. And then we saw weak September food animal sales, and we're still looking to see if that's an anomaly for this one particular month or something that will continue, which we'll keep a close eye on.","John C. Lechleiter","I just want -- this is John Lechleiter. I want to just make a comment of as you saw on one of the slides we showed you earlier, the volume growth for the quarter was 10% with Elanco, so they were adversely affected by currency to some extent as well. This is going to continue to be a very important segment for us. I think the fact that we've grown up in the last decade or so organically a companion animal business really makes us a little less dependent on the ups and downs in the crops cycle, and the impact that might have on the food animal part of our business. So the secret sauce for Elanco is its pipeline. And this is a company that has been -- has produced more innovation than anybody else in this space. That's really what has driven growth thus far, and we expect that to continue.","Philip Johnson","Great. This is Phil. Since we've gone past the top of the hour, we'll close the Q&A session here. As we break, I would like to recognize individual who for the investors has toiled behind the scenes, that has been an invaluable support in Investor Relations group. That's Arnie Hanish, our Chief Accounting Officer, who's retiring soon after 29 years with the company. So Arnie, thank you for your contributions.","And we thank all of you that have joined us this morning and appreciate your interest in Eli Lilly & Company.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Kevin Hern, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Kevin Hern","Good morning. Thank you for joining us for Eli Lilly and Company's Q2 2019 Earnings Call. I'm Kevin Hern, Vice President of Investor Relations. Joining me on today's call are: Dave Ricks, Lilly's Chairman and CEO; Josh Smiley, our Chief Financial Officer; Dr. Dan Skovronsky, President of Lilly Research Laboratories; Anne White, President of Lilly Oncology; Enrique Conterno, President of Lilly Diabetes and Lilly U.S.A and Patrik Jonsson, who is joining us for the first time as our Incoming President of Lilly Bio-Medicines. We're also joined by Kim Macko and Mike Czapar of the Investor Relations team.","During this conference call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors, including those listed on Slide 3 and those outlined in our latest forms 10-K and 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","The information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It is not intended to be promotional and is not sufficient for prescribing decisions.","As we transition to our prepared remarks, a reminder that our commentary will focus on non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude the financial contribution from Elanco during 2018 and 2019, and present earnings per share as though the full disposition via the exchange offer was complete on January 1, 2018. Now I'll turn the call over to Dave for a summary of our progress in Q2.","Dave Ricks","Thanks Kevin. Well, it's an exciting morning for us here at Eli Lilly and an important day for women around the world living with breast cancer. As we have just announced the positive results showing that Verzenio extends life of the women with breast cancer in the MONARCH 2 trial, more on that in a few minutes, but first let me make a few comments on the overall performance in the quarter.","We continue to execute on our strategic objectives, focusing on launch excellence, progressing our pipeline and improving productivity and our capabilities. Second quarter revenue grew 1% and 3% in constant currency, despite the loss of U.S. exclusivity for Cialis late last year and the impact of Lartruvo\u2019s impending product withdrawal.","Q2 marked our 15th consecutive quarter of worldwide revenue growth. Our performance was driven by volume growth of 6% excluding the Cialis loss of exclusivity and the impact of Lartruvo volume grew nearly 15% led by our key growth products which accounted for 43% of the company's revenue.","Q2 non-GAAP operating margin was 27.9%, representing a 250 basis point decline versus last year. This reflects a decrease in gross margin and increased investment in both our launches and our pipeline. Operating margin improved by 170 basis points versus Q1 of this year, reflecting progress toward our margin goals for 2019 and 2020. We achieved milestones on several pipeline assets since our last earning call, including the FDA approval of Emgality for treatment of episodic cluster headaches in adults. The FDA approval of CYRAMZA as a single agent for patients with High-AFP Second-Line Hepatocellular Carcinoma and FDA approval of Baqsimi, our nasal glucagon for the treatment of severe hypoglycemia in patients with diabetes.","We're pleased to note that for all three of these approvals, the Lilly product represents a first-in-class opportunity within their respective indications. Additional milestones to highlight include the positive Phase 3 data for higher doses of Trulicity in patients with Type 2 diabetes. And the positive Phase 3 overall survival data for Verzenio from the MONARCH 2 study which I mentioned earlier, an exciting milestone for Verzenio differentiating this medicine from others in the CDK 4 & 6 class.","Also in partnership with Pfizer, we're prioritizing a potential U.S. submission of Tanezumab in patients with moderate to severe osteoarthritis pain by Q1 2020, followed by submissions in the EU and Japan. At this time, we are not planning regulatory submissions for moderate to severe chronic low back pain. We continue to leverage our strong operating cash flow to augment our pipeline through external innovation and return capital to shareholders.","We announced a worldwide licensing agreement for novel small molecule from Centrexion Therapeutics that is currently being studied as a potential non-opioid treatment for chronic pain conditions. We completed the $3.5 billion accelerated share repurchase program announced in Q1. And we returned nearly $600 million to shareholders via the dividend.","Moving on to Slide 5 you'll see more detail on the key events since our last earnings call in April. In our continuing efforts to make medicines more affordable for patients, we launched Lily insulin Lispro this quarter, at a list price of 50% lower than current Humalog list price. While an important solution for patients access so far has been limited. We will continue to work with payers to make this important solution accessible to patients.","I would also like to highlight our leadership changes. First, a sincere note of gratitude to Mike Harrington, for his tremendous leadership and service to our company. Mike, you've done a great job defending the company and serving as a key advisor to our leadership team and our board. Second, I would like to welcome Patrik Jonsson as her assumes leadership for our Biomedicines business unit. Patrik is a patient focused leader with a long track record of delivering results in some of our largest markets. Under Patrik's leadership, Lilly Japan has climbed from the 17th ranked Pharma Company in Japan in 2014 to the number six ranking at the end of this year. We delivered the highest growth rate in Japan during that period of time, which included the successful launches of our key growth products. It's great to have Patrik joined the senior leadership team.","Now I'll turn the call over to Josh to review our Q2 results and to provide an update on the financial guidance for the balance of 2019.","Josh Smiley","Thanks, Dave. Slide 6 summarizes our presentation of GAAP results to non-GAAP measures. And Slide 7 provides a summary of our GAAP results. Looking at the non-GAAP measures on Slide 8 you'll see revenue increased 1%. Gross margin as a percent of revenue increased to 81.0%, excluding the impact of FX on international inventory sold, gross margin as a percent of revenue was 80.2%, keeping us on track to achieve our long-term goals for manufacturing efficiency and profitability.","On the same basis our gross margin declined approximately 60 basis points compared to Q2 2018 driven by unfavorable impact of product mix and a negative impact of price on revenue, partially offset by manufacturing efficiencies. Total operating expense increased 8%, with marketing selling and administrative expense increasing 7%, driven primarily by higher marketing investments to support the recent launch of Emgality in the U.S. as well as other key growth products.","R&D expense increased 10% reflecting higher development expenses for late stage assets, including tirzepatide, our RET-Inhibitor and mirikizumab. Total operating income decreased 7% compared to Q2 2018 driven by all the investments that I just mentioned, which put our operating income as a percent of revenue at 27.9% for the quarter. As our recent launches continued to drive revenue and operating leverage, we expect income growth and improvements in operating margins, while we remain on track to achieve our full year guidance of 28% as well as our 2020 target of 31%.","Other income and expense was expense of $32 million this quarter compared to income of $21 million in Q2 2018. This was driven by higher net interest expense primarily related to the Loxo acquisition. Our tax rate was 10%, a decrease of 670 basis points compared with the same quarter last year, driven primarily by a net discrete tax benefit associated with the resolution of U.S. and foreign tax audits as well as the timing associated with the impact of U.S. tax reform.","At the bottom line net income declined 3%, while earnings per share increased 1% due to a reduction in shares outstanding from share repurchases. In Q2 we made good progress aligned with our strategic priorities as evidenced by driving strong volume based revenue growth despite significant headwinds from the loss of exclusivity of Cialis in the U.S. and the impact of Lartruvo. Investing behind key growth brands such as Emgality, Verzenio, Taltz, Jardiance and Trulicity and continued pipeline progress, including three regulatory approvals, two submissions and positive Phase 3 readouts for two key growth products.","Slide 9 outlines, these same non-GAAP measures year-to-date, while Slide 10 provide the reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS and you'll find additional details on these adjustments on Slides 27 and 28.","Moving to Slide 11, let's take a look at the effect of price rate and volume on revenue growth. This quarter, worldwide revenue grew 3% on a performance basis, driven by a 6% increase in volume, partially offset by price. Foreign Exchange reduced revenue growth by 2%, for the tenth straight quarter we delivered volume growth in each major geography. U.S. revenue was flat compared to the second quarter of 2018, volume growth of 5% was led by Trulicity, Taltz, Jardiance and Alimta, excluding Cialis and Lartruvo, volume grew nearly 17% in the U.S., with our diabetes products delivering over 24% volume growth.","Consistent with our 2019 financial guidance, U.S. price declined 4% with nearly 3% driven by increased rebates in the Medicare Part D coverage gap resulting from the change this year that moved manufacturing funding from 50% to 70% of the doughnut hole. Approximately 2% was due to unfavorable segments mix. The remaining 1% price favorability is a mix of modest list price increases and favorable adjustments to estimates for rebates and discounts partially offset by higher contracted rebates and patient affordability.","Going forward, we expect the changes in coverage gap funding to continue to impact Q3 with less impact in Q4 and we still anticipate mid-single-digit declines in U.S. price for the full year. Moving on to Europe, revenue grew 6% excluding FX, driven by volume partially offset by the negative impact of price. Volume growth is led by Trulicity, Olumiant and Taltz. In Japan, revenue growth of 4% excluding FX was driven by volume, with Verzenio, Olumiant and Cymbalta as key contributors to the growth. Revenue in the rest of the world increased 12% excluding FX led by 26% growth in China on the same basis.","At the bottom of the Slide is the same information for our June year-to-date results. As shown on Slide 12, our key growth products were once again the engine of our worldwide volume growth. These products drove 15.4 percentage points of volume growth this quarter, reinforcing our confidence in achieving our 2020 revenue goals.","Branded that have experienced loss of exclusivity provided a drag of 650 basis points driven primarily by Cialis. As expected, and we've seen a rapid erosion of Cialis sales, following the entry of generics in the U.S. market at the end of September last year. We expect this drag to continue in Q3 and begin to normalize in Q4.","Slide 13 provides a view of our key growth products. In total, these brands generated over $2.4 billion in revenue this quarter growing to 43% of revenue. In addition to the sustained strong performance of Trulicity, Taltz and Jardiance, I'd like to highlight the performance of CYRAMZA, which grew 19% in the U.S. as our share of market doubled in second-line lung. We look forward to continued growth as we launch the High-AFP HCC indication in the second quarter and expect to submit first line metastatic EGFR mutated non-small cell lung cancer in the U.S. later this year.","We're excited to see Emgality continue to gain share, exiting Q2 at 41% share of market for new-to-brand prescription in the U.S. which is an increase of approximately 9 share points where we exited Q1. As our best-in-class access continues to grow, we exited the quarter with paid script of approximately one-third of total U.S. scripts. We look forward Emgality continuing its strong uptake in U.S contributing meaningfully to sales in the second half of 2019.","Slide 14 shows the year-over-year select lines of our income statement, focusing on our non-GAAP results, foreign exchange rates had little impact on gross margin and modest positive impact on operating expenses, operating income and EPS.","Turning to our 2019 financial guidance on Slide 15, you'll see that we've updated our non-GAAP guidance that reflects increase in our bottom line results for the year. Specifically, we're raising and narrowing the range for SG&A expense of $5.9 billion to $6.1 billion, reflecting continued investments in recent launches. We are lowering the range for other income and deductions to zero to an expense of $150 million reflecting first half gains in our equity portfolio.","We're decreasing our tax rates from a range of 14% to 15%, to 13% to 14% to reflect the net discrete tax benefits associated with the resolution of tax audits in future. And we are raising our non-GAAP earnings per share range to $5.67 per share to $5.77 per share, which reflects the Q2 discrete tax benefit as our performance expectations remains unchanged. On a reported basis, the tax rate is expected to be in the range of 14% to 15% and our earnings per share for 2019 is now expected to be in the range of $8.58 per share to $8.68 per share.","Slide 16 shows the progress we've made towards our 2020 revenue and operating margin goals. On the left of the slide, the midpoint of our 2019 guidance represents 5% revenue growth over 2018 in constant currency, despite headwinds from the loss of exclusivity for Cialis and the impact of Lartruvo. With that performance in 2019, we would need to grow sales at 6% in 2020 to achieve the 2015-2020 minimum compounded annual growth rate of 7% that we've outlined.","As the headwind from Cialis LOE and Lartruvo abates in 2020 and our new products continue to scale, we're confident that we'll achieve that minimum revenue goal. On the right, you can see that we've delivered significant margin expansion since 2015, increasing from just under 20% to over 29% last year. Again, as the impact of the Cialis LOE and Lartruvo diminishes this year. As our new products continue to scale, we're confident we'll achieve our 2020 goal at 31% operating margin.","On Slide 17, we provide an update on capital allocation. Aligned with our strategic priorities, we spend over $10 billion in the first half of the year to drive future growth between our business development activities, capital expenditures and internal investment in R&D. In addition, we've returned nearly $5 billion to shareholders. As we look ahead to the second half of the year, we'll continue to fund the growth of our new \u2013 our key products and recent launches, invest in our pipeline, seek external innovation to augment our future growth prospects and return capital to shareholders.","Now, we'll turn the call over to Dan to highlight our progress on R&D.","Dan Skovronsky","Thanks Josh. It's been an exciting quarter for R&D results, really capped off with a big news this morning that Verzenio\u2019s MONARCH 2 trial demonstrated positive efficacy at the interim analysis, improving overall survival for women with HR-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer. A bit more color on Verzenio and its important results in a minute. But first I'll summarize some of the other R&D highlights for the quarter.","Slide 18 shows select pipeline opportunities as of July 25th. Movements since our last earnings call includes the regulatory approvals that Dave mentioned earlier, the regulatory submission of empagliflozin in collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim for type 1 diabetes and the regulatory submission of CYRAMZA for first-line EGFR-positive non-small cell lung cancer. The initiation of Phase 3 testing for baricitinib and alopecia areata. Iinitiation of Phase 1 per five assets including our Oral GLP-1 Receptor Agonist and the attrition of two Phase 1 molecules.","Moving to Slide 19, since the last earnings call, we've made progress on a number of key events that we're monitoring for 2019, including the approvals, submissions and top line disclosures that Dave and I have already mentioned. New this quarter, we've added the top line readout for pegilodecakin SEQUOIA trial to the Phase 3 trial in combination with FOLFOX with second-line pancreatic cancer. And we expect this event driven trial to read out later this year.","We'll recall that ARMO had moved this program into Phase 3 based on limited data for Phase 1, this was driven by the high unmet medical need in second-line pancreatic cancer. As we've shared in previous updates, we still see lung and renal cancer as the key indications for this molecule. Later this year, we'll initiate a study in renal cell cancer, as well as a biomarker driven studies in lung cancer. In diabetes, we had a number of medical presentations at this year's American Diabetes Association meeting, including Ultra Rapid Lispro for type 1 and type 2 diabetes, the Trulicity REWIND CV outcome study, as well as several tirzepatide datasets.","I'll share a few key takeaways from the ADA meeting. Moving to Slide 20, I'll highlight the tirzepatide dose escalation study. The study demonstrated consistent efficacy with improved tolerability relative to the Phase 2b study that we shared at EASD in 2018. This is evidenced by significant reduction in the treatment discontinuation rates shown here. The GI side effects that did occur were mostly mild to moderate and were less severe than in the first Phase 2b study. These results are encouraging, particularly because the dose escalation in the Phase 3 study was a slower step-wise design and was tested in the Phase 2 dose escalation study.","We believe tirzepatide has the opportunity to reset treatment expectations for patients for HbA1c and weight loss relative to current therapies. Five trials in the surpass program are already underway and we look forward to data readouts beginning in 2021.","Turning to Slide 21, you'll see summary data regarding the REWIND cardiovascular outcome study for Trulicity. As a reminder, the patient population included in REWIND was different from other CV studies for GLP-1s, as observed by the notably lower rate of MACE events in the placebo arm updated on the left. Studying a lower CV risk patient population established a high bar to demonstrate efficacy and generated data and a population that's more representative of diabetes patients seen in physicians\u2019 offices.","Despite the high bar for efficacy, Trulicity demonstrated clinically meaningful 12% reduction in MACE while demonstrating safety consistent with prior studies. Equally impressive is the consistency of MACE results, which showed a benefit across a variety of measures, most notably the prespecified subgroups of patients with and without prior CV disease. We expect the label to reflect the broad population we studied, and we look forward to hearing from regulators on our submissions.","Moving to Slide 22. Last quarter, we highlighted the four big late-phase bets we've made over the last 12 months. This quarter, I'd like to highlight select Phase 2 opportunities. But first, let me start with some comments on Verzenio. Obviously, we've made exciting progress with this medicine, now generating additional data in Phase 2 and Phase 3, which highlight Verzenio's important differentiation versus other CDK 4\/6 inhibitors. When we previewed upcoming data readouts at our December 2018 investor meeting, we highlighted three important readouts that we expected over three consecutive years. We said we expected Phase 2 data in HER2-positive patients in 2019, Phase 3 data for overall survival for MONARCH 2 in 2020 and Phase 3 adjuvant data in 2021.","We're pleased to show today that the first two of these readouts have occurred and both are positive. As per our press release this morning, the MONARCH 2 readout occurred earlier than expected and showed Verzenio extended life for women with metastatic HR-positive HER2-negative breast cancer. This interim analysis was the first robust analysis of overall survival and required a stringent p-value. While we had originally expected this trial to go to its final analysis in 2020, the results were strong enough to meet the endpoint at the interim analysis, making Verzenio the first and only CDK 4\/6 inhibitor in combination with fulvestrant to achieve statistically significant improvement in overall survival.","We look forward to presenting these results later this year and working with regulators to submit this important new data. In addition, we're announcing today that our Phase 2 trial in HER2-positive breast cancer was positive, making Verzenio the first CDK 4\/6 inhibitor to show positive efficacy in a randomized controlled trial in this HER2-positive population. We'll work with regulators to determine the appropriate next steps. Also, we're pleased to hear today that MONARCH plus, our Phase 3 study in China, was stopped early due to efficacy. This data will support our upcoming submission for approval in China. Finally, I should say we're still very much looking forward to receiving data in the adjuvant population, and our Phase 3 trial in this population is still expected to read out in 2021.","Now let me turn back to the topic of ongoing Phase 2 trials. Touching briefly on pegilodecakin, in addition to the Phase 3 pancreatic cancer results we now expect in 2019, the Phase 2 lung cancer trials, Cypress 1 and Cypress 2, are on track to complete later this year, and we expect data disclosures to come in 2020.","Moving to neuroscience. Zagotenemab is our anti-tau antibody currently in a placebo-controlled study of nearly 300 patients. This study uses a tau imaging agent to identify early symptomatic Alzheimer's patients whose disease has not progressed beyond the potentially treatable state. While Alzheimer's is a higher-risk area, we believe our molecule uniquely targets aggregated forms of tau, a key pathologic hallmark of the disease. And our trial design incorporates unique elements that will help us best learn a treatment with a tau antibody is a beneficial strategy for Alzheimer's disease. We look forward to seeing the data in 2021.","In addition, D1PAM is our positive allosteric modulator that targets the dopamine D1 receptor. We previously shared some encouraging Phase 1 data, and we're now studying this molecule in Phase 2 in the symptomatic treatment of Lewy body dementia, which includes patients with both dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson's disease dementia, focusing on improving attention and cognition. Based on enrollment, we expect data in early 2020. If we see a signal in the Phase 2 data, we're prepared to move quickly into symptomatic treatment of Lewy body dementia as well as Alzheimer's disease.","In immunology, we recently moved our anti-IL-33 antibody into Phase 2 development in patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis, an area of high unmet medical need. We're excited about the potential of this target and this molecule. This asset builds on our emerging immunology portfolio, and we anticipate seeing data in the first half of next year. Finally, I'd like to highlight two diabetes programs. First is our Basal Insulin-FC, which is a next-generation basal insulin. Basal Insulin-FC uses the same time extension technology that we used to create Trulicity, enabling convenient once-weekly dosing. This asset has the potential to be the first weekly basal insulin and could be an important new treatment option for people with diabetes. We're anticipating reporting top line data next year.","Second, we have ongoing efforts focused on improving the delivery of insulin and improving patient outcomes. We know that more than half of people on insulin today are not achieving their A1C treatment goals. The ongoing Phase 2 efforts of our automated insulin delivery system are the first step in an iterative process towards a closed loop system that we believe has the potential to significantly increase the number of patients achieving their A1C goals. Pending positive Phase 2 data will move into Phase 3 in 2020 with a potential launch in 2021. We look forward to tracking the progress of these assets over the coming years and will share additional pipeline updates on our next earnings call.","Now, I turn the call back over to Dave for some closing remarks.","Dave Ricks","Thanks, Dan. Before we go to Q&A, let me briefly sum up the progress we've made in the second quarter. We delivered volume growth of 6%, despite the continued erosion of Cialis due to generic competition and the withdrawal of Lartruvo, key growth products Liberty impressive volume growth of 15%, which now represents 43% of our revenue. We made strategic investments in commercial and late-stage pipeline products to reach more patients today, and improve the standard of care in the future. Meanwhile we continued to progress towards our margin goals as operating margin improved to 170 basis points versus Q1 2019.","We made progress with the pipeline this quarter, including three regulatory approvals, along with the exciting MONARCH 2 overall survival readout for Verzenio. In addition, we moved one asset into Phase 3 development, while also advancing multiple assets into the clinic. Looking ahead, we're excited about the data disclosure for our RET inhibitor at a major medical meeting and subsequent submission later this year.","We also returned over $600 million to shareholders via the dividend, and completed our $3.5 billion accelerated share repurchase program. Finally, last week, the Senate Finance Committee released details of its plan to address drug pricing and improve patient out of fund cost for patients. This is of course just the latest in a continuing discussion in Congress and the administration, and it won't be the last word we'll hear from the Senate on this subject. I know there may be a lot of questions about this particular package, so let me make a few points here in the hopes of allowing our Q&A to focus on the solid Q2 results we delivered and the strong prospects for Lilly's future.","First, I want to assure investors that the industry has and will continue to focus on shaping this to be, guided by our core principles of encouraging and protecting innovation, fairness and transparency in the pharma industry and all healthcare, and lowering costs at the pharmacy counter for patients who use our medicines. While the Senate Finance Committee package advance some of these ideas, it falls short on many others. We'll be working with all stakeholders over the coming weeks and months to try to better align legislative proposals to our core principles.","I know many of you have and will continue to work to size the impact of these proposals on the industry and on patient care. So let me make a few comments here to help. We're reserving a more detailed numeric answer for a later time when there's more clarity and more uncertainty. The three parts of this package I'll highlight are the Part D redesign, resetting the 100% relate cap in Medicaid and capping list price increases in Part B and D. Pharma has already put out a public statement on the policy concerns from a patient innovation perspective, so I'll just focus on the practical implications here and assess the likelihood and the impact to Lilly. This strategy just follows.","A Medicaid Part D redesign, which includes an out-of-pocket maximums beneficiaries seems, the most important and the most needed to be legislated in some form, and is a proposal, which would deliver savings to patients for use higher cost medicines with the addition of this out-of-pocket cap. Based on our current portfolio, we should have a neutral to positive impact on our diabetes portfolio, which currently is our primary exposure in the Part D benefit. But it would have a negative impact on our immunology and oncology business.","Removing the 100% rebate cap in Medicaid is the next most likely proposal in our view, as it was \u2013 it has also shown up in a draft house legislation as well. The current finance version basis in the new cap at 125% in late 2022, raising money for the government, but delivering no benefit to patients. In the near-term, this would represent a larger headwind for us in the general industry, primarily due to our insulin business. Medicaid represents a little more than 10% of the U.S. Humalog and Humulin volume, so a 25% increase rebate would represent a moderate negative impact on our insulin revenue.","Finally, capping list prices, it was price increases at the rate of CPI inflation in Medicare Part B and D will perhaps be the less likely to be enacted proposal that we've seen. Medicare Part D is a market-based structure, which has worked quite well, coming in under budget, while expanding access to innovation for millions of seniors. We're concerned about the price controls this represents. And mechanisms already exist to limit price increases in these segments and contracting in Part D and the ASP reporting system in Part B. While Lilly has already significantly moderated list price increases for our medicines, this policy if enacted we'd continue to encourage this kind of a moderation. Patient impact will be quite modest from this proposal, although accumulate through time as do the government savings.","Unfortunately, none of these proposals address the fundamental structure issue of the gross to net spreads, and this will remain a centerpiece of our advocacy over the coming months to remake the incentives for all actors and deliver substantial out-of-pocket savings to patients who use innovative medicines. I would note that as presented \u2013 presently constructed, these proposals would begin to take effect in 2021 and 2022, and currently would have no impact on our 2020 guidance.","Longer term, in any case, we will continue to focus on volume driven growth through innovation. Across our Company, Lilly employees remain energized and motivated to progress the pipeline to bring innovative medicines to millions more \u2013 million more patients who need solutions for different diseases. We are excited to execute our strategic priorities to deliver not only our 2019 and 2020 goals, but also to realize the long-term growth opportunity in front of us.","This concludes our prepared remarks. Now I'll turn the call over to Kevin to moderate the Q&A session.","Kevin Hern","Thanks, Dave. We'd like to take questions from as many callers as possible, so we ask that you limit your questions to two or to a single question with two parts. Cynthia, please provide the instructions for the Q&A session. And then we're ready for the first caller.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from the line of Umer Raffat with Evercore. Your line is open.","Umer Raffat","Hi. Thanks so much for taking my questions. First, I read the blog post with a lot of interest on Medicaid Max rebate caps. And my question is what's the dollar impact if that cap is raised to 125% and what's that dollar impact if there is no capital? I think this is one of those questions every investors is very curious about given the exposure here. So that's first. Secondly on R&D, I was curious on Cyprus 1 trial for ARMO which is due this fall. I understand it's an open-label trial, how would you set the investor expectations going into that readout knowing that IO-IO of late, has been very disappointing? Thank you very much.","Kevin Hern","Thanks, Umer. We'll have Dave take the first question and then Anne, your second.","Dave Ricks","Okay. I appreciate the question. Although I was hoping to head most of these off in my prepared remarks, Umer. As I said the \u2013 any version of a Medicaid M catalyst, we think is a regressive policy. It punishes companies by forcing us to underwrite state Medicaid, actually giving a rebate in excess of our list price. But policy issues aside, I think you're asking with the exposure of the Company.","As I said this almost exclusively impacts our insulin portfolio across the Lilly medicines. And we are in the low teens in terms of total volume for Medicaid as a percent of that \u2013 those businesses. So that would be the theoretical cap on the impact of those businesses. 25% of that is a smaller number related to insulin and insulin related to the total of the Company. So it's a concerning policy because of the nature of it. The absolute financial impact for the Company is capped in a way by the volume in Medicaid and the 25% with the phase-in is certainly a better version of a bad policy in any case, we advocate for leading to Medicaid MCAP at 100%.","Anne White","Pegilodecakin, so it's \u2013 Dan mentioned, we look forward to completing the studies and sharing that data at the beginning of Q1. We are particularly looking forward the results in Cyprus 1. So this is a patient population where we've added the Keytruda in high-expressers, so those are the PD-L1 over 50%. So positive data from those trials would trigger additional long trials, potentially registration trials. We do continue to believe that the greatest opportunity for pegilodecakin is in lung cancer in the first line setting and then also in later lines whether following or combination with other IO agents.","And then the other area of great interest is renal cell cancer. Both lung and renal had encouraging data in the Phase 1 study. So as Dan mentioned, we do see this as a rapidly evolving landscape and then working on our plans to optimize peg in that setting. And so look forward to starting those studies at the end of the year, as well as biomarker driven studies in lung cancer and other tumor types. So more to come and Cyprus and pegilodecakin.","Kevin Hern","Thanks Umer. Next caller, please, Cynthia?","Operator","That will come from the line of Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Terence Flynn","Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe first just would love some perspective on Trulicity growth in the second half given the dynamics you saw in the first half, there. And then can you help frame for us, the high dose data for Trulicity in the context of tirzepatide? And then my second question is on the LOXO-292. You mentioned you're going to have data presentation later this year. Just would love high level thoughts on kind of the durability and safety, tolerability, you're seeing to date. Thanks.","Kevin Hern","Thanks. So we'll go to Enrique for the first question, and then Anne on that 292.","Enrique Conterno","Very good. Well, we are pleased with the performance of Trulicity. We got sustained strong volume growth. We saw a 41% prescription growth in the United States when we look at the second quarter of 2019 relative to the second quarter of 2018.","As we look at that, our sales growth was below that. Clearly there was some price erosion. The bigger pieces of this price erosion were the high rebates that were somewhat offset by modest list price increases. And then about seven points was the incremental funding of the donut hole, going from 50% to 70%. Clearly, when we look at relative to Q1, we did see good continued sequential growth when we look at volume.","I think importantly, I think the fundamentals of the business are very strong, as we look at both class growth of about 30%, and when we look at their share performance. We do have, as you mentioned, significant catalyst with REWIND, and of course when it comes to the higher doses 3.0 milligrams and 4.5 milligrams for Trulicity. We are excited about the opportunities with both. When we think about tirzepatide, we sort of think of tirzepatide being in a completely different zip code when it comes to efficacy. That's why we utilize in the worse of resetting expectations of treatment for people with type 2 diabetes. When we look at both A1C and wait, so we continue to be very excited about that particular asset.","Anne White","And then with LOXO-292, thank you for that question. We will present as you said, an update on the registrational data in the second half of 2019 at one or more a medical meeting, and that's an advance the regulatory filing, which is on track for the U.S. by the end of the year. And we really do look forward to sharing that robust data set. It's now over 500 patients enrolled and it's rolled across tumor types with RET fusions or mutations. And we continue to be very excited about the profile as both a first and the best in class RET inhibitor.","So LOXO-292 is highly potent and we've seen robust response rates and exciting emerging durability as well. And also a safety profile that doesn't carry the burden of cytopenia that can require costly supportive care interventions. So again enrolments continue to be strong. The LOXO team is continuing to do a fantastic job in this program. And so we're very much looking forward to sharing that data at upcoming meetings.","Kevin Hern","Thanks, Anne. Thank you, Terence. And next caller, please?","Operator","That will be from the line of Andrew Baum with Citi. Your line is open.","Andrew Baum","Thank you. First question, could you break down for us the initial versus subsequent lines of CDK 4\/6 therapy for the entire market, and give us some idea whether you can use the MONARCH 2 data to cure formally status on that this commercial and Medicare plan for 2020?","And then second, if we take the inflation cap is something that will happen with the Medicare Part D. Is it possible that could relate concerns about rising insurance premiums to allow rebate reform to research as part of the proposal? Thank you.","Kevin Hern","Thanks. We'll go to Anne for the initial question and then Dave for the inflation cap question.","Anne White","Well, thank you, Andrew. And you asked a really good question and thought about this carefully. So in a trial like this, the reason it's so difficult to show a survival advantage is because of patients crossing over. And the fact that we were able to demonstrate significance at a pre-planned interim confirms the strength of Verzenio, and we do believe differentiates our product. We do expect increased growth across all lines of therapy based on these results.","And importantly, we will certainly share this data with those making access and treatment decisions. As we've heard overall survivals, the most important outcome and most objective outcome as well, so this really verifies the importance of Verzenio to achieve that best outcome for patients. And we've heard repeatedly from patients that overall survival is the most meaningful one for both patients and the physicians who are treating them. And this is an incredibly devastating disease and women who are living with this disease want to do everything they can to be with their families as long as possible. So we're really glad to have delivered this result for women with metastatic breast cancer.","Dave Ricks","Thank you. Thanks for your question, Andrew. And I think you \u2013 I didn't quite make it up. I think you're talking about the Part D CPI cap as it relates to the impact on the rebate reform score. Look I \u2013 the Senate finance package, which is sort of the leading integrated package we've seen generates a huge amount of savings to the government, most of which does not go back to the patients. This is our primary issue with it. Even the reform within Part D that is on the table, the AF proposal pretty much pays for itself, maybe generates a little bit of surplus action, really.","So the question we're posing to policymakers is how do we reinvest that? For yes, premium stability, premiums are already extremely low in Part D and have been stable for years, but more importantly, directly leave at the pharmacy counter more relieved than this package delivers with the various proposals. One of those is as you indicate is to go back to the idea of passing through some or all of negotiated discounts with seniors and indexing their co-payments, their deductible to net pricing not list. I think pretty much everyone is closely as you think this is a good idea, as you point out the issue has been the score.","Now, if we can find into Part D and make it in connection with the rest of the Finance Committee package, I think there is a huge potential to achieve all those goals. One could also look at phases, phasing it in or even partial rebate pass through stepping up through time. So all these ideas are \u2013 ideas we've had as pharma that we're actively pushing on. And maybe the main thing about all this is, although this package, got a lot of ink, we're far from the finish line here and there'll be a lot of discussion, probably with policies we really don't like and some we like better like the one you're suggesting. And we'll do our best to try to shape this into something workable that addresses the fundamental issue, which is out-of-pocket costs for people who use innovative medicines.","Kevin Hern","Thank you. Andrew, thanks for the question. Cynthia, next caller, please?","Operator","That will be from the line of Steve Scala with Cowen. Your line is open.","Steve Scala","Thank you. I have a couple. First on tanezumab, how would you describe your level of confidence that the 2.5 milligram can be approved in OA, why are you no longer a filing in chronic lower back pain and where does cancer pain stand? So that's the first question. And then secondly, AbbVie's IL-23 SKYRIZI seems to be off to a great start, and AbbVie specifically said they were taking share from IL-17. So just curious what you're seeing. Thank you.","Kevin Hern","Thanks, Steve. Dan will have you take the tanezumab question, and Josh, if you can handle SKYRIZI.","Dan Skovronsky","Yes. Thanks Steve for the question on the various tanezumab indications. In a sense, you're right, in the order that you put them in, which is that we sort of prioritize based on the data that we have and the overall benefit risk in each of those populations. So based on that as well as the unmet medical need in osteoarthritis, we've prioritized moving that forward with the regulators.","Overall, we wouldn't be proceeding with regulatory submissions and announcing that we're proceeding unless we had confidence in the overall benefit risk that this medicine provides in that population. That's based on the trials that we have recently disclosed. It's also based on the totality of the evidence and that's a decision that we've come to together with our partners.","At Pfizer, the chronic lower back pain we've decided not to pursue at this time for almost exactly the same reasons, given the unmet medical need in that population and the benefit risk in that population. Cancer pain is the third here in line and we don't have that trial. It's taking a bit of time to read out and so it's hard to comment on what the benefits could be there given that we don't have that data yet.","Josh Smiley","Okay. On SKYRIZI, it's Josh. The launch is really in line with what we expected it to be. It's a good launch, if you look at it relative to Taltz and time normalize Taltz is a little bit better in terms of prescription trends. But in terms of what we see in the market place right now Steve first, we saw really \u2013 we're pleased with Taltz's performance in the U.S. In Q2 we saw TRx volume growth of 61%, and really we see share growth. Really as we look at SKYRIZI, we see \u2013 it looks like share coming primarily from the store, in the IL-20 \u2013 IL12\/23 class, maybe some from Cosentyx.","But our growth continues and we feel good about the share performance that we're seeing. Of course for later this year, we're looking forward to releasing data on our head-to-head trial against Tremfya and I think that will be an important competitive positioning for us.","So we \u2013 overall, the biggest thing that we need to see is continued growth in the class. I think still majority of prescriptions are happening in the TNF class. So I think anything on the \u2013 both of IL-17 and IL-23 classes are able to shift to the better more modern treatments is good for patients and it will be good for us.","Steve Scala","Thank you.","Kevin Hern","Thanks, Josh. Thanks, Steve. Next caller, please?","Operator","Go to the line of David Risinger with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","David Risinger","Yes. Thanks very much. So I have two questions, please. First, Dave, you had mentioned that out-of-pocket costs for people who use innovative medicines are a challenge. But could you talk about what the industry is doing if anything with respect to such costs outside of Part B because the government's actions will likely only applied a Part D, that's where the government can affect drugs. And the industry has a major public relations problem with the majority of the population that is outside of Medicare Part D that struggle with out-of-pocket costs. So is the industry doing anything i.e. with the Chamber of Commerce or with major employer groups to try to change the dynamic of the out-of-pocket cost challenge?","And one final thing I'll just make a statement which is that it does seem that the industry has not been able to overcome the unfair treatment of drug coverage, i.e. the fact that people pay too much out-of-pocket relative to the out-of-pocket costs for other healthcare utilization such as physician visits, hospital visits, et cetera. So anyway, sorry for the long diatribe but I did want to understand the industry's agenda outside of government reimbursement.","And then second, could you just talk about Lilly's evaluation of oral GLP-1s as a potential pipeline product opportunity? Thank you.","Kevin Hern","Thanks. Dave will have a \u2013 Dave will take your first question, and then Dan will talk about glutathione oral pipeline.","Dave Ricks","Yes. Thanks, Dave for the question, a lot in there. But I think in general we agree that \u2013 I mean, we need to improve the rhetoric in the \u2013 around the industry, we're working hard to do that. But mostly we need to improve the experience of patients at the pharmacy counter. You correctly point out that a lot of the discussions about government programs, but for Lilly's business more than half our business in U.S. is commercially reimbursed in whatever we are doing there. That is an area of increasing focus for us. And I think there is probably four things that I would point to that we're both doing in ramping up.","The first is how we design and implement our own healthcare coverage. As a healthcare company, I think we can begin to shape the market by our own purchasing behavior. And I think we have \u2013 with that we are going through it here, one of the most progressive policies for our own employees as it relates to drug cover, including first dollar drug coverage on products like insulin and the way the deductible gets funded et cetera. And these are all physicians having years of experience, doing it, we're in a position to recommend to our peer companies as well as to insurance providers as best practice.","As you know, probably that \u2013 recently there was an IRS ruling that is quite important maybe subtle thing that allows for the first time clarity around the question of whether medicines can be classified as a preventative treatment under HRA \u2013 HSA designs and high deductible plans. And the answer from the ARS is yes, they can. So we will use that as I think, a new point to help those that are purchasing insurance products in the commercial market so they can design plans that a first dollar coverage zero-out-of pocket for important essential medicines, in particular in diabetes for us, but also other categories as well that affect millions of people.","Thirdly, a value-based pricing is something Lilly is taking a leading position on. Although it's been stubborn in government segments we're making enormous strides in commercial markets. And this \u2013 well, it doesn't directly translate to the issue out-of-pocket costs at the pharmacy counter, I think it does allow us to both demonstrate the value of our medicines and share the risk and benefit of those medicines with self-insured employers. We're having a lot of success with this and I think it does begin to shift the discussion pretty dramatically around medicines as a cost versus medicines as a solution and that's important.","Finally, there are state-based efforts that are seeking to regulate the commercial marketplace. I think you'll see pharma and Lilly increasingly active in those debates, Colorado being one of them that's out there. And as the playing field shifts from a federal debate during an election year where \u2013 let's be honest very little will probably happen, the states maybe a center for action in 2020, and we'll be ready to engage and advocate for policies that help patients with the innovative medicines there.","So a lot in my answer, but I think you pointed out, a good thing here which is commercial market matters for a lot of companies including Lilly, and we need to address those inefficiencies as well.","Kevin Hern","Thanks, Dave. Dan?","Dan Skovronsky","Great. Thanks for your question on oral incretins. It's obviously an area of interest for us. And maybe speak generally about our strategy here, which is that we want to be able to offer oral incretin therapy that meets sort of one of two criteria. First, it could have a significantly improved bioavailability versus what's currently under development. And that's important because that will translate to more convenient experience for patients, more convenient dosing with more reliable efficacy.","The other option is to offer greater efficacy in an oral product than the currently available once weekly GLP-1s. So we're pursuing those two tactics with different approaches. So to get something that's very highly bioavailability you need to move to small molecules. And so here we have a program, which is characterized by molecule just moved into Phase 1 this quarter, we call the GLP-1 NPA or non-peptide agonist, which is the product that was invented by Chugai, and we partnered with them on that. So we're excited to see Phase 1 data from that. We'll quickly learn what kind of bioavailability we get, and that will determine how we pursue that project.","The other avenue to get better efficacy than currently available injectables really relies on next generation incretins. So these are by specific molecules like our tirzepatide GIP\/GLP where we are seeking to get the peptide to become orally bio-available. And we have a number of purchase to accomplish that and look forward to moving those programs into the clinic soon.","Kevin Hern","Thanks, Dan. And thank you, Dave. Next caller, please?","Operator","We will go to the line of Seamus Fernandez with Guggenheim. Your line is open.","Seamus Fernandez","Thanks very much. So just two very quick questions, first on Verzenio and HER2-positive disease. Can you just give us a quick sense of Lilly's definition of a clinically meaningful if the data registrational? And then just maybe give us an estimated market size or path to thinking about the market size? And then separately, on Taltz, gross to net, can you just give us the gross to net currently? And given the Company's need to reposition the product for growth in RA, should we anticipate further price concessions in the next formulary negotiation cycle? Thanks a lot.","Kevin Hern","Thanks, Seamus. Anne will review for the Verzenio question and then Josh will take the Taltz question.","Anne White","Yes, Seamus, thanks for that question on the HER2-positive data. And as Dan mentioned in his opening remarks, we're extremely pleased to have a positive result in that study. And so as you mentioned, this is the first randomized controlled study to have positive results in HER2-positive breast cancer. And this has been a very difficult-to-treat population. And so finding opportunities for them to avoid chemotherapy has certainly been the goal of this study.","And so we do believe that the positive result and the meeting of the primary endpoint of PFS are clinically meaningful. And while I can't show the specifics of the data and we'll be presenting that at a scientific meeting later this year, we do believe that it's clinically relevant for patients, particularly those that want to avoid chemotherapy in this setting.","We do \u2013 the next step really is to discuss this data. And that's our plan, to discuss this data with regulators as we share at the scientific meetings. So I can't comment any further at this time on regulatory strategy.","On the market size, so as you probably know, this is about 15% to 20% of breast cancer. So this is not an insubstantative market. So we do believe this is a significant opportunity as we go forward for these patients who have that particularly hard-to-treat type of breast cancer. So again, together with the overall survival data and the robust result that we had in the China registration study, I think all three just reinforce the strength that Verzenio brings. And again, the only CDK 4\/6 that has continuous dosing, the only one with a monotherapy indication, and it's continued to help patients, particularly those with a poor diagnosis. So I think we're very pleased to share these updates on Verzenio today.","Josh Smiley","And Seamus, on Taltz and price and gross to net, really in the second quarter, neither of those were major factors in terms of U.S. growth. Our price and gross-to-net rates have remained pretty steady. As we mentioned in Q1, about two-thirds of Taltz prescriptions right now in the U.S. are reimbursed, and that really didn't change in Q2. We're pleased with the share performance in psoriasis. I think as you mentioned in the room space, we're looking forward to indications in AxSpA, which we think will make us more competitive and open up significant growth opportunity there.","And we're focused on access, and we would like to see that improve. But really, in terms of price and availability today, not significant changes in the first half of this year.","Dave Ricks","And maybe just to comment to add to that, PsA is the indication, not RA. I think we see \u2013 the way we see this is these additional indications actually will enhance our leverage in payer access discussions, not erode it. So actually, I think it works the opposite way from the way your question was phrased. The more volume we can build on PsA, the more indications like AxSpa we get, the more unique the product is and the more leverage we gain. So I think we're optimistic about both the growth of the product but also the pricing power in this market.","Kevin Hern","Seamus, thanks for your questions and next caller please.","Operator","We will go to the line of Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Chris Schott","Alright, great. Thanks very much for the questions. First one is, there seems to be lingering investor concerns about Trulicity and GLP-1 pricing as we look out to 2020 and beyond with the launch of oral sema. Can we maybe just get your latest thoughts in terms of how you see payers reacting to new entrants in the market? And should we be anticipating a more challenging pricing environment for Trulicity going forward? So that's the first question.","Second question was on tax. I think you mentioned some discrete items and a lower tax rate this year. Just any thoughts about how we should think about normalized tax rate for Lilly as we look beyond 2019? Thanks very much.","Kevin Hern","Thank you, so Enrique and Josh for the tax question.","Enrique Conterno","Appreciate the question. I know we get this question often on Trulicity and the outlook of price. And I'm unable to provide that, but I think it's important to think about the value that Trulicity is delivering today and the incremental value that we can deliver as we think about REWIND, as we can think about the higher doses that Trulicity will be launching because all of that is basically additional value that the product will be providing.","We think we have a strong foundation with the performance of the product. I'm not going to speculate on how Novo would price the product and what the potential responses from payers, maybe.","Josh Smiley","I think on tax rate, our prior guidance for this year on a non-GAAP basis was between 14% and 15% as we reduced that by a point, given the discrete tax benefits that we saw in the second quarter. I think from a long-term perspective, that 14% to 15% range is reasonable. One of the things \u2013 the swing factor here is the calculation around guilty and depending on where and how our income flows that again can move that a little bit. But we're comfortable in the sort of low-to-mid teens as a sustainable rate given the tax structure that we have today in the U.S.","So as long as that's maintained, we think we can maintain at somewhere in that range with again \u2013 on any given year depending on where we're launching, how sales are moving, we could see a 100 basis point swing one way or another.","Kevin Hern","Thanks Josh. Chris, thanks for your questions. Next caller, please?","Operator","We will go to the line of Tim Anderson from Wolfe Research. Your line is open.","Tim Anderson","Thank you. On Trulicity, where is the Lilly Diabetes team expect that Novo's oral semaglutide source of business will come from in terms of drug classes? And when that product launches, do you think that will lead to a slowdown in the scripts for Trulicity that will be palpable by investors, or is the class growth high enough such that Trulicity may not really budge at all?","And then second question again on reform, sorry, Dave. I was surprised to learn from someone who is well-informed in this area that AARP was a key stakeholder in killing the proposed rebate reform because of their alignment with the drug industry where they supposed to get something like half of their funding. My question is, whether you think rebate reform still be brought back on to the table or is that permanently off the table?","Kevin Hern","Okay, thanks. So Enrique for Trulicity and then Dave for the policy question.","Enrique Conterno","Yes. It's \u2013 honestly it's very difficult to speculate given that we need to see when we think our source of business, we will need to see basically how Novo will price the product, what type of placement, what is the message and so forth and so on. I think what we see, though, I think just generally when we think about diabetes is that, patients do tend to go to an oral first, right as we think about orals.","So right now I think the product that we basically have, that we are commercializing is Jardiance, which has an incredible evidence and incredible benefit. My sense is depending on how product positions, how they price this product, and that's going to be a pretty big barrier for them to overcome. I think we're extremely well positioned with the product. We're investing well behind it and we have a great partner on Boehringer Ingelheim to make that extremely successful.","Kevin Hern","Dave?","Dave Ricks","Yes. Okay. Thanks for the question, Tim. I think I guess we can declare the experiment of heading off questions in advance in prepared remarks that we missed our primary endpoint. Anyway, I think it\u2019s true, AARP was a strong opponent of rebate reform. We can all speculate why, but it's also true that the majority of their revenue, I think more than half comes from royalties from the Part D program. So easy to get cynical when you spent time in Washington.","That said, we still think it's a good idea. Is it possible to come back? Well, probably in some other form. I think the broad-based pulling of the Anti-Kickback Statute gets harder because of the way the scoring happen and the politics around it. But as it mentioned by Dave Risinger earlier or perhaps it was Andrew, that inside of a Part D benefit redesign, the idea of patients linking out-of-pocket costs to something other than list price is a good idea. And there is a sliding scale, we don't have to go all the way. That could change the scoring and make it more affordable and create a model for insurance design in the commercial market and other segments.","So we're far from giving up on this idea. And as you know, given a retail portfolio like Lilly's, with big gross to net spreads, over 50% on average across our portfolio, this is a single quickest and most efficacious way to save patients' money at the point of sale, and restructure the incentives of the payers to work on behalf of patients directly versus work on behalf of all beneficiaries, including non-patients, which is kind of how it's set up today. So we got a long way to go in this debate and this is an idea we have might go.","Kevin Hern","Thanks , Dave. Tim, thanks for your questions. Next caller, please.","Operator","We will go to the line of Louise Chen with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open.","Louise Chen","Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. So my first question is on tirzepatide. I wanted to ask you what you think or what level of GI side effects is considered acceptable by physicians? And then on your NASH and obesity product, how do you plan to differentiate your product from others in development, are those that are failed?","And then my second question is on the CGRPs, the potential entry of these oral CGRPs. And do you think the prophylactic ones would interfere with the growth of the injectable CGRPs and then what about the acute CGRPs if there is any overlap there with your products? Thank you.","Kevin Hern","Thanks. We'll go to Enrique for the question on tirzepatide and then Dan, if you want to talk about the CGRPs.","Enrique Conterno","I think, we already have an excellent in-market experiment here because we've seen the success of GLP-1, so we know that with the level of side effects of the GLP-1 class, we can have significant success. We do believe that we are not going to be trading off. In the case of tirzepatide, we will get the additional efficacy and we believe that we will have a comparable side effect profile to the GLP-1 class.","When it comes to NASH and obesity, honestly we are bidding to be best-in-class product. We're not bidding to be first-in-class or we are thinking that we are going to reset the expectations of what's possible in both obesity and NASH with tirzepatide.","Kevin Hern","Thanks, Enrique. Dan?","Dan Skovronsky","Great. Thanks for your question on the CGRP market and the potential impact of oral CGRPs coming to market. Of course, as you know and pointed out the injectable CGRPs like our Emgality are approved and marketed for prevention for prophylaxis of migraine, whereas the initial indication for the oral CGRPs is likely to be in the acute treatment or a broader use of migraine.","I think there is a couple of questions about the oral CGRPs that are still outstanding, and probably first I would go to safety. One of the great things I think about the drugs like Emgality is the great safety data that we've been able to generate here. Remember, this is a relatively young and otherwise healthy population with somewhat chronic disease and so safety has got to be a key factor in choosing a medication in this population. There are questions about the safety of the oral class and we'll just have to see how that ends up with regulators.","I think there is also a bit of a mechanistic question here which there's just not data to address yet. So the question though is, if you've got chronic blockade of CGRP because patients on a preventive antibody already, and we know we pretty much maxed out on the dose response curve here. The question is whether adding an additional oral agent will have any effect if it will even work as and part of and people are already on chronic treatment. So for that reason, we've looked for other mechanisms for migraine and part of that won't clash with CGRP antibodies, but rather are likely to be complementary.","So we're excited about the potential that we can offer with lasmiditan and that's currently under FDA review. And I think will be an important new treatment in the broader space coming soon.","Kevin Hern","Thanks, Dan. Louise, thanks for your questions. Next caller, please.","Operator","We will go to the line of Jason Gerberry with Bank of America. Your line is open.","Jason Gerberry","Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just two questions from me. First on tirzepatide, just thinking about, absent the reporting of Phase 3 data, do you think we'll learn anything in the next 12 to 18 months as it pertains to the diarrhea side effect, and whether it's a GIP-driven side effect? And then my second question just on the Olumiant detailed Phase 3 BREEZE data in atopic dermatitis, the IGA scores relative to dupilumab were a bit lower, so just sort of curious, based on the data we have so far in hand, how do you think Olumiant could be positioned in the atopic dermatitis market? Thanks.","Kevin Hern","Okay. Thanks. Enrique for tirzepatide, and then we'll go to Dan for the Olumiant question.","Enrique Conterno","Yes. My sense is I'm sure that we are going to be waiting for the Phase 3 trial so what we see basically on some of the Phase 3 trials for us to understand this dose titration actually delivers when it comes to tolerability. And as we mentioned, we feel very comfortable given the modeling, given the studies that we've done that we are going to have a product that has unsurpassed efficacy resetting expectations for A1c and weight loss, and at the same time a product that is tolerable and comparable to GLP-1s.","Kevin Hern","Thanks, Enrique. Dan?","Dan Skovronsky","Yes. Thanks for the question on Olumiant for atopic derm. Just specifically comparing it to dupilumab, I\u2019d just point out, obviously that it's tough to compare in this case, an oral medication with injectable biologic for atopic derm. I think Olumiant has some advantages in the repetidy of action and patients may like that. But really I think the important comparison here is versus other orals for atopic derm and there are none yet.","So, we have the potential to be the first oral for atopic derm and I think that's encouraging. We've got more data to come here and we'll see how that comes out.","Kevin Hern","Thanks, Dan. Jason, thanks for your questions. Next caller, please.","Operator","We'll go to the line of Navin Jacob with UBS. Your line is open.","Navin Jacob","Hi, Thanks for taking my question. Just on Taltz, wondering if you could give any color on the underlying volume growth of the overall psoriasis market and psoriatic arthritis market? AbbVie is planning to double-digit underlying market growth in terms of dynamic that perhaps some of us are missing, I am just wondering if you're seeing that level of growth. And then with regards to your SG&A line, you came in a little bit higher than expectations raised your guidance for the year. Over the next couple of years I know you're launching a bunch of products, wondering how you're thinking about that line, how we should be thinking about it?","And then finally with regards to capital allocation, we've seen several companies in this space do large deals and\/or just yesterday, a large spin-off, any color on how you're thinking about your business whether there is any potential for restructuring that we may not be necessarily thinking about and your continued interest in bolt-on M&A deals? Thank you very much.","Kevin Hern","Okay, thanks. So we'll go to Josh for the Taltz and SG&A questions and Dave talking about the capital allocation structuring.","Josh Smiley","Okay, great. So first on the overall derm market, we're seeing low double-digit growth in total across the class, the IL-17s are of course growing faster than that and I think we'd expect to continue to see with the launch of SKYRIZI, the IL-23s grow. And again I think that's what's probably most important is moving, as I mentioned earlier, moving patients from TNFs to the modern IL-17s and IL-23s. So we're looking forward to the data that we will generate later this year on our head-to-head versus on Tremfya. And again we're focused on Taltz in psoriasis is on 100% clearance and acting fast and being durable. So we're looking forward to continued growth in that market.","As we move to SG&A, our guidance for the second half of the year really implies a pretty flat, absolute level of SG&A with the first half of this year. We're comfortable with that. As you look with our new product launches, we've got a lot of variable SG&A expense. We do a lot of direct-to-consumer advertising in the U.S., both television as well as digital. So we've got a good handle on how we pulse that investment and we've clearly in the second half of last year, as our new launches we're scaling, we're putting a lot of money behind them.","We've continued that the first half of this year, but in an absolute basis, we feel comfortable with sort of flat to moderate growth in SG&A as we look out over the course of the next few years. We think we're well invested behind our new launch products and mostly we'll see a mix of tactics, but a pretty good absolute envelope where we are now. And again that reinforces as I talked in the prepared remarks, so we look at operating margin for 2020 with the kind of sales growth that we'd expect headed into 2020. We do expect to see good operating leverage there and are very confident with our 31% operating margin target for 2020.","Kevin Hern","Thank you, Josh. Dave?","Dave Ricks","Yes. I mean on capital allocation nothing changes for us. I think we've said for quite some time, we don't believe in large scale merger activity generates value for shareholders. We still don't believe that. In terms of spin-outs yesterday's news, we don't have such an entity to spin out. We had one in animal health and we executed that transaction. I guess of the thinking being similar in that we think human innovative pharmaceuticals is the business to be. And then it's what we do well and where we can generate a lot of value for all stakeholders, patients, society and shareholders if we execute.","So our focus in terms of capital allocation is really on funding organic R&D, and then looking outside for opportunities, bolt-on\u2019s mostly that would fall within the pipeline, building type exercise where we can add value where it fits within our therapeutic focus, and where we see value for shareholders and patients. So that\u2019s what we've been focused on for some time. We had the Centrexion deal announced this quarter, Loxo in Q1, those types of things are what we're interested in and where our focus lies.","And I don't see there's a change from even the past 10 years. So we'll continue on that path.","Kevin Hern","Thanks Dave. Navin, thanks for your questions. This ends the Q&A portion. I'll turn it over to Dave for the close.","Dave Ricks","Great. Thank you. We appreciate your participation in our call today and your interest in Eli Lilly and Company.

With a pipeline full of exciting opportunities and a diversified volume driven growth in the market, Lilly continues to be a compelling investment.","Thanks for dialing-in.

Q3 earnings call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a questions-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. Phil Johnson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Phil Johnson","Good morning. Thank you for joining us for Eli Lilly & Company's third quarter 2013 earnings conference call. I am Phil Johnson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Joining me today are Derica Rice, our Chief Financial Officer, Dr. Jan Lundberg, our President of Lilly Research Laboratories and Ilissa Rassner and Travis Coy from the Investor Relations team.","During this conference call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors, including those listed on slide three and those outlined in our latest forms 10-K and 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It is not intended to be promotional and is not sufficient for prescribing decisions.","Q3 marked another quarter of strong operational execution, both in terms of financial results and pipeline advancements. Solid topline revenue growth and expense controls produced a 41% increase in non-GAAP earnings per share. And in the last eight months, we have completed eight U.S., European and Japanese regulatory submission for four potential new medicines. Empagliflozinm, our insulin glargine product in collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim, dulaglutide and ramucirumab.","In the coming quarters, our financial results will reflect the U.S. patent expirations for Cymbalta and Evista. We are ready for this challenging financial period and remain well positioned to invest in R&D, recapitalize our asset base and gauge an optimistic business development and return substantial cash to shareholders by paying our dividend at least at this current level in 2014 and beyond and by repurchasing shares under our recently authorized $5 billion program.","In 2014, we will also see more Phase 3 data readouts and could have additional regulatory submissions as well as multiple product launches. This is an exciting time and we remain focused on continued execution of our innovation based strategy to bring value patients, physicians payers and shareholders.","Before covering our financial results, let's review events that have taken place since our last earnings call. We had a number of clinical data readouts, including positive readouts for SQUIRE, a Phase 3 study investigating necitumumab as first-line treatment for squamous non-small cell lung cancer and for RAINBOW, a Phase 3 study of ramucirumab as combination therapy in patients with advanced gastric cancer. In both studies, we saw increased overall survival.","Also for ramucirumab, the Phase 3 RA study in first-line breast cancer failed to meet its primary endpoint of increased progression free survival. We also made substantial progress on the regulatory front as we completed the rolling DLA submission in the U.S. for ramucirumab as a single agent for advanced gastric cancer and completed the E.U. submission for the same indication.","As you saw this morning, we are pleased with the FDA granted Priority Review designation. We also submitted dulaglutide for Type II diabetes in both, the U.S. and Europe and along with Boehringer Ingelheim, submitted empagliflozin for Type II diabetes in Japan.","Disappointingly, we received the final decision for the centers for Medicare and Medicaid services that provide coverage with evidence development for the use of beta-amyloid Positron Emission tomography imaging agents, including our approved product Amyvid.","We believe this decision is a significant setback for patients and for the Alzheimer's disease community. Finally, Lilly's board of directors authorized a new 5 billion share repurchase program, which the company intends to complete over a multi-year period.","(Audit Start 4:15)Now let's turn to discuss our financial performance. First, I will provide comments about our GAAP results and then Travis will discuss a few non-GAAP measures, which we believe provide insights into the underlying trends in our business.","Turning to Slide 6, you will see that just as it did in Q2, worldwide revenue increased 6% driven by growth in key products, including Cymbalta, Alimta, Cialis, Tradjenta, Humalog, Strattera, Humulin, and Animal Health.","Gross margin as a percent of revenue was 79.2%, an increase of 130 basis points over Q3, last year. The increase in gross margin percent was driven by higher prices and lower manufacturing costs partially offset by a smaller benefit from the effect of foreign exchange on international inventories sold.","Total GAAP operating expense, the sum of R&D, SG&A and other special charges, decreased 4%. This decrease was driven by a 6% decline in SG&A expenses and by a $53 million asset impairment charge in last year's quarter with no similar charges this quarter. The decline in SG&A expense was driven by ongoing cost containment efforts, including the previously announced changes to our U.S. sales and marketing activities related to the upcoming loss of exclusivity for Cymbalta and Evista.","R&D expense increased 3% this quarter, driven by higher early-stage research expenses. The growth in revenue, increase in gross margin percent, and decrease in total operating expense combined to produce a 42% increase in operating income.","You may recall that in Q3 last year, we recognized $788 million of income related to early payment of Amylin's financial obligations related to exenatide. We had no such income this year, and other income and deductions with a net deduction of $31 million in the quarter.","Our GAAP tax rate decreased by 8.7 percentage points due to the taxes payable in the third quarter of 2012 on the payment received from Amylin, and to a lesser extent the reinstatement of R&D tax credit in the U.S. effective January 1, 2013.","As a result, our Q3 GAAP net income declined 9%, while the decline in GAAP earnings per share was slightly less at 6%, reflecting the benefit of our share repurchases late last year and early this year. Travis?","Travis Coy","Thanks, Phil. Let's move on to non-GAAP measures provided on Slide 7. This quarter, there were no reconciling items, so our GAAP and non-GAAP results are the same. Last year, however, we did have the two items Phil mentioned earlier that were excluded from our non-GAAP results; $788 million of income related to exenatide and a $53 million asset impairment charge. Also our non-GAAP tax rate decreased 1.6 percentage points due primarily to the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit. As a result, our non-GAAP net income and EPS growth were substantially higher than the corresponding GAAP numbers at 35% and 41% respectively.","Slide eight provides the same information on a year-to-date basis, while slide nine provides a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS. Additional details about our reported earnings are available in today's earnings press release.","As you can see on slide 10, total revenue increased 6% in Q3, driven by a favorable price impact of 5% and a 3% increase in volume, partially offset by a negative foreign exchange impact of 2%. U.S. pharma revenue increased 11%, driven by price as volume was essentially flat. In Australia, Canada and Europe, or ACE, revenue grew 5% driven by volume increases across multiple products, including Alimta, Cialis, Cymbalta, Forteo and Humalog. The positive effect of FX offset the negative price effect.","Once again, Japan revenue was significantly impacted by the weakening of the yen. For the quarter, FX reduced our Japan revenue by 21%. On a constant currency basis, Japan revenue grew 9% with an 11% increase in volume, partially offset by a 2% price decline. Volume growth was primarily driven by Forteo, Strattera, Tradjenta, and Evista. As for emerging markets, which is no longer embedded in rest of the world, revenue declined 1% this quarter with FX contributing negative 4%, price negative 2% and volume a positive 5% led by Alimta, Cialis, Forteo, Humalog, and Tradjenta. Within emerging markets, revenue growth in China moderated, but continued at a double-digit pace up 11% driven by 10% volume growth. Elanco Animal Health grew 11% this quarter, also driven by volume including a benefit from the U.S. withdrawal of a competitor's food animal product. Both U.S. and o U.S. animal health grew 11% supported by food animal growth of 10% and companion animal growth of 13%.","Slide 11 shows the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates on our 2013 results. For both Q3 and year-to-date, FX has had a modest negative effect on revenue growth. In terms of cost of goods sold, this year we have seen a smaller benefit from the FX effect on international inventories sold. As a result, foreign exchange has had a substantial effect on growth in operating income and earnings per share.","Next, I will provide a brief pipeline update before turning the call over to Derica. Slide 12 shows our pipeline as of October 16. Changes since our last earnings call are highlighted with green arrows showing progression and red arrows showing attrition. As Phil mentioned earlier, we recently submitted dulaglutide and ramucirumab in both the U.S. and EU. In addition, we formally terminated development of our Phase II base inhibitor. In phase I, three molecules began testing and three others were terminated.","Now I will turn the call over to Derica to cover some of the remaining key events for 2013, our financial guidance and some closing comments before we open the call for Q&A. Derica?","Derica Rice","Thanks, Travis. Today, I will began my remarks with slide 13, a slide we have used for the last three years to help you chart our progress, primarily on our number one priority, which has been advancing our pipeline. As you can see, there many more green checkmarks than red, and we are pleased with the progress that we have made this year. Starting mid-last year, we entered an intense period of Phase III data readouts that extends into 2014. So far, we have seen positive Phase III results for five assets, ramucirumab, necitumumab, dulaglutide and empagliflozin, and our insulin glargine product. And we\u2019ve completed regulatory submissions for four of these assets, with the fifth necitumumab slated for 2014.","Before the end of the year, we have internal data readouts on a number of Phase III trials for edivoxetine as well that initial Phase III data for our novel basal insulin with a topline press release for edivoxetine likely between late this year and early next year and for our novel basal insulin later in 2014.","In August, we had the District Court hearing in the Alimta method-of-use patent litigation. We are pleased with the arguments that were presented and anticipate a ruling to be handed down in the first half of next year. Finally, later this quarter on December 11 to be exact, we will lose the U.S. Patent protection for Cymbalta. We are proud of the benefit this product has brought to patients, and we are prepared to successfully traverse the financial challenge posed by its patent expiration.","Now, as we discussed in the past, due to the patent expiration in the fourth quarter, we expect to see a reduction in wholesaler purchases, and we will take a substantial reserve for the expected future product return. I will provide a bit more color on this in just a moment.","Now let's turn to our updated 2013 financial guidance. As you can see on Slide 14, most of our line item guidance remains unchanged. We have revised two line items. First, we have raised the bottom end of our EPS guidance by $0.05. This brings our full year non-GAAP EPS guidance range to $4.10 to $4.15 per share. Second, we are now forecasting capital expenditures to be approximately $1 billion.","Now some of you have already commented this morning on the fact that we did not raise the top end of our full year EPS guidance range despite beating Q3 EPS consensus by $0.07, and you\u2019ve correctly observed that. To make the math work, this means that consensus EPS for Q4 needs to come down by roughly $0.07. It appears that the difference between our expectations compared to the Street for the split of EPS across Q3 and Q4 [falls] (ph) down to the expected sales erosion for U.S. Cymbalta.(Audit End)","Let's dig into this a little bit deeper. U.S. Cymbalta sales by quarter, this year have been $1.1 billion, $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion for the first three quarters of this year. For Q4, the street average is just under $800 million, which represents two full months of sales at the recent run rate.","Our expectation is that U.S. Cymbalta sales will come in well below current consensus. First, we expect minimal wholesaler repurchases after the patent expires on December 11. Second, we expect minimal wholesaler purchases in the first two to three weeks leading up to the patent expiration as wholesalers work down their existing inventories to post-patent expirations levels.","As we have called out in the past, in Q4 we will also take a substantial reserve for expected future returns and we said this reserve will on the hundreds of millions of dollars. As a result, we anticipate that U.S. Cymbalta sales in Q4 will be closer to $500 million or half our recent quarterly run rate as opposed to the nearly $800 million that is reflected in sell side consensus.","Moving to slide 15, you will see a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS for 2013 and the associated growth rates from these numbers to our 2013 guidance. In closing, Q3 marks another quarter with solid financial performance.","Through top line revenue growth and continued cost containment efforts, we delivered 41% non-GAAP earnings per share growth. Going forward, we will continue to focus on the three strategic priorities that have guided our efforts thus far advancing our pipeline, driving strong performance of our marketed brands in key growth areas and increasing productivity and reducing our cost structure.","These strategic priorities will also allow us to return substantial cash to shareholders by paying our dividend at least at this current level 2014 and beyond and by repurchasing shares under our recently authorized $5 billion program. We remain committed to our innovation strategy and believe it will drive growth and expand margins post 2014.","The progress we have made to-date positions us well to meet the challenges ahead. In 2014, we will begin the launch of our next wave of innovation and we will continue to generate and disseminate important data that will help investors and analysts better gauge our longer term growth potential. We look forward to keeping you updated on our progress. This concludes our prepared remarks and we will now take your questions. Lola, first caller please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Audit Start 17:15)(Operator Instructions). First we will go to line of Mark Schoenebaum with ISI Group.","Mark Schoenebaum - ISI Group","Hi guys, thank you very, very much for taking my questions. I really appreciate it. Thanks for all the clarity on the call. I had a couple of, if I may, pipeline questions. The first is on necitumumab, do you -- I realize that we haven't seen all the data that you have, do you guys expect necitumumab to become the new standard of care in frontline squamous or would you characterize it differently than that?","And number two, also on cancer, when would you expect we would see, and if this is in the slide, I apologize for missing it, when would you expect to present additional data on your CDK 4\/6 inhibitor additional clinical data?","And then, the final question was, can you update us on the timelines for the dulaglutide versus Victoza trial and maybe Enrique can educate us on the commercial implications of results from that trial. Thank you","Phil Johnson","Great Mark. Thank you for you questions. Jan, maybe you want to start off with the first two related to pipeline. and Ilissa, you can help with that one, and then actually, we don't have Enrique on the call today. No problem. I look to Ilissa to provide an update on the AWARD-6 trial and we will go from there.","Jan Lundberg","Yes, and let me start with necitumumab. As you know this indication of squamous non-small cell lung cancer has very few treatment options currently. So, we are looking forward to our discussions with the regulators after we have submitted, and then I think we will see the final outcome there.","In relation to CDK 4\/6, we are very encouraged with the data we have seen with our molecule and we believe we have a very competitive agent that allows continuous dosing and it's also penetrating the blood-brain barrier which could be important for a number of tumor indications, and we have expansion cohorts in both lung and breast and we anticipate those data will be communicated next year.","Ilissa Rassner","Thanks, Mark. It's Ilissa. For dulaglutide, the AWARD-6 trial versus Victoza 1.8 milligrams, we expect that trial to readout in early 2014, and we would expect that at some point in 2014, we would hopefully be able to present detailed data. In terms of commercial expectations, we actually think that this is an important trial to help achieve optimal pricing and access. If we can achieve the primary endpoint of non-inferiority, it will be really important in that regard.","Phil Johnson","Great, and then also on the clinical trial results for the SQUIRE trial of necitumumab in first-line squamous non-small cell lung cancer, we would expect that to be presented at the medical meeting during 2014. It's too early to provide a specific venue, but you can probably guess some of the likely culprits for lung cancer trials that we would be shooting for. So look forward to that data presentation during the course of next year.","Lola, look if we could have a next caller please?","Operator","Certainly, and next we will go to the line of Tim Anderson with Sanford Bernstein.","Bruce Badner - Sanford Bernstein","Hi, this is Bruce Badner, in for Tim Anderson with two questions. So on the Animal Health landscape, is it your sense that there are meaningful business development opportunities in this area in terms of businesses you can bolt-on to your existing business?","Then from my second question. I know Effient is not a mega brand for you, but it is a steadily growing franchise that\u2019s selling around $0.5 billion a year now. Is there anything to fear from AstraZeneca's Brilinta or are you seeing any impact as they try to push their own product harder? Thank you.","Phil Johnson","Great. Thank you for the questions. Derica, if you would like to take the question on Animal Health business development, and then Travis you want to take the second question on Effient, please. All right, thanks. Derica?","Derica Rice","In regards to Animal Health, we continue to be very encouraged and excited about our Elanco Animal Health business in the third quarter, we actually grew revenue 11%, of which 10 percentage points of that was in the food animal segment, and we had about 13 percentage points of growth in the companion animal segment. If you\u2019ve followed Lilly historically, we have been probably more inquisitive in the animal health space than we have been on the human pharma side, and we continue to see business development as an opportunity to further leverage our organic growth. And as you saw or may recall that when Jeff Simmons, the President of our Elanco Animal Health business presented at our Investor Day on October 3 about a third of - or 30% of the growth over the last five years has been from acquisitions and about two-thirds has been through organic growth and pipeline, so we will continue to be assertive in the area of looking for external opportunities to bolster that business.","Phil Johnson","Bruce, this is Phil. I will go ahead and take your second question, so on Effient, we have actually not seen a significant impact from the launch of Brilinta, particularly here in the U.S. We did see an impact last year and into this year from the launch of generic clopidogrel that seems to have stabilized, and the weekly TRx are pretty stable on that 27,000 mark and have been now for a few months. We do look forward to driving growth in the product by focusing on areas where we have had particularly strong data, for example in those patients that have STEMI or those patients with NSTEMI that also have diabetes as well where we believe we have a pretty strong value proposition.","Next caller please?","Operator","Certainly, and it come from the line of Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs.","Jay Olson - Goldman Sachs","Hi. It's Jay Olson on behalf of Jami Rubin. Thanks for taking the question. Could you help us understand the impressive growth in Tradjenta in the third quarter, and could you provide some color on the sorts of patients such as new to market versus switching from other DPP-4s. Also, can you describe some of the key DPP-4 market dynamics such as how long patients typically remain on DPP-4 therapy before adding therapies or switching to other therapies? Finally, could you comment on the pricing and whether or not you see pricing power in the DPP-4 market? Thank you.","Phil Johnson","Jay, thank you for the questions. I\u2019ll have Ilissa start with your questions and I will go ahead and complement her answer. Ilissa?","Ilissa Rassner","Yes. We have been very pleased with the growth that we have seen in Tradjenta. We, as you probably know, have increased our access over time. In the commercial space, we are in the mid-60 percentage points in terms of access, about half of that in terms of Part D. We continue to lead Onglyza in new patient volume and share making us the second choice in the DPP-4 space, and as Enrique had pointed out in October 3, if you are looking at endocrinologists which are a leading indicator of primary care physicians and you are looking at this as a monotherapy, 40% of new-to brand-scripts are going to Tradjenta, so we see a lot of momentum there.","Travis Coy","I think the one question Jay we may have to get back to you on, which we don't have the data for here is the question you had on the length of time that people stay on a DPP-4 before switching to others and then the question you asked about sort of where the patients are coming from in terms of switch that data that we can get from our diabetes team, but we don't have here with us, so we will get back to you on those two sub-questions.(Audit End)","Phil Johnson","Next question please?","Operator","It will come from the line of Chris Schott with JPMorgan.","Chris Schott - JPMorgan","Great. Thanks. Just first on Elanco. How sustainable is the acceleration in the growth we are seeing here from competitor withdrawal? Then second, just coming back on Elanco, the consolidation of the space, do you think consolidation of larger animal health companies is possible for an antitrust perspective? Apologies, I have a cold here. My voice is not doing so well.","Then the final question, repo in light of the current stock price, how much of a priority is that $5 billion program? Thanks very much.","Travis Coy","Thanks, Chris for the questions. Derica, do you want a start? Then if necessary, I can.","Derica Rice","In regards to Elanco, the good news is that the majority of the 11 percentage points of growth is coming from our organic business. We do know that, of that 10 percentage point growth on the food animal side, a piece of that is from the benefit of one of the competitive product Zilmax being removed from the market or withdrawn from the market here in the U.S, but it is probably about half of that growth.","We believe that we can continue to sustain good robust growth in the Animal Health segment and part of that is also going to be by bolstered by the fact that when you look at just numbers of that group's pipeline, that they will be launching new products across their portfolio as well.","In regards to Chris, your question about consolidation, it's hard to speculate on what the other larger players are thinking, but clearly if you are in that upper half of the industry, the animal health space, then and you are contemplating consolidation, the anti-trust rules and all that is going to come into play because you will see overlap of portfolios and there is, I guess for those few to pursue that route, there are a number of different ways to try to deal our content with that including divesture of certain product lines. But that probably will be the biggest hurdle. In regards to the $5 billion share repurchase program that we announced, we believe we can do this along with sustaining our dividend at least at this current level in 2014 and beyond. We had not commenced the program as of yet but we hope to start it sometime soon. And obviously as we look to initiate that, then one of the factors as to when and how much will be kind of where the stock price is trading at that time.","Phil Johnson","Chris, one other thing on the stock repurchase program, when we got some questions after the announcement, some had observed, and correctly so, that the last repurchase program that we authorized was $1.5 billion. It was completed very quickly between late last year and Q1 of this year. And we had indicated and continue to indicate that this particular program would be one that we would do over multiple years. Lola, could we have our next caller please.","Operator","Certainly, it will come from the line of Vamil Divan with Credit Suisse.","Vamil Divan - Credit Suisse","Yes, thanks for taking the questions. My first one is back on the diabetes side. If you could just maybe talk a little bit about Humalog and the pricing dynamics there? We are seeing pretty big list price increases but the net selling price looks like it is lower for the quarter. So any color there will be helpful?","Phil Johnson","Great, then I will go ahead and take your question. So in the U.S., there are a number of factors that lead this quarter for the negative net effective selling price change that we outlined in the press release. There are three main factors there.","One is, that we do continue to see the effect of some of the changes that took place in access for 2013. We compare back to 2012. So some of the competitive and payer dynamic.","Second, we have seen greater utilization of a number of Lilly products including Humalog in Medicare Part D increasing the amounts that we are reserving essentially for donut hole exposure as well as in the managed Medicaid book of business, leading to higher overall or average level of rebates and discounts.","Then there were, in the quarter, some dynamics that are more one-time related to accounting adjustments as we look both at what happened in last year's Q3 and adjustments made in this year's Q3 based on new information that came in that really were adjustment not specifically related to the quarter itself.","We do expect, as we go forward you are going to see a little bit different dynamic in Q4 than you are likely to see during 2014. We will see an impact from some pretty significant adjustments that were made in Q4 of 2012 that will make the price dynamics look significantly different and more positive in Q4 of '13. Again that's not going to reflect any kind of change in the underlying actual prices or discounts that we have in 2013.","It is something that is going be driven by our prior period comparison and then do keep in mind that going forward, we will likely see the impact both in terms of volume and price for the Express Scripts' decision to put NovoLog off their formula essentially and put Humalog into preferred position for 2014 in their more high controlled national formulary that a portion of their clients do subscribe to.","So again, we continue to see very robust volume growth in this category and we are very pleased to have very stable share and good robust volume growth as the market continues to grow. We project that trend to continue in the future.","Vamil Divan - Credit Suisse","Okay, thanks, and then one more if I could, just on emerging markets and appreciate the color you gave on the call regarding the different push and the pulls leverage. How should we just think about maybe longer term the percent of growth there? 3%, I guess in the constant currency rate was a little bit less than we would have thought for this quarter. How should we think about maybe fourth quarter or looking in to next year?","Derica Rice","Sure, there was a little bit of an impact obviously from a slowdown in growth while we still posted double-digit growth in China of 11%. That was somewhat below some of the prior quarters. As Jan talked about in our October 3 meeting, his expectation would be for high single-digit growth on average, going forward. This is an area where we do tend to see a little bit more variability in the quarterly growth rates. So we wouldn't advise you to go ahead, maybe look at averaging that over a couple of quarters to get a feel for the true underlying dynamics and not be swayed, frankly on a positive upside or on the downside if you see a quarter that has significantly higher or lower growth. So the high single-digit is a realistic growth rate going forward for our business. Given the amount of innovation that we will also have to bring to these markets going forward, we are very comfortable with that kind of a growth expectation for our emerging markets business.","Vamil Divan - Credit Suisse","Okay. Thank you.","Phil Johnson","Lola, next caller please?","Operator","Certainly. From Tony Butler at Barclays.","Tony Butler - Barclays","Thanks very much, Derica. It's been fairly impressive when you look at the SG&A line, how much you have been able to draw down overall expenses, so I could push you a little bit, are you satisfied with that numbers as you enter '14 moreover given that you will, well, let's assume you will have at least two launches in '14, may be more, and relative to the pushes and pulls on that SG&A line I would love you to comment. Thanks very much.","Derica Rice","Sure, Tony. We are pleased with our performance, but we are never satisfied with our performance. We believe that we can always look to improve and get better. As we think about 2014, as you heard me say at our Investor Meeting here in Indianapolis on October 3, even in 2014 you will see that our SG&A spend will decline even further in '14 versus where have you seen here this year. Then also in addition to that, you will begin to see that our R&D spend will decline as well as we have completed many of the current Phase 3 studies come to completion as well as our pipeline continues to mature. I think, we will have a even better operating expense profile in '14 even though we will be going through the period of declining revenues.","Operator","We will go to the line of Gregg Gilbert with Bank of America.","Gregg Gilbert - Bank of America","Thanks. A couple of oncology questions. First on ram in gastric, I realize the second potential indication will be filed separately, but in reality I think docs will probably want to use ram in combo or at least have the option, so my question is are you trying to get the combo results published as soon as possible to enable Compendia listing for the self paid reimbursement in both indications versus having to wait for the second.","My other question is on necitumumab. When you put out the top line release a couple months ago, you indicated you would file obviously this is a more definitive statements in saying you would meet with regulators in light of the stoppage of [INSPIRE]. Can you offer some context around your confidence in the benefit risk in the squamous setting?","I guess, we could assume the thromboembolic events were much less common in INSPIRE or is it simply that there a fewer treatment options in the screen, so any context around your confidence on that you have already decide to file on neci would be helpful. Thanks.","Derica Rice","Thanks for the questions. Gregg, I will take the first and have Ilissa take the second, so for the combination therapy data second-line gastric with ram. Clearly, this was very positive data. We are very pleased to see this with a second study now in second-line gastric cancer.","We are very interested to get this data out sooner rather than later for the scientific community to understand the potential benefits as well as the potential side effects of this molecule. There are some venues that we would obviously be targeting that would be great for gastric cancer, so we would expect a disclosure in the first half of next year.","Obviously, it would be great if it would be earlier in the year at an appropriate venue, but we will need to stay tuned on that as we have additional details, we will keep you guys appraised. Ilissa?","Ilissa Rassner","Yes. For necitumumab, Gregg, as you did point, we said that we anticipate filing before the end of 2014, and the timing there is related to some manufacturing validation work that needs to done that's pretty typical with biologics when we sometimes season changes in the manufacturing process.","In terms of the benefit risk, I think this is one where obviously we didn't share the actual data just the top line, but you need to look at the molecule holistically at the benefit risk profile. We have said that from a risk perspective with thrombolic events that it is consistent with other EGFR molecules, however, we saw efficacy with necitumumab as we pointed out in our press release and taking it together. I think it has a favorable benefit risk profile to move forward.","Phil Johnson","Thanks, Ilissa. Lola, next caller please?","Operator","Certainly. It will come from the line of Marc Goodman with UBS.","Marc Goodman - UBS","Yes. Derica, you just mentioned a better operating profile in 2014 to 2013, I was curious are you saying that you think the operating margin is going to be higher even though the top line is under pressure?","Then second question is just on Alimta. Can you remind us how much of the OUS sales are Japan and how it's doing in Japan ex-currency is really what I am trying to figure out. Thanks.","Derica Rice","Hi, Marc. This is Derica. Let me just clarify, when I was talking about the profile meaning for Tony's question. Our operating expenses will be lower in '14 than 2013, so, that's what I meant by an improved profile.","We believe we can achieve that through some of the measures I talked about previously such as some of the trials on R&D side that we are in Phase 3 today, we will have completed. And as those begin to conclude that will bring, lessen the pressure on our R&D spend. On the commercial side, you will be seeing as we lose the patent for Cymbalta, you know that we have already restructured our sales force in the U.S. reducing it by 30% for which we get a partial effect this year. We will get a full year effect next year. And then, in addition to that, you will also see the removal of the DTC advertising as well. So those are all things that will lessen the pressure on our SG&A and R&D spend allowing us to bring it down even further than in '14 versus 2013.","Phil Johnson","And Marc, on Alimta, before I give the response on that, I might want to direct you and other callers to the fact that we have gone ahead and supplemented our workbook with additional information based on some of your requests over the last few quarters or years in some cases. So hopefully you will find this information helpful as we go forward.","One of the things that you will find in addition to the sales breakdown by product that we have been providing that was U.S., international leading up to worldwide, we have provided subsequent tabs that break out international into ACE, Japan and emerging markets. So that data will show, for example, that we have $76.5 million of sales of Alimta in Japan in Q3. That is down pretty significantly relative to the prior year's quarter due to two factors. One is, obviously, rate where we are down about 21% year-on-year. Then also we had a pretty significant price reduction that was instituted in Japan given the significant success we had commercially to trigger that 25% price reduction. So we continue to see very good uptake of the product and use of the product in Japan and we are very pleased with the performance that we have had.","One other things that we did add to the workbook on that note is constant currency exchange rate growth as well, both for products on the international side as well as worldwide and hopefully again that helps respond to some of the requests that you have made over time. Lola, next caller, please.","Operator","Certainly, it will come from the line of Damien Conover with Morningstar.","Damien Conover - Morningstar","Hi, thanks for taking the question. Just a follow-up on the diabetes pricing environment. What we are seeing with a lot of your older products is very strong pricing power. So maybe if you could comment just more on the longer-term pricing power of your insulins and what might be different about this market in context of the PBM's and just insulin in general that might not allow you to have that strong pricing power or in fact whether or not there is better pricing power there over the longer term? Thank you.","Phil Johnson","Damien, thank you for the question.","Derica Rice","Sure, Damien this is Derica. I think when we look at the pricing environment for insulins in the U.S., okay, our position is, we still believe that there should be an element of choice, as it relates the formulary access. We do not believe single source formulary is the right decision, both for physicians and for payers. However, we have seen a dynamic over the recent years as it relates to some of the managed care organizations, PBMs where they have chosen to go to single source and in that environment it absolutely makes the pricing much more competitive and usually you find yourself in a higher rebate environment. And so that's one of the dynamics that is somewhat subduing the net effective selling price impact in insulins versus what you have seen at some of the other therapeutic area categories.","Phil Johnson","On the insulins going forward as well, Damien, this insulin basal or the basal insulin lispro or novel basal insulin to the extent we are able to show differentiation above and beyond, just reduction in nocturnal hypoglycemia, for example, we built to the kinds of additional benefits that helps to position you more favorably with regards to these types of decisions. The fewer those benefits are in the minds of payers, it's probably more difficult it is to go ahead and maintain the patient choice and access that we think is most appropriate. So again we look forward to some of the trials that we will read out starting late this year and the next year for that particular product and are hopeful that in the basal space, as we enter that, that can provide some additional not only revenue for us but also some additional benefit for patients and payers that will be recognized in terms of access and pricing.","Derica Rice","So innovation and value are going to be the key determinants, Damien.","Damien Conover - Morningstar","Great, thank you.","Phil Johnson","Lola, next caller, please.","Operator","And we will go to Alex Arfaei with BMO Capital Markets.","Alex Arfaei - BMO Capital Markets","Good morning. A follow-up on the animal health business. If you could please provide more color on the strength of the x U.S. business with some of the drivers there.","Derica, I am not sure if I got your response earlier when you were talking about the competitive issues with Zilmax. Is that something that you think is sustainable? Is that the benefit that you are seeing there? How should we think about that advantage going forward? Thank you.","Derica Rice","Sure. Let me start with your second question. In regards to Zilmax, I mean, it's hard for us to comment in terms of sustainability of that. That's all dependent upon how the situation plays out with Merck and their product and obviously, we are not privy to their discussions with the regulatory agency in that regard and so that's probably going to be a better question for them.","In regards to our o U.S. business, if you look our o U.S. Food Animal business growth was around 9% and our companion animal sales grew around 23% to give you some idea of our performance o U.S. Those two combined, you really gave us pretty robust growth outside of the U.S. and we continue to see significant growth opportunities going forward, so other than the food animal slowdown that we saw earlier in the year, which we are beginning to see as Jeff has said a little bit of a bounce back, we feel very encouraged about the future prospect of this business segment for us.","Travis Coy","Damien, a little more color on the o U.S. companion animal growth there. We have recently launched Trifexis o U.S., so that has been driving some of the growth and obviously we have experienced very good success of that product in the U.S., so we look forward to globally expanding that product.","Phil Johnson","Next caller please, Nova?","Operator","Certainly, it will come from the line John Boris with SunTrust.","John Boris - SunTrust","Thanks for taking the question and congratulations on the quarter. On ramucirumab, can you just articulate what your strategy is at least in Asia and Japan, in particular for filling ramucirumab?","Secondly, on the R&D front. On your Sclerostin development program, can we possibly get an update there and when there might any data readouts and when that product might enter Phase 3?","Then just a follow up on China, seems as though with the dynamic on volume growth being somewhat flattish in August and into September, can you give some comment on how that might be potentially impacting your business in the Chinese market? Thanks.","Phil Johnson","All right. John, thank you for the questions, so we will have Derica take the China question. Then either Jan or Travis will help us with ramucirumab Asia filling question as well as the update on Sclerostin. Derica, do you want to start off with that China question?","Derica Rice","John, we saw really two dynamics playing out in China at the moment. One is just the overall slowdown in economic growth in China, okay? The second factor has been growth related to the impact of some of the current compliance discussions that are going on in the China marketplace here in the late second and third quarter.","We believe that obviously the economic underlying growth is going to be more of a constant matter to deal with. I think the question on the table is for some of these compliance matters that has impacted the growth dynamic in China, when we will begin to see the bounce back and kind of return more kind of a normalcy, so to speak.","For us, we saw good growth in the quarter of 11% in China. It was below what we have seen in some of the prior quarters and prior years, but still in that strong double-digit range.","Phil Johnson","Jan?","Jan Lundberg","Yes. In relation to Sclerostin, so we are very encouraged by the Phase 2 data that we have here in a very large, actually patient population area and still an unmet medical need and as you know Sclerostin is a unique bone building agent and the with marked BMD increases in the spine and also some similar effect in the hip and we are in final discussions with the regulators on actually how we will form our Phase 3 program.","Phil Johnson","Okay. Ilissa?","Ilissa Rassner","In regards to ramucirumab and Japan, we are actually currently evaluating our options for regulatory filings outside of the U.S. and Europe, but we don't have any specifics to share at this time. I will remind you that the REGARD trial had fewer Asian patients than the RAINBOW combo trial and we haven't been specific on the number of the RAINBOW. We will be presenting that data in the future, but it does contain a larger percentage of patients in Asia.","Phil Johnson","Thanks, Ilissa. Lola, next caller, please.","Operator","And no one else is in queue with a question. I would like to turn it back to Mr. Johnson for any closing remarks.","Phil Johnson","Okay, great. We thank you very much to those of you on the line listening for your interest in Eli Lilly and Company. We had a very successful Q3, both in the financial front as well as on advancing our pipeline and as always we will keep you appraised of our progress in the future. I would also point your attention to January 7, which is sort of the next time we will have one of these calls and that will when we issue first time guidance for 2014. Once again, thank you for listening and participating. Have a great day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today.

Welcome to the Q 2014 earnings call. At this time, all participants are in a listen only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Chairman, President and CEO, Dr. John Lechleiter. Please go ahead.","John Lechleiter","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today to discuss Eli Lilly and Company's second quarter 2014 earnings. As the operators said, I am John Lechleiter, Lilly's Chairman, President and CEO.","Similar to our last call, this morning we are bringing more of our senior leaders into the room here to participate and to answer your questions and we hope that this enhances the quality of the information we provide you during these sessions. Joining me on today's call are Derica Rice, our Chief Financial Officer, Dr. Jan Lundberg, our President of Lilly Research Laboratories, Sue Mahony, President of Lilly Oncology, Enrique Conterno, President of Lilly diabetes, Dave Ricks, President of Lilly Bio-Medicines, Chito Zulueta, President of Emerging Markets, Jeff Simmons, President of Elanco Animal Health and Ilissa Rassner, Brad Robling and Phil Johnson of Lilly's Investor Relations team.","During this conference call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors, including those listed on slide three and those outlined in our latest forms 10-K and 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The information we provide about our products and our pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It's not intended to be promotional and is not sufficient for prescribing decisions.","Before we get into our Q2 results in detail, I would like to offer this context. Even as we feel the full brunt of our patent expiries, we continue to execute our strategy. Our performance is in line with our expectations and we are on track to meet the goals we have shared with you for the year. And the steady advance of our pipeline only strengthens our confidence in our innovation-based strategy.","Cyramza launched to a good reception in the U.S. Empagliflozin has been granted approval in the EU. Our insulin glargine product has been recommended for approval in Europe. And we presented positive data on a number of late stage molecules at the recent ASCO and ADA meetings. We anticipate a number of additional regulatory actions this year as well as additional regulatory submissions and important Phase 3 data readouts. And we continue to manage our expenses rigorously even as we invest to ensure successful launches and continue to advance our pipeline.","With that, let's turn to the key events since last quarter's call. Since our last call, we launched Cyramza in the U.S. as a single agent treatment for patients with advanced or metastatic gastric cancer or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma with disease progression on or after prior chemotherapy. We are pleased with the uptake we are seeing with the reports we are receiving from the sales organization and with feedback from customers on their experience to-date.","We have also a number of positive developments on the regulatory front spanning diabetes and oncology. The European Commission approved empagliflozin or Jardiance indicated in the treatment of Type II diabetes to improve glycemic control in adults. As I mentioned on last quarter's call, Lilly and Boehringer Ingelheim anticipate launch of the product in European countries to begin this quarter.","In the U.S., Boehringer Ingelheim resubmitted the empagliflozin NDA to the FDA. This was deemed a Class I resubmission, which carries a two month review period. Consequently, we expect FDA action this quarter. In Europe, Boehringer Ingelheim submitted the fixed dose combination of empagliflozin and metformin. Also in Europe, the CHMP issued a positive opinion recommending approval of our new insulin glargine product for the treatment of Type I and Type II diabetes. This product, which is part of the Lilly-Boehringer Ingelheim Diabetes alliance is the first biosimilar insulin recommended for approval in the European Union.","Moving now to oncology. In the U.S., based on data from the RAINBOW study, we submitted a supplemental BLA for Cyramza as combination therapy in patients with second line gastric cancer. This will be a standard review and therefore we expect FDA action in the first half of 2015. In Europe, where our initial submission was based on the REGARD monotherapy study, we have now incorporated the RAINBOW data in our submission dossier which is currently under review. And finally, we announced that the FDA granted fast track status for our BLA for necitumumab as first-line treatment of metastatic squamous non-small cell lung cancer. We continue to expect FDA submission before the end of this year.","In clinical news, we had a number of detailed data presentations at the annual meetings of the American Society of Clinical Oncology and the American Diabetes Association. At the ASCO meeting, we presented detailed data from the Phase 3 REVEL trial studying ramucirumab in second line non-small cell lung cancer. In this study, Cyramza demonstrated statistically significant improvements across multiple efficacy endpoints including overall survival, progression free survival and overall response rate. The improvement of overall survival and progression free survival on the Cyramza plus docetaxel arm was consistent across the majority of subgroups including nonsquamous and squamous histologies. We remain on track to meet our commitment for regulatory submission in the second half of 2014.","We also presented detailed data from the Phase 3 SQUIRE trial studying necitumumab in first-line squamous non-small cell lung cancer. In the Phase 3 SQUIRE trial, patients with stage IV metastatic squamous non-small cell lung cancer showed a statistically significant improvement in overall survival, progression free survival and disease control rate. As I mentioned earlier, we intend to submit this BLA by year-end.","Finally, following our initial disclosure at AACR in April, we presented additional data from the Phase 1 trial of our CDK 4\/6 inhibitor, Abemaciclib. These data were from two different cohort expansions. One as a single agent in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer, and the other in combination with fulvestrant in patients with advanced breast cancer. Based on these data as well as the data presented at AACR, we will begin Phase 3 trials later this year in both advanced breast cancer and advanced lung cancer. We are pleased with the single agent activity we have seen with Abemaciclib as well as with the product safety profile and believe we could have a best-in-class molecule.","At the ADA meeting, we presented detailed data from three of the Phase 3 AWARD trials of dulaglutide. There was significant investor interest in the AWARD-6 trial comparing once-weekly dulaglutide 1.5 mg to once-daily liraglutide 1.8 mg. Results from this study show that dulaglutide 1.5 mg was noninferior to the highest approved dose of Victoza in the reduction of HbA1c from baseline. This is the first head-to-head Phase 3 trial of a GLP-1 to show noninferiority to liraglutide 1.8 mg on this important clinical measure.","Detailed data was also presented for AWARD-2 and AWARD-4 head-to-head trials comparing dulaglutide to insulin glargine with and without mealtime insulin. Both trials showed that once-weekly dulaglutide 1.5 mg provided significantly greater reductions in blood glucose for patients with Type II diabetes. Additionally, in both studies hypoglycemia rates were lower for dulaglutide 1.5 mg treated patients compared to insulin glargine. We are very pleased with the results of these three Phase 3 studies for dulaglutide, as well as with those of the Phase 3 studies presented at last year's ADA. If approved, dulaglutide will be the only GLP-1 receptor agonist that is both once-weekly and ready-to-use. We believe it could provide patients and physicians an important new treatment option for Type II diabetes.","In the quarter, we also issued two topline press releases for Phase 3 trials, one for our basal insulin peglispro and the other for Cyramza in second line hepatocellular cancer. We announced positive topline results for three completed Phase 3 clinical trials in patients with Type II diabetes for basal insulin peglispro, which is being studied as a once-daily treatment for both Type I and Type II diabetes. The primary efficacy endpoint of noninferior reduction in HbA1c compared to insulin glargine was met in all three trials.","Having met the primary endpoints, superiority for HbA1c lowering was examined and in all three trials basal insulin peglispro showed a statistically superior reduction in HbA1c compared with insulin glargine. In addition, in all three clinical trials patients taking basal insulin peglispro experienced statistically significant lower rates of nocturnal hypoglycemia and had comparable to statistically significant less weight gain than those taking insulin glargine. We remain on track to issue a topline press release this quarter on our Phase 3 trial in patients with Type I diabetes and to make regulatory filings by the first quarter of next year.","For Cyramza, we announced that the Phase 3 REACH trial in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma or liver cancer did not meet its primary endpoint. Overall survival favored the Cyramza arm but was not statistically significant. Although the REACH study did not meet its primary endpoint, we are encouraged by the efficacy seen in specific subpopulations. We plan to discuss these results with regulatory authorities to inform future trials.","In business development news, we announced last week an immunotherapy collaboration with U.K. based Immunocore Limited to research and potentially develop novel T cell-based cancer therapies. This collaboration will result in a third quarter charge of $45 million or $0.03 per share of EPS after-tax that we have incorporated into our revised guidance for 2014.","Also, we close the acquisition of Lohmann Animal Health, a privately held German company that is a global leader in poultry vaccines. This acquisition establishes Elanco as a global poultry leader and solidifies Elanco's vaccine presence and manufacturing capabilities. We also entered into an agreement contingent upon certain closing conditions to sell the feed additives portion of Lohmann's business to a management led group.","Finally along with Sanofi, we announced an agreement to pursue regulatory approval of nonprescription Cialis. Under the terms of the agreement, Sanofi acquired the exclusive rights to market Cialis OTC following Sanofi's receipt of all necessary regulatory approvals.","In other news, the English High Court determined that the vitamin dosage regimen patents for Alimta in the U.K., France, Italy and Spain would not be infringed by a generic competitor that has stated an intent to market certain alternative salt forms of pemetrexed in those countries upon expiry of the Alimta compound patents in late 2015. We strongly disagree with this ruling and have appealed the ruling to the Court of Appeal.","In the U.S., based on the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in the Akamai versus Limelight Networks, Teva and APP filed an unopposed motion asking the Court of Appeals to remand the Alimta case back to the District Court to consider the issue of infringement. No date has been set for a hearing with the District Court. Note that this does not affect the District Court's decision that our patent is valid. We remain confident that this patent is both valid and enforceable against generic manufacturers.","A Brazilian labor court ruled against our local subsidiary in a case alleging some employees were exposed to hazardous materials in a manufacturing facility operated by the company between 1977 and 2003. We believe the decision is entirely without merit and we filed an appeal.","Finally, during the second quarter, we executed share repurchases totaling $145 million under our $5 billion share repurchase program.","And now, I will turn the call over to Phil for a discussion of our financial performance for the quarter.","Phil Johnson","Thanks, John. First I will review our GAAP results and then discuss a few non-GAAP measures to provide some additional insight into the underlying trends in our business. Moving to slide seven, you can see that our Q2 revenue was $4.9 billion, which is 17% lower than Q2 2013. This decrease in revenue reflects a decline of $1.1 billion in U.S. Cymbalta sales following loss of exclusivity in December last year. In addition, U.S. sales of Evista declined nearly $145 million following that product's loss of exclusivity in March of this year. Excluding Cymbalta and Evista in the U.S., the rest of our worldwide revenue grew 6%, mainly from volume.","Recall that last quarter, we stated that our Japan revenue benefited by about $70 million from higher customer purchases in advance of an increase in a local consumption tax. As expected, this quarter customer purchases in Japan were reduced by a similar amount. This negative impact on our overall corporate revenue growth was largely offset by a benefit in the U.S. related to an adjustment in the reserves for managed Medicaid rebates and discounts.","Gross margin as a percent of revenue decreased 4.4 percentage points, also driven by the loss of U.S. exclusivity for Cymbalta and Evista. This quarter the effect of foreign exchange rates on international inventory sold resulted in the modest addition to cost of sales, while in last year's quarter, it resulted in a modest reduction to cost of sales. Excluding this FX effect from both 2013 and 2014, gross margin as a percent of revenue declined 3.4 percentage points from 79.9% in Q2 2013 to 76.5% in Q2 this year. As in prior calls, we have included a supplementary slide providing our gross margin percent for the last 10 quarters with and without this FX effect.","Non-GAAP measures are shown on slide eight. Total operating expense defined as the sum of R&D and SG&A decreased 11% or nearly $340 million versus Q2 of 2013. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses were down 11%, while R&D was down 10%. The reduction in marketing, selling and administrative expenses was due to the reduction in U.S. sales and marketing activities for Cymbalta and Evista as well as our ongoing cost containment efforts. The decline in R&D expenses was driven primarily by a reduction in late stage development costs.","Other income and expense was net income of $54 million in Q2 2014 compared to a income of $12 million in the second quarter of 2013, with this modest change driven by a variety of miscellaneous items. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 22%, an increase of 1.5 percentage points compared to Q2 last year. The main reason for this increase in the tax rate is the lapse of R&D tax credit at the end of last year. At the bottom line, net income declined 42% and earnings per share declined 41%. As in Q1, this decline is significant but very much in line with our expectations and places us on track to achieve our full year guidance.","In slide nine, we provide the same reconciliation of non-GAAP adjusted information for our year-to-date results.","Moving to slide 10, you will find a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS. Additional details about our reported earnings are available in today's earnings press release.","As I mentioned last quarter, nearly all our peers exclude amortization of intangibles from their non-GAAP results, while we include this expense. For your modeling purposes, please note that we recognized amortization expense of $134 million representing 2.7% of revenue this quarter.","Now let's look at how price, rate and volume affected our revenue growth. Given the significant decline in U.S. Cymbalta and Evista sales, I will provide you with some color on how that affected revenue growth this quarter.","On slide 11 you can see the total revenue decline of 17% in Q2 2014, which is shown in the yellow box on the middle of the page, and that this decline was entirely driven by volume. Price added about 1% to revenue growth, while the impact of FX was nil. Excluding U.S. Cymbalta and Evista, the rest of our worldwide revenue grew 6%, with just over half of that growth coming from volume and the rest from price.","Touching on some of the geographic highlights. For the quarter, U.S. Pharma revenue declined 33%, driven by a volume decline of 36%. Excluding Cymbalta and Evista, the rest of our U.S. Pharma revenue increased 13% comprised of 5% from volume and 8% from price. The benefit I mentioned earlier from the adjustment for managed Medicaid utilization had a positive effect a two percentage points of this growth in the form of price.","In Japan, as I mentioned earlier, our Q1 revenue benefited by roughly $70 million as customers increased purchases in advance of an increase in the consumption tax that went into effect on April 1. As expected, customer purchase in Q2 were reduced by a similar amount leading to a decline in our Q2 Japan Pharma revenue. Specifically, Japan Pharma revenue declined 15% this quarter, driven by a volume decline of 10%, adjusting for the timing of customer purchases, our Q2 Pharma Japan volume would have increased 5%. You will also see that the weaker Yen is still reducing our growth rate but at a much lower rate than in prior quarters.","In emerging markets, we saw good performance growth of 8%, partially offset by a 4% negative impact from foreign exchange. Volume growth of 7% was driven by Humulin, Forteo, Humalog, Vancocin, and Tradjenta. Sales in our largest emerging markets country China grew 15%.","Finally, Elanco Animal Health posted revenue growth of 11%. Strong growth in our U.S. food animal business and in both food and companion animal products oUS was partially offset by lower U.S. companion animal sales. Also at the end of April, we closed the acquisition of Lohmann Animal Health. This added nearly $25 million in revenue, primarily oUS contributing four percentage points to worldwide animal health growth.","Now let me turn the call over to Derica.","Derica Rice","Thanks, Phil. On slide 12, you will see the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates on the growth rates for select items of our income statement. FX had almost no impact on our revenue or operating expenses this quarter. As Phil mentioned, FX did cause a modest increase in the growth of cost of sales with the corresponding negative effect on operating income and EPS. As a result, FX caused our operating income and EPS to decline an additional two to three percentage points.","Slide 13 shows our pipeline as of July 17. Changes since our last earnings call are highlighted with green arrows showing progression and red arrows showing attrition. As John discussed earlier, Lilly and Boehringer Ingelheim received European approval for empagliflozin. In addition, we began Phase 2 testing of a biologic for diabetes and we began Phase 1 testing of two Biologics, one for anemia in patients with chronic kidney disease and the other for ulcerative colitis, and we terminated development of five assets, three in Phase 2 and two in Phase 1.","Next, let me remind you of our key events for 2014 and review our updated 2014 financial guidance. In the first 6.5 months of the year, we are pleased with the progress we have made on key events we laid out for you at the beginning of the year. As you can see from the green checkmarks on slide 14, we had a productive first half of the year, advancing our pipeline and sharing Phase 3 data. While I will not go through each item on the slide, I will give you a reminder of the potential key events for the remainder of this year and provide updates along the way.","As John mentioned, later this year we will begin Phase 3 trial for abemaciclib our CDK 4\/6 inhibitor in both advanced breast cancer and advanced lung cancer. We no longer expect to move blosozumab, our antisclerostin antibody for osteoporosis into Phase 3 in 2014. The formulation we plan to take into Phase 3 produced injection site reactions at a higher rate than desired. We will conduct additional work with the formulation used in Phase 2 before moving forward.","With respect to Phase 3 data, we expect to report topline results this year, with detailed data presentations next year. For our basal insulin peglispro studies in patients with Type I diabetes, ramucirumab for metastatic colorectal cancer, and three immunology assets, ixekizumab, tabalumab and baricitinib.","In addition to the submissions we have already completed this year, we continue to expect regulatory submissions this year for the fixed dose combination of empagliflozin and metformin for Type II diabetes in the U.S., necitumumab for first line squamous non-small cell lung cancer and ramucirumab for second line non-small cell lung cancer as well as for gastric cancer in Japan. As we previously disclosed, we expect to submit our basal insulin peglispro for Type I and Type II diabetes by the end of the first quarter of 2015, if not earlier.","Also this year, we could have regulatory action on empagliflozin in the U.S., dulaglutide in the U.S. and Europe and our new insulin glargine product in the U.S. as well as final EC approval following the recent positive CHMP opinion and ramucirumab in advanced gastric cancer in Europe. Now keep in mind that in addition to regulatory approval timing the launch timing for our new insulin glargine product will be impacted by a number of factors, including patent expirations and ongoing litigation.","In other key events for the remainder of 2014, data package exclusivity for Cymbalta will expire in Europe in the second half of this year, although we do not expect generic duloxetine to enter the European market until 2015. Now clearly we have a lot going on in 2014 and we are looking forward to maintaining the momentum from the first half of this year into the second half.","Now let's turn to our 2014 financial guidance. Our performance through June places us on track to achieve our full year financial guidance. Since our last earnings call, there have been some minor pushes and pulls but major changes to our full year outlook. As a result, our guidance for nearly all line items as shown on slide 15 remains unchanged. We have revised our GAAP EPS guidance to reflect a charge of $45 million pretax or $0.03 per share after-tax related to the immune oncology licensing deal with Immunocore announced last week, and we slightly revised our outlook for capital expenditures, which has been reduced to $1.2 billion.","On slide 16, we have provided a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS for 2013 and the associated growth rates from these numbers to our 2014 guidance.","Now I will turn the call back over to John.","John Lechleiter","Thanks, Derica. Before the Q&A session, let me briefly sum up. While our revenues and earnings continue their decline as we expected, at the same time the launch of Cyramza and a number of approvals and impending launches give us great confidence that we are poised for growth in the years ahead. Our performance is consistent with our expectations and we are on track to meet our 2014 financial goals. We recorded growth in the sales of a number of products and key markets as well as in our Elanco Animal Health business. The 11% decline in our operating expenses shows our ongoing determination to manage expenses rigorously so we can get the most from our well-stocked late stage pipeline. The steady advance of the pipeline strengthens our confidence in our innovation-based strategy and our commitment to accelerate discoveries to the people who need them.","And now I will turn the call over to Phil for our Q&A session.","Phil Johnson","Great. Thank you, John. Toni, we are ready for the first caller, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from the line of Tim Anderson with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Tim Anderson - Sanford Bernstein","Thank you. Two questions. The first is, we are seeing price competition in diabetes in various ways starting last year and then recently Glaxo launched their GLP-1 at a pretty big list price discount to existing therapies, which you rarely see drug companies do. This could have an obvious impact on dulaglutide's pricing at launch and I am sure you will say it's too early to discuss pricing, but I am hoping you can still address in general terms, because it is a worrisome trend, not just for dula and Lilly but for other products and other categories for a variety of companies.","Then the second question is on Lilly's plans in terms of M&A activity and also tax inversion. You guys, in the past, have been pretty steadfast about only really considering bolt-on acquisitions. Is this still the current stance, because if so that size probably would not be big enough to qualify you for inversion. So how is Lilly thinking about M&A and the potential for inversion?","Phil Johnson","Tim, thank you for the questions. We will have Enrique Conterno, President, Lilly Diabetes take the first question on the pricing in the GLP-1 space and then Derica Rice, CFO, take your question on M&A.","Enrique?","Enrique Conterno","Very good. Well, as we all know, pricing in the U.S. has become extremely competitive when it comes to the diabetes space, which is driven both by payors and competition. I think in this particular case, pricing also in a certain way reflects the profile of the very specific products. We are extremely confident in the profile that we bring with dulaglutide and the number of trials that we have conducted. So we do think we have a very strong value proposition.","And of course, as we think about diabetes, our stance continues to be the same. We are a proponent of choice. We believe choice is important for patients. And we are seeking basically a dual axis in the diabetes space whenever this is possible.","Phil Johnson","Thanks, Enrique. Derica?","Derica Rice","Tim, as it relates to M&A activity, our stance and strategy has not changed in this space. We continue to be very interested in looking for those opportunities that can augment our current organic footprint, both commercially as well as scientifically. And that really lies in the space that you have seen us play in historically, looking for in licensing deal and sometimes it's easier to do small M&A transactions to get access to those technologies. We continue also to be not interested in doing the large-scale M&A. We just have not seen that the long-term benefits from those types of transactions.","As it relates to inversion, if that ever did come about, it would be a secondary benefit, not the primary driver of us taking any type of M&A action.","Phil Johnson","Great. Thanks, Derica. Toni, next caller please.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum with ISI Group. Please go ahead.","Mark Schoenebaum - ISI Group","Hello?","Phil Johnson","Yes. We can hear you.","Mark Schoenebaum - ISI Group","Thanks. Can you hear me? Sorry about that. I am sorry. Thanks for taking my question. Just if I could ask the pipeline question. So all across the pipeline, you have had some nice success this year, but perhaps nothing truly transformative. But when I look ahead, I see two things that potentially are really transformative, solanezumab and the CETP inhibitor. And I was just wondering, I think in the past, you have characterized, not the recent past necessarily, but you characterized solanezumab as a high risk pipeline program. I would love to know if you still perceive it as such, now that the new Phase 3 programs are ongoing?","And I guess, so we can't do a deep dive in earnings call, the same big picture question on CETP, do you view that as a high risk, moderate risk or low risk asset? And maybe if you could just remind us on the timeline? Thanks.","Phil Johnson","Great. Mark, thanks for the questions. We will have Dave Ricks, President, Lilly Bio-Meds answer your questions. Jan, if you would like to chime in anything after Dave, please feel free to. Dave.","Dave Ricks","Thanks, Mark, for the question. We remain excited about both of these programs, the CETP inhibitor, evacetrapib and solanezumab. Importantly, we are confident on the timelines we have previously communicated as to those data readouts which are clearly not in this year but that coming up over the next couple years.","As it relates to CETP inhibitors and ours specifically, we are confident for several reasons. One, the LDL in addition of this asset, we think is enough by itself to achieve the outcomes we have designed in the study to demonstrate. On top of that, of course, there are other effects. HDL lowering or increasing being the most pronounced as well as other cardiovascular potential impacts. So testing the CETP hypothesis with a complete inhibitor of CETP like evacetrapib, we think is something that's new and we are doing an ACCELERATE trial. So we remain excited about that asset and should it play out that it has an impact on cardiovascular risk reduction, we think there is ample market opportunity for such a drug.","For solanezumab, I think as we have communicated since the EXPEDITION-1 and EXPEDITION -2 studies, we believe in the mild signal we saw in those studies. We have designed a study now, which we think will be the definitive test of solanezumab in mild patients with Alzheimer's and we have improved, we believe, the probability of success in that versus EXPEDITION-1 and EXPEDITION-2 by importantly screening out patients who did not have amyloid plaque and by powering the study appropriately for this population.","So bottom line, we are bullish on both of these. Of course, there is technical risk because both programs did not complete a normal Phase 2 proof of concept in the sense that you are demonstrating the outcome before starting a Phase 3. So I will stop there and ask Jan if he has any additional --","Jan Lundberg","Yes, I think we can also gain some additional confidence from data from competition. The recent report by crenezumab at the Alzheimer's meeting in Copenhagen, I think supports the data that we have with solanezumab because it was reported there that this antibody which has some similarities to sola in its mechanism of action also reduced the cognition decline in the mild population of Alzheimer's, which I think is the second nonpharmacological agent that actually shows that if you interfere with the amyloid pathway, you can reduce cognition decline in Alzheimer patients.","Phil Johnson","Great. Thank you, Jan. Toni, Next caller, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our question comes from the line of Jamie Rubin with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Jamie Rubin - Goldman Sachs","Thank you. Just a more mundane question. Derica, your gross margin guidance for the full year at 73%, which assumes a significant deterioration in the second half of the year, are you just being conservative with your numbers? Or is there something that we are not aware that we should take into consideration for that? And can you confirm that that would assume a worsening in the second half?","And Dave Ricks, for you, just on PCSK9. I know that is a Phase 2 asset, and it would seem that the PCSK9 would directly compete with the CETP inhibitor. What are your plans for this drug? And I think you are probably fourth in line in bringing a PCSK9 to the marketplace. So if you can elaborate a little bit on where you see that project going? Thanks.","Phil Johnson","Thanks for the questions. Jamie. Derica, you want to kick this off?","Derica Rice","Sure. Hi, Jamie. Good morning. As it relates to our gross margin guidance, let me just walk you through a series of things. One typically Q2 is one of our higher gross quarters, primarily because one, we do not have the slowdown that usually takes place in our production facilities outside the U.S., primarily in Europe due to the summer holiday. And also in the fourth quarter, we typically experience the usual maintenance shutdowns. What we expect and what you saw in the first half of the year is that we had very high production volumes running through our manufacturing facilities and we anticipate that those production volumes will be lower in the second half for the reasons I cited earlier. So the gross margin performance that you are seeing thus far for us is pretty in line with the expectations that we have for the year.","The second thing that I would also highlighted is that also what you will see in the last six months of year is a full absorption and dilutive effect of the Lohmann Animal Health acquisition which we talked about, the $0.05 hit, when we announced the deal for the year and we also talked about the fact that it would be dilutive to our gross margin as well.","Phil Johnson","Great. Thanks, Derica, Dave?","Dave Ricks","Great. Thanks, Jamie, for the question on PCSK9. I think you are correct that we are behind in this class but we think the class has a place in the management of cardiovascular risk. Obviously there's assets in front of us that are reading out positive data. So the probabilities here look good for the class. I think for us the really question is one of differentiation, maybe not so different to the question on the GLPs. We are conducting right now a Phase 2 experiment to really elucidate a differentiated profile. And I think that data is going to be really key for our decision making about what to do next. Whether that would be to proceed full speed ahead, perhaps share risk with another partner or perhaps to have someone else take the asset forward and Lilly move on to other opportunities. So we need to see that proof of concept and based on that information, we will make some decisions in the quarters ahead.","Phil Johnson","Great. Thanks, Dave. Toni, next caller, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Boris with SunTrust. Please go ahead.","John Boris - SunTrust","Thanks for taking the questions. First one for Derica. Just one item in your guidance that seemed to change was the CapEx, which seemed to move down on your guidance. Can you maybe just characterize what's going on in the CapEx line and where that savings is going to be going?","Second question for Jan. It looks as though there were some pruning of the pipeline to your oncology assets. Can you maybe help us understand what the next assets or beyond ramu and neci within your strategy that you will be focusing on within oncology. If there is any in Phase 2 you can point out.","And then on the Immunocore deal for novel T-cell based therapies, are there any particular mechanisms that you are targeting along with T-cell area or looking to optimize with that codiscovery and codevelopment strategy? Thanks.","Phil Johnson","John, thanks for the questions. Obviously Derica will take your first question on capital expenditures and maybe John and Sue, you would like to comment on the oncology questions that John had. Derica?","Derica Rice","Sure. Hi, John. From a CapEx standpoint, it's really fairly straightforward. Our manufacturing team and our facilities group have done an excellent job of just driving productivity and being able to bring in projects still on time, but at lower cost. So that $100 million change in our outlook for CapEx s really spread across a multitude of capital projects where you are eeking out increased efficiencies.","Phil Johnson","Great. Thanks, Derica. Jan.","John Lechleiter","John, with respect to what you term pruning of the pipeline, I think the fact that we had three potential cancer drugs that fell out of Phase 2 is somewhat a factor of just the abundance of cancer opportunities that we have in Phase 2. It reflects the ongoing nature of the business decision making related to data that we have gathered and other priorities that we have set. I think going forward, you are going to see Lilly much more focused on the clinical progression of the molecules where we believe we have a competitive lead and that we believe offer the greatest opportunity for Lilly. We have got a great position today of really having an abundance of riches and yet we have finite resource. With an ever more competitive environment, I think it's important that we put clear focus and resources behind those that we believe provide for us the greatest potential and the greatest opportunity for patients at the end of the day.","With respect to the T-cell therapies, I am going to ask Sue to comment, both on your second question about the oncology portfolio and then specifically on immuno-oncology. But we believe immuno-oncology is an important area. We have said this. We believe we have assets already in our pipeline that really factory in to this disease, to this mechanism a writ large and the Immunocore deal was, we think a great opportunity for us to influence the immune cycle, hopefully for the benefit of cancer treatment in a very specific way.","And again, I will ask Sue to comment in greater detail.","Sue Mahony","Sure. Yes, thanks. Clearly with regards to the oncology pipeline, we are looking at the key cancer pathways, including cell cycle inhibition, the tumor microenvironment and immunotherapy. You are aware of bemaciclib. Obviously, we are very excited about that molecule. We have initiated our Phase 2 study, single agent study. We are on track to initiate the fulvestrant Phase 3 study in breast cancer in the next few weeks. And the additional Phase 3 study, both with a breast caner with aromatase inhibitor and in lung cancer will be starting and KRAS lung cancer, we will be starting towards the end of this year. So that is one molecule we are very excited about and we are moving forward rapidly with that.","In other molecules that we have in our pipeline that we are continuing to progress, our c-Met antibody which is a bivalent antibody that we believe could have different properties than other agents out there. And then, our TGF-\u03b2 small molecule inhibitor or galunisertib, which is in Phase 2 development, and this is actually a molecule that is getting a lot more interest because it targets the pathway that modulates and functions T Regulator Cell. So that is one agent that we believe that could have or does have a new modulating activity and we are going to be seeing further combinations with that agent, both with other targeted agents and with other immunotherapy agents.","We have two other agents that we have got in clinical development as well that impact the immune system includes the CXCR4 peptide antibody which is in Phase 2 development, and that's involved in the trafficking of immune cells in tumors and rCSF-1 antibody that's in Phase 1 and that targets monocytes and macrophages involved in creating an immunospecific environment in the tumor. So we have three assets in clinical development that impact the immune system.","We are also continuing to increase our discovery efforts and capabilities both internally and through recruitments externally if necessary and we have got a number of targets that we are interested in. In addition to collaborations and partnerships and potential acquisitions that we are looking at, and Immunocore is the recent one that we have announced and we are very excited about looking at novelties. So base cancer therapies, that deal specifically looks at three targets. We have identified three targets. We can't tell you what those targets are now but they are ones that we believe that have potential and clearly if we decide to take those into the clinic, we will be looking at combinations with other oncology assets and other assets in our pipeline for those agents.","So we are very excited about the opportunities that we have got in oncology and as John said, it's really a case of making sure we are prioritizing and putting our focus in the right areas to making sure we are progressing the molecules that have got the most potential for patients.","Phil Johnson","Great. Thank you, Sue. Toni, if we can have the next caller, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Chris Schott - JPMorgan","Great. Thanks very much. Just had a few here. So my first one was, as we look at Lilly returning to growth and as cash flow starts to recover, can you just share some of your views on your products and potential divestitures of non-core assets? We have seen a number of players in the space that would consider looking at the divesting some of those businesses? Just thoughts from Lilly in terms of, if that's something that could be on the table?","Second question on the CDK program in breast cancer. I think Pfizer announced, it's moving forward with a palbociclib filing based on Phase 2 data. If that drug is approved early next year, just can you comment what that means competitively Lilly, as you think about your program and the timing of that program relative to Pfizer's launch?","And then finally, I am not going to sound so generically, but your on sclerostin inhibitor, just talk about next steps from here and your confidence that this is something you can dress? Just trying to understand what we should be watching for on the updates there. Thanks very much.","Phil Johnson","Chris, thank you for the questions. We will have Derica take the questions on strategies around late stage assets, post patent assets. Sue Mahony on what the palbociclib potential approval could mean from a competitive perspective, and then Dave, want to take lead maybe on talking about the sclerostin question, that would be great. Derica?","Derica Rice","Hi, Chris. As it relates to, I guess this is a little bit of still, a further extension of our capital allocation strategy. We have got a number of deals over the last few years to take advantage and make sure we are maximizing the potential what's sitting inside not only Lilly's labs but also Lilly's even currently marketed products. So even if you look at Evista, we did some deals there outside of the U.S. to make sure that we were able to put proper resourcing behind that at a time when we were diverting some of other resources more towards the pipeline to advance the late stage assets that we saw with future potential.","I think going forward, we will continue, as you heard even from Dave and from John as well, that we have a pretty robust and pretty full clinical stage pipeline today. And we believe there are potentially more opportunities than we will have the capacity to progress on our own. So it is possible that going forward you will see us as we cycle through those deciding which assets we will go alone and as Dave said, which assets we may partner and which assets we may find other ways to monetize the value from. The good news is that we are at the beginning of this cycle as we are getting great discovery output from our research labs and that's what affording us these opportunities that lie ahead of us. And we have no intentions of doing anything that will damage that flow of new molecules moving into the clinic and it gives us the optionality down the road.","Phil Johnson","Thanks, Derica. Sue?","Sue Mahony","Yes, with regard to the palbo potential approval, that really doesn't have any significant impact on our plans for Abemaciclib. Clearly our focus is on ensuring that we get our three Phase 3 studies up and running as quickly as possible this year, which we are on track to do. I am very confident that the team has got a good plan in place to ensure that we get rapid enrollment in these studies. We are confident in our molecule. We believe that we could have a best-in-class molecule here with single agent activity and continuous dosing. So as I said, our focus really is ensuring that we get these trials up and running as quickly as possible, and I think we are on track to do that.","Phil Johnson","Great. Thanks, Sue. Dave?","Dave Ricks","Great. Thanks, Chris. Maybe just quickly as well on asset mix and looking to change that, I would say, on the late lifecycle, in market assets, I think we are open to that as well, but we need to have a transaction that produces value. So I think when we see those things we move on them. I think the Cialis announcement with Sanofi this quarter is an example of that where we are harvesting late lifecycle value from Lilly assets.","On sclerostin antibody, pronounced blosozumab, for those on the phone, we had completed a proof of concept study in severe osteoporosis. We are excited by that data. We remain excited by the data. In conducting a transition from a Phase 2 formulation to a final commercial image, we did have some results that surprised us a bit in making that transition. We needed a bit more work on the formulation so that we have really a competitive or even differentiated commercial product image. We had scheduled or had communicated a potential for a start to the Phase 3 program toward the 2014 and today we are just saying, that's not going to happen in 2014 because of this delay. As we have more information, we will come back to the investment community to share firmer timelines.","Phil Johnson","Great. Thanks, Dave. Toni, next caller, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Seamus Fernandez with Leerink. Please go ahead.","Seamus Fernandez - Leerink","Thanks for the questions. So just a few quick questions. First off, maybe for Jan. Can you give us your general thoughts on the data that was presented on Roche's crenezumab? I think we have seen some data that looked somewhat similar, but can you just maybe compare and contrast what we saw with Lilly's solanezumab versus crenezumab, and how these molecules are fundamentally different?","Second question is for Enrique, on the launch preparation for dulaglutide. Can you just give us a sense of where we are, as we lead into a potential action date from the FDA? Have we the facilities? Have they been inspected? How is inventory building? And how would you recommend that we assess the dulaglutide launch, given recent product launches and perhaps access, although I would think that Lilly might have a bit of a better opportunity given its ability to leverage the portfolio?","And then just a quick update on the glargine challenge in the U.S. and if you would consider and risk launch following the expiration of the 30 month stay?","And my last question is, if you can remind us, post the Lohmann acquisition and perhaps Novartis, Derica, would you be able to tell us what the overall deal related noncash charges that get baked into the P&L on an ongoing basis and your adjusted earnings? Can you remind us what that number is currently? And it what may move to?","And then perhaps what prevents Lilly from moving to the industry standard cash EPS? Thanks a lot.","Phil Johnson","Okay. Keep us on track here. If we miss one of your questions, don't hesitate to let us know, but I think we will go ahead and have Jan talk about the data for Roche's crenezumab. Obviously, Enrique, the two middle questions on launch for dulaglutide and the status of the glargine legal situation here in the U.S. and then Derica, the last one on the noncash charges. So Jan, you want to start please?","Jan Lundberg","Yes, first I would like to make a comment, and since it's not a head-to-head trial, I think it's more compelling than different trials and done under different conditions, but as I said before, the data are generally supportive between solanezumab and crenezumab. We should remember though that the crenezumab is a Phase 2 trial, which is clearly much smaller than EXPEDITION-1 and EXPEDITION-2. And I think for our EXPEDITION-3 is going to be the most important trial, which is even 60% larger than the previous EXPEDITION trials and the focus, I think here is clear. It is the mild Alzheimer's patients that could have the best impact from solanezumab and we are selecting the amyloid positive ones which is also a key criterion.","Phil Johnson","Great. Thank you, Jan. Enrique?","Enrique Conterno","First on dulaglutide. We are, by the way, expecting that the trade name which is going to be TRULICITY. We are very much on track. The action date for both the U.S. and Europe is this year. So our launch preparations are very much ongoing. There is not much more really that I can discuss at this stage whether it's pricing or inspections and so forth. Just to say that at this stage things are going on truck from our perspective.","When it comes to our new insulin glargine product, we are also expecting tentative approvals this year and clearly we do have in the U.S. the 30 month stay. I can't make many comments about the ongoing litigation, but clearly we do not believe that we are infringing any of the asserted patents. So we are hopeful that we can resolve this as soon as we ca. Hopefully even before the 30 month stay. But if that is not the case, we have the conviction in terms of what our position is and we are not infringing any of those asserted patents. So we will be planning to launch at this stage.","Phil Johnson","Enrique, thank you. Derica?","Derica Rice","Hi, Seamus. For amortization of intangibles that's embedded in our operating results, as you heard from Phil earlier, for the second quarter about $135 million is what's reflected in our Q2 results. When we think about Lohmann, if you look at it on a full-year basis, a full twelve month basis, somewhere between $15 million to $20 million. As it relates to Novartis Animal Health. I am not able to share that with you until we actually close the deal and we have the final purchase accounting. So that number is still moving at the moment.","Phil Johnson","And in terms of any thoughts about moving towards where most of the peers said of the non-GAAP treatment of amortization, Derica?","Derica Rice","Thanks, Phil. We have obviously gotten some input both from people such as yourself, Seamus on the sell side as well as we have gotten some inquiries on it from some of our buy side investors as well. It's something we are taking under consideration. Actually, we plan to come back and inform you as to what are our actions going forward will be.","Phil Johnson","Great. Thanks Derica. Toni, if we can have another caller, please?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Scala with Cowen. Please go ahead.","Steve Scala - Cowen","Thank you. I have three questions. First, on dulaglutide. There's no question that you have a best-in-class asset. But what portion of the GLP market would be receptive to a modestly effective but less expensive product from GSK? And is that portion 10% or 30%?","Secondly, Lilly has given out some time ago now, a very specific guidance on SG&A and R&D as a percent of sales without specifying a year in which that will be achieved. Consensus, I believe, has Lilly achieving these targets in 2019. Can you tell us whether Lilly's internal forecast has you achieving these targets before 2019? And if you aren't willing to say, would you say whether Lilly plans to achieve these targets this decade?","And then the final question is that, it seems that 2015 is setting up to be a phenomenal year with sales and earnings up very strongly. Yet consensus covers a wide range. What early observations would you like to make about 2015? For instance, please take the opportunity to rein in the high end of those estimates, unless compared to your expectations, the high end is just fine. Thank you.","Phil Johnson","All right. Steve, thank you, for the three questions. Well I will have Enrique take the dulaglutide question, and Derica you will have to comment on timing or some of the goals for the SG&A and R&D as a percent of revenue, and then any initial thoughts on 2015. Enrique?","Enrique Conterno","Steve, thank you for your comments. I am going to quote you on dulaglutide as a best-in-class asset. VERY much appreciate it. We certainly believe so. Look, on your specific question about -- there are different types of profiles in the GLP-1 class and some look less efficacious. I will be honest, I think the value proposition for those products is very complicated. We do know that improved glycemic control leads to reduction in complications. That is a very strong value proposition. It does what we seek that. So it is difficult for me to say what type of share would those products get, but I do not believe it is going to be very much.","Phil Johnson","Okay. Thank you. Derica?","Derica Rice","Hi, Steve. As it relates to our margin guidance that we put out there, Steve, we actually have provided a timeline, at least up till now. What we said is that, no later than 2019 or by 2019 we will achieve a total operating expense as a percent of sales somewhere in the 48% to 50% range. Getting back to the historical levels of profitability that you have seen from Lilly pre-patent expiration. We still expect to at least meet that timeline. There clearly will be opportunities to update that outlook as we move forward.","As it relates to 2015, Steve, it is still early. I am not in a position to share details on our outlook for 2015. But we have said though is that we do, coming out of 2014, expect to return to growth and to begin our journey towards expanding our margins. And so that is the kind of performance you should expect to see and obviously in the near future we will have an opportunity of giving you more specifics around 2015 as we think about our usual timeline for issuing guidance.","Phil Johnson","Yes, and then typically, Steve, that guidance is given in that first full week of January. So probably somewhere around January 7 you should expect to be seeing a day reserved for the 2015 guidance call. Toni, if we can have next caller, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vamil Divan with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Vamil Divan - Credit Suisse","Yes, thanks so much for taking the questions, so two that I have. One on the CGRP antibody. I think that's a pipeline asset people don't talk about too much yet. Can you just talk a little more on your expectations there? We have obviously seen some setbacks previously in that space. What do you think are the differentiating points for that product? And what would you say are some of the key decision points that you have coming up here?","And then just looking at your slide 14 with the key events, it doesn't look like any other major external data readouts the rest of this year. Any chance any of the autoimmune studies that you have ongoing that we might see some of those at AACR later in the year? Or if not, should we assume ULAR next year might be a big meeting for you guys with all three of these assets there?","Phil Johnson","Vamil, thank you for the questions. We will have Jan lead off on the CGRP. Dave, feel free to chime in and then I will ask my colleague Ilissa if she wants to comment on some of the data readouts for the back half of the year, Jan?","Jan Lundberg","Yes. Calcitonin gene related peptide or CGRP has been implied as an important mediator in migraine since quite some time and it has been shown by small molecules that you can reduce then the acute migraine symptoms by giving up oral agents. The problem with both agents were that yes, they prove the hypothesis that CGRP is an important mediator, but they were not safe for chronic use, because they had liver toxicity. That's why I think the antibody, in a way, comes in with an open door where the mechanism has been proven and antibodies, as we have seen with ours, are generally safer. So they are more appropriate also then for potential to chronic use.","And as you know, we described the positive data from a proof of concept study recently where the effect in chronic migraine was shown reducing the migraine headache days and also migraine attacks than in so-called episodic migraine. So what we are doing now with this molecule is to do some more dose ranging and studying and preparations then for Phase 3. And we also recently announced that we will start to study on osteoarthritis also for this agent.","Phil Johnson","Great, Jan. Thank you. Dave, any comments?","Dave Ricks","No.","Phil Johnson","Okay, Ilissa?","Ilissa Rassner","Sure. Thanks, Vamil, for the question. So a while you are correct, that we don't have any detailed data readouts listed for our immunology portfolio, we are expecting internal data readout in the second half of this year, starting with ixekizumab, followed by tabalumab and towards the very end of the year, the first trial we will readout for baricitinib. Those trials should have detailed data readouts starting in 2015. I will also remind you that we are expecting topline results as well for our basal insulin peglispro in diabetes for the Type I trials and that will be in the third quarter of this year.","Phil Johnson","And as has been our past practice, Vamil, I think you should expect that the various trials that Ilissa just mentioned would lead to topline press releases providing an update at a high level on whether or not the trials have met their endpoint. So what kind of safety profile we have seen and some of our thoughts on next steps for those molecules. One I might mention that's broader across the portfolio, the REACH trial of ramucirumab in hepatocellular cancer, I think it is quite possible and likely that we have detailed data presented at a medical meeting before the end of the year that should get some additional insights into the commentary we provided around subgroup data that we found to be quite interesting.","Ilissa Rassner","And then also for ramucirumab, there is the colorectal data that would lead out towards the end of this year, possibly early next year and could have a topline readout as well.","Vamil Divan - Credit Suisse","Great. Okay. Thank you.","Phil Johnson","Thanks for the questions. Toni, next caller, please.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Colin Bristow with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Colin Bristow - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks for taking the questions. On GLP-1s, we should see Phase 2 data for Novo' oral GLP-1 in Q2 2015. I was just wondering if you would give us your thoughts on this approach and how you view it as a potential competitive threat to the GLP-1 market, as well as the DPP4s and SGLT2s?","On SGLT2 fixed combos, one of your competitors has stated that they view the approval of these as a significant inflection point for the acceleration of cost growth. I am just wondering how you are thinking about this opportunity and do you share this view?","And then finally, just on the basal insulin peglispro, I think I heard you say that the U.S. filing was going to be 1Q 2015 or earlier. What are the factors that could lead to an earlier filing? And how soon could this be? Thanks a lot.","Phil Johnson","Great. Colin, thank you very much for the questions, and those are all directed to Enrique Conterno. Enrique?","Enrique Conterno","Thanks. On oral GLP-1s, we have said that this is an area that is attractive and is an area where we very much looking at as well. I won't comment. I think your question is probably more appropriate for one of our competitors. When it comes to the fixed dose combination, if you are referring to the fixed dose communication between a GLP-1 and insulin, we clearly see the combination of a GLP-1 and insulin as important therapy.","We do believe with dulaglutide and our insulin portfolio, we can provide very significant value when it comes to providers and payors. We do believe that the restriction that is imposed by having a fixed dose combination in this particular case, in a certain way, takes away from the flexibility that endocrinologists want and need, given how insulin is titrated.","They are giving some indications here but I should also comment about the SGLT2s and DPP4 fixed-dose combination. We do believe this is an important product for us. Of course, we are developing this with Boehringer Ingelheim. We have submitted this in the U.S. and we believe we are significantly ahead of our competition. Today about 25% of the SGLT2 use is on top of a DPP$0. So that gives you a sense of the possibilities for overall class growth and branded growth and the impact that this fixed dose combination could have.","Finally, you asked about whether we could file earlier than Q1, basal insulin peglispro? That is a possibility, but at this stage, I think what we said is we would file by Q1. Clearly we are working on getting the readout for our Type I studies and we expect that we are going to be seeing this later this quarter, and we expect the press release together with that.","Phil Johnson","Great. Thank you, Enrique.","Colin Bristow - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Phil Johnson","You are welcome. Next caller please.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes to from the line of Jeff Holford with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Jeff Holford - Jefferies","Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I have got two questions around insulin glargine products. Just firstly, can you just give us a bit more color on why you have added the three mil cartridge to your filing? And does this potentially relate to being able to come to the market with a product such as the OptiClik device which Ypsomed had previously there to try and get around some of the Solostar patents?","And then secondly, can you just update us a bit more on your thoughts around timing of European launch and what kind of presentation the product would have, in terms of device or not? Thank you.","Phil Johnson","Great. Jeff, thank you for the questions. We will stay with Enrique.","Enrique Conterno","Sure. On insulin glargine, we have submitted two NDAs. You are right. One for prefilled pens and one for an insulin for cartridges. Clearly, those are two independent NDAs and we have been sued on each one of them. So that's all I will say, basically, at this stage, but we will be intending to, basically, oppose the patent expirations and resolving the ongoing litigation to be able to bring both of those to the market.","Your second question was related to Europe. Clearly the patent expiration for Lantus is in 2015. We are expecting tentative approval this year. So we are very much in our preparation, but that's as much as I can comment. Of course, we take very seriously the patents, but are in place and we will launch after those patents have expired.","Jeff Holford - Jefferies","Thanks very much.","Phil Johnson","You are very welcome. Toni, next caller, please.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Alex Arfaei with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Alex Arfaei - BMO Capital Markets","Good morning. Thank you for taking the questions. A question on ramucirumab for second line metastatic colorectal cancer. My understanding is that the Phase 3 trial, those patients could have been treated with Avastin first line. So how should we think about the process of this trial, given the similar mechanism of action and given the clinical profile we have seen with ramu so far? Thank you.","Phil Johnson","Thank you very much, Alex. Sue Mahony, please?","Sue Mahony","Yes, Alex, you are right. This is a second line trial after Avastin in first line. Clearly, we will wait and see what the data shows. We will have that data towards the end of this year and we will be announcing topline and then we will be planning to present it at a scientific meeting next year. So I think it's too early to speculate at this point. We will have to wait and see what the data shows us.","Phil Johnson","Okay, great. Thank you very much. Toni, next caller, please.","Operator","Okay. Your next question comes from the line of Marc Goodman with UBS. Please go ahead.","Marc Goodman - UBS","My first question is how are you thinking about the biologic psoriasis market? There's several players there. So are you thinking about your product being differentiated?","Second, there was a comment earlier on the call about an adjustment in the U.S. for managed Medicaid. How big was that adjustment? Can you just explain what happened there?","And then third, just on the insulin products. Any major changes in the quarter? Humalog, Humalin seemed to be bouncing around first quarter, second quarter quite a bit relative to what I would have thought the scripts were doing. So if you could just give us a sense of what's going on there? Thanks.","Phil Johnson","Absolutely happy to, Marc. Thanks for the questions. Dave Ricks, we will have you go and start with the biologic market with psoriasis. Derica, if you could comment please on the managed Medicaid situation. Enrique, for the U.S. insulin sales trends we have been seeing. Dave?","Dave Ricks","Yes. Thanks, Marc. As it relates to psoriasis treatment, we have seen our rapid growth of TNF use over the last decade in treating moderate to severe psoriasis and then more recently, of course, alternate mechanisms with Stelara which has been met with great success in the market. We believe IL-17s are another step forward in therapy for patients with moderate to severe psoriasis and you can see some of the Phase 2 and Phase 3 readouts from the three competitors, which are all neck and neck in the very last stages of testing here. The promise of the class is really to move the standard of what good is from a PASI 75 clearance to really something north of that, PASI 90 or total clearance which can now be possible for these patients who suffer from this difficult condition and we see IL-17s delivering PASI 100 or complete clearance substantially above both anti-TNFs and Stelara. So that's the value proposition for the class. Within the class, we of course have our own differentiation strategy, which includes of course efficacy. We will have to see the safety as it bears out and then dosing regimens which are all different between the various players. We have not disclosed or read-out our Phase 3 program and that will be coming soon in a topline fashion. So we will wait to say any more until when we see those data in a complete form, but we are bullish on the class.","Phil Johnson","Excellent, Dave. Thanks, Dave. Derica?","Derica Rice","Hi, Marc. As it relates to the U.S. and the managed Medicaid, this is really us, as we got additional receipts in from customers. We were able to true up the accruals and provisions on our book. Dollar wise, it's about $60 million, which in effect was about two percentage points of growth in the U.S. So just as a reminder, our U.S. overall sales was down about 30%. If you were to exclude the impact of the Cymbalta and Evista patent expirations, our growth was a positive 13%, which was about eight percentage points of price, five percentage points of volume. So of that eight percentage points of price, two percentage points of that was the managed Medicaid adjustment.","Phil Johnson","Excellent. Thank you, Derica. Enrique?","Enrique Conterno","Sure. Marc, you are correct. When we look at the underlying script growth for our insulin business in the U.S., Q1 and Q2 are very comparable but we do see you in terms of our reported sales, we were at minus 1% for Humalog in Q1 and we were 17% growth for Q2. So a big difference there. Let's remember that in Q1, we had a significant wholesaler destocking that impact in the growth rate. In the case of Humalog, that impact was 8 to 9 percentage points in Q1. So that that explains the part of the difference. In Q2, we just discussed managed Medicaid, in the case of Humalog, that impact was 4%.So those were we had, I guess, some very unique impacts to each one of those quarters.","Phil Johnson","Great. Thank you, Enrique. Toni, next caller, please.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Damien Conover with MorningStar. Please go ahead.","Damien Conover - MorningStar","Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Just a follow-up on the insulin franchise. Just had a question for the pricing power with Humulin. It looks like a very strong growth in the U.S. with price. I just kind of want to understand that in the context of the Express Scripts negotiations on getting on the formulary there, but still being able to drive some price. Wondering if that price is coming from customers outside that formulary? Or if that formulary still allows for some pricing power?","And then secondly, when you think about the renegotiations with the PBMs, and we are likely to see the formularies in August, I wanted to see if anything strategically has changed with the negotiations there after you have had a couple quarters here of a more aggressive negotiation that happened last year? Thank you.","Phil Johnson","Damien, thank you for the questions. Enrique Conterno.","Enrique Conterno","Sure. On Humulin, a big part of our human insulin franchise in the case of Humulin is that we have a very unique product in Humulin R U-500 which basically has significant growth on where the pricing pressures are not as high as with the rest of the insulin franchise, and you basically see some of that reflected in terms of both price and volume.","Your second question related to our ongoing discussions or negotiation with the PBMs and payors, I won't be able to share much on that front.","Phil Johnson","Okay, great. Damien, thanks for the questions. Toni, next caller, please?","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes form the line of Gregg Gilbert with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank","Thanks, and good morning. I wanted to go back briefly to the inversion subject. And for John and Derica, companies that have done inversions almost always claim that tax efficiency is a secondary sort of effect. So I would like to hear how you are and the Board is thinking, John, on this subject has evolved over the past year or so?","And sort of a nitpicky follow-up. Derica, you indicated that Lilly isn't considering or doesn't generally agree with large scale M&A for Lilly. But would a $20 billion to $30 billion deal, definitionally, be considered large scale M&A? Thanks.","Phil Johnson","Okay, great. Thank you very much for the questions. Welcome back to the fold. Wasn't expecting to hearing you on the call, but its great to hear your voice. Derica, for the inversion and the definition of large scale, please.","Derica Rice","Well, to me, $20 billion to $30 billion is a pretty large number. At least from my basic math class in Alabama.","Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank","So maybe the rest of the question is moved then?","Derica Rice","Again, even if we were preparing to through our series of patent expirations and there is a lot of speculation of other thoughts we needed to do to manage our way through this tough period in the history of Lilly and still clearly large-scale M&A was one of the options that was on the table. Again, as we looked at all the data, both looking at other transactions by other firms that historically there is that near-term benefit you can gain but longer-term, the core to this industry and we believe the core to our business as Lilly is, your ability to innovative and get new molecules out of your labs that create clinical differentiation. And so that's where we chose to focus and expend our energy. So when we think about business development transactions, ways that we can augment that innovative platform or footprint for us, we are absolutely interested in. Things that would begin to create a distraction and could begin to hamper or dampen our ability to produce new innovative research and development, are things that we are really quite not interested at the moment. And for us, it's been a combination of those smaller deal bolting on to our organic strategy and I see that being the path going forward.","John Lechleiter","Gregg, it's John Lechleiter. It's nice to hear from you. I think the only other comment I would make is, look, I think that the activity around inversions right now just points to a failure of our U.S. tax code and it really keeps American companies, not just Pharma industry, but across industries from being competitive with their overseas counterparts. We have been talking about tax reform. I think the first TV interview I gave when I became CEO in 2008, a big discussion was tax reform. We need a lower rate. We need a territorial system. We don't need Band-Aid approaches in between. It's time for the Congress to step up to the bar and get this thing done.","Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank","Thanks, gentlemen.","Phil Johnson","Thanks, Gregg. Thanks, John. Toni, next caller, please.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Mark Purcell with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Mark Purcell - Barclays","Yes. Thanks for taking my questions. Staying with diabetes, lots of questions. But I wondered, for clarification, for the glargine product in Europe, should I expect from some of the comments you made so far, to see this product launched in Europe in Q2 next year?","And then in terms of the SGLT\/DPP4 combo, actually you are about a year ahead. So again, heading in towards a Class 1 review, how confident you are of launching that product after the PDUFA early 2015?","Straying away from diabetes and thinking about your margin targets and where you are heading with a very broad pipeline. Some of these areas you are heading into are fairly crowded. There could be some serious battles in primary care and cholesterol. Obviously, there's some entrenched competition, increasing competition in the immunology space. So how do you consider going alone on some of these assets outside your core are for the moment versus partnering with players already in the space?","And then lastly, clearly some very rigorous management recession on R&D costs, as you mentioned several times on the call. Should we be more comfortable now towards the lower end of your guidance range for SG&A and R&D cost lines for the full year? Or are there phasing effect such as initiation of new R&D trials which we need to be alerted to at this point? Thanks a lot.","Phil Johnson","Great, Mark. Thank you for the questions. We will have Enrique take the questions on the insulin glargine in the European Union and then thoughts on the lunchtime for the SGLT2\/DPP4 combo and then for the going alone versus partnering, some of how we think about that given some of the investments required to compete in these marketplaces, Derica, if I would ask you to maybe make a comment based on these volunteer business in particular if you want to comments as well, please feel free to, and then Derica if you could comment on the lower end the guidance range we have got for SG&A and R&D and how we should be thinking about where we are tracking. Enrique?","Enrique Conterno","So when it comes to glargine in Europe, as I mentioned, we are expecting to launch after the patent expiration in Europe. I do not believe that I provided an expect date on that, but clearly we are undertaking all of the preparations so that we can do that. When it comes to the SGLT2\/DPP4 combination, the EMPA\/LINA fixed dose combination, we had shared that we have submitted that. We shared that early this year, which basically puts with an action date of early 2015.","Phil Johnson","Great. Thank you, Enrique. Derica?","Derica Rice","Mark, I will start with that the guidance in terms of operating expenses. I am not able to guide the investment community to one end or the other of the range. What I can say is we feel very good about meeting those goals that we established for the year and we feel very confident that we will be within the range that we provided.","As it relate to, I guess your earlier question also around, as we look at our portfolio, the good news is that we believe we produce an abundance of clinical opportunities in our pipeline and some of those are core areas and some of those are maybe outside or tangential. Clearly, we will be able to evaluate each of those molecules and decide which path we choose to pursue as we consider each one of those. But the good news is that we have optimality and Dave, I don't know if there is anything you would like to add to that.","Dave Ricks","Well, nothing more than, we always look, I think, almost every asset at options to partner, either to share risk if it's a critical stage asset or as the asset matures a trade value, sometimes by accessing reach, sometimes by capability or this other unique sort of portfolio fits or portfolio trade options that manifest themselves. So we are open-minded about all that but it has to make sense in terms of value creation and we are not going to talk about those in advance in this setting. But I think that's our mindset as it relates to partnering.","Phil Johnson","Excellent. Thanks, Dave. Toni, next caller please.","Operator","Thank you. And our last question comes -- disregard. They have disconnected. Thank you.","Phil Johnson","Okay, all right. Having exhausted the queue, I will turn it over to John to close our call today. John?","John Lechleiter","Okay, thanks, Phil. And I will be brief. To all those on the call, we appreciate your continued interest in Lilly. Our performance once again is in line with our expectations this quarter. We are on track to meet our 2014 financial goals and continued progress advancing the pipeline places us on track to return to growth and margin expansion post 2014. We believe our strategy is the right one for Lilly to create value for patients, for physicians, payors and of course our shareholders. And our ability to execute so far gives us increasing confidence that Lilly is indeed poised for growth. As always, you can expect we will keep you apprised of our progress. Thanks again.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this conference will be available for replay after 11:30 Eastern today.

And welcome to the Eli Lilly Q1 2017 Earnings Call. For the conference, all the participants are in a listen-only mode. There will be an opportunity for your questions. Instructions will be given at that time.","As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I'll turn the conference now over to your host, Mr. Dave Ricks. Please go ahead, sir.","David A. Ricks - Eli Lilly & Co.","Good morning. Thank you for joining Eli Lilly & Company's First Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. I'm Dave Ricks, Lilly's President and CEO. Joining me on today's call are Derica Rice, our Chief Financial Officer; Dr. Jan Lundberg, President of Lilly Research Labs; Enrique Conterno, President of Lilly Diabetes and Lilly USA.; Dr. Sue Mahoney, President of Lilly Oncology; Jeff Simmons, President of Elanco Animal Health; and I'd like to extend a special welcome to Christi Shaw, who joined us earlier this month as President of Lilly Bio-Medicines. We're also joined by Kristina Wright, Chris Ogden and Phil Johnson of the IR team.","During this conference call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors, including those listed on Slide three and as outlined in our latest Forms 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC. The information we provide about our products and pipelines is for the benefit of the investment community; it is not intended to be promotional and it is not sufficient for prescribing decisions.","Before discussing key events for the quarter, I'll start with a summary of our progress on our strategic objectives since our earnings call in January. Starting with grow revenue. Q1, we generated worldwide revenue growth of 7%, which was driven by 9% volume growth in our pharmaceutical business, led by our new products.","On our strategic objective of expand margins, our non-GAAP gross margin percent, excluding the effect of FX on international inventory sold, increased by nearly 220 basis points compared to Q1 2016. And total operating expenses as a percent of revenue also declined by nearly 220 basis points.","Under the heading of sustaining the flow of innovation, we launched baricitinib under the trade name Olumiant in Europe for rheumatoid arthritis. While here in the U.S., we were disappointed to receive the complete response letter from the FDA for baricitinib in RA. We remain confident the benefit-risk of baricitinib as a new treatment option for adults with moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis, and we will work with the FDA to determine a path forward to ultimately bring baricitinib to patients in the U.S. And as I'll discuss in more detail later, we had a positive Phase 3 read-out for abemaciclib, for Taltz and for Cyramza.","Finally, on deploying capital to create value, we completed the acquisition of CoLucid Pharmaceuticals, which adds lasmiditan for acute migraine to our late-stage pipeline. And we returned over $500 million to shareholders via our dividend. Our continued progress in 2017 keeps us on track to achieve our mid-term goals for each of our strategic objectives.","Now let's go to slide five for a more detailed review of the key events that occurred since our last earnings call. On the commercial front, here in the U.S. in collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim we launched Synjardy XR, a once-daily combination tablet containing empagliflozin and extended-release metformin for the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes. As I mentioned earlier, we launched Olumiant in Europe for the treatment of moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis, following European Commission approval earlier this year.","On the regulatory front, U.S. FDA issued a complete response letter for baricitinib for rheumatoid arthritis. The letter indicated that the FDA was unable to approve the application in its current form. Specifically, the FDA indicated that additional clinical data are needed to determine the most appropriate doses and to further characterize safety concerns. Lilly and Incyte disagree with the Agency's conclusion, and we look forward to meeting with the FDA in the coming months to determine appropriate next steps. We'll provide you status updates after we meet with the FDA.","Also here in the U.S., the FDA approved an update to the Trulicity label to include use in combination with basal insulin for adults with type 2 diabetes. And in Europe, along with Boehringer Ingelheim, we received European Commission approval of an update to the Synjardy label to include a change to the indication statement as well as data from the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial on the reduction of cardiovascular death.","On the clinical front, we announced that MONARCH 2 is a Phase 3 trial of abemaciclib in combination with fulvestrant in women with HR+ and HER2- breast cancer met its primary endpoint of improved progression-free survival. We look forward to presenting data from this study at ASCO in early June. And we'll hold a call the evening of Saturday, June 3 to discuss these results with the investment community.","Finally, we've decided to move the FDA submission of MONARCH 2 from the previously announced timing of Q3 up in to Q2. And just yesterday we announced that the MONARCH 3 study with abemaciclib met its primary endpoint at an interim analysis, demonstrating that women with HR+, HER2- advanced breast cancer who had not received prior systemic therapy experienced a statistically significant improvement in PFS with treatment with abemaciclib plus an aromatase inhibitor compared to placebo plus an aromatase inhibitor. The improvement was also shown in a key secondary endpoint of objective response rate. We intend to begin global regulatory submissions of these results in Q3 2017.","For the RAINFALL study of ramucirumab in first-line gastric cancer, the independent data monitoring committee recently met to review the primary analysis. While we remain blinded to the data, we're pleased to report that the IBMC stated that the study met its primary endpoint of improved progression-free survival. Consistent with our prior communications, our expectation remains that regulatory submissions could occur after we have the final overall survival data in 2018.","At the American Academy of Dermatology Meeting, we presented Phase 3 data showing that patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis treated with ixekizumab, or Taltz, demonstrated superior efficacy at 24 weeks compared to patients treated with Stelara. And along with Boehringer Ingelheim, we initiated two Phase 3 studies of Jardiance for the treatment of chronic heart failure. These trials will enroll patients with and without diabetes and with both preserved as well as reduced ejection fraction heart failure.","Moving to slide six. As I mentioned earlier in business development news, we completed the addition of CoLucid Pharmaceuticals. In other news, in Japan, the IP High Court ruled in our favor in the invalidation trials initiated by Sawai regarding our vitamin regimen patents for Alimta. If the patents are ultimately upheld through all the challenges, they could provide intellectual property protection for Alimta in Japan until June of 2021.","To support the increased demand for our products in our pipeline, we announced plans to invest $850 million in our U.S. operations in 2017, including research laboratories, manufacturing facilities and some administrative areas. We also distributed over $500 million to shareholders via the dividend.","Now I'll turn the call over to Phil for a discussion of our financial performance for the quarter.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Thanks, Dave. Slide seven summarizes our presentation of GAAP results and non-GAAP measures, while slide eight provides a summary of our GAAP results. I'll focus my comments on our non-GAAP adjusted measures to provide insights into underlying trends in our business, so please refer to today's earnings press release for a detailed description of the year-on-year changes in our first quarter GAAP results.","Looking at the non-GAAP measures on slide nine, you can see that Q1 2017 revenue increased 7% compared to Q1 2016, reaching $5.2 billion. Gross margin as a percent of revenue was 78.1%, an increase of 180 basis points over Q1 2016. The effect of foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold resulted in a benefit to both this year's and last year's quarter, with the benefit being slightly larger last year.","Excluding this FX effect, our gross margin percent increased by nearly 220 basis points, going from 74.9% in last year's quarter to 77.1% this quarter, driven by manufacturing efficiencies. Total operating expense increased 3% compared to Q1 of 2016. This increase is lower than the increase in revenue, leading total operating expense as a percent of revenue to decline by nearly 220 basis points, to 53.2%.","Looking at the component parts of total operating expense, marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased 5%, while R&D expenses increased just 1%. In marketing, selling and administrative expenses, higher spending to support new products is partially offset by lower spending on late lifecycle products.","Other income and expense was income of $50 million this quarter compared to $55 million reported in last year's quarter. Our tax rate was 21.2%, an increase of 3.3 percentage points compared to the same quarter last year. This increase was primarily due to the net discreet tax benefit of approximately $50 million in last year's Q1.","At the bottom line, net income and earnings per share both increased 18%. We achieved this significant earnings growth by delivering high-single digit volume-based revenue growth, while improving our gross margin percent and reducing our OpEx percent, creating positive leverage. Slide 10 provides a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS, and you'll find additional details on these adjustments on slide 22.","Now let's take a look at the effect of price, rate and volume on revenue growth. On slide 11 in the gray highlighted row at the bottom of the table, you'll see the 7% revenue growth I mentioned earlier. The effect of foreign exchange on revenue growth was minimal this quarter. Excluding the slight headwind from FX, our worldwide revenue growth on our performance basis was 8% and was driven entirely by volume.","By geography, you'll notice that U.S. pharma revenue increased 16%, driven primarily by volume. Trulicity was the main driver of U.S. volume growth, with meaningful contributions also coming from Taltz and Lartruvo.","The decline in European human pharmaceutical revenue of 5% was driven by the negative effect of price and unfavorable foreign exchange movements, partially offset by higher volume. On a constant currency or performance basis, European revenue decreased 1%. This performance decrease was driven primarily by Cymbalta and Alimta, partially offset by the uptake of new products, led by Trulicity.","In Japan, despite a large negative impact from the entry of generic Zyprexa last June, pharma revenue increased 5%. This increase was driven by a 6% benefit from higher volumes and, to a lesser extent, from a stronger yen, partially offset by a 4% negative price effect from last year's biannual price cuts.","On a constant-currency basis, Japan pharma revenue increased 3%. While excluding Zyprexa, Japan pharma revenue in Q1 grew 16% on a constant-currency basis, led by Cyramza, with meaningful contributions from Cymbalta and Trulicity.","Turning to our pharma revenue in the Rest of World, or RoW, revenue this quarter increased 2%, as volume growth of 7% was largely offset by lower prices and the negative effect of FX. On a performance basis, RoW revenue increased 4%, as growth in Humalog, Trulicity, Trajenta, Cyramza and Jardiance was partially offset by lower sales of Cymbalta, Alimta and Cialis.","Turning to Animal Health, this quarter worldwide revenue increased 2%, driven by higher volume for our acquisition of Boehringer Ingelheim Vetmedica's U.S. vaccine business. The effect of FX as well as price was minimal. Excluding the BI Vetmedica vaccines acquisition, the rest of our Animal Health revenue decreased 3%.","As we've done in recent quarters, let's now take a look at the drivers of our worldwide volume growth on slide 12. As I mentioned earlier, excluding FX, our worldwide revenue grew 8% this quarter, driven by an 8% increase in volume. In total, our new products comprised of Trulicity, Cyramza, Jardiance, Taltz, Basaglar, Lartruvo, Portrazza, and now Olumiant in the EU, were again engines of our worldwide volume growth. You can see that these products drove 10.1 percentage points of volume growth this quarter. Humalog contributed 50 basis points, Trajenta contributed 40 basis points and Animal Health, due to the BI Vetmedica U.S. vaccines acquisition, contributed 30 basis points of volume growth.","Lower Cialis volume provided a headwind of 90 basis points, primarily due to lower volume in the U.S. as a result of a decline in the overall ED market as well as increased use of off-label generic sildenafil. Alimta trimmed 1.1 percentage points from our volume growth, due primarily to competitive pressure in the U. S., while a loss of exclusivity for Zyprexa, Cymbalta and Evista provided a drag of 1.8 percentage points.","Now let me turn the call over to Derica.","Derica W. Rice - Eli Lilly & Co.","Thanks, Phil. As in prior quarters, I'll start by sharing some color on our new product launches. As you can see on the graph on slide 13, our new products generated over $800 million in revenue this quarter, led by Trulicity and Cyramza. This represents over 15% of our total worldwide revenue, up from 12% last quarter. And as Phil mentioned earlier, these products drove 10.1 percentage points of our worldwide volume growth this quarter.","Trulicity performance continues to be strong and is benefiting from the both growing market share and a rapidly expanding GLP-1 class. In the U.S., we're pleased that our new-to-brand share with endocrinologists, which we view as a key leading indicator, is comparable to Victoza. We've also recently expanded our efforts to reach primary care physicians and are encouraged by the early results.","Cyramza continues to grow globally, driven largely by Japan, where we're seeing strong adoption in gastric cancer and, more recently, have seen uptake in both lung and colorectal cancer. O-U.S. markets now account for nearly two-thirds of our worldwide Cyramza sales, and we look forward to continued O-U.S. growth. U.S. Cyramza sales declined this quarter, largely due to pressure from IO agents in non-small cell lung cancer.","Moving to Jardiance. In the U.S., we're pleased that our new-to-therapy share with both endocrinologists and primary care physicians has increased substantially since the FDA approval of the CV indication and the update to the ADA's diabetes treatment guideline. In absolute terms, Jardiance new-to-therapy volume has increased by 75% since we began active promotion of the new CV indication.","We continue to see rapid uptake of Taltz as well as continued strong growth of the IL-17A class in psoriasis. We're excited that our new-to-brand share of market with dermatologists, a proxy for use in psoriasis, exceeds that of Enbrel and Cosentyx.","On Basaglar, we launched here in the U.S. in mid-December and are seeing strong uptake early this year, largely driven by switching in high controlled PBM formularies. U.S. new-to-brand share of market is approaching Levemir and exceeds that both Tresiba and Toujeo.","In Q4, we also launched Lartruvo for soft tissue sarcoma in the U.S. and in early launch markets in Europe and this quarter have begun to launch in select rest of world countries. We're excited by initial physician feedback and the potential of this molecule to help patients with soft tissue sarcoma.","Finally, earlier this quarter, we launched Olumiant in Europe, with this quarter's sales representing initial stocking in Germany. We are pleased with the initial customer feedback and we see great potential for this molecule in Europe.","Moving to slide 14, you'll see that changes in foreign exchange rates had a modest effect on our Q1 2017 results. Growth in non-GAAP EPS was 18% including the effect of FX and 22% in constant currency terms.","Moving on to our pipeline update. Slide 15 shows our NME pipeline as of April 18. We had positive movement which included: the European approval of Olumiant, the addition of Lasmitidan for acute migraine treatment via our acquisition of CoLucid; initiation of human testing for our long-acting insulin; and termination of development of a Phase 1 diabetes asset.","In our NILEX pipeline on slide 16, you'll see the initiation in collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim of the Phase 3 heart failure program for empagliflozin as well as the initiation of Phase 2 work with abemaciclib in pancreatic cancer.","Now turning to slide 17. Let's recap the recent progress we've made on the key events we projected for 2017. Since our last call, we've added checkmarks for: the initiation of the EMPEROR studies of empagliflozin for heart failure in collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim; the positive PFS readout for the ramucirumab RAINFALL trial; the U.S. submission of ixekizumab for psoriatic arthritis; the EU approval of baricitinib for rheumatoid arthritis; the closing of the CoLucid acquisition; and the favorable Japanese Supreme Court ruling upholding our Alimta IP.","We've also added a red checkmark for the FDA's complete response letter for baricitinib. You will also see that we've moved the MONARCH-3 data readout from the internal readouts to the external disclosure section based on the positive interim analysis that will allow us to present the data at a medical meeting in the second half of the year.","We've also added potential key events for the global regulatory submissions of the abemaciclib MONARCH-3 data, the readout and likely presentation at a medical meeting later this year for the second Phase 3 trial of lasmiditan, and for the potential FDA action on the SBLA for ixekizumab for psoriatic arthritis.","Turning to our 2017 financial guidance on slide 18. Our expectations for 2017 are largely unchanged from our last update in late January. You'll see that our non-GAAP line item guidance remains the same. However, we have adjusted our GAAP EPS guidance, primarily due to the global severance charges related to actions to improve our cost structure.","Before we go to the Q&A session, let me briefly sum up. 2017 is off to a strong start. Led by our new products, worldwide revenue grew 7%. By driving improvements in our cost structure, we leveraged that top-line growth into 18% non-GAAP EPS growth, or 22% growth when excluding FX.","While we're disappointed with the delay of baricitinib here in the U.S., we continue to have strong momentum behind our innovation-based strategy. Since our last earnings call, we've launched Olumiant in Europe and had positive Phase 3 readouts for abemaciclib, Taltz and Cyramza. We also closed the CoLucid acquisition, bolstering our Phase 3 pipeline with the addition of lasmiditan.","Going forward, our management team will remain focused on: launching new products with excellence, reloading our late-stage pipeline, driving increased productivity to expand our operating margins, and investing in the core drivers of our business \u2013 talent, scientific capabilities and technology platforms to ensure our future growth prospects.","Now, this concludes our prepared remarks. I'll turn the call over to Phil to moderate the Q&A session. Phil?","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Thanks, Derica. We would like to take as many questions from callers as we can. So I would ask that you limit your questions to two or a single two-part question. And we thank you in advance for collaborating with this request.","John, if you could go ahead and provide the instructions for the Q&A session, and then we're ready for the first caller.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. And first we'll go to Tim Anderson with Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Timothy Minton Anderson - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Yes. Hi.","Operator","Tim Anderson, do you have a question?","Timothy Minton Anderson - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Yes. Sorry about that. My question is on abemaciclib and your latest thinking about the ability to show that your drug is more efficacious than palbo. Because your pivotal trial didn't have Palbo as a comparator, any efficacy comparisons can really only be made on the side-by-side basis. And naturally, that has certain limitations. So assume that the difference in abema would have to be quite big to really be perceived as a better product. I this something that you think is achievable? I'd like to your latest thinking on that.","And then a payer question. If you could just talk about payer trends and rebating trends in SGLT2 category. If you addressed that earlier, I was on another call so I apologize. And on Cyramza, any additional color on, you I think mentioned U.S. pricing erosion, which is unusual with a medical benefit drug in the U.S.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Okay, Tim, thank you for the questions. So, Sue, if you'll handle the first question that he had on abemaciclib and then the third one on Cyramza. Enrique, if you'd like to comment on the SGLT2 pricing.","Susan Mahony - Eli Lilly & Co.","Hi, Tim. Thanks for the question on abemaciclib. As you say, there are no comparative studies of the CDK-4 and 6 inhibitors. We believe that it's going to be important that we look at the totality of the data across multiple trials as we look at these agents. I think I've been consistently saying that we believe that we could have a best-in-class CDK-4 and 6 inhibitor. And I continue to believe that based on the attributes of the molecule as well as, as we say, look at the consistency of data across multiple trials. And that hopefully we will read out two of them this year and we will have others coming in the future.","While I say that, well, as we'll mentioned before, this molecule selectively inhibits CDK-4 versus CDK-6. It's actually 14 times more potent on CDK-4 than CDK-6. It has the ability to cross the blood-brain barrier and we have seen therapeutic levels on brain tissue. The continuous dosing we believe is important for a self-cycling inhibitor, and not just from an efficacy perspective, but also from a convenience perspective of patients.","And we have seen in our previous trials and have consistent results that the diarrhea, which is the main side effect, is manageable and actually is transient. So we now have our MONARCH-1 trial in our refractory patients. We have had multiple treatments and have seen in that trial single-agent activity with this agent.","We now have two positive Phase 3 trials with the patients on our second-line MONARCH-2 trial, which had a (26:03) therapy. And we're looking forward to presenting that data at ASCO and also hopefully publishing that data this year, too.","And, of course, yesterday we announced the MONARCH-3 first-line study against the aromatase inhibitors, where we saw at the interim and we mentioned previously that we had high bar interim. We saw that at the interim we achieved our PFS endpoint, which is the primary endpoint, as well as a secondary endpoint of overall response rate. And so we're excited as we look at the whole molecule here. And we encourage you to see the data in the future to look at the totality of the data across all the trials.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","On the Cyramza.","Susan Mahony - Eli Lilly & Co.","Cyramza. With regards to Cyramza, yeah, as we're looking at Cyramza performance in the U.S., Tim, we continue to see challenges in the lung cancer market, mainly due to ILs. And so we've essentially seen sort of flat to declining sales in the U.S. over the last few quarters, which, of course, is the complete opposite to Japan, where we're seeing phenomenal sales.","Our focus in the U.S., it's really a gross to net adjustment that you mentioned there, so I wouldn't read too much into the pricing. Our focus is to continue to ensure that we have uptake in gastric cancer, which is a very differentiated market. A lot of doctors who treat gastric cancer in the U.S. treat one patient a year. And so really getting to them on time to ensure that they know to use Cyramza in the appropriate patient is our focus on gastric cancer.","And in lung cancer, as people are getting used to knowing where to use the ILs in second-line and then if they move to front-line, we're being clear on the patient that we believe can benefit from Cyramza.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Great. Just to complement Sue's answer, on that gross to net adjustment, it was essentially a benefit that was recognized. We trued up the estimates for rebates and discounts in Q1 of 2016. It's leading to the negative year-on-year compare. So nothing unusual that we're seeing in the actual contracting or pricing for the product.","Enrique?","Timothy Minton Anderson - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Enrique A. Conterno - Eli Lilly & Co.","So the SGLT2 class, similar to other diabetes classes, is highly managed from a formulary perspective. We are in a unique position given the data and the label that we basically have with Jardiance. And as I have previously shared, even prior to us getting the label, our formulary positioning was very strong.","So just to give a sense, we have nearly 90% access on commercial plans and about 70% in Part D. And we showed that's a very strong position for us. The issue with the 2 class for the most part is being contracted as one of two type contracts, so these are not sole exclusive contracts. We, of course, we're advocates for open access and, at this point in time, we are excited about the early trends that we're seeing for our products.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Great. Thanks, Enrique. John, if we can go to the next caller please.","Operator","And that would be Seamus Fernandez with Leerink. Please go ahead. Mr. Fernandez, your line is open, if you have a question.","Seamus Fernandez - Leerink Partners LLC","Sorry. I was on mute. Thanks for taking the questions. Just a couple of quick ones. First, on abemaciclib, can you guys talk a little bit about what you think is a differentiated response rate in the setting, whether it be for MONARCH-3? Again, my understanding is that we're seeing in combination with aromatase inhibitors response rates between 52% and 55%. So it seems like the response rate dynamic is something that you're focusing in on. Love to just better understand what you see as a uniquely meaningful response rate, or if you're really just focused on the monotherapy response rate that you see with abemaciclib and we already knew.","The second question. When I look at the revenue that was generated relative to the scripts for Basaglar, it certainly came in a bit below our expectations. Just trying to get a better sense of what the dynamics are in that market, in particular, that would have the revenue come in below those expectations. And that's also factoring in the stocking that occurred in the fourth quarter, so I don't see that as a full explanation.","And then lastly, in terms of the dynamics with baricitinib, some of the questions that we get from investors are the reasons why Lilly chose to incorporate the language in the press release with regard to its disagreement with the Agency. That seems to imply that Lilly will pursue all avenues before being forced to do additional clinical studies. So just trying to get a better sense of why you chose to incorporate that language into the press release. Thanks so much.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Okay, Seamus. Thanks for the questions. So, Sue, we'll start with you for abemaciclib, then the question on overall response rate, Enrique for Basaglar revenue here in the U.S. relative to scripts. And then, Christi, your first question on baricitinib and the language we had in the press release. Sue?","Susan Mahony - Eli Lilly & Co.","Yeah. Thanks, Seamus, for the question. I think, again, I'll back to I think it's going to be really important when we look at the totality of the data as we look at the trials across multiple trials with the CDK4 and 6 inhibitors and we look at the magnitude and the depth of response, which is a key secondary endpoint that we had in our studies as well as, as we said, the PFS and the totality of the data.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Enrique?","Enrique A. Conterno - Eli Lilly & Co.","So, Seamus, as I look at it, destocking does in our view basically explain the difference. Revenue for us and given the script level is basically tracking as we had expected. I think it's important as we look at this product, we are clearly right now north of 20% when it comes to NBRx share.","Importantly, a big part of that is driven by switches, as we've seen different payers take or choose Basaglar as an exclusive option. But I think what we're also encouraged is when we look at basically new patients to a basal insulin, we also see our share basically improving. We're now at 7% on that specific metric.","So we are very encouraged for what we see. And at this point in time, we do think that the revenue and scripts are aligned based on what we had expected.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","All right. Thank you, Enrique. Christi?","Christi Shaw - Eli Lilly & Co.","Hi. Yes. Thanks for the question. I think what you read is exactly right regarding bari. We continue to believe in the risk-benefit profile of baricitinib at the four and two milligram. And what we need to do next is really get with FDA and understand specifically what their concerns are.","So the answer is, yes, we disagree. But we want to meet with them and make sure that we understand completely and see if we can find a path forward quickly to allow patients that are suffering access to baricitinib.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Great. Thanks, Christi. And before we go to the next caller, Seamus, I believe the numbers that you're citing for overall response rate are, in fact, for those patients with measurable disease. Just to highlight that when you see data from our trials, make sure that you're looking at a similar patient population and cut of the data.","John, if we can go to the next caller, please?","Operator","That will be Gregg Gilbert with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks, team. One two-parter here. First, when you announced the bari delay, you reiterated your 5% revenue growth goal. My question is, since it will be harder to get there without bari and assuming that doesn't show up in that timeframe, what are the caveats that you would offer in terms of reaching that goal without bari other than the Alimta caveat you've mentioned before? So hoping for a little bit more granularity underpinning your confidence in achieving that.","And secondly, on Animal Health, can you go a little bit deeper into the trends in the quarter, perhaps with and without acquisition? And, Jeff, any sort of headwinds\/tailwinds you'd want us to understand in the quarter and as it relates for the rest of the year for your business? Thanks.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Gregg, thank you for the questions. Derica, we'll start out with you for the long-term growth question. And over to you, Jeff, for the Animal Health question. Derica?","Derica W. Rice - Eli Lilly & Co.","Good morning, Gregg. And thanks for your question. As it relates to the mid-term guidance of achieving a minimum of 5% on average revenue growth between 2016 and the end of the decade, there are no new additional caveats that I can offer, Gregg. We feel as confident about achieving that goal today as we did when we put that guidance out last year in July.","Recall that we've always said that the growth prospects for Lilly did not reside or rest on a single asset. It really is about the strength across the portfolio of opportunities that we talked about. And up to now, we launched seven new products, and eight if you include Olumiant in Europe. So we feel very good about our growth prospects going forward. And we factored in that we may not always have 100% success across each molecule. But in aggregate, we are very confident we can achieve that minimum 5% goal.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Great. Thanks, Derica. Jeff?","Jeffrey N. Simmons - Eli Lilly & Co.","Yes, Gregg, on Animal Health, a few comments. First of all, as we signaled earlier this year, and as Q1 indicates, we anticipate growth for the year will be back-half loaded. This is due to some one-time events in Q1 as well as our SAP 2016 implementation, which will impact Q2.","As such, though, although Q1 was a little lighter than expected, we anticipate improving growth trends later this year. What will drive that, Gregg, is really few things. First of all, launches. We're seeing good uptake initially here with Galliprant, our deal with Aratana, as well as we got some launches in aquaculture. Secondly, is companion animals, some share shift, and then on the food animal side, vaccines. So that will be the drivers of our second half return to growth.","We continue to be excited about the BI acquisition, and that's progressing well. I also would say, finally, we continue to progress our strategic agenda, focusing on our key growth engines, which we've talked a lot about in vaccines, nutritionals and companion animal therapeutics. The integration of BI, again, is going well and that's on track. And we've completed the scale of our Dundee, Scotland manufacturing site to Argenta as part of our broader manufacturing agenda.","So overall industry, I think the things to watch, I think the fundamentals for the medium and long term are still strong with the trends with durable brands. I think the things to watch, innovation is representing an increasing amount of growth and becoming increasingly important. We're not seeing, for instance, in food animal as much innovation so that segment has not grown as much. And I think in the slower growth segments we're seeing, of course, increasing competitive pressures. So those are some things I think to watch going forward.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Thanks, Jeff.","Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","We can go to our next caller, please.","Operator","And we'll go to Andrew Baum with Citi. Please go ahead.","Andrew S. Baum - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","Thank you. A couple of questions. You obviously showed some very significant improvement in your gross margin during the quarter, (38:12) manufacturing efficiencies. Could you just separate out mix versus manufacturing? And then within manufacturing, procurement yield and so on to help us understand how far those will go here?","And then second, on Jardiance. Could you just outline the rate limiting steps for this product, both in terms of class awareness and obviously the pending CANVAS data to grow the awareness of the class? And then secondly, in terms of education of physicians, the potential advantages, what can be done by you in order to break down barriers to accelerate uptake?","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Andrew, thank you for the questions. Derica, we'll go to you for the question on the gross margin percent and then Enrique for the Jardiance questions. Derica?","Derica W. Rice - Eli Lilly & Co.","Hi, Andrew. And this question I really have to give kudos to our manufacturing team. The gross margin improvement is really driven by lowering our per unit cost. It's not due to mix effect and that means that it should be sustainable going forward.","Do recall also that in the second half of the year, you're going to see negative pressure on our gross margins because we began to feel the impact of the next round of patent expiries. So we will have lost Strattera and Effient in the U.S. So that's what brings down the drag that we expect in the second half. But, again, what's helping us to weather that is by the manufacturing team absolutely reducing our per unit costs.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Thanks, Derica. Enrique?","Enrique A. Conterno - Eli Lilly & Co.","Sure. Let me first provide a little bit of color on Jardiance and what we're seeing since the launch of our cardiovascular indication. As you know, we received that indication in December and we launched in mid-January.","Since we've launched that indication, we have seen a significant inflection on new patient starts for Jardiance. So just in three months, we've seen a 70%, 70%, increase on new patient starts. That class overall has grown about 30%, which has driven now the class to basically reaccelerate when it comes to new patient starts. The class was actually quite flat before this indication. As we look at the four-week growth versus the previous year, we're now at 16%. So we are encouraged in terms of what we're seeing with Jardiance.","Now, clearly, we are in a certain way, it is a paradigm shift when it comes to treating diabetes, in particular, the risk of death for people with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease. And, for us, therefore, peer-to-peer is hugely important. That's something that we've been quite focused on. We are very excited by our level of activity and interest and attendance to these peer-to-peer sessions. But all-in-all, we are pleased with our progress and we expect more.","There are lots of questions when it comes to the outcomes from Canvas. We basically see, maybe, generally, three types of outcomes. Let me just outline them. But, clearly, if outcomes were to be a negative, a neutral trial when it comes to CV, that probably would be the worst outcome for us. We clearly believe that our data is highly compelling. But, clearly, we could benefit from that tailwind of having another SGLT2 basically have this similar data.","If their data is positive but is not as positive as ours, that's probably the best-case scenario for us. But it's also quite positive if their data looks similar to us. We clearly have a lot of momentum with our product, so we are hoping that they have a positive trial and are waiting to see what the results are.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Great. Thank you, Enrique. John, if we can go to the next caller, please?","Operator","And we'll go to John Boris, SunTrust. Please go ahead.","John T. Boris - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thanks for taking the questions. In light of the successful launch of Basaglar across your diabetes franchise, strategically is this a consideration to partner with other companies for biosimilars across possibly oncology or possibly across your immunology franchise with a product like Humira?","Second question on productivity gains. For Derica, what have you learned about YZ that makes you confident as you prepare for another loss of exclusivity in 2018 for Cialis that you're prepared to navigate through that? And any qualitative commentary you can give on the consensus earnings growth of 7% in 2018? I know you haven't given guidance there, but certainly a topical question.","And then lastly, on Jardiance. Certainly the product had some pretty significant renal benefits. Are you doing anything with the Agency to further quantify the benefits for the Agency to possibly go back to them to try and secure that within the label of Jardiance? Thanks.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Thanks, John. Thank you for the questions. We'll go to Dave for the question on our interest in moving more into biosimilars, Derica for the productivity question, what we learned in YZ that can help for next year with 2018. And then Enrique for the Jardiance renal question. Dave?","David A. Ricks - Eli Lilly & Co.","Thanks. Thanks, John. Well, I think we've addressed this question before, but just to reiterate. Basaglar is a great fit for us because we already have an asset base to make the product, we have a commercial investment that can sell the product and we have devices that are world-class that the product goes in. So it's really a drop-in to a broader insulin play and rounds out an important part of the portfolio we weren't participating in, which is the innovative basal segment, which is obviously a big segment of the diabetes market.","But our core strategy in diabetes is to innovate above and beyond the benefits of glargine in basal insulin as it is all other therapies. And that's really the same as our other therapy areas, oncology, immunology. Our main focus is on innovation to beat the standard of care today for something better for patients.","If those same dynamics played out for a TNF biosimilar or something else, sure, we'd look at it. When you can get a lot of leverage financially and it tucks into your portfolio, that can make good sense. But we don't have a broad-based division associated with biosimilars work. We're not pursuing that at this moment.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Great. Thanks, Dave. Derica?","Derica W. Rice - Eli Lilly & Co.","Hi, John. With regards to learnings from our YZ experience, the biggest difference is the fact that with this next wave of patent expiries we are able to offset that with new product launches. When we launched our four largest products during that YZ period, we did not have any new product launches during that period. So the real key is having new product launches.","And then that's really contingent on our ability to sustain the flow of R&D output. So you'll see we're very committed to that. And that's why you saw us announce the CoLucid deal earlier this quarter, which is, again, another increased effort in bolstering our late-phase pipeline.","And then the third learning is just having a sustained productivity agenda. That's why we came out in 2015 in saying, hey \u2013 or actually in 2012, we believe we can get to that 50% water mark in 2018 in terms of OpEx as a percent of revenue. We said that we can improve our gross margins between 2015 and 2020. And while we set the 50% water mark for 2018, we're not resting on our laurels thinking that's the end of the journey. We think we can improve beyond that. We just haven't put those statements out there at this point in time.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Great. Thanks, Derica. Enrique?","Enrique A. Conterno - Eli Lilly & Co.","So, clearly, the renal data for Jardiance is quite encouraging. As we had a number of discussions with the regulatory authorities, it is pretty clear that for us to be able to make a claim, it is quite likely that we will need to do an additional trial.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Thanks, Enrique. John, if we could go to next caller, please?","Operator","And that will be Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Just a few questions. This is to Dave and Derica. Is it safe to assume that in reiterating your medium-term guidance out to 2020 that you do ascribe some value to baricitinib? Or, Derica, you also just said that Lilly's not dependent on any one single product but a portfolio of products. So if you could clarify that.","Secondly, just curious to know your plans for baricitinib in the other indications such as AD, lupus, psoriatic arthritis. I know those are studies that are still early, Phase 2. Are those indications on hold until pending positive resolution on RA, or is it possible that you would go ahead with those plans? Is there a scenario where you decide not to go further with that RA if FDA is requiring large trials that would be expensive and might mean being no longer the first and best-in-class drug on the market?","And then just lastly, Dave, solanezumab, unfortunately, that was a very expensive setback, but that happens. Now we have the baricitinib setback. At what point can you justify to yourself a much more substantial restructuring initiative that really focuses on the company's cost structure?","Yes, we acknowledge this quarter we did see good operating margin improvement. But going out and looking at where Lilly's margins are today relative to the industry average, you've got a long way to go to reach parity. So just wondering if you could share your thoughts on that and at what point you actually start to get more aggressive on the margin side. Thanks very much.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Great, Jami. Thanks for your questions. So we'll have Derica address the medium-term outlook as it relates to baricitinib and clarify our thoughts there. And then, Christi, we'll have you talk about further indications for baricitinib. And then, Dave, the question we got on the longer-term outlook. Derica?","Derica W. Rice - Eli Lilly & Co.","Hi, Jami. In regard to our mid-term guidance and the relevance of bari in the U.S., absolutely we are planning for success of that molecule. And we have not given up on the prospect of that opportunity. So as Christi said earlier, we're looking forward to engaging with the FDA and we'll work diligently to try to find a pathway forward to bring that molecule to patients here in the U.S.","That being said, that guidance that we put out there around the 5%, that's what we believe to be the minimum performance that we thought we could achieve. What we didn't do is provide what we thought was the maximum what we could achieve.","Even taking into account the impact of bari, we still believe we could stay above that 5% minimum goal that we established in terms of average growth between 2015 and 2020. So, again, our confidence is still very high in our ability to achieve that objective.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Thanks, Derica. Christi?","Christi Shaw - Eli Lilly & Co.","Sure. So, the first question I'll take is the one on rheumatoid arthritis. We have not contemplated a scenario in which we will not pursue baricitinib for rheumatoid arthritis. We continue to believe, as I said, in the safety benefit-risk profile.","Of note I think it's important to say that the submission that we had in Europe was exactly the same as that we had in the United States. And we stand behind the European decision and the label that they granted.","As we look at other studies and clinical studies, we actually are continuing those. Obviously, we'll take into account our discussions with the FDA. But we are looking at continuing those studies and starting a Phase 3 trial in psoriatic arthritis by the end of this year.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Thanks, Christi. And, Dave?","David A. Ricks - Eli Lilly & Co.","Yeah. Sure. Thanks. I think, Jami, your question is, if I heard it right, is would we undertake some very large cost restructuring programs and sort of make a one-time move in operating margins.","Right now, under the scenario we see and per the discussion we also had with Derica today, we see a continuous top-line revenue growth driven by new products. And the kind of performance we put up in Q1, if we just compound that out I think will yield impressive margin gains.","Reminding people 7% top line, 3% cost curve, yielding 18% income growth. I think if we compound that over the next several years, you'll be (51:50) top-tier financial performance out of Lilly. Ad that's where we're focused on rather than try to have some disruptive event that would perhaps set us back in terms of revenue growth and our R&D productivity.","So right now that's what we're focused on. Of course, we have scenarios, as Derica described, that have different mixes of products that get us to that 5% average top line, some that get us well above it. We're very comfortable with that guidance now.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Just to be clear, Dave, the improvement in operating margin is highly dependent on top-line growth and top-line mix as opposed to any cuts to operating expenses?","David A. Ricks - Eli Lilly & Co.","Yeah. It's primarily based on a topline growth, that's right. If you do the math, there are targeted cost reductions, which have been and we'll continue to undertake, to reshape the company and make it as competitive as it needs to be as well as service the R&D engine as well us the launches that are underway.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","You're welcome. John, if we can go to the next caller, please?","Operator","And we'll go to Steve Scala with Cowen. Please go ahead.","Steve Scala - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you. A few questions. First on Jardiance. Would you speak specifically to the disconnect between revenue and scripts in Q1? I'm not sure that was fully explained.","Secondly, I appreciate that you have not met with FDA yet on baricitinib. But based solely on what's in the CRL and Lilly's interpretation of it, when would Lilly be in a position to answer FDA questions? Would that be a 2017 event or a 2018 event?","And then lastly, would you elaborate on the dynamics around the JUNIPER trial of abemaciclib in lung cancer? The primary completion has moved a couple times now. One interpretation could be that Lilly is cutting its losses and giving up. But maybe you can clarify. Thank you.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Thank you for the questions. So, Enrique, over to you for the Jardiance question on the disconnect between TRx and revenue. Christi, for the question on the baricitinib complete response letter. And over to Sue for the JUNIPER study with abemaciclib for lung cancer. Enrique?","Enrique A. Conterno - Eli Lilly & Co.","Well, we don't think there's a disconnect between TRx and revenue. The quarter for Jardiance was pretty clean, so we didn't have changes in estimates when it comes to rebates and discounts. Let's recall, and of course, in the case of Jardiance, we share 50\/50 the gross margin for the product with BI the way basically what we book as revenue. And right now I think it's fair to say that the current revenue basically is a good reflection of the underlying scripts.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Great. Thanks, Enrique. Christi?","Christi Shaw - Eli Lilly & Co.","Yeah. In terms of the bari timing, it's really, we can't give you an estimate on whether it's this year or next year until we meet with the FDA, which we are hoping we will do within the next 60 days.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Christi, thank you very much. Sue?","Susan Mahony - Eli Lilly & Co.","Yeah. With regards to the JUNIPER study, we are continuing with that study and very interested in the role of CDK4 and CDK6 in KRAS mutation-positive lung cancer. We have made some changes to the study to ensure enrollment and to ensure that it hits the high bar given the changes that we've seen in FDA guidance and labeling on erlotinib, but we continue that study and are actively enrolling it.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Great. Thank you, Sue. John, next caller, please.","Operator","And we'll go to Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Christopher Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks very much. Just had two questions here, both on diabetes. Maybe first on Humalog. With biosimilars coming to market in 2018, 2019, can you really compare and contrast some of the dynamics of the rapid-acting market versus what we're just seeing right now with the basal market where you've launched Basaglar and it's done very well from a share perspective?","And the second question was more broadly just discussing longer-term, your latest longer-term views on diabetes pricing. There seems to be concerns about a market that's been in flux over the past few years. Lilly has obviously benefited from its broader portfolio, but your competitors have struggled. So, of course, just longer term, do you see the pricing dynamics continuing to erode or even get worse? Or could we see dynamics stabilize a bit here as we've gone through at least a few of these categories pretty aggressive price competition? Does that at some point stabilize, or are you preparing for an environment where things continue to be challenging? Thanks very much.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Thank you, Chris, for the questions. Enrique, they're both for you.","Enrique A. Conterno - Eli Lilly & Co.","Sure. So the first question is an interesting one because, clearly, we are on both sides of that equation. So you can imagine, we're going to take all the learnings of the launch of Basaglar as we think about how do we ensure that we protect our Humalog franchise. It is fair to say that Humalog has slightly different make up in terms of \u2013 we think of the product, as you know, it's not just rapid-acting, but it's also the mixtures, which are about 30% of volume.","Clearly, we do have a strong position when it comes to payers. And importantly, the contracting already is on exclusive status for really meal-time insulins across all of the major plans. That is different from the type of contracting when it comes to basal insulins where basically we had a number of products in formulary. So any time that you basically narrow the formulary, there's an opportunity for a payer to have an economic benefit from a larger rebate.","So the dynamics are a little bit different. We clearly are preparing and thinking through that. And I won't be able to comment more on that. But I do think that our position with Humalog is quite strong.","When it comes to diabetes pricing, what we basically see is a continuation of the current trends. So we don't see significant step changes. We basically see at this point in time different classes are in different stages. As I just mentioned, meal time insulins, we are basically \u2013 all major plans have made a one-on-one exclusive-type decision when it comes to a meal time insulin. But SGLT2s, there's one of two status for most plans. GLP-1s is something similar. So we basically see is a continuation of trends rather than a step change.","Clearly, we are pretty well positioned given the breadth of our portfolio and really strong share and momentum that we have with our product, which is key as different payers make the formulary decisions.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Great. Thank you, Enrique. John, if we can go to the next caller, please?","Operator","We'll go to Geoff Meacham with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Geoff Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, guys. Good morning and thanks for taking the question. On Taltz, I wonder if you can talk about the new-to-brand share trends in the U.S., say, over the past six months. Are there many plans that you're still have don't have formulary status in? And then in Europe, can you speak to countries that you expect to come on board fully for this calendar year?","And then on baricitinib. I know it's hard to say, but were extension studies for all the pivotals part of the filing? I'm just trying to figure out what data haven't yet been submitted or analysis not yet done that you could add that would be new to the CRL. Thanks.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Great, Geoff. Thank you very much. Christi, if you want to take the first question on the Taltz new-to-brand trends. And feel free if you want to try the second question, we're happy to help with that one as well.","Christi Shaw - Eli Lilly & Co.","Sure. So, coming new to Lilly, obviously the data we saw in Taltz in these studies plays out in the marketplace. It's really remarkable, the PASI 100 data and how physicians are seeing the benefits play out with patients in their offices. And that's what's really leading to the NBRx share gains and growth. The growth continues. As you probably know, we passed Enbrel early last year. We passed Cosentyx later in the year.","We continue to believe that the IL-17s are the best-in-class and a huge market opportunity for us as we close the NBRx share on Stelara. And that, in spite of not having a lot of formulary access with all of the payers. So we continue to work on that. So, yes, there is opportunity to grow in that area.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","In terms of the data that was submitted, Geoff. So there were data obviously from the four pivotal studies as well as from data (1:01:05) over the course of the review from the extension study. There is additional data that we have generated in the extension study that we have not submitted to the FDA.","As Christi talked about earlier, we'll look forward to meeting with the FDA here in the next 60 days or so to see if any of the additional data that we have could be helpful to them in their consideration of the safety concerns that they raise in the complete response letter.","John, if we can go to the next caller, please?","Operator","Sure. We'll go to Tony Butler with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.","Tony Butler - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Yes. Thanks very much and good morning. Two brief questions. Sue, Cyramza in Japan has been perhaps the better geographic growth driver for the product. However, in quarter-over-quarter, it does look as if it had peaked in Q4. And I'm curious if that is, in fact, the case being down in Q1?","And, Enrique, again, back to I guess back to Steve Scala's question on Jardiance. Also, or similarly, the Q4 to Q1, at least Lilly's share of the growth profit is effectively flat and slightly down. Is it because demand is in a lower revenue-generating channel, for example, perhaps more Medicaid patients are being prescribed your product that maybe those from managed care? Thanks very much.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Great. Tony, thanks for the question. Sue for the Cyramza Japan question and then Enrique for the Jardiance follow up.","Susan Mahony - Eli Lilly & Co.","Hi, Tony. Thanks very much for the question on Cyramza in Japan. You're right, it is going very well in Japan. The quarter-on-quarter is just the timing. If you look at last year, you would have seen the same dynamics. What we are continuing to see is strong growth of Cyramza in Japan. And the gastric cancer indication right now has a market share of 57%. In fact, I think Cyramza is one of the most successful oncology launches now in Japan.","We also are now seeing uptake in both the lung and the colorectal cancer indications. There's quite a high level \u2013 as you know, the prevalence in Japan of gastric cancer is a lot higher than the U.S. and we are seeing a lot of overlap between uses of Cyramza in gastric cancer and those that treat colorectal cancer. And so we see a good opportunity for uptake in that indication, too. We're currently seeing that and also in lung. So we feel very good about the continued uptake of Cyramza in Japan.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Thank you, Sue. Enrique?","Enrique A. Conterno - Eli Lilly & Co.","Yeah, there's really not an issue when it comes, Tony, to segment mix. We had in Q4 of 2016 a positive benefit, roughly about $15 million worth of Lilly revenue due to changes in the estimates of rebates, discounts and co-pay cards. So that's basically why that comparison doesn't follow the script trend.","If anything, we should see basically improved pricing when it comes to Jardiance just because we made some changes to our co-pay cards. So we are going to be less reliant on them as time goes through. So that should basically give us some benefit over time when it comes to the nebulized prices that we see.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Thank you, Enrique. John, if we can go to the next caller?","Operator","And that will be David Risinger with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. David, your line is open, if you're on mute maybe?","David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yes, I'm restrained, as many of my peers. And instead, Phil, I'll follow your instructions and ask two questions. First, Dave, could you please discuss near-term M&A opportunities to acquire small biotech companies with new launch prospects in order to enhance your new launch pipeline flow late decade?","And then second, Enrique, I was actually surprised with Jardiance that, given its extraordinary cardiovascular benefit, which is actually better than many drugs that are solely approved for cardiovascular disease, I would have thought that Lilly would have gone to payers and said to payers, we need to reduce our rebate payments to you. Obviously, from an ethical standpoint, Jardiance has to be tier two irrespective of rebates. And so I guess I'm just hoping that you could provide a little bit more color on why Lilly has to enhance rebates for such an extraordinary drug? Thank you.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Great, Dave. Thank you for the two questions. Dave, we'll go to you for the near-term M&A question and back to Enrique for the Jardiance question.","David A. Ricks - Eli Lilly & Co.","Yeah. Thanks, Dave. Well, our posture on M&A really hasn't changed. It's a top priority for deployment of capital. Of course, we are very interested in targets that would enhance our position, whether it be pipeline or otherwise, in oncology, in diabetes, in immunology or in Alzheimer's or pain.","When we've seen those things, we've moved quickly. I think CoLucid is an example of that. The reality in the world, though, is, I think, that there are constraints. And one of them is pricing. We're not the only company looking for these assets. The other is strategic fit. We're going to be disciplined to stick to therapeutic areas where we have an ongoing interest. We think this is where we have information advantage and we want to trade on that.","And then I think the asset fit within our pipeline, when we're talking about pipeline assets, we seek to acquire things that can be producing interesting combinations or fill gaps. So we're very focused on this space. Obviously, we had one transaction in Q1. I hope we can find more like it because we see a lot of value in CoLucid as an example. It's a top priority for me and we continue to scour the planet for good opportunities to add to Lilly's growth story.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Great. Thanks, Dave. Enrique?","Enrique A. Conterno - Eli Lilly & Co.","Okay. I agree that the Jardiance is indeed compelling value for payers. I'm unable to discuss what our rebate strategy is on this forum. But I think it's important. We do have some \u2013 there's, of course, public knowledge when it comes to, for example, Germany and Japan.","And in both of those cases, in the case of Germany, we have a new price, a higher price for Jardiance based on the indication. And in the case of Japan, we did not get the price cut. We got a minor \u2013 a positive price adjustment. But, yes, we do believe that this product offers compelling value to payers and to patients.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Thank you, Enrique. John, if we can go to the next caller, please?","Operator","And that would be Umer Raffat with Evercore. Please go ahead.","Umer Raffat - Evercore Group LLC","Yes. Thanks for taking my question. So I wanted to ask directly, do you think you need a new trial for bari, number one? And, number two, in a scenario \u2013 let's say, there is a scenario where only two milligram dose is approved, do you think bari will be able to get the head-to-head label versus Humira on label?","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","What was the question, Umer? I'm not sure if you cut out or if that was two questions.","Umer Raffat - Evercore Group LLC","I'm so sorry. So let me try again. First of all, I just wanted to ask directly, do you think you need a new trial on bari? And, number two, in a scenario where only two milligram dose is approved, do you think you'll be able to get the superiority language versus Humira on label? Thank you.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Christi, would you like to handle this?","Christi Shaw - Eli Lilly & Co.","Sure. So we don't know what we'll need until we actually meet with the FDA. As I said before, we believe in the benefit-risk profile of the four milligrams and the two milligrams across dosage groups. And that's what we continue to see with the data. And we want to make sure that what we provide to the marketplace is something that is effective and safe for the patients that it serves.","So, right now, we're looking at a four-milligram and two-milligram and open to the discussions with the FDA. And we'll see how they go and get back to you after that.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Thank you, Christi.","David A. Ricks - Eli Lilly & Co.","And just as a reminder, the R&D study just had the four milligram in it against Humira. So I think if that's your question, just remind the group that that was the only dose studied in that particular (1:10:10) analysis.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Okay. Thanks, Dave. John, next caller, please.","Operator","And we'll go to Alex Arfaei with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Alex Arfaei - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Good morning. Thank you, folks, for taking the questions. Most of my questions have been asked. A couple more for Enrique in diabetes. First, on Humalog. How comfortable are you about the sustainability of the exclusive arrangements that you have with payers? Because the economic benefit that you mentioned from the rebates, that's obviously has come under increased scrutiny. So what are the risks there?","And then following up, obviously Trulicity is doing well. What is your competitive outlook on the GLP-1 class, particularly from the oral GLP-1 in Phase 3 from Novo? Thank you.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Okay. Alex, thank you very much for the questions. Enrique, again to you.","Enrique A. Conterno - Eli Lilly & Co.","Sure. So, clearly as we contract with payers, it's not only the economic benefit, but of course all of the clinical benefits of each one of the products. In the case of Humalog, it's always difficult to say as we go through the contract in season.","But I think what we can say is, as we looked at historically, once a payer has made a decision on a particular product, basically once it comes time to renew, they typically have continued with that choice that they initially made, in particular when there are not new entrants basically coming in to the mix.","So we see this not only in diabetes, but I think in other therapeutic classes. As you can imagine, if we have a market where we have two major players, in this particular case maybe Lilly and Novo, and we were in dual status and we go to exclusive status, you are switching 50% of the patients. But once somebody is on exclusive status, now you basically \u2013 the disruption is significantly higher. And clearly, the economics from a benefit of the rebate perspective are really not going to be there because they are already getting basically top exclusive rights.","When it comes to Trulicity, clearly the product is doing extremely well. We are very excited about the overall growth of the class. So we see significant expansion of the GLP-1 class continuing. And of course, Trulicity has superior share performance within that class. We do see additional competition coming in both \u2013 when it comes to semaglutide as well as the oral GLP-1. Of course, we need to wait for additional data.","What type of label will these products get. Clearly, the efficacy of sema is, we believe, very good but they also had a signal when it comes to retinopathy. So we need to see what is the label going to look like because we do think that it's not just efficacy but the entire profile.","And finally, one of the great benefits that Trulicity I think is offering is we basically feel that Trulicity is almost redefining the first injection experience because patients don't have to touch the needle or see the needle. In a certain way, the feedback that we get from the experience I think is just fantastic. We've said that we are interested in oral GLP-1, and that's something that we're actively working on.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Thanks, Enrique. John, next caller, please.","Operator","And that will be Vamil Divan with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Vamil K. Divan - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Great. Thanks so much. So one just follow-up on the diabetes side. Can you give us a sense of the share now for the SGLT2s and the GLP-1s that's coming from primary care physicians as opposed to specialists? I guess if you want to throw the DPP-4s in there as well, that'd be helpful.","And then my second question, just on the 2017 guidance, just wanted to clarify. I believe you have not incorporated any expectations around the potential approval from KEYNOTE-021G for Alimta in combination with carbo and Keytruda. Can you just confirm that's correct and would that then be upside if that approval does come next month? Thanks.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Okay, Vamil. Thank you very much for the questions. Enrique, if you'd like to handle the question with regard to split between PCP and specialists for SGLT2s and DPP-4s as well, if you have it. And then, Derica, any comment you have on how the KEYNOTE-021G approval, if that comes through, how it could impact our expectations for 2017. Enrique?","Enrique A. Conterno - Eli Lilly & Co.","Yeah, so when it comes to orals and SGLT2s and DPP-4s are pretty alike. We basically see primary care basically driving about 80% of the overall scripts. Now, one thing that we've been watching is basically, what about cardiologists. And what we basically see that is while cardiologists, in the case of Jardiance, are a significant source of authority. And while we have seen an increase, the base of prescribing is extremely, extremely small.","I don't have the actual split for the GLP-1s, and I'm cautious about making it because that class has been evolving very, very quickly. And what we basically see is huge growth when it comes to primary care right now. But that class used to be about 50\/50. And we'll provide the specifics of where we are now.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Great. Thank you, Enrique. Derica?","Derica W. Rice - Eli Lilly & Co.","In regards to the guidance, as you saw in our press release and in our remarks here this morning, we reaffirmed our guidance for 2017. As it relates to the KEYNOTE data, we're excited about the data itself. We look forward to hearing the feedback and the outcome with the discussions with the FDA.","Clearly, if it's positive, it would go to support that guidance. But when we put our guidance together, we contemplate, again, as I stated earlier, a number of various scenarios that we will have to contend with, whether it's over the next 12 months in terms of our annual guidance or as it relates to our mid to longer-term guidance when we're talking about the 5%. And this would be just one of those additional scenarios that's factored in.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Thanks, Derica. John, next caller, please.","Operator","That will be Marc Goodman with UBS. Please go ahead.","Marc Goodman - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning. Sue, can you talk about how your oncology strategy's evolved? And what are the key Phase 2 assets we should be focused on? And then second, just on Animal Health, can you tell us what was the impact of the BI sales in the quarter of the acquisition? Thanks.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Hey, Marc, thank you for the question. Sue, for the oncology strategy question and highlights on Phase 2 assets. And then, Jeff, back to you for a commentary on the impact of the BI Vetmedica acquisition and the results for quarter. Sue?","Susan Mahony - Eli Lilly & Co.","Sure. Yeah, thanks for the question. Clearly, as we're looking at our strategy, the oncology environment is changing pretty rapidly and we want to make sure that as we're looking at agents, that we're bringing through really agents that are standard of care change or have potential to be standard of care change and to be foundational agents.","We believe that we have a number of those. We just launched Lartruvo for soft tissue sarcoma, which is the first agent that has been approved to show an overall survival advantage over standard care in 40 years, and showing an improvement of 12 months nearly in soft tissue sarcoma. So I think that is one that we can say clearly has the potential standard of care changing and foundational.","We have abemaciclib data that we're excited about, too. We have a number of assets in our portfolio. We're actually currently going through a strategy review and prioritization which we are looking forward to giving you more details on over the next months.","There are a number of agents that we're excited by. I think that we look at our checkpoint inhibitor, prexasertib. Data on that is pretty exciting and you should see more on that coming through over the next few months as you see how we're continuing to develop that further.","With regards to our ERK inhibitor, we're pretty excited about that, too. That's in Phase 1 at the moment. And we also have a potential combination options with our PI3K\/mTOR inhibitor and abemaciclib. So you're going to see more as we continue to roll out our prioritization of our portfolio. We have a number of assets in our portfolio now. What we want to do is really focus on those ones that have the potential to be foundational standard of care changing and have rapid development of those. And that's where our focus is.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Thanks, Sue. Jeff?","Jeffrey N. Simmons - Eli Lilly & Co.","Yes, on the impact of the BI, we sold $40.8 million in the first quarter. That's aligned with our plans. And again, as mentioned in the results, we were up 2% with the impact of BI. Without it, it was minus 3%.","Derica W. Rice - Eli Lilly & Co.","And just, Marc, overall, if you saw from our prepared remarks, that Vetmedica added about 30 basis points of our overall 8% volume growth in the quarter.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Thanks, Derica. John, next question, please?","Operator","And we'll go to Jeff Holford with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Jeffrey Holford - Jefferies LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. So, clearly, Trulicity has been having a great launch and is expected to going forward. But I get a lot of questions from investors just around sustainability of pricing in the GLP-1 segment. So just maybe ask you to gaze into crystal ball a little bit through maybe the upcoming contracting and one or two years out, how you just see that potentially being different from the insulin markets, obviously where pricing pressure's been a bit more difficult.","And then the second question, just really going back to baricitinib a little bit and the clinical trial design there. There is quite a lot of crossover in some of those clinical trials and up and down dosing. Just wanted to get any feedback that you can potentially give us on how comfortable the FDA was with that design right from the outset and whether any of this crossover and up and down dosing in the trials was potentially discussed at mid-cycle review? Thank you.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Hey, Jeff, thank you for the questions. Enrique, if you'll comment on Trulicity pricing question. And then, Dave, do you want to take the question for the baricitinib trial time? Enrique?","Enrique A. Conterno - Eli Lilly & Co.","Sure. Just on Trulicity. First, our access right now is outstanding. I think it reflects the \u2013 given the clinical and business performance of the product, Trulicity is now basically added in most plans. So our access in both commercial and Part D is north of 80%. Unfortunately, I'm unable to provide forward-looking expectations in terms of pricing.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Enrique, thank you. Dave?","David A. Ricks - Eli Lilly & Co.","Yeah, and just briefly on baricitinib. You're correct in saying that the program had a number of step ups after the initial placebo-controlled phases. So many patients moved from two to four milligrams or placebo to four (1:21:50) standard in RA studies. And we also in the long-term study everyone rolled into, we had a step-down feature. So we have a lot of data about two versus four, and we look forward to talking to the FDA more about that data in the coming weeks and days.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Thanks, Dave. John, next caller, please.","Operator","And we actually have no further questions in queue.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Okay. Let me just give a few seconds to see if someone wants to queue. If not, we'll go to close. So let's give a couple seconds for that, please. Did anyone queue, John?","Operator","No further questions coming in.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Thank you very much. Dave, would you like to go ahead and close out the call?","David A. Ricks - Eli Lilly & Co.","Okay. Thanks, Phil. We participate your participation in today's earnings call and interest in the Eli Lilly & Company. As we've discussed before, Lilly is entering a period of growth driven by new product launches. The diversity in our portfolio, our top-line growth prospect and the opportunity for margin expansions over the balance of the decade provide a compelling thesis for investors.

Welcome to the Q1 2019 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions]","As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our VP of Investor Relations, Kevin Hern. Please go ahead.","Kevin Hern","Thank you. Good morning. Thank you for joining us for Eli Lilly and Company\u2019s Q1 2019 earnings call. I am Kevin Hern, Vice President of Investor Relations. Joining me on today\u2019s call are Dave Ricks, Lilly\u2019s Chairman and CEO; Josh Smiley, our Chief Financial Officer; Dr. Dan Skovronsky, President of Lilly Research Laboratories; Christi Shaw, President of Lilly Bio-Medicines; Anne White, President of Lilly Oncology; and Enrique Conterno, President of Lilly Diabetes and Lilly USA. We are also joined by Kim Macko and Mike Czapar of the Investor Relations team.","During this conference call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors, including those listed on slide three and those outlined in our latest Forms 10-K and 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It is not intended to be promotional and is not sufficient for prescribing decisions.","As we transition to our prepared remarks, a reminder that our commentary will focus on non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude the financial contribution from Elanco during the first quarters of both 2018 and 2019, and present earnings per share as though the full disposition of the exchange offer was complete on January 1, 2018.","We believe this view provides insights into the drivers of our underlying business performance as a dedicated pharmaceutical company and provides for cleaner comparisons to future and prior periods.","Now, I will turn the call over to Dave for a summary of our progress in Q1.","Dave Ricks","Thanks, Kevin. The Company\u2019s focus in 2019 is to execute on a broad and exciting range of new products and indication launches, to build and accelerate our pipeline, and continue to improve the focus and competitiveness of our company. We are pleased with the progress on these objectives in Q1 2019.","First quarter revenue grew 5% in constant currency, despite a significant decline in U.S. Cialis revenue due to the recent loss of exclusivity. We made significant investments in key commercial and late-stage pipeline products and delivered non-GAAP EPS of 2% putting us on track to meet our full year financial guidance.","Our key growth products, which all launched since 2014 contributed meaningfully to our performance and account for 39% of our revenue. While still relatively early in their product life cycles, these products continue to drive growth led by Trulicity, Taltz, Verzenio, and in collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim, Jardiance and Basaglar.","Total volume growth across the entire portfolio was 7% and excluding Cialis was nearly 13%. U.S. diabetes contributed strong volume growth of nearly 17%. Oncology growth accelerated in the U.S., Japan and China. And our international markets grew volume by 9%, as global launches of key brands continue across our major geographies.","Excluding the impact of FX on international inventory sold, Q1 non-GAAP operating income as a percent of revenue decreased by nearly 600 basis points versus Q1 2018, reflecting a decrease in gross margin and investment in recent launches and multiple late-stage pipeline opportunities. On the same basis, operating income as a percent of revenue in Q1 increased by nearly 80 basis points versus Q4 2018, reflecting progress toward our 2019 full year margin goal of 28%.","We exited Q1 on track with our plans for the full year. We have invested in our future growth, while delivering strong volume growth across the business. Importantly, several pipeline assets achieved milestones this quarter, including the regulatory submission for the Trulicity REWIND study for CV outcomes label in the U.S. and in Europe.","The FDA granted priority review for Emgality for cluster headache in the U.S. The submission of Ultra Rapid Lispro for Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes in both Europe and Japan. The U.S. submission of our first connected device, our connected care prefilled insulin pen. And we had several Phase 3 data readouts.","We also announced an updated timeline for expected regulatory action timing for nasal glucagon. We received notification. The FDA has extended the review timeline by up to three months to analyze information requested late in that review cycle. We remain confident in nasal glucagon submission package and look forward to FDA action in the coming months.","In terms of capital deployment, we continue to utilize our strong operating cash flow to access value creating external innovation, which will enhance our future growth prospects. We completed the acquisition of Loxo Oncology and in key pipeline assets and expanding our presence into precision medicine. We completed the full separation of Elanco Animal Health via an exchange offer, retiring 65 million Lilly shares with approximately $8.2 billion.","We entered into a global licensing and research collaboration with ImmuNext, focused on new medicines for autoimmune disease. We announced a global licensing and research collaboration with Avidity, focused on potential new medicines in immunology and select other indications.","We announced an agreement to sell the rights in China for two legacy Lilly antibiotic medicines, as well as a manufacturing facility to Eddingpharm, a Chinese-based specialty pharmaceutical company. And we returned an additional $3.5 billion to shareholders via a previously announced accelerated share repurchase program and $600 million in dividends, representing a 15% increase per share versus 2018.","Moving on to slides five and six, you will see more details on key events since our February earnings call, including our announcement to introduce Insulin Lispro a low priced version of Humalog in the U.S.","Now, I will turn the call over to Josh to review our Q1 results and to provide an update on our post Elanco financial guidance.","Josh Smiley","Thanks Dave. Slide seven summarizes our presentation of GAAP results and non-GAAP measures and slide eight provides a summary of our GAAP results. Looking at the non-GAAP measures on slide nine, you will see revenue increased 30%.","Excluding the impact of FX on international inventories sold, gross margin as a percent of revenue was 80.2%, in line with our long-term goals for manufacturing efficiency and profitability. On the same basis, gross margin declined 130 basis points compared to Q1 2018, driven by production timing and lower volumes from post patent products.","Total operating expense increased 12%, with marketing selling and administrative expense, increasing 13%, driven primarily by increased investment to support our recent launches, including DTC campaign campaigns to drive awareness from Emgality, Verzenio and Taltz.","R&D expense increased 11%, reflecting the ramp up of multiple late-stage pipeline assets, the addition of the Loxo Oncology portfolio and the insight communicating to us that they would no longer co-fund the development of baricitinib, which reduces the royalty we will pay them moving forward.","As a result of the investments described above, operating income decreased 8% compared to Q1 2018, which put our operating income as a percent of sales at 26.2% for the quarter. As our recent launches continue to drive revenue and operating leverage, we expect income growth and improvements in operating margin during the remainder of 2019.","Other income and expense was income of $86 million this quarter compared to income of $70 million in Q1 2018, driven by over $100 million in gains of mark-to-market of public equities held through venture capital investments and strategic partnerships, partially offset by higher net interest expense.","Our tax rate for the quarter was 12.9%, a decrease of 260 basis points compared with the same quarter last year, driven primarily by timing associated with the impact of U.S. Tax Reform.","At the bottomline, net income declined 4%, while earnings per share increased 2%, due to a reduction in shares outstanding from share repurchases. Recall that our non-GAAP comparisons remove the 65 million shares retired through the Elanco exchange for both 2018 and 2019.","While income declined this quarter versus Q1 2018 we made important progress on several fronts that will drive future growth, as demonstrated by growing revenue despite significant headwinds from the loss of exclusivity of Cialis in the U.S., investing behind key growth brands, such as Emgality, Verzenio, Taltz, Jardiance and Trulicity, and advancing several pipeline assets to the next phase of development, including multiple regulatory submissions.","Slide 10 provides a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS and you will find additional details on these adjustments on slide 23.","Moving to slide 11, let\u2019s take a look at the effective price rate and volume on revenue growth. This quarter, foreign exchange reduced revenue growth by 2 percentage points. As Dave mentioned earlier, worldwide revenue grew 5% on a performance basis, driven by a 7% increase in volume, partially offset by price, Q1 is the ninth straight quarter our business grew volume in each major geography.","U.S. revenue increased 3%. Like last quarter Trulicity, Taltz, Verzenio and Basaglar were the key drivers of 6% volume growth, partially offset by price. Excluding Cialis, volume grew nearly 15% in the U.S., highlighted by diabetes products delivering nearly 17% volume growth.","Consistent with our 2019 financial guidance U.S. price declined 3%, driven by increased utilization of patient affordability programs, mainly for insulins and Taltaz, adjustments through estimates for rebates and discounts at higher contracted rates, primarily related to Trulicity, which were partially offset by favorable segment mix across the portfolio.","Moving to Europe, strong volume growth of 9% was largely offset by the negative effect of foreign exchange and to a lesser extent price. Volume growth was led by Trulicity, Olumiant and Taltz.","In Japan, strong volume growth of 7%, driven by Cymbalta, Verzenio and Trulicity, was largely offset by a drag of 6% from price, as a result of the government mandated price decreases that went into effect in 2018.","Revenue in the rest of the world increased 9% on a performance basis this quarter, led by volume growth from Humalog, Trulicity, Cialis, Jardiance and the recently launched Tyvyt, a China-only anti-PD1 immunotherapy agent in collaboration with Innovent Biologics.","As shown on slide 12, our key growth drivers were once again the engine of our worldwide volume growth. These products drove 14.8 percentage points of volume growth this quarter, an increase of over 100 basis points versus their contribution to growth in Q4 2018.","Brands that have experience loss of exclusivity provided a drag of 530 basis points, driven primarily by Cialis. You may recall, the generic versions of the Cialis entered the U.S. market at the end of September last year, and as expected, we have seen a rapid erosion of sales. When excluding LOE, the rest of our products posted robust Q1 volume growth of nearly 16%.","Slide 13 provides a view of our key growth products. In total, these brands generated nearly $2 billion in revenue this quarter, representing 39% of revenue. Trulicity continues to post robust growth, having achieved over 45% total share of the U.S. market, in a rapidly expanding class, that grew nearly 30% this quarter.","Similarly, Jardiance posted impressive U.S. share gains in volume growth, now capturing 50% and 64% share of market in total and new prescriptions respective. Both products continue to be the market leaders in their classes.","Emgality launch trajectory continues to be strong, with nearly 33% share of market for new prescriptions in the U.S., an increase of almost 13 share points from where we finished 2018. We expect increasingly strong performance in the U.S., combined with best-in-class access to drive meaningful sales contribution in the second half of 2019.","Continuing with our non-GAAP explanations on Slide 14, foreign exchange rates had a modest impact on our revenue, but a more meaningful impact on cost of sales, due to the effect in last year\u2019s quarter, resulting in the mid-single digit impact of operating income and EPS.","Turning to our 2019 financial guidance on Slide 15, you will see that we maintained non-GAAP-pharma-only expectations we shared in February. And with the Elanco exchange offer complete, are now providing EPS on the same basis. Our non-GAAP earnings per share range is $5.60 to $5.70, an increase of $0.05 versus our previously issued guidance range, which included Elanco.","While the line items remain unchanged from the previously communicated pharma-only expectations, I\u2019d highlight two items that impact our outlook for the remainder of 2019. First, we will manage expenses to deliver within our SG&A range, while investing thoughtfully to drive continued revenue growth.","And second in Q1, OID benefited from mark-to-market equity gains and our tax rate benefited from a net discrete item. We are maintaining our full year outlook for these items, however, as these items are highly variable and it is early in the year.","Touching briefly on our updated GAAP guidance, we expect earnings per share to be in the range of $8.57 to $8.67, which includes a $3.7 billion gain on the disposition of Elanco recorded in discontinued operations.","On Slide 16, we provide an update on our recent activity regarding capital allocation. Consistent with our strategic priorities, we spent over $8 billion on initiatives to drive future growth. In addition to investing in internal R&D, we closed the Loxo Oncology acquisition which augmented our pipeline, and returned over $4 billion of cash to shareholders.","As Dave mentioned earlier, we completed the successful divestiture of Elanco this quarter via an exchange offer. We exited Elanco at an attractive price and recognized a $3.7 billion gain on the disposition. In addition, the exchange offer was substantially oversubscribed, and resulted in earnings accretion in 2019, from retiring Lilly shares.","As we have returned to growth, our confidence in our business outlook has been reflected in meaningful dividend increases in 2018 and 2019. As we move ahead, our ability to continue to generate strong operating cash flow supports our pursuit of external innovation to enhance our long-term growth and create shareholder value.","Now I will turn the call over to Dan to highlight our progress on R&D.","Dr. Dan Skovronsky","Thanks Josh. Slide 17 shows select pipeline opportunities as of April 24. Movement since our last earnings call includes, the regulatory submission of Trulicity rewind data for CV outcomes label in the U.S. and Europe, submission of our Connected Care prefilled insulin pen for Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes in the U.S., submission of a fixed-dose combination of empagliflozin. linagliptin and metformin XR, for type-2 diabetes in the U.S. and submission of Ultra Rapid Lispro from type-1 and type-2 diabetes in Europe and Japan.","We also highlight the initiation of Phase 2 testing for our IL-33 monoclonal antibody and immunology. The initiation of Phase 1 testing for three new molecular entities, including our GIP, GLP glucagon tri-agonist, and the attrition of two Phase 2 molecules.","With the submission of Ultra Rapid Lispro, we are now on track to deliver 12 NME approvals since 2014. Therefore, a common question I get is, what\u2019s next? As we replenish our late-stage pipeline, in the past 12 months we have made four big innovation bets with mirikizumab, pegilodecakin, our recently acquired RET inhibitor and tirzepatide.","Moving to Slide 18, mirikizumab is our IL-23 in Phase 3 for psoriasis and ulcerative colitis, with expected data readouts in 2020 and 2021 respectively. We see first-in-class potential for ulcerative colitis, a disease with high unmet need in growing incidence, where we saw strong Phase 2 efficacy and clinical response and endoscopic healing.","Based on positive Phase 2 data in Crohn\u2019s disease, which we will be presenting in a few weeks at DDW, we are now moving quickly into Phase 3 for Crohn\u2019s disease yet this year.","Pegilodecakin is our first-in-class PEGylated IL-10 from ARMO Biosciences. We see strong biological rationale and single agent activity in renal cancer. There\u2019s also an intriguing signal in combination with both chemotherapy and checkpoint inhibitors in several tumor types.","We are looking forward to data readouts from the Cypress-1 and Cypress-2 non-small cell lung cancer studies by the end of this year, as well as the Phase 3 pancreatic cancer trial in 2020. We will also be starting a clinical program in renal cell carcinoma this year.","Our most recent late stage entry is our potential first-in-class and best-in-class RET inhibitor from Loxo Oncology. Currently in the Phase 2 portion of the LIBRETTO-001 study, we look forward to having both additional data readout and a regulatory submission by the end of this year. This molecule has received breakthrough designation from the FDA for three indications, RET fusion positive non-small cell lung cancer, RET-mutant medullary thyroid cancer, and RET fusion positive thyroid cancer.","We are excited about the data we have seen to-date, which has shown robust response rates and encouraging response durations. We look forward to presenting new data at a medical meeting in the second half of this year.","Finally, tirzepatide, our novel first-in-class and best-in-class GIP, GLP dual agonist twincretin, which started its Phase 3 SURPASS program in late 2018, on the heels of presenting impressive Phase 2 results in October at EASD.","We believe tirzepatide could provide levels of efficacy not seen with existing products. All SURPASS studies for the global submission should start by the end of the year, with data expected in 2021. We also expect to initiate Phase 3 studies in obesity and a Phase 2 study in NASH later this year.","We look forward to presenting new data at ADA in June on tirzepatide, including the additional dose escalation data from a Phase 2 trial in diabetes, data from a Japan clinical trial and new biomarker data from our Phase 2 trial supporting potential efficacy for NASH.","We are excited about this cohort of innovative first-in-class, late-stage assets each with the potential to improve the standard of care across immunology, oncology and diabetes. We look forward to what\u2019s next from these assets as they achieve important milestones and readouts over the next 12 months.","Slide 19 shows a tally of a significant progress we have made since our last earnings call on key events we are monitoring for 2019 including submissions across four key line extensions or NMEs that I described earlier, the regulatory submission of Emgality for episodic cluster headache in Europe, positive results from CAROLINA CV outcome study of Trajenta, positive results for a Phase 3 study of Taltz for non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis.","Results from two Phase 3 studies of Tanezumab, the first in patients with chronic lower back pain and the second a long-term safety study in patients with osteoarthritis pain. Positive results from a Phase 3 study of Cyramza for first line EGFR non-small cell lung cancer.","We also note that we received notification that for technical reasons the FDA has refused to file the supplemental NDA for Empagliflozin in type 1 diabetes and that we have made a decision to not pursue the development of Olumiant for psoriatic arthritis. In addition to the late-stage highlights I shared with you today, we are growing our early stage pipeline through both enhanced internal productivity and external innovation. We will highlight several examples in upcoming earnings calls.","Now I will turn the call back over to Dave for some closing remarks.","Dave Ricks","Thanks, Dan. In the first quarter, we delivered strong volume based revenue growth of 5% on a constant currency basis, driven entirely by our key growth products. We made strategic investments in commercial and late-stage products, which will enhance our future growth prospects. We have seen good pipeline progress this quarter, including a number of regulatory submissions. In addition, we bolstered our early phase pipeline by advancing multiple assets into the clinic and signing research agreements.","We also completed two significant transactions that will allow us to simultaneously focus the business and accelerate our pipeline of innovative medicines, the disposition of Elanco and the acquisition of Loxo Oncology. Finally, we returned over $4 billion to shareholders via the dividend and share repurchases.","Speaking for the entire team at Lilly, we remain incredibly excited about the prospects in front of us to reach millions of people, who need better medicines for difficult diseases. And we are eager to continue to execute on the growth opportunity in front of the company.","This concludes our prepared remarks and now I will turn the call over to Kevin to moderate our Q&A.","Kevin Hern","Thanks, Dave. We would like to take questions from as many callers as possible. So we ask that you limit your questions to two or to a single question with two parts. Karen [ph], please provide the instructions for the Q&A session. And then we are ready for the first caller.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We will go to the line of Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Chris Schott","The first one from me was just elaborating a little bit more on Trulicity dynamics this quarter, particularly as you think about price as well as to make sure I heard the comments in the prepared remarks properly. But how should we be thinking about net pricing and the overall pricing environment for Trulicity in 2019? And were there any one-time impacts or true-ups of rebates for Trulicity this quarter?","My second question is really quick one on Emgality, and just how we should we be thinking about where net pricing is going to shake out for this one. And should we think about second quarter results reflecting maybe more normalized gross to net then we saw with the Q1 result? Thanks very much.","Kevin Hern","Thanks, Chris we will go to Enrique for Trulicity and then Christi for Emgality.","Enrique Conterno","Chris, thank you for your question allow me to provide some color on Trulicity\u2019s overall performance. We continue to be very excited about the underlying business fundamentals of the product. When we look at volume growth, we are basically the beneficiary of very strong share growth. We are now sitting at 46%, which is an all time high for Trulicity and with the tailwind of very significant class growth now sitting at 30%.","Something to note is that when we look at sequentially volume while scripts basically increased for Trulicity from Q4 of 2018 to Q1 of 2019 by about 5%\/6%, our actual shipments declined by 7%. So I want to make sure that we are looking at the underlying business fundamentals and not necessarily just some shift in retail or wholesale inventory dynamics. When it comes to pricing, there hasn\u2019t been a step change, when it comes to pricing. I think of course, we see pricing pressures across all diabetes categories.","But it\u2019s important to note that our price this quarter was comparable to our price in Q4 of 2018. Now what we basically see in terms of pricing is relative to Q1 of 2018 is higher rates, when it comes to managed care and rebates. Growth in highly rebated segments, whether it\u2019s the Department of Defense,VA and so forth. And then we also had a negative impact due to changes in the estimates for rebates and discounts.","Christi Shaw","And Chris on Emgality, your question on net pricing and will be more normalized on Q2, what we saw in Q1, first of all, on-demand, very excited about the fact that we are now the number two CGRP passing a JV in both new prescriptions and total prescriptions. And we are on track in Q2 to pass Aimovig in new prescriptions. As we look at the net, we saw a higher than typical free goods as reimbursement was coming on.","To give you a little bit of flavor the first quarter had a 57% of commercial claims were reimbursed. We exited Q1 at 67 or two out of every three prescriptions are claims -- commercial claims being reimbursed. So as the reimbursement comes on in Q2, we should see an improvement in that.","Operator","Next we will go to the line of Jason Gerberry, Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Jason Gerberry","Christi, just to follow up on the Emgality comment I know that a lot of companies in the space of kind of frame second half payer environment is a little bit fluid. So is your comment that where you exited 1Q, should we be thinking about that as a linear trend. Are there any puts and takes going on changes in the reimbursement of CGRP biologics just wanted to get a better sense there.","And I guess my follow up probably staying with you AbbVie\u2019s SKYRIZI got pretty good early access. And so I am just sort of curious, your thoughts winners and losers there either be the established novel interleukins or do you see this as more cannibalization of AbbVie\u2019s own Humira franchise. Thanks.","Christi Shaw","Sure so, continuing on Emgality in terms of access. First of all, we saw very good receptivity by the payers for this class really given doctors and patients choice. And also not having many if any real restrictions for primary care prescribing. So on the reimbursement side we see the payers coming on board and more and more are coming on board right now our access ending Q1 is 82%. So we do expect that to get better and better over the course of the year. So I hope that answers your question there.","On SKYRIZI, the data on SKYRIZI is as expected and as we look at tolerability to compete, the competitive landscape that we environment that we are in really doesn\u2019t change access is very similar SKYRIZI and Taltz all of the newer agents really coming to market and helped increase the expectations of patients and doctors should have on really skin clearance.","And so it\u2019s a competitive marketplace, but we like our chances because with Taltz in the dermatology office we know clear skin, very fast and it lasts up to five years, we have seen data that sustained and no new safety signals. And we also have the head to head versus an IL-23 that will be coming out this year which will demonstrate that speed and clearance at 12 weeks and 24 weeks for the IL-23 really show their peak efficacy.","So we are looking forward to that and in rheumatology we will continue to compete there as we just released our head-to-head data versus Humira showing superiority and then later this year, being able to look at the regulatory approval of AxSpA. So the competition is fierce, but our chances and our add with Taltz are extremely good. And we don\u2019t care huge difference in the landscape because of really coming in.","Operator","Seamus Fernandez from Guggenheim. Please go ahead. I am sorry. One moment. Yes go ahead please.","Seamus Fernandez","So just a couple of quick questions. As we think about the evolving competitive landscape in the insulin space. We have seen Humalogtake up quite a bit of share in a short period of time. And then there\u2019s also the threat of potential biosimilars reaching the market in the next couple of years.","The evolving landscape and how that potentially impacts your portfolio as it relates to Humalog or also for the long-acting insulins going forward. And then just a second quick question for Dan. You guys have some data on your ERK inhibitor at ASCO, just hoping that you could give us your thoughts on data coming at ASCO for that product and perhaps any other datasets, that you think we should be watching for. Thanks.","Dave Ricks","Thank you, Enrique, if you want to answer the insulin question we will go to Dan.","Enrique Conterno","Sure. Clearly, there\u2019s -- there are new competitors in the insulin space, I think, in the case of EADVI think it\u2019s important to reflect that their most of their share gains really have been driven and managed Medicaid outside more look and Humalog of management are -- our overall script are basically flat, clearly there is an evolving landscape, when . it comes to insulin with the potential entry of other insulins follow-ons.","As you know the insulin categories are going to be transitioning to BLAs in the 2020 timeframe. Clearly, there\u2019s questions about interchangeability and when is that going to play out as we said in the past, we don\u2019t view interchangeability or something imminent. We eventually think, this is going to happen, but it needs to be more clarity. So this is likely something that won\u2019t happen before 2021.","Now, it\u2019s difficult for us to predict when insulin follows up will come into the market in particular in the U.S., given that some of these products have expressed certain expectation when it come to launch timelines, but have been delayed.","Importantly, to note as well is that we continue to evolve our overall instrument strategy and we like to say that we are reimagining insulin systems and an insulin delivery with by basically bringing in a connected care platforms to be able to improve patient outcomes in a much more meaningful way. So we are excited about our overall innovations with systems connected care, but also bringing new insulin like our Ultra Rapid Insulin Lispro that we are developing.","Dr. Dan Skovronsky","Yes, thanks for the question on our ERK inhibitor. This is a Phase 1 program, but it\u2019s still very early, but we are pretty excited about it. The reason that we are excited about this pathway is because the MAP Kinase pathway is implicated in driving about 30% of solid tumors.","So it\u2019s a great opportunity to drive that pathway. At ASCO, we have a couple of presentations on the ERK inhibitor, including some of the early Phase 1 data in a variety of patients and some data in lung cancer patients as well. So we look forward to being able to share that, but again it\u2019s a early program. I think we have a few other disclosures ASCO, but we are excited about, turn it over to Anne to comment on late-phase disclosure.","Anne White","Yes. So one of the disclosure that we are very excited about at ASCO is the results of our EGFR mutation positive first-line lung cancer study in CYRAMZA. So this is the RELAY Study and we shares top line data in March that the study was positive and met the primary endpoint of progression-free survival.","So we will be submitting to regulators globally midyear and approval on this would make the six indication that we have achieved for Cyramza. Importantly, we are excited about the data and we look forward to this oral presentation at ASCO. Also there\u2019s currently the standard of care in this setting and we know that our magnitude of benefit must be competitive with that.","We look forward to providing more answers for patients in the setting and also providing more options for physicians as they look to sequence therapy for the best outcomes for their patients. So we look forward to sharing more with you at ASCO.","Operator","And next we will go to Tim Anderson with Wolfe. Please go ahead.","Tim Anderson","On the rewind data for Trulicity coming up at ADA without running the data. Can you just talk about your level of excitement and if this is the data where once just presented you think the prescriber community is going to say well, that\u2019s really a game changer?","And then second question on Tanezumab, I think a lot of investors see this program is probably dead based on the latest data disclosure from you and Pfizer. Can you just share your perspective?","Dave Ricks","So we will go to Enrique on rewind, and then Dan, you want to talk about the tanezumab results.","Enrique Conterno","Yes. We continue to be excited about the rewind results for Trulicity. I am going to -- I have a plug here for my Investor Relations colleagues that we have an investor, we are planning on in new investor call at the ADA post disclosure of rewind we saw. Also, we hope to either see you there. Hope there you can either connector be there in person.","Dr. Dan Skovronsky","Yes. Great, thanks for the question on tanezumab. Before I address your question on the future tanezumab, I think it\u2019s important to comment on why we entered into this partnership with Pfizer and why we have pursued this program. It\u2019s obviously because of the dramatic unmet medical need here.","There are nearly 60 million Americans suffering with chronic pain from osteoarthritis and chronic lower back pain, many of whom have moderate to severe disease and aren\u2019t getting relief from currently available therapies.","When you put that in the context of the drawbacks of the therapies that are currently available, including in many cases opioids, you can just understand how important it is to have new non-opioid mechanisms to address pain.","So that\u2019s why we entered into this program and as we said before, we entered in, with a high level of confidence on the efficacy of this mechanism. But what we saw to discharge was the safety risk through this program.","And so that brings us to the final study, which of course was designed to fully understand the safety risk of this mechanism that reason in the study enrolled a different population of patients and we enrolled in the others, we wanted to compare to NSAIDs and therefore we had to enroll patients, who were getting some measure of relief and it is tolerate chronic NSAIDs.","So we are continuing to analyze the results from that study from 10.58, we are looking at that so in the context of all of the available data on tanezumab. Our plan then is to discuss the totality of the data with regulators in the coming months and that will help us decide on what the next steps are, and then we will be able to share an update with you when that\u2019s globally.","Operator","Next we will go to the line of Geoff Meacham from Barclays. Please go ahead.","Geoff Meacham","For Dan on the Olumiant and atopic derm, what do you guys see as differentiation in the data so far among the JAKs. I know you still have some data coming up. And in this indication is your view from the field how attractive oral options are versus injectables. And then just a real quick one for Enrique on Trulicity, just wanted to ask your view of the class growth differences in the U.S. versus O-US and how durable says, I know this has been a big driver in independent of the share gains that Trulicity has gotten over the years. Thank you.","Dave Ricks","Thanks, Geoff. So Dan and then we will go to Christi.","Dr. Dan Skovronsky","Okay, maybe I will start with the comment on differentiation and toss it to Christi for the commercial insights on patient interest and in an oral here. Although I should just say it\u2019s premature to speculate differentiation versus other molecules where we haven\u2019t seen the full data from theirs or even ours. But we are excited about the opportunity to be first year in atopic derm. Christi?","Christi Shaw","Yes, exactly, right now DUPIXENT is available, but it\u2019s an injectable for the more severe type of atopic derm and there\u2019s so many more patients out there suffering millions of patients. In fact, our dermatologist tell us atopic derm space reminds them of the psoriasis space about 15, 20 years ago.","So we do think it\u2019s a large opportunity and we do plan to be the first JAKs to market. We have released on the fact that our first two studies were positive. You probably saw that we have three more studies to read out this year and then based on the totality of that data, if they continue to be positive. We will be submitting next year.","Enrique Conterno","So when it comes to Trulicity class or GLP-1class growth, I think we see the same dynamics in most markets, the drivers are similar, which is the updated guidelines that having recently released. So when we look outside of the U.S., we are GLP-1class growth is in the mid \u201820s, given the maturity of the class in the U.S., it is impressive that the growth in the U.S. is even higher than that, but it\u2019s very exciting to see and as a corollary to that, I think the Trulicity\u2019s performance is very consistent across many markets.","Operator","Next we will go to the line of Andrew Baum from Citi. Please go ahead.","Andrew Baum","Just going back to SKYRIZI for the first question. What\u2019s your first-line market share for Taltzin psoriasis and do you expect to be able to grow it now that\u2019s SKYRIZI has been introduced into the market. I am obviously referencing Avi\u2019s enormous rebates influence as well as the profile of that drug and what it may mean for the contraction of the more refractory lines of therapy?","And then second, perhaps Dave could comment on the timing and the impact of the proposed rebate reform on your diabetes business expressly on the near-term impact for realized pricing because of the Medicare math, assuming it does get implemented at the beginning of next year. Many thanks.","Dave Ricks","Thanks, Andrew, so we will go to Christi for the comment on SKYRIZI and then, Enrique, if you want to talk about the impact on diabetes so then proposed rebate Safe Harbor world.","Chris Schott","Yes, so in dermatology specifically, our total prescriptions are a little over 15% and we do see growth continuing absolutely, we see actually with the new therapies that have come to market. It actually has increased the market growth, so right now the market is growing at 13%.","And the more of the newer agents coming to market, I think the more, you will see the older TNFs be used for short periods of time or potentially not used first line in the future. And so we do see our growth coming from the fact also our ability to compete in dermatology.","So the SKYRIZI versus Taltztop to head will be another place for us to go five year data sustained efficacy and we really are the only one that\u2019s had been able to show not only clear positive 100, but the ability to do it fast and one to two weeks and that sustainability. So our growth continues and we continue to see have very high confidence that growth will continue.","Enrique Conterno","The biggest impact from the proposed rule is really at the patient level, because patients will have access to medicine side to more affordable prices. And if you take that threat forward, I think what you will basically see is better appearance, and I think that\u2019s something that we all want when it comes to healthcare, which is better appearance to medicine. So the impact that is not often talked about is really, when it comes to maybe an impact on volume. When it comes to some of the mechanics and so forth honestly, I view pretty neutral overall.","Dave Ricks","Let me just jump in Andrew, on both of those points. I think it\u2019s important to note in psoriasis two things, one that there\u2019s four stepping through TNFs for almost every patient, if that were to change, I think that\u2019s a big positive for the newer innovation, so the doctors can select appropriate therapy for patients with psoriasis noting that TNFs don\u2019t work nearly as well as in the new classes and amongst those we think tells us the best profile.","Also within derm, there\u2019s a lot of switching anyway, so the front-line market is versus the total is much smaller than other immunology indications. That\u2019s an important thing to keep in mind. On the rebate rule we do, we are planning for implementation January 1, I think Enrique rightly notes that the volume upside, the thing I would worry about is rate compression because presumably you would have more facial transparent pricing.","But I think across our portfolios, because of the hike consolidation on the payer side, the rates are pretty compressed already. There aren\u2019t big differences between what the payers are paying. So that\u2019s why we lean into this one, we think it\u2019s the right policy answer to help seniors with medication costs and to shift the debate from list pricing to net pricing, which we see as our long-term interests.","Kevin Hern","Thanks for your questions, Andrew, next caller please.","Operator","I will go to Vamil Divan from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Vamil Divan","Hi. Great. Thanks for taking the questions. So just first on Olumiant, I think, I asked this question before, but just the U.S. opportunity there against our limited sales this quarter. I think you said in your prepared remarks, you are not going to be filing for psoriatic arthritis, just correct me if I miss heard that? And I am just, I guess, on how you think about getting the 4-milligram to the market and so the opportunity in the U.S. for that product and also the implications from the data of Pfizer recently released from their long-term trial showing some additional question on thrombosis? And then the second one, just following up on the psoriasis questions, you mentioned mirikizumab and the data there in psoriasis, I know you said you will be first in GI, I am just curious what the differentiation of any would be in psoriasis for that product or is it really more just a GI focus we should think about? Thanks.","Dave Ricks","Thanks, Vamil. We will go to Christi for Olumiant Americas questions.","Christi Shaw","Okay. So for Olumiant, yeah, I think, what we see in the U.S. is it will be slow and steady in Olumiant 2 milligrams RA. Your question about psoriatic arthritis, you did hear correctly, as we look at the opportunities for us to be best-in-class, first-in-class and really enter market with unmet need.","In psoriatic arthritis in the ankylosing spondylitis non-radiographic expire as well. We already have Taltz and Taltz has shown very remarkable results and so we feel very good with that play as we look to study Olumiant and other indications like atopic dermatitis.","Remember Lupus got Fast Track designation in December. We are studying both 2 milligrams and 4 milligrams in that indication, as well as atopic dermatitis and we have our alopecia areata study where Phase 2 will readout later this year and if positive we will move to Phase 3.","So we are still very big on the opportunity of baricitinib as a whole, the RA 2 milligrams will be slow and steady growth and 4-milligram is being studied and we looked at CD efficacy results there and bring it to market if they are positive.","In regards to the Pfizer question about what readout in their Jack high dose. So we -- as we look at the data that we have and 55 countries that have approved Olumiant, we haven\u2019t seen unusual safety signals in DTEs and we continue to study, obviously, post marketing research that we are doing in collaboration with agreement with FDA both on real world evidence and in randomized clinical trials, those will continue as well. So no news on -- no unusual news on our Taltz and Olumiant like the Pfizer announcement.","And then lastly on mirikizumab, so, yes, we are in Phase 3 studies with both psoriasis and ulcerative colitis, we are very excited about the GI space because mirikizumab should be the first IL-23 to ulcerative colitis. We also finished our Phase 2 data on Crohn\u2019s disease that data will be released at DDW in just a few weeks here in May. So look for that.","And then, yes, in psoriasis we are doing a Phase 3 clinical trial with some competitive endpoints in head-to-head data. So when that study reads out we will be looking to see if we can have stronger and more sustained results then current IL-23 in the market.","Kevin Hern","Vamil, thanks for your questions. Next caller please.","Operator","And next we will go to Umer Raffat from Evercore. Please go ahead.","Umer Raffat","Hi. Thanks so much for taking my questions. First, can you quantify for us what percentage of TRx are paid versus free on Taltz, as well as Emgality? And secondly, I noticed one of the trials reading out for you this fall, the IL-10 plus Opdivo trial in second-line lung has been shrunk from 100 down to 50 patients. Is that simply a function of increasing Keytruda use in first-line or is there another dynamic here as well? Thank you very much.","Dave Ricks","Okay. Thank you. We will go to Christi for the questions around Taltz and Emgality and then Enrique will talk about pegilodecakin.","Christi Shaw","Sure. First of all, Lilly believes in really open access and giving choice to patients and physicians. So we continue to work with payers on access with Taltz. In spite of that, we -- the barriers that we have had -- we had very good uptake with Taltz and as we look at our programs, patient specific, copay cards, et cetera, being able to allow patients on drug and then transition to insurance coverage, we see that two-thirds of patients in the market on Taltz are paid for.","On Emgality, as I said before, the commercial claims that have been submitted, we see in Q1 that 57% of those have been reimbursed. And as we exited Q1, we saw that in the mid \u201860s, two out of every three patients that submitted a claim we had reimburse coverage for.","Dave Ricks","Thanks, Christi.","Enrique Conterno","Yes. On the question on pegilodecakin, this is the Cyprus 2 study referring to. So this is a second-line lung study, its Phase II study IO-naive patients. So following first-line treatment, but not in immunotherapy and then it\u2019s in combination with Opdivo in low expressers. And what we are finding, as you know, well, is that IO-naive patients in the second-line are becoming increasingly rare. So what we decided to do was analyze that data and have that inform the next steps for the program. But not continued to further enrolled patients in this somewhat diminishing population.","We have remain confident that the greatest opportunities for pegilodecakin remain in lung cancer, both in the first-line setting and in later lines, and also in renal cell cancer. So as Dan mentioned, we will be starting a renal cell study later this year.","But we look forward to readouts in lung at the end of this year and then also in pancreatic cancer early next year and remain confident in the opportunities for pegilodecakin across those tumor types. So I look forward to hearing more towards the end of the year, both on Cyprus 2 and on the Cyprus 1 study, which is in the first-line setting.","Kevin Hern","Thanks, for the questions Umer. Next caller, please.","Operator","And we will go to David Risinger, Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","David Risinger","Yes. Thanks very much. I have two questions. The first is for Dave. I am hoping that you can help us understand a little bit better, how you are thinking about the forthcoming HHS action on the elimination of rebates and how that will negatively impact companies that use volume based discounts such that a product like Taltz will be able to step up on the formulary and maybe move into a formulary position that another larger player held in psoriasis? And then second, Enrique, with respect to Trulicity, just hoping that you can help us with a little bit more of a bridge. So you said that, Rx increased sequentially by 5% to 6%, actual shipments declined by 7%. So does that mean there was an inventory work down of 12% to 13% and could you also quantify the negative dollar change in reserves? Thank you.","Kevin Hern","Thank you, Dave, and then Enrique.","Dave Ricks","Yes. Thanks, Dave. So on the rebate rule, again, we are planning for this January 1, of course, it\u2019s Part D, there are some legislative efforts to look at regulating commercial market. I guess, at this point, my speculation would be that looks more challenging either for political or practical reasons.","But I do think once Part D changes and I think we are, as I said, planning toward that, you will start to see increased interest from payers that are not in the government systems or commercial payers to have similar benefits provided to their beneficiaries, particularly in chronic disease where list price effects have a lot of distortion and increased out-of-pocket costs and we have all heard the upgrade around that really centered on insulin, frankly.","So I think your logic is the right one in the sense that today with rebates which are not share with patients and confidential payers have a strong incentive to keep those confidential and use those to compete on premiums, that\u2019s the way it works. I think in the future world where that can\u2019t be the way they use those rebates, they will need compete for premiums in other ways, efficiency, presumably, and patients will have a choice at the counter based on net pricing. I would assume the doctors are informed about those net prices and that also becomes an influence on prescribing.","So for new innovative therapies hypothetically one in specialty market or in a general practitioner market like Emgality, I think that will be an important part of any company\u2019s strategy to understand the net price that will officially be there for the consumer.","The final comment is, of course, Part D is senior program. So the demographics will affect us mostly in our diabetes franchise initially and that\u2019s where a lot of our planning is focused right now.","Kevin Hern","Thanks, Dave. Enrique?","Enrique Conterno","Whenever we look at sequential growth you -- there\u2019s a lot -- what I call the colloquially a double whammy effect. So we could be double counting here is not to simply add up. One good way to think about it is just if we were to shift 5% of the units from Q4 to Q1 that that explains 10 percentage points of difference, but in reality we are only shipping 5% of units from one quarter to another. That\u2019s a long way of saying that, I will have your estimate likely the -- we don\u2019t have full visibility into the retail inventories, but my assessment is about 6 points.","David Risinger","Thank you.","Kevin Hern","Dave, thanks for the questions. Next caller please.","Operator","And next we will go to Steve Scala from Cowen. Please go ahead.","Steve Scala","Thank you. I have a couple of questions. We were expecting Verzenio data in 2019 from MONARC Her and MONARCH plus. I am wondering if there still on track. And then, secondly, Enrique, one of the concerns with the upcoming rewind readout is that the benefit might be driven by the 30% or so of patients in the trial with pre-existing cardiovascular disease and that the remaining patients add little to the overall outcome. So, overall, the benefit might be a solid but unspectacular 20% or so reduction in risk, which won\u2019t offer opportunity for differentiation. I am just wondering, can you tell us not to be concerned about this point? Thank you.","Kevin Hern","All right. We will go to Anne for the question on Verzenio and then Enrique on rewind.","Anne White","Yeah. So you are correct. So we are looking to deliver our new data to drive additional growth in one of them the HER-2 positive study, which we will report results on towards the end of the year at a medical meeting. The MONARCH 2 overall survival data will readout as we had communicated in the past in 2020. And then we also have importantly the adjuvant study reading out in 2021.","And I appreciate asking about Verzenio because there has been an encouraging start to the year. The revenue grew 30% over Q4 and we also are seeing nice uptake across Japan and European markets. So we look forward to these additional data readouts helping contribute to that message. But look forward to those readouts coming as we had communicated in the past.","Kevin Hern","Thanks, Anne. Enrique?","Enrique Conterno","We are unable to provide additional comments on rewind, but look -- we look forward to seeing you at the conference call.","Kevin Hern","Thanks, Steve. Next caller, please.","Operator","Thank you. Next we will go to the line of Alex Arfaei, BMO. Please go ahead.","Alex Arfaei","Okay. Thank you and good morning. On tirzepatide, your -- good to see the program formally, I guess, extended in obesity and NASH. Regarding your Phase 3 obesity trial, could you give us a little bit more color in terms of the outcomes you are looking forward the competitor are you using and the potential readout? And you mentioned you have dose titration data at ADA, can you comment on the extent to which that data shift you dosing for the Phase 3 trials, particularly the high dose? Thank you.","Kevin Hern","Enrique?","Enrique Conterno","Yeah. So we are very excited about the tirzepatide and being able to start our Phase 3 Type 2 diabetes study and basically pursuing both obesity in Phase 3 and NASH in Phase 2. We are not providing additional color on the specific obesity trials that we are conducting -- that we plan to conduct. Clearly we need to have the appropriate discussions with the FDA as we engage in this Phase 3 trial, but we plan to do sometime -- that sometime in the future. And as far as the titration question, yes, we do plan to have presentation at ADA, looking at some of the additional titration data for separate thing.","Kevin Hern","Thanks for the questions, Alex. Next caller, please.","Operator","Thank you. Next we will go to Louise Chen, Cantor. Please go ahead.","Louise Chen","Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. So my first question is on mirikizumab, you had mentioned that you will likely be the first to IL-23 to marketing you see in Crohn. I am just curious in addition to that, what are the competitive advantages do you see as it relates to other ILs and about and also Jack? And then the second question I had was on LOXO-292, you showed very good ORR median duration percentage of patients on therapy. How do you think that will hold up into the Phase 2 readout and how do you think you might compare with other RET inhibitors in development? Thank you.","Kevin Hern","Thanks. We will go to Christi for mirikizumab and then Anne on RET inhibitor.","Christi Shaw","Thanks Louise for the question on miri. So, to be clear, we expect to be first in to the market on ulcerative colitis and first of a couple to market on Crohn\u2019s disease. So, you never know, we have been speeding up the Phase 2 trial and look forward to entering the next, but that\u2019s where we are on GI. We are very excited, because our studies are set up to be best-in-class and so if they read out positively, we expect to not only be first-in-class or best-in-class in ulcerative colitis and Crohn\u2019s disease.","Kevin Hern","Thanks, Christi. Anne?","Anne White","Yes. When we have thoughts on the Loxo question, when we start to move into precision medicine and to obtain a RET inhibitor, we really thoroughly survey the landscape and selected the molecule in the portfolio that we believe to be first and best-in-class, and we continue to believe that today. We intend to submit in the U.S. by the end of the year end in Europe shortly thereafter.","So to answer your question, we remain very confident in the efficacy, safety profile and the duration of our RET inhibitor. And we will continue to expect that will deliver first in both lung and thyroid cancer. So we are actually be having -- we are presenting an update on the registrational data in the second half of 2019 at a major -- a couple of major medical meetings in advance of that potential regulatory filing.","And importantly, as you look at this data set, we now have over 400 patients enrolled across tumor types with RET fusion or mutations. And so we fully expect the data to continue to bear out what we saw last year, which is in response rates, as you said, from 60% to 80%, with well over 90% of patients remaining on study. This is the data reported last year and then we will provide an update later this year.","Kevin Hern","Thanks, Anne. Louise, thanks for your questions. Next caller, please.","Operator","Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Next we will go to Navin Jacob from UBS. Please go ahead.","Navin Jacob","Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. So, number one, I just wanted to -- I am sorry to beat a dead horse on GLP-1 pricing. But Enrique, if you could just dig in a little bit further, just wanted to understand in Q1 of this year, how much of the lower price was related to Medicare Part D on whole changes versus other rebate related changes, because you mentioned that there was rebate estimate adjustments, I want to understand is that a one-time impact for accrual accounting related issues or is it something that we should be thinking about as continuing on going forward. And so, overall, just wanted to understand, where is the GLP class going in terms of pricing, is there going to be continued pricing pressure over the next couple of years? And then, secondly, just on op margins, if you could help us understand longer term where the op margin profile for the human health business will look like. Can we expect margins to reach mid-to-high \u201830s in line with some of your other peers? Appreciate the help.","Kevin Hern","Thanks, Navin. We will go to Enrique for Trulicity. Then Josh on the op margin question.","Enrique Conterno","Yeah. So I just first to address the question about the doughnut hole. The doughnut hole becomes a little more important in Q2, I don\u2019t have the numbers in front of me, but in the case of diabetes medicines maybe Q1 is maybe only about 10% of the overall doughnut hole from an accounting perspective, what we are going to see throughout the year. So when we think about Trulicity, while there was some impact of the doughnut hole. It was not material to the pricing results.","As we -- as I mentioned, when we look at Trulicity, we do have high rebates in managed care and so forth relative to Q1 of last year, the change is due to estimates -- change in estimates for rebates and discounts. That -- yes, that is basically changing because of how we had accrued them based on a full review of the claim that we received later basically changes the information that we have on hand and we need to account for that as soon as we know that information. So, yes, that is a particular impact that was from other quarters that basically is impacting this particular quarter. So that\u2019s probably as much detail as I can provide.","Kevin Hern","Thanks, Enrique. Josh?","Josh Smiley","I mean on operating margins for the quarter, we were slightly above 26%, our guidance for the year is to be at 28% we are confident we will get there. I think you will see through the remainder of the year that we will see if power guidance topline growth netting out currency effects similar to what we are seeing this quarter and we will see sort of the operating expenses at a more constant absolute level than what we are seeing in Q1. So we are confident in our 28% for the year.","And then for 2020 our goal is 31% and we are confident as well in achieving that. That\u2019s for pharma only, so that\u2019s on our new basis excluding Elanco. We see good opportunity to get to the 31%. So we are no change there.","I think if you look past 2020, we would expect margin expansion to continue. We have a limited patent expirations in the first half of the next decade and we still have the new products that we are launching now will still be in their growth phase. So we definitely see margin expansion opportunities post 2020. But we haven\u2019t given a specific goal.","Kevin Hern","Thanks, Josh. Next caller, please.","Operator","There are no further questions in queue at this time. Dave Ricks, please go ahead.","Dave Ricks","All right. Thank you. Thank you all for joining us and we appreciate your participation in today\u2019s earnings call and your interest in the Eli Lilly and Company. We began 2018 with a lot of momentum and we made meaningful progress in our first quarter. Although, Q1 was a period of investment, we remain committed to our revenue and profitability goals for 2019 and 2020. We continue to advance our innovation-based strategy to progressing internally discovered medicines, augmented with external innovation. We completed two transformative transactions this quarter as well, with the full separation of Elanco and the addition of Loxo Oncology. With a robust pipeline and volume driven revenue growth Lilly continues to be a compelling investment. Thanks again for dialing in.

Welcome to the Eli Lilly and Company Q1, 2018 earnings call. At this time, all participants lines are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Dave Ricks. Please go ahead.","David Ricks","Good morning. Thank you for joining us for Eli Lilly and Company\u2019s first quarter 2018 earnings call. I\u2019m Dave Ricks, Lilly\u2019s Chairman and CEO. Joining me on today\u2019s call are Josh Smiley, our Chief Financial Officer; and Enrique Conterno, the President of Lilly Diabetes and Lilly USA; Dr. Sue Mahony, President of Lilly Oncology; Christi Shaw, President of Lilly Bio-Medicines; and Jeff Simmons, President of our Elanco Animal Health. We\u2019re also joined by Kristina Wright, Jim Heaney, Kevin Hern and Phil Johnson of the Investor Relations team. We also joined for the first time by Dan Skovronsky, our incoming President of Lilly Research Laboratories. Dan is succeeding Dr. Jan Lundberg who retires at the end of May. Jan has been key to our success as we navigated the years YZ and return to growth for the series of successful products. We want to thank Jan for his all contributions to our company. ","During this conference call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors, including those listed on Slide 3 and those outlined in our latest Forms 10-K and 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community only. It is not intended to be promotional and it is not sufficient for prescribing decisions.","2018 is off to a good start. With first quarter revenue growth of 9%, which we leveraged into a 29% non-GAAP operating income growth and 37% non-GAAP EPS growth. New pharmaceutical products continue to be the drivers of our worldwide revenue growth. Led by Trulicity, Basaglar, Jardiance and Taltz, with growth in both US and international markets where launches continue to scale up. New product growth more than offset revenue declines resulting from loss of exclusivity on a number of established products. In addition, we continue to expand our margins this quarter. Excluding the effect of FX, our international inventory sold non-GAAP gross margin as a percent of revenue increased by nearly 70 basis points over Q1 of 2017. ","And non-GAAP operating income as a percent of revenue increased by 775 basis points to 30.4%. Pipeline progress this quarter also included approval in launch of an additional indication and first line metastatic breast cancer for Verzenio based on the MONARCH 3 data. Positive Phase 3 studies of Taltz for ankylosing spondylitis, the positive Phase 3 study for Cyramza at high AFP patients with second line liver cancer. And the initiation of a Phase 3 study for Trulicity in 3 mg and 4.5 mg doses. ","While we are pleased that the FDA Arthritis Advisory Committee supported the efficacy of both the 2-mg and 4-mg of baricitinib in RA and 2-mg overall, we are disappointed that the committee did not recommend approval of the 4-mg dose. We are confident in the benefit-risk profile of both baricitinib 2-mg and 4-mg for the treatment of patients with RA, supported by the clinical data generated to-date, and by the experience in more than 40 countries in which both doses are approved and available. We'll continue to work with the FDA on this important application.","In terms of capital deployment, we announced a strategic collaboration with Sigilon to develop encapsulated cell therapies for the treatment of type 1 diabetes. We purchased $1.1 billion of stock and returned nearly $600 million via the dividend. And we are making expected progress on Elanco strategic review and still anticipate sharing our conclusions on our Q2 earnings call this July. ","Slide 5 contains more detail on key events since our January earnings call. Now I would like to the turn call over to Joshua to review our Q1 results and provide an update on our financial guidance for 2018. ","Joshua Smiley","Thanks Dave. Slide 6 summarizes our presentation of GAAP results and non-GAAP measures. While Slide 7 provides a summary of our GAAP results. I'll focus my comments on our non-GAAP adjusted measures to provide insights into the underlying trends in our business. So please refer to today's earnings press release for a detailed description of the year-on-year changes in our first-order GAAP results. Looking at the non-GAAP measures on slide 8, you'll see the revenue increase of 9% that Dave mentioned earlier. Gross margin as a percent of revenue decreased to 75.1%. This decrease was due to the effective foreign exchange rates on international inventory sold. Excluding this FX effect, gross margin as a percent of revenue actually increased roughly 70 basis points, driven by higher realized prices and manufacturing efficiencies, partially offset by product mix.","Total operating expense decreased 5% with marketing, selling and administrative expense decreasing 4% and R&D expense decreasing 6%. Total operating expenses as a percent of revenue declined by 710 basis points compared to Q1, 2017. This significant improvement reflects our continued efforts to reduce our cost structure and increase our margins, accelerated by the restructuring actions we took late last year. Other income and expense with income of $67.5 million this quarter compared to income of $78.3 million in last year's quarter. ","Our tax rate was 15.9 %, a decrease of 530 basis points compared with the same quarter last year, driven primarily by the impact of US tax reform. At the bottom line, net income increased 35%, while earnings per share increased slightly faster at 37% due to a reduction in shares outstanding from shares repurchase. We achieved a significant earnings growth by delivering high single digits revenue growth, while significantly reducing our operating expenses, creating positive leverage again this quarter.","Slide 9 provides a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS. You'll find additional details on these adjustments on slide 20. So moving to Slide 10, let's take a look at the effective price rate and volume on revenue growth. This quarter the effective foreign exchange provided a four percentage point benefit, excluding this our worldwide revenue growth on a performance basis was 5%, driven by both price and volume. For a fifth straight quarter, our human Pharma business drove volume growth in each major geography. US Pharma revenue increased 10% driven by price into a lesser extent volume.","Our diabetes portfolio led by Trulicity, Basaglar, and Jardiance was the primary driver of volume growth with growth of 30%, offset by the losses of exclusivity for Strattera and Effient and Axiron and by a decline in volume for Cialis due to the entry of generic erectile disfunction products.","For US Pharma, it's also worth noting that when excluding LOEs, the rest of our US products grew by approximately 20% in total. US price growth in the quarter was favorably impacted by an adjustment for rebates and discounts, primarily related to lower Medicaid utilization than anticipated across the portfolio. While Medicaid remains a significant segment of our US business, we estimate that the growth we experienced in this segment in the past several years has plateaued in recent months. ","Moving to Europe. We've been pleased with the overall performance of our new product portfolio across the region. Pharma revenue grew 2% excluding that FX, driven entirely by volume despite the loss of exclusivity for Cialis. Excluding the impact of the Cialis LOE volume grew nearly 17%. This volume growth was led by Trulicity, Olumiant, Taltz, Lartruvo, Jardiance and Basaglar. ","In Japan, pharma revenue increased 1% excluding the FX, driven by volume of new products namely Trulicity, Taltz and Jardiance, with a partial offset in price from the impact of the biannual price cuts. Our pharma revenue in the rest of the world increased 4% on a performance basis this quarter, led by volume growth of Trulicity, Humalog and Forteo.","Turning to animal health. As we noted during our Q4 earnings call, we've been expecting to return to top-line growth in the second half of this year, and our Q1 results are on track with this expectation. Excluding FX, Elanco revenue declined 4% this quarter. I highlight, however, that revenue in Q1 actually increased 1% in performance terms when excluding the impact of products we've made the strategic decision to exit. These strategic exits are the contract manufacturing activity that came with the BIUS vaccines acquisition, as well as 2 terminated legacy US distribution agreements and Posilac.","You'll see that we provided a back up slide quantifying the drivers of our animal health revenue growth excluding those strategic exits. We're encouraged with the revenue trends we're seeing in our ongoing or core business. New products contribute $ 62 million in Q1, driven primarily by Credelio, INTERCEPTOR PLUS and Galliprant. These new products drove our core companion animal portfolio up 10% in the quarter.","Our core food animal business decreased 4%, primarily due the U.S. buying patterns in Q1, 2017, as well as continued ractopamine competition, importantly though our poultry business continue to deliver strong growth. In Q1, poultry products grew11%, well ahead of the market and we expect to see full-year growth for our overall core food animal portfolio.","Lastly, I point out this is our second consecutive quarter with overall price growth, which is a sign of solid foundations in the industry. We expect this price growth to continue through 2018. We are monitoring the trade situation closely and while we do not see immediate impact to our animal health business, we are cautious about the broader economic impact if export activity declines. Hopefully, this provides you with useful insights into our animal health revenue growth and Jeff can address questions you may have in the Q&A session.","So now let's take a look at the drivers of our worldwide volume growth on Slide 11. In total, our new products including Trulicity, Basaglar, Jardiance, Taltz, Verzenio, Olumiant, Lartruvo and Cyramza were the engine of our worldwide volume growth. You can see that these products drove 11.1 percentage points of volume growth this quarter. The loss of exclusivity of Effient, Strattera, Zyprexa, Cymbalta, Evista and Axiron provided a drag of 510 basis points, while Cialis and animal health accounted for 230 and 120 basis points of volume declined respectively.","Slide 12 provides a view of our new product uptake. In total, these brands generated nearly $1.5 billion in revenue this quarter, and represented over a quarter of our total worldwide revenue. I'd like to highlight the progress in our second quarter of Verzenio launch. We are pleased with the continued new to brand shared growth which is now at 15% in the approval of the new first line metastatic breast cancer indication, giving us the broadest label in the class. Last week at AACR, we presented the final analysis of the MONARCH 3data which showed 28.2 months in progression-free survival, more than months better than placebo, as well as analysis across all patient subgroups in the MONARCH 2 and MONARCH 3 studies which demonstrated that patients with certain concerning clinical characteristics received substantial benefits in the addition of Verzenio to endocrine therapy.","Moving to Slide 13. This quarter FX had a more significant effect on our results, largely driven by the euro. Excluding FX, you can see that revenue increased 5%, non-GAAP cost of sales increased just 2% and non-GAAP EPS increased 47%.","Turning to our 2018 financial guidance on Slide 14. You will see that we've updated our guidance to reflect an additional $700 million on top line, driven by lower expected Medicaid utilization, changes in estimates to rebates and discounts, as well as the impact of foreign exchange rate movements. A slight increase in marketing, selling, admin and R&D expenses to account for FX movements, as well as for funding for additional pipeline opportunities. An increase of $25 million to the top end of our range for OID, and a decrease in our tax rate from 18% to 17% which reflects the change in expected geographic mix of income.","These updates contribute to an increase in both GAAP and non- GAAP earnings per share. Our non-GAAP earnings per share is now expected to be $5.10 to $5.20, which is an increase of 20% over 2017 at the midpoint of the range.","Now I will turn the call back over to Dave to review view the pipeline and key future bets. ","David Ricks","Thanks Joshua. Slide 15 shows select NME and NILEX as of April 20th movement since our last earnings call include the approval of baricitinib for the first line treatment of metastatic breast cancer in the US. A Phase 3 starts for Trulicity in 3 mg and 4.5 mg doses. A Phase 1 starts for the IL-23 CGRP biospecific antibody for immunology. While we have attrition of the Phase 2 base inhibitor molecule as monotherapy, the trial and combination with the N3pG antibody continues, and we look forward to seeing results in this novel trial design.","We also discontinued our abemaciclib pancreatic cancer study. You'll see we've combined our NME and NILEX pipeline into one view. In terms of NILEX, we have a robust set of lifecycle opportunities for recently launched products, which we expect will continue to bolster the growth prospects for important brands like Trulicity, Taltz, Verzenio, Olumiant and Jardiance. These products are well positioned in some of the largest and fastest growing categories. In our dressing areas of high unmet medical need.","Key NILEX opportunities include AxSpA for Taltz, atopic dermatitis for Olumiant, adjuvant breast cancer for Verzenio. The 3 mg and 4.5 mg dose study for Trulicity and heart failure for Jardiance, which is in collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim.","On Slide 16, we highlight expected key events for 2018. In addition to noting the US approval of Verzenio for first line metastatic breast cancer, we've indicated the data disclosure of the keynote 189 study at AACR which showed that Alimta, in combination with Keytruda plus platinum chemotherapy reduced the risk of death by half compared with chemotherapy alone as first-line treatment in metastatic, non-squamous, non small cell lung cancer patients.","The overall survival benefit was robust regardless of PDL-1 expression status. We also announced last week that the Cyramza Phase 3 study in bladder cancer did not reach statistical significance in the secondary endpoint of overall survival. There are many events to look forward to in 2018, notably the expected regulatory action for US baricitinib, galcanezumab, Verzenio and Alimta.","We also look forward to the data readout of the second phase 3 study of Taltz in ankylosing spondylitis. The readout of the rewind study for Trulicity, and the initiation of several phase 3 studies including our anti IL-23 for ramucirumab for psoriasis and ulcerative colitis.","Before we go to the Q&A session, let me briefly sum up the progress we've made this quarter. In Q1, new products accounted for 25% of total revenue, and nearly 30% of our human pharma revenue. Volume grew in our human Pharma business by 4% despite recent patent expirations. And when excluding the strategic exits, our animal health business returned to positive performance growth. We realized significant efficiencies in our cost structure leading to operating margin expansion of 775 basis points excluding FX. And we have main pipeline progress this quarter with the launch of Verzenio in the first line metastatic breast cancer in the US. The launch of Taltz for psoriatic arthritis in Germany and positive phase 3 data for new indications for both Taltz and Cyramza. ","Finally, we returned $1.7 billion to shareholders via the dividend and share repurchase. This concludes our prepared remarks. Now I'll turn the call over to Phil Johnson to moderate the Q&A session.","Phil Johnson","Thank you, Dave. We would like to take questions from as many callers as possible during the Q&A session. So we do ask that you limit your questions to two or to a single two-part question. Lia, you can provide the instructions for the Q&A session and then we're ready for the first caller.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","Our first question is from line of Greg Gilbert with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Greg Gilbert","Thanks. Good morning, team. First, Dan, congrats to you in your new role. Dave, can you talk about the use of Bari outside the US in terms of mix of strengths and any post marketing safety data that you have to bolster your case with the FDA? And secondly on the subject of drug pricing in the US. What types of changes are you expecting the administration to put forth? You can be specific as you'd like but at least conceptually would love your opinion and how do you think Lilly is positioned relative to those potential changes? Thanks.","Phil Johnson","Great, thank you for the questions. We are actually going to have Christi Shah, President of Lilly Bio-Med to take your question on the use of the two different doses outside the US and any o-US data that may be helpful as we present our case to the FDA. And then Dave you'll have the question on drug pricing. Christi?","Christi Shaw","So outside the US over 40 countries you have both the 2 and 4 mg approved. And the majority of the use is in the 4 mg with remarkable efficacy, really patients getting their lives back and the safety continues to hold up that we see no new signals that are different than what we submitted to the FDA. And will continue I think yesterday's ADCOM showed for sure the unanimous vote on the efficacy of the 4 mg is important to patients in the US. So we want both the 2 and the 4 mg approved in the US for those patients.","David Ricks","Yes. Thanks, Greg. Obviously, big topic drug pricing. I mean it's hard to speculate exactly what the administration will say or do, but I think I can comment on what pharmas position has been and Lilly's as well, which is as it relates to a leading pain at the pharmacy counter and reducing the burden of list prices that consumers pay at the counter, we've been long been proponents of rebate pass-through, both in commercial plans and Part D. And I think the most important action that the administration could take would be to create either set of experiments or mandate a rebate pass-through for patients in the Part D program. This would I think immediately impact seniors cash flow and pocketbook, as well as I think helped to normalize the incentives on gross to net spread. So that I would be personally surprise if that wasn't part of the commentary, and that's something we've long stood for. So that would be I think a positive development from our perspective. The HHS Secretary has commented on Part B and the lack of market mechanism there. I would expect that to be a topic of discussion. And then we do see increased desire under this administration to approve waivers for Medicaid, giving states flexibility in a variety of forms to manage their own programs. And I would expect to see more of that. Finally, we worked closely with this administration on trade agenda to balance the incentives that foreign markets have to suppress drug pricing which are primarily exports from the US. We've had some early signs of success there with the Korea free trade agreement. We'll keep on that. I think long term, US needs to use is trading power to help equalize that sharing across sort of advertising the R&D expense that it takes to create the new innovations, which are becoming even more frequently from the industry. So we watch that carefully and continue advocate for pro innovation, pro patient choice, as well as policies that can make sure that this innovation, this industry can continue innovate and prosper for years to come. So all those topics are front of mind and will keep working out, Greg. ","Operator","Very good. It's the line of John Boris with SunTrust. Please go ahead.","John Boris","Thanks for taking the questions and congratulations on the robust results. Just back to Olumiant. Can you just quantify the number of patient years of therapy that you have on Olumiant, not just in the clinical package but how many or how much patient years or number of patient years of therapy that you have abroad especially since it's heavily skewed towards 4 mg? And then on Taltz, on the Novartis call, they clearly indicated that they also had a wholesaler de-stock and buyout. In addition to that was giving away a lot of free products. And then obviously copay accumulators are also a topic that is penalizing patients on deductibles. Can you provide some commentary on the miss on Taltz and the impact across your business of potentially copay accumulator going forward?","Phil Johnson","Great, John. Thank you for the questions. So Christi if you want to start with the Taltz question and then we'll figure out who's going to be best position here to give some of the numbers on the patient years exposures for Olumiant and the clinical trial program.","Christi Shaw","And can you give me the clarity on the Taltz question that was with term -- ","John Boris","I think the Novartis indicated they gave away a lot of free product through initial sampling. How much did that impact IL-70 uptake in the quarter particular Taltz? ","Christi","So for Taltz, we did have some inventory changes which were the biggest rationale for our decline from Q4 to Q1 in terms of dollars. But our demand was up in terms of Q4, Q4. And in fact our NBrx has grown 30% sequentially in the first quarter. So we're seeing actually real demand coming through. I can't really comment on the others, and how they count their inventories. The accumulator program I think our goal is to make sure that patients get access to every medicine that we provide and that their doctors think they need. So whether that a little bit of rebating, whether that's copay assistance et cetera that passed through that Dave talked about earlier. It's also important to ensure the patient's get access, but we haven't had issues to date.","David Ricks","And then John I don't think here in the room we have numbers on the patients that are in some of the overseas registries for follow-up. I think Dan you do have some information on the clinical trial program and the number of patients and patient years exposure.","Dan Skovronsky","Yes. Thanks, John. So in the safety data we presented to the Advisory Committee was based on more than 7, 800 patient years in our clinical trials. And that establishes the safety database for baricitinib from clinical trial experience. Your question referred also to the commercial experience outside the United States, where obviously they've been many, many more patients exposed to the drug. Although, we don't have exact numbers for patient years exposure. As you heard from Christi, despite that extensive exposure, we haven't seen any new safety signals. So while we agreed that VTE is a potential risk of this drug. We haven't seen that manifest in the clinical experience.","Operator","Very good. That is the line of Tim Anderson with Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Tim Anderson","Thank you. A couple of questions. Going back to Taltz. So in the class of IL-17 in general J&J is running the Phase 3 eclipse trial comparing their IL-23 to Novartis is IL-17. You have both of these mechanisms either on the market or in development. So I'm hoping you have some perspective on what you think is the better more effective mechanism in psoriasis. And if that J&J trial comes out in favor of Tremfya, doesn't that have a potential indirect impact on Taltz? And second question on your GIP\/GLP one, I know you've said in the past we're supposed to see Phase 2 data this year. Can you say what the likely venue will be and maybe preview what you're hoping to see in that data?","Phil Johnson","Great, Tim. Thank you for the question. So Christi to you for the question on Taltz, IL-23 versus IL-17 and then Enrique over to you for your first question of the day on the GIP\/GLP.","Christi Shaw","Sure. I mean, first of all, what I would say is thank goodness for patience we have so many more newer medications that are providing such higher efficacy. So IL-23, IL-17, they are going to be great for patients and it's going to spend the time to tap into that older market where the older TNS really lack efficacy relatively speaking. So the other thing is patients really churn through different modalities, each patient might need something different, they response to one and not the other, so we're really confident glad that we have both in our portfolio and we believe there will be specific patients for each. Specific to Taltz, as we look at the future the very short-term, not only is the psoriatic arthritis indication starting to kick off, these are dermatology really move in the first quarter and we think it's due to the psoriatic arthritis s indication really solidifying that efficacy there, but we also have our own head-to-head psoriatic arthritis readout later this year versus Humira, and then we have our ankylosing spondylitis data too that we have one of two studies that have completed. The second will be at the end of this year. So a lots happening with Taltz and we feel very good about our chances are winning the market place.","Enrique Conterno","So, we've been an excited for quite a sometime about GIP\/GLP clearly, the hurdle for this product is pretty high and we want to see their superior outcome when it comes to hemoglobin A1C and weight loss, this will be current GLP. We expect that we're going to be disclosing some of this data either later late this year or ADA next year. We have to see. ","Operator","Next is a line of Geoff Meecham from Barclays. Please go ahead. ","Geoff Meecham "," Hey, guys. Good morning and thanks a lot for the question. Just have a few more for Enrique and diabetes. So Trulicity growth has been great but how is the influential do you feel like rewind could be positive or negative relative to the current trajectory? And then Jardiance SLT-2 class is growing but we've haven't quite seen a tipping point for Jardiance just like guidelines, how do you think that could play out? And what do you think that could be and then I know it's been a lot of very questions already but if it's just a two mg dose that's approve maybe help us with the commercial positioning. Obviously weaker but I just want to give your context for that? Thanks.","Phil Johnson","Meecham, thank you for the question. And Enrique will go to you for the first two questions with Trulicity and Jardiance. And then the Christi over to you for a question on 2 mg dose for baricitinib commercial implication.","Enrique Conterno","Yes. Maybe just to start with framing the Trulicity quarters because we have another strong quarter continued solid growth. We basically have seen that the increased promotion but the new launches is basically having some impact in market acceleration, but we see both -- we see a very good market growth and we see basically good share performance with Trulicity in a more competitive environment. So we very much like our position we have a strong access position as well and finally I'm calling something that sometimes it's under estimated but it's the patient experience that we basically receive from physicians, from patient themselves. We have an excellent real world efficacy and which is very simply delivered. So we're very excited about that. Clearly, we wind us and change any of that but it is extremely important because we believe the longer-term for us to be competitive in this class we will need cardiovascular outcomes. As it relates to the SGLT2s, clearly we have been seen some very good growth of Jardiance but we had a pretty important event in Q1 related to the exclusion from CBS. Jardiance still has very good access and what we basically have seen post the rebasing of the prescriptions of patients, many patients have been switch and we basically have seen resumed growth over the last few weeks. Clearly the SGLT2 class and Jardiance in particulars still a very small part of the overall prescriptions. We estimate that about 30% of patients with diabetes have established for the vascular disease. So the opportunity for us is of continued growth and we're working to accelerate Jardiance and being Jardiance catalyst for the growth of the class.","Christi Shaw","Thanks Geoff for the question. I think you saw yesterday the reinforcement by everyone with the 4 milligram dose is really needed for patients from an efficacy standpoint. So our goal is to actually have both doses available and we continue to study both the 2 and the 4 milligrams and other studies that are ongoing. ","Operator","Next we go to line of Chris Schott with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.","Chris Schott ","Great, thanks very much for the questions. First one was just on the Humalog performance in the quarter and some of the rebates. So just two questions there, first, can you just quantify what the benefit was in the quarter? And second, can you just elaborate and what's happening with mix year and can we think about that is sustainable? My second question was on Taltz channel dynamics is under question just quantifying what we saw in terms of the work down of this quarter. And you've also get some very healthy volume trends but can you talk a little bit more about the underlying price dynamics in the IL-17? Are there other pressures we should be thinking about beyond just channel work down the quarter that could offsets of that volume growth? Thank you.","Phil Johnson","Chris. Thank you for the question. Just to understand the second question. You mentioned mix being sustainable, is that specific to Humalog or that more broadly focused across the portfolio products in the U.S.","Chris Schott ","I was actually specifically with the Humalog, but if there is a broader trend we'd love to hear that as well.","Phil Johnson","Okay. Very good, so if you love to the or Enrique if you talk about the Humalog in addition of the mix and then over to Christi for the Taltz channel dynamics. Joshua Smiley, if you are going to make any overall comments and repeat a one on or we generally seeing in the U.S. across our portfolio for mix. Enrique?","Enrique Conterno","Very good. So when it comes to Humalog of course, strong quarter, we saw about a $50 million benefit in the quarter related to changes in the estimates of rebates and discounts. Part of that was Medicaid and part of that other payers mix changes. We basically see some of those benefits continuing throughout the year of course some of that is also growing as part of Q1. In essence, we are seeing lower Medicaid claims and basically other dynamics that are slightly favorable when it comes to payer mix, when it comes -- specifically to Humalog. Now, when we look broadly the portfolio, it is pretty clear that those Medicaid claims is something that we see across the portfolio but not all of our products are as exposed as of the incidents are.","Christi Shaw","Sure, so specifically the inventory change we saw was about $32 million quarter four and quarter one. And if we look at the price dynamics and volume growth, ours volume growth and as we look to the future, if patients really need the best medications out there, we haven't seen a strong need yet to significantly rebate. I know Novartis in its call said that on their but that's not the same case for us.","Operator","Yes. We have line of Andrew Baum with Citi. Please go ahead. ","Andrew Baum ","Hi. Couple of questions, please. Could you indicate your assessments have been impacted setting that [indiscernible] [Technical Difficulty] in 2019 given the new business, the third-party patients? Second, could you talk your expectations for Alimta post 189 data as well as the stalling of the 340B expansion which I assumed is health view? And then finally on business development and oncology generally, I know that my pay loss likely go to a competitor and also away that the deal flow we might have expected from to the in oncology not as yet transpired, but could you just update this on your commitment particularly to immuno biology and expectations and valuations you see for and potential acquisition for partnering candidate externally. Thank you.","Company Representative","Great. Andrew, thank you for the questions, we'll go to Enrique for the first question on the doughnut hole in 2019, and then Sue if would like to comment on expectations for Alimta moving forward as well as project perspective as you presented on oncology business development. And now the Dave or Josh you want to give a corporate perspective feel free to augment. Enrique?","Enrique Conterno","So the increased coverage in during the doughnut hole for 2018, when we look at our overall portfolio is about $200 million, most of it being driven by diabetes","Sue Mahony","Yes, with regard to Alimta, clearly, we're very pleased with the Keynote-189 data and as I mentioned earlier, we have seen growth in this quarter on Alimta in the U.S. 8% growth overall and 3% that was price, 5% that was volume. We've also continue to see increase in each brand in combination. I think we don't give focus on individual products, and I think it's key to note that about 50% of our sale is come from first line and second line, about 40% is first line. With that we are as I said, seeing a stabilization in overall share market and an increase in each brand. We continue to see unexpected that increase as we saw some people waiting for the phase 3 trials data outcome before turning the combination of the Alimta, Keytruda and carbo. So we are really pleased with that. We think that it's concerns the benefit that we seen with Alimta, historically as a standard of care in the first line non-small cell lung cancer setting, and we continue to see that will be the case going forward. And with regard to a business development, we are continuing to be very interested in BD across all areas including IL, and we have told previously about offshore bank deal which is a bet that we have one of the best that we will be placing with regards to RNA based vaccines. We anticipate that we will be doing other deals both in the IL space and in other areas in oncology in the future. We're also bringing in new people into our team again. We motioned we\u2019ve on-boarded two physicians recently, one from Duke and the other from the Memorial Sloan Kettering and you will see us continuing to bringing more external talent. ","David Ricks","I would just say we're highly committed to use balance sheet to expand our portfolio with BD, we've talk about clinical stage assets and particular and oncology's the number one target. So, Jeff I wouldn't read through the relative lack of activity most recently as any signs that we're change our conviction. Of course, we need to look at each idea and make sure make sense for us to only make sure we like sciences and valuations are appropriate. But as we'll be discipline on those matters but strategically we understand, we need to be active externally and you can count us. If you need to look at all available choices that to our pipeline in particular in oncology.","Phil Johnson","Okay, thank you, Dave. And then back to question that John Boris had asked but we did not have a data for. Thank you to Olumiant team for providing that we now have 11,500 patients' years of exposure with baricitinib. And when you add in the post approval exposures. Lia, we can go to next caller please.","Operator","Thank you. It will be the line of Tony Butler with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.","Tony Butler ","Thanks very much. Two questions if I may. One is, the pipeline related, one is galcanezumab and you do have some data at AN today. But I'm just curious with respect to the range of somewhat similar products that we'll come to market as a cluster, I assume later this year. What makes gout stand out? And can it do so without having a second agent in the bag is it less middle hand. And then second, back to the previous question asked on immuno biology. You have had relationship with an antibody base company I assume for biospecifics. And I'm just curious it seems to be an interesting area with CD1 through engagers in. Could you speak more to that because it's a way maybe to back end and to an area and which you didn't have to go through reset direct PD1? Thanks very much.","Phil Johnson","Okay, thank you for the questions, Tony. Christi we will go to you for the galcanezumab and how we intend to succeed in that market place. And over to Sue for the question on immuno biology biospecifics et cetera.","Christi Shaw","Sure, So, Tony thanks for the question. I think this is an area where migraine patient haven't had and an option for few decades, and here we are with the couple of agents coming out quickly together. So, first of all, I think the really good thing to really have a couple of companies activating these patients. So, the first piece is who is going to be better at the consumer driven area, the direct to consumer. And I think our chance is there are very good and we have a history of that. On the day specifically, we have 50%, 75% and 100% measurements endpoint and we are the only one is actually showing at 10% to 15% of the patient have the ability will be free of migraine totally. The other think we have is the galca is fast and durable. We see results as early as month one and we see the results continue through the 12 months that we've looked at. You were right, we do have the cluster data coming up and nothing has ever worked in this type of migraine and if we do it'll be a huge win for patients and obviously is then good for differentiating galcanezumab. So our second half launch, we're well prepared for to be competitive and we think we have some differentiation there. ","Sue Mahony","Yes. Tony thanks for the question, biospecifics, yes, as we've looked at our I\/O portfolio and what we want to do, we want to understand really what the next generation of IO agents are. And we've taken two bets. I mention one, and we'll be taking others by the way but two that we've taken at the moment, one is the RNA based vaccines that we think really could be potentially disruptive in the future. The other is the biospecifics and as you have mentioned we have ongoing collaborations and actually a number of biospecifics looking at different targets that should be coming into the clinic very soon. We're excited by those. Another asset that we've got in the clinic that we talked about before but not too much is the TIM-3 and we're pretty excited by our TIM-3 and think that we've got a best-in-class asset there. We've also got an IDO. We know that there's some data on IDO we have to see what happens there, but we believe that we've got one that again could be differentiated; so those are two assets we've got in clinic now and as you mentioned we're taking bets on the RNA based vaccines and the by specifics. ","Operator","Thank you. That's the line of Vamil Divan with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. ","Vamil Divan","Great, thanks for taking my question. May be just following up on a couple there were topics that were discussed earlier again on baricitinib kind of coming out of yesterday's discussion just I know you have a phase-3 program in atopic dermatitis. Can you just talk about how you see sort of risk\/reward and the attractiveness of a product like this in atopic dermatitis where I would think acceptance of safety concerns may be a little bit lower? And then the second question I have just following up on the question on the CGRPs, just curious if you could give your thoughts given we have Botox on the market and also some oral products that are generally used for preventative use, would you expect that the CGRP antibodies are going to use only patients upon through those products or do you think that there might be an opportunity to be used ahead of either. [Technical Difficulty]","Phil Johnson","Great, Vamil. Thank you for the question. So Christi we'll go to you for both the baric, atopic term question, as well as where you see CGRP potentially being used.","Christi Shaw","Sure. So baricitinib you know each disease they have its own benefit risk ratio so if you look at what we're studying our phase 2 data with Lupus. We have both the two and the four milligram. If you look at atopic derm, the data that we read out in phase two, the two milligram did work; it just took a little bit longer. So whether it\u2019s two or four you know we know the patients will get better there. So each disease, they really have its own dosing and for rheumatoid arthritis we strongly believe the two and four milligrams needs to be available in the US as it is in over 40 countries. On the CGRP side, we expect patients to cycle through the generics and most of them already have there's like 4 to 5 million patients that are on preventatives and then there we believe there's a few million more that aren't on preventative and should be. So we have every expectation that there'll be a requirement for them to have used for example triptan before they; they go on to a CGRP, but we do expect it will compete well versus Botox. I mean getting 21 to 24 injections in your around your head for doesn't seem as good as having a monthly injection if I\u2019m a patient. So I think we have an advantage there and they have the same hurdles from an access standpoint. So I believe that usage will come and we\u2019re already talking to payers about how we make sure that access is available to the patients that need it. ","Operator","And that's a line of Mark Goodman with UBS. Please go ahead.","Mark Goodman","Just to continue on with the CGRP conversation as well as Lasmiditan. Can you just talk about the safety profiles that you see and how you think these things are going to be all used? I mean presumably if everything makes it to the market, how the orals will be used? Your oral versus CGRP orals. Second question is Taltz, just can you explain the specialty pharmacy buying pattern issue and what was the impact on Taltz in the quarter and there were also some inventory patterns with respect to Forteo. Can you quantify that as well? Thanks.","Phil Johnson","Okay. So Dan if you wouldn't mind talking about some of the safety profiles for a CGRP monoclonal antibody as well as Lasmiditan. Christi, if you could then get the second part of that piece of the question that was how we see Lasmiditan being used relative to oral CGRPs potentially and then if you could go over again the Taltz specialty pharmacy buying patterns that we've seen in effect of this quarter\u2019s revenues proposal. ","Dan Skovronsky","Great, thanks. So with respect to the safety profile of galcanezumab, I think we've been really encouraged by what we've seen in our phase-3 trials on safety. And I think that's critically important for a preventative for migraine patients could be on for a very long time to be well tolerated by the patients and have a very clean safety profile. So that's an important differentiator for galcanezumab and for the class probably of anti-CGRP antibodies. When you get to the orals which are abortive, the safety profile could be a bit different and we've seen some evidence of that for the oral CGRPs and I think Christi you were going to comment on commercial differentiation. ","Christi Shaw","Sure. I think that's one of the big advantages that we bring in the marketplace is a platform that we're building for pain. So we have the prevention and galcanezumab, the treatment in Lasmiditan and then we have Tanezumab coming. With the mechanism of action Lasmiditan is different than the oral CGRPs. And if we look at patients not everyone responds to the same agent. So we believe that they'll be used similarly for an acute phase and that not all patients will respond to one or the other. So obviously our goal would be to win in that marketplace and position ourselves well for that. But we're working on the package to submit later this year. And then on the Forteo question, I'm sorry the Taltz specialty pharmacy, I think I answered that. That was like a $33 million that was the inventory impact for Taltz but demand was positive quarter-to- quarter. And then on Forteo, the last question on Forteo was basically what we saw was inventory cam in at a different way. We saw the wholesaler buying patterns actually increased volume in Q4 of last year. Some of that has been de-stocking in Q1 but not all of it. We did have somewhat formally loss with Tim Lowe's, the new competitive entries but that was a really small impact to the overall performance for Forteo. ","David Ricks ","Okay. I am just going to add I guess there was another question about using for the CGRP antibodies in refractory patients. Just to point out that all of our phase-3 pivotal studies had patients who failed on at least two other modalities. So that's likely the indication I'm not sure if that has a big commercial bearing because those patients who have had - are chronic migrainers or episodic migrainers have tried many other things. So I think the pool of available patients for prevention will be there. The data in our program and I believe all the competitors is on to failures and despite that and the data we\u2019re present today is incredibly strong, large extent of patients have at least 50% reduction in headache days per month. ","Operator","And that is Dave Risinger with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. ","David Risinger","Yes, thanks very much. So I have two questions. First just to follow up on the CGRPs. There was a Reuters article today that described how Express Scripts is asking for lower list prices on CGRPs. Could you just provide a comment on that and whether a manufacturer could trust PDMs to not extract significant rebates in the event that a manufacturer does list, the list price lower than expected and then second with respect to Trulicity rewind, the slide that you published this morning indicates an internal readout in 2018, but not an external readout and I just wanted to understand that a little bit better because clinicaltrials.gov indicates July completion of that trial. Thank you very much. ","Phil Johnson","Great, thank you, Dave. Well, the article you're referencing was specific to CGRPs. Your question really more of a policy question. So Dave if you would mind taking the first part of Dave Risinger question then Enrique over to you for the Trulicity rewind, timing of internal readout and top-line press release relative to presentation to medical media. ","David Ricks","Yes. Thanks, Dave. I did glance at that interview with Steve Miller this morning. I was really happy to see this Express Scripts is now for value-based pricing. Of course, we've been for this kind of construct for years because we believe in the performance of our products and I think in the case of migraine drugs and many other drugs. Diabetes, other autoimmune drugs even in oncology I think we're willing to enter into these discussions. The point about lower list prices is a little bit moods, I think the idea that the price varies in a value-based scheme based on actual product performance I think that's the key piece. So the value determination we will need to do it's difficult to comment specifically on launched products, would we trust the PDMs? Well, I think we worked closely with all the major payers in the US. I am happy to see the ESI is now changing their view and supportive of this kind of construct. We'd be happy to work with them on it. ","Enrique Conterno","So when it comes to a rewind, we do expect internal readout in the second half with the top-line press release likely in early Q4, and we will be targeting the full disclosure of the results at the next year's ADA meeting. ","Phil Johnson","And Dave, just to be clear the city.gov date that you cite is the expectation for the last event. Obviously, with it being event-driven there is uncertainty around that. Even once we have the last event occur that would trigger then the analysis to be done. It does take a number of months to go ahead and get all that final visits and data into the system clean and validate the database, and then run our tables, figures and listings and report out. So Lia, if we can go to the next caller please. ","Operator","Very good. It's line of line of Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Jami Rubin","Thank you. May be for you David and Christi, I don't want to put words in your mouth but it sure sounds like you're not going to launch baricitinib unless you can get both two and four milligrams approved is that correct? And can you cite specific examples where the FDA goes against the panel recommendation? I know recently there was a Pacira that was approved even though the panel went against it but that was a non-opioid drug and in this case there is another jack on the market. So I'm just wondering if you can comment on your level of confidence that you can convince the FDA to vote against the FDA panel on the four milligram tablet. And if you can't would it is your decision not to launch Baricitinib for RA and to what extent would that affects your 5% top-line growth objective? Thanks very much.","Phil Johnson","Great, Christi. You want to go ahead and answer the question related to the launch two and four et cetera and maybe Josh if you want to comment on expectations versus 2020. ","Christi Shaw","Sure. As I said before I think the promising thing we saw is that there was unanimous, unanimity in terms of the four milligram efficacy. And so the thing that you saw in the voting was based on a specific indication and as we continue to work with the FDA on our labeling and our path to the market that's where we can say we\u2019re the highest unmet need. So that the patients who are suffering so much in the United States have access as they do in 40 other countries to improve their pain and improve their lives. So we will continue to talk to them about what is the path for both two and four milligrams and what is the indication that we can best serve the highest unmet need population. So I think one of the things you saw in the vote was the wording was very specific to the indication that was presented which was at after -- methotrexate, thank you. And then let's see the outcome. So I can't comment or recall any AdCom in terms of overruling but I think as I said it wouldn't be overruling the AdCom if we look at a different and carve out indication for four milligrams that benefits patients the most and make it 2 milligram available as well to lower risk patients. ","Joshua Smiley","Thanks, Jami. I think we've been clear about our growth expectations through 2020, which is a five% compound annual growth rate and the five% is a minimum and not dependent on any single product where we're confident in our growth prospects. I think if you look at where we are on Q1. We're ahead of our targets to get to a 5% growth in 2020. The strength of the new products that we have on the market today and the potential new launches in pain and other things that we've talked about already I think give us good confidence that we'll be there in 2020. We're still excited about the prospects of Olumiant particularly outside the US where we\u2019ve already launched. I think by just looking at analyst models, the dollars associated with the US sales of Olumiant in 2020. I think in most of your models are pretty small anyway, but we're confident in strength to the portfolio that new products will continue to drive our growth and we're -- that 5% minimum is still valid. ","Operator","Yes. It\u2019s the line of Steve Scala with Cowen. Please go ahead.","Steve Scala","Thank you. A couple questions. First on rewind. There's some concern about the less sick population being studied versus some of your competitors studies. Can you talk about how you design rewind to still achieve its endpoint despite its population possibly generating fewer events so maybe you can comment on how you arrived at the trial size, duration and also the statistical power? And then secondly, a couple questions on Elanco yesterday was announced that you hired a CFO for Elanco; is this newly created position and why was it done now? And can you comment on poultry trends? I think you've commented, no, can you comment on swine and cattle, you already commented on poultry. Thank You.","Phil Johnson","Christi, thank you for the question. So we'll go around the horn here. Enrique, if you'll take the first question on the design of rewind, Josh, Elanco CFO hiring that was announced yesterday and then Jeff you can give some more details on other parts of portfolio including swine that we didn't comment on in the prepared remarks. Enrique?","Enrique Conterno","Well, Rewind is an event-driven trial. So we will basically have closer of this trial-one, we hit a certain number of events and the trial is appropriately powered for us to show basically a statistical difference if the product were to show it that is meaningful. So we are pretty confident. I do know that we got a lot of questions about the population that we have enrolled, whether the population is maybe less sick. We at this point in time I think we basically want to see the outcomes of the trial. We do have a lot of expertise when it comes to designing cardiovascular trials. And we're confident that we've designed this trial in the appropriate way. Dan, I don't know if you want to make any other comments. ","Dan Skovronsky","No, that's correct. I would just add that we'll have one of the longer duration trials here in terms of the follow-up time on these patients, which gives us sort of more area under the curve time for the drug to work. And have its effect on cardiovascular outcomes. So although the lowering right mandates a larger longer trial, the increased duration actually we see as benefits to showing effect. ","Joshua Smiley","I think our first our strategic evaluation of Elanco is continuing as planned and we'll be in a position in our Q2 earnings call to announce our strategic direction. Our hiring of Chris Jensen as a CFO for Elanco adds to that analysis, he brings good external experience. And I think will position us well for any future direction that we announce and look to execute after our Q2 earnings call. ","Jeff Simmons","Yes, Steve. So first system industry perspective at a high level, beef continues to be stable and continue to grow. Dairy is a slower recovery expected probably as an industry later in 2019, and swine I think the eyes are a little bit on trade but again pretty stable overall. So we feel pretty good about the overall industry economics, no material impact on us. I think everyone's; as Josh said in his comments we're going to continue to watch trade. I don't think it's relative to a feed additive issue or anything like that. It would be much more just about the impact that trade barriers could have on the overall economics especially of the US industry. At this time, we don't see anything and definitely no impact on us. If you look at Elanco\u2019s business, food animal will return to growth in the second half as we've stated. We see that led heavily by poultry and swine, less so by ruminants. ","Operator","Next is the line of Umer Raffat with Evercore. Please go ahead. ","Umer Raffat","Hi, thanks so much for taking my questions. I noticed phase three investigating a really high dose 4.5 milligrams in diabetes and I was just curious, a, what your thought processes but also your expectations on weight loss in that trial? And I would have thought that at such a high dose you might have included a semaglutide comparator as well. So just curious how you thought about that trial? And then in a quick follow up on animal health. Is Posilac and Optaflexx still a driver that's been weighing in just wanted to understand the market access pressures to livestocks? Thank you. ","Phil Johnson","Umer. Thank you for the question. So Enrique on the recently initiated study for Trulicity using some higher doses and then Jeff back to you for some animal health dynamics with Posilac and Optaflexx. ","Enrique Conterno","So we are studying both 3 and 4.5 milligrams. We believe those doses can be well tolerated if appropriately titrated. And we basically have design this trial in a way that it can show actually a difference from a regulatory perspective vis-\u00e0-vis dula 1.5 when it comes to hemoglobin A1C. We are also expecting to see important difference when it comes to weight loss, but its okay that we made the A1C end point from risk benefit perspective in order to get this product approval. ","Jeff Simmons","Yes. So market access issues continue to be definitely and an area that we\u2019re focused on and again we have taken some proactive actions as Josh mentioned with the strategic exiting as we are assessing our decision here with Posilac and exiting the business, but headwinds do continue for Posilac. I would note on our food animal business, first of all international grew as you will note in the backup slides that we saw close to 2% growth in o-US food animal. The net 10% though I would highlight came from one majority of that being Posilac and the declining in use. And again that\u2019s driven by our exit and then some U.S. buying patterns relative to Q1 of 2017. On ractopamine, competition continues although we are continuing to see our business hold and remain stable in this area. ","Operator","We go to its line of Jason Gerberry with Bank of America. Please go ahead. ","Q \u2013 Jason Gerberry ","Hi, good morning, and thanks for taking my question. First question is on Verzenio. Feedback from Pfizer is that at least in the U.S. the metastatic market for the CDK0\/4 agents is getting increasingly well penetrated and that maybe more of the near to medium term growth is shifting to x-US expansion, at least until label expansion occurs with more early use in breast cancer setting. So just kind of curious, if you agree with that assessment and as we look at Verzenio, the real growth opportunity in the U.S. is going to be contingent upon getting new patients start share versus your competitors. And then just the second question on CGRP front, how important you think early mover advantages in this category? One of the three kind of more advanced players in the market faces some uncertainty into it June PDUFA date, so just kind of curious how important you think early mover advantage would be in the category? Thanks. ","Phil Johnson","Jason, thank you for the question. So Sue, we go to you for Verzenio question and then Christi over to you for the question on CGRP first mover advantage. ","Sue Mahony","Yes. Thanks for the question on Verzenio. With regards to, well, first, we\u2019re very pleased with the uptick I think as Josh mentioned we\u2019ve got 15% huge brand share. And when we launched it we launched with the single agent activity and the combination with [Indescernible] and we should back at third of the market literally just the end of February we launch with the larger indication which is the rheumatoid just two third of the market and we\u2019re now 16% on each brands, we feel good about that. And with regards to the actual market, we see plenty of opportunity actually for both growth in the market and also taking share with regards to growth about 50% of patients are treated with CDK4 and 6inhibitors, so again we see an opportunity there. One of the things that we\u2019re trying to do is to ensure that physicians really understand patients that can benefit the most and we present a data on pace of the concerning clinical characteristics where with Verzenio, we were able to see that even in those patients we could see robust an efficacy similar to the overall patient population. And obviously with the data that we\u2019ve got with the rheumatoid which is well the 28.2 month PFS is seen as robust as well, we see that as beneficial and we also see we got differentiated molecule with single-agent activity and continue dosing. So, our believe is that we can both compete within the market and that there is still continues to be opportunity to growth in the for the overall CDK market in the U.S. and of course o-US we have submitted to Europe and Japan and we hope to get approval later this year in both those geographies. ","Christi Shaw","So on how important CGRP in early mover is, look at different classes, it depends on the differentiation strategy pieces, in general though three to four months is not a big deal, I mean by the time you get your label and get approved, then you\u2019re talking about access, really its not a big difference. If you are looking at bigger delay and you have two agents in the marketplace and you are 12 to 18 months later that is a detriment for share. ","Operator","Next is line of Alex Arfaei with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. ","Prakhar","Good morning. This is [Prakhar] for Alex Arfaei. I just had one question. Could you provide additional thoughts behind your decision to discontinue the base in a bit on its own? And yet advance the combination with the anti-PG antibody. And what was the milestone achieved to drive this efficiency. Thank you. ","Phil Johnson","Great. Thank you for the question. Dan if you like to comment?","Dan Skovronsky","Yes, thanks for that question. So you're correct that we terminated the monotherapy for our phase 2 base inhibitor. That was based on a combination of external data readouts which of course you're familiar with, as well as our internal look at the data. A theory behind this compound initially was that given its higher brain penetration, this would have a favorable, more favorable safety profile. However, we also sought to demonstrate efficacy in Phase 2 and that was futility was what drove us towards stopping it. Now the rationale to continuing in and of course in monotherapy that continues to be on base status and phase 3 for monotherapy. As you commented we continue with the combination. Here I think we have a growing understanding that we need to clear the Abeta out of the brain with a plot clearly antibody that's get centered PG and also inhibited to production. So hitting from both end is rationale there for the combo. ","Operator","Yes. It's the line of David Mirus with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. ","David Mirus","Good morning, a couple of questions. First going back on the administration's potential moves. When you mentioned the pass through pricing net of rebates. Can you address that assumes or does it assume that PVMs will willingly just make less money or how do you think mechanistically that will work without having an impact to PVMs. And then separately, if you can just provide us with, if you were to think of your top-10 or 20 products relative pricing average in the U.S. versus say developed Europe. What would you say the differential in net pricing would be? Is it as large as some people think or is it because of all the discounts that are much lower, thanks?","Phil Johnson","David. Thank you for the questions. Dave Ricks we'll have -- can you take both. ","David Ricks","Sure. So just on the rebate through. As it relates to the Part D program. We've done modeling ourselves as well as pharma. And I know CMS has as well. Then it isn't free as you point out. But as Scott has been saying his podium speeches lately we somehow device a system where the fixed subsidized well. And I think there is something ethically wrong with that. I think there is going to census about that even among PVM apparently. So the idea will be that premiums would modestly grow across Part D program. We're talking $1 or $2 per member per month is probably all that's necessary. In exchange for passing through some portion not a 100%. But some portion of rebates to consumers in the Part D program in particular when they're exposed to the donut hole and beyond that their share of traffic side. So that's the basic idea. In that model, I think Part D plan providers will just be make a trade- off which is slightly higher premiums in exchange for maybe pass through. And of course that math requires some assumptions about how much rebates pass through. Our position is that it needs to be well more than half. Both to reduce the [Indescernible] of middle man and manufacturers to raise fewer prices, which I think is a positive objective here, as well as to meaningful out of pocket, savings at the point of sale. In correction plan, the dynamics are a little bit different, but here I think the ultimate decider will be the ultimate payers which are commercial payers like our company and other Fortune 500 companies. I think they are the market makers not the PVMs. And I think if they decide that employees would like to have rebate pass through in their plans as a matter of competition for labor that's what will happen. And Lilly's made that choice for instance already and the PVMs we use are implementing it. And as the second question was the European pricing. And I think if you look at big markets like China, Japan and Germany. And then compare that to government pricing in the U.S. a blend of Medicaid DoD, BA and part D, I think most policy makers would be surprised to find that the US government pricing is really not that different across commonly used medications from those major markets. If you change the market basket, you include share single payer models that particularly market with where they have a lot of layers of approval which have the effective beating down manufacturing pricing or use long delay periods which erode IT et cetera. It's less of fair competition but I mentioned China and Japan, Germany is the next three biggest market. But also a relatively rapid market introduction closes to regulatory approval. And I think there are important apples-to-apples comparisons. That time analysis I think you should expect the pharma group to do more off as we continue through this regulatory phase of price reform. I think it will shed a favorable light on the kind of deals that the US government gets today. ","Operator","And that is the line of Steve Scala with Cowen. Please go ahead. ","Steve Scala","Thank you. A couple of questions. It was mentioned that you've seen lower Medicaid utilization but I am not clear on why you've seen that. So maybe you can amplify. And then secondly, the abemaciclib pancreatic Phase 2 study that was stopped, the trial was not to readout to late 2018 or early 2019. So was it stopped for futility at interim look for instance and does this failure in pancreatic decrease your interest in other new tumor types? Thank you. ","Phil Johnson","Thank you for the question. And Enrique, if you would like to comment on the first question on the lower than expected Medicaid utilization. And then over to you Sue on the pancreatic cancer trial.","Enrique Conterno","So we make our approvals for rebates and discounts before we actually receive the claims. In the case Medicaid, it tends to lack significantly more some of those clear -- receive of those claims significantly more than in commercial plans, another plans. So we basically have our estimate and what we basically have seen is that the claim that we have received have been lower than we had expected. So that's -- now there could be a number of reasons for that but at this point in time we are basically thinking as well okay as we look into the past what does this mean for us we are looking accruals for Q1 and for the rest of the year and the reason what we have a benefit coming from Medicare when we look at entire year. ","Sue Mahony","Yes. Steve, now the pancreatic study was actually went to the final endpoint and we stopped the study. So I think you might be looking at cg.gov may have late timeline just as we are looking at future follow up with patients. And it does not by any mean reduce our confidence in moving forward in other indications with abemaciclib. This is pretty high bar. Pancreatic as you know is a tough gemo type and we are looking at clearly targeting tumor with the CDK pathway is important and also we do believe the combination is probably the way to go. We have a number of non breast indications that we are looking and you should see some trials starting later this year, as well as of course our lifecycle planning in breast cancer. ","Phil Johnson","Great. Thank you. I think we've gotten through 17 different types of questions. And it sounds like there are no more folks in the queue. So I'll turn it over to David Ricks to close our session. And Lia after that you can provide the replay instructions.","David Ricks","Thanks, Phil.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Dr. John Lechleiter. Please go ahead, sir.","John C. Lechleiter - Eli Lilly & Co.","Thank you. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us for Eli Lilly & Company's third quarter 2016 earnings call. I'm John Lechleiter, Lilly's Chairman, President and CEO. Joining me here in Indianapolis on today's call are Derica Rice, our Chief Financial Officer; Dr. Jan Lundberg, President of Lilly Research Laboratories; Dr. Sue Mahoney, President of Lilly Oncology; Enrique Conterno, President of Lilly Diabetes; Dave Ricks, President of Lilly Biomedicines; Chito Zulueta, President of Emerging Markets; Jeff Simmons, President of Elanco Animal Health; and Kristina Wright, Brad Robling, Chris Ogden, and Phil Johnson of Lilly's IR team.","During this call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations.

The information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It is not intended to be promotional and is not sufficient for prescribing decisions.","Before discussing key events for the quarter, I'll start, as usual, with a summary of our progress since the second quarter earnings call in late July and I'll use our strategic objectives framework for this discussion.","Our first strategic objective, grow revenue. Q3 revenue increased 4% on a constant currency or performance basis, driven by 7% pharmaceutical volume growth. Consistent with previous quarters, this year our new products, Trulicity, CYRAMZA, Jardiance, Basaglar, PORTRAZZA, and Taltz accounted for nearly all of that growth.","On our strategic objective, expand margins, our non-GAAP OpEx as a percentage of revenue declined 20 basis points compared to the third quarter 2015. We expect continued progress in the fourth quarter, as our full-year guidance at the midpoint of our ranges implies an improvement of about 200 basis points to 250 basis points in OpEx as a percent of revenue for the year.","Under the heading of sustaining a flow of innovation, olaratumab was approved in the U.S. last week for soft tissue sarcoma and will be sold under the trade name Lartruvo. Europe's CHMP provided positive opinions, recommending approval of olaratumab for soft tissue sarcoma and of GLXAMBI for type 2 diabetes. And along with AstraZeneca, we received Fast Track designation from the U.S. FDA for AZD3293, the oral BACE inhibitor for Alzheimer's disease.","On our strategic objective deploy capital to create value, we announced an agreement to","acquire Boehringer Ingelheim U.S. Animal Health vaccines business, filling a key strategic need in our companion animal portfolio. In both human pharma and animal health, we will continue to actively pursue external opportunities to enhance our future growth prospects.","Finally, during the quarter, we returned over $500 million to shareholders through our dividend. In summary, the progress we're making in 2016 places us on track to achieve each of our strategic objectives through 2020.","Now, let's move on to a review of the key events that occurred since our last earnings call. We continue to make progress on the regulatory front. As I just mentioned, here in the U.S., the FDA-approved Lartruvo in combination with doxorubicin for the treatment of adults with soft tissue sarcoma with a histologic subtype for which an anthracycline-containing regimen is appropriate and which is not amenable to curative treatment with radio therapy or surgery. This is the first FDA-approved front-line therapy for soft tissue sarcoma in four decades. It also marks the third product from our ImClone acquisition to receive regulatory approval.","This is an accelerated approval based on data from our Phase II trial. Continued approval","for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory study. The Phase III announced study is fully enrolled and is currently expected to complete in late 2018.","In Europe, we received a pair of recommendations for approval from the CHMP. The first","recommendation was for granting a conditional marketing authorization for Lartruvo in","combination with doxorubicin for the treatment of adults with advanced soft tissue sarcoma not amenable to curative treatment with radio therapy or surgery and who have not been previously treated with doxorubicin.","Similar to the U.S., Lartruvo was reviewed under the EMA's Accelerated Assessment program. As part of the conditional marketing authorization, we will need to provide results from our ongoing Phase III study. Until availability of the full data, the CHMP will review the benefits and risks of Lartruvo annually to determine whether the conditional marketing authorization can be maintained.","The second recommendation was for GLYXAMBI, a single tablet combining Jardiance, our SGLT-2 inhibitor, and TRADJENTA, a DPP-4 inhibitor. The specific recommendation was for use in adults 18 years and older with type 2 diabetes to improve glycemic control when metformin and\/or sulfonylurea and one of the individual components of GLYXAMBI do not provide adequate glycemic control or when a patient is already being treated with the free combination of Jardiance and TRADJENTA. GLYXAMBI, Jardiance and TRADJENTA are products of the Boehringer Ingelheim and Lilly diabetes alliance.","Finally, along with AstraZeneca, we received Fast Frack designation from the FDA for AZD3293, an oral Beta-secretase cleaving enzyme, or BACE inhibitor, being studied in Phase III trials for Alzheimer's disease.","On the clinical front, we announced that following a pre-planned interim analysis for MONARCH 2, an independent data monitoring committee provided the recommendation to continue the study without modification, as the interim efficacy criteria were not met. The MONARCH 2 trial compares abemaciclib with fulvestrant versus placebo with fulvestrant in women with hormone receptor positive human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. The trial will continue to completion in the first half of 2017.","At the European Society for Medical Oncology meeting, early data in lung cancer were presented on the combinations of KEYTRUDA with ALIMTA and of KEYTRUDA with CYRAMZA. KEYNOTE-021, a randomized Phase II study, included Cohort G studying KEYTRUDA added to ALIMTA plus carboplatin versus in ALIMTA plus carboplatin in first-line non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer patients regardless of PD-L1 expression level. The combination of KEYTRUDA and ALIMTA carbo nearly doubled the response rate compared to ALIMTA carbo alone.","There's been considerable focus within the investment community on the durability of responses. In this study, we were very pleased that patients on the KEYTRUDA ALIMTA carbo arm experienced progression-free survival of 13 months. While the overall survival data were not yet mature, roughly 75% of patients on both arms were still alive at one year. This is at the top end of results we've seen for any combination trial in a broad population of first-line non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer patients and we look forward to the presentation of additional data from this trial at future medical conferences.","Updated data were also presented from the KEYNOTE-098 study evaluating KEYTRUDA with CYRAMZA in second- to fourth-line non-small cell lung cancer. Here, too, we observed promising clinical activity, including durable responses. 80% of patients experienced a decrease in target lesions, spanning the spectrum of PD-L1 status, while the objective response rate was 30% with responses seen in both non-squamous and squamous non-small cell lung cancer patients. In addition, the disease control rate was 85% and median progression-free survival was not yet reached.","The data from both KEYNOTE-021-G and KEYNOTE-098 provide proof points for how we intend to deploy our diverse oncology portfolio across the three platforms of cell signaling, tumor micro environment and immuno-oncology to pursue a rational and differentiated combination","strategy across our diverse oncology portfolio in order to improve outcomes for patients.","Shifting to immunology, I'm pleased to report that we achieved the primary end point in the SPIRIT-P2 study of ixekizumab in patients with active psoriatic arthritis who had been treated with one or more conventional DMARDs as well as had an inadequate response to one or two TNF inhibitors or intolerance to a TNF inhibitor.","The results of SPIRIT-P2 further build on the existing benefit-risk profile Taltz obtained from a very large clinical program. With this second positive psoriatic arthritis study, we plan to submit ixekizumab for psoriatic arthritis in the U.S. in the first half of next year followed by submissions in Europe and other geographies, and we plan to present the data at a medical meeting in 2017. Keep in mind that psoriatic arthritis has already been approved in Japan.","At the EADV meeting in Vienna, we also presented initial data on our head-to-head study called IXORA-S of Taltz versus Stelara in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. The primary endpoint of the study was met, as Taltz demonstrated superiority to Stelara on the PASI 90 score at 12 weeks. These data reinforced the strong clinical profile of Taltz and we look forward to presenting additional data from this study next year.","As expected, earlier this month, we achieved last patient visit in the Expedition 3 trial of solanezumab in patients with mild dementia due to Alzheimer's disease. As a result, we plan to issue a top-line press release before the end of the year.","In other news, we announced the retirement of yours truly as President and Chief Executive Officer effective December 31 of this year. I will continue on Lilly's Board of Directors until the end of May, serving as non-Executive Chairman. Dave Ricks, currently President of Lilly Bio-Medicines will assume the role of President and Chief Executive Officer and join the board on January 1. Dave will become Chairman of the Board on June 1.","We announced an agreement to acquire Boehringer Ingelheim Vetmedica U.S. feline, canine and rabies vaccines portfolio, as well as a fully integrated manufacturing and R&D site and a number of pipeline assets for approximately $885 million, including the estimated cost of acquired inventory. This innovative platform of companion animal vaccines has high brand awareness and an established loyal customer base. The addition of these assets advances our strategy of offering a balanced portfolio to both prevent and treat disease. This acquisition is subject to FTC approval and closing of the BI-Sanofi asset swap. We expect to close the deal early next year.","The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana ruled against Lilly and its partner Acrux in a patent case for the testosterone treatment AXIRON, ruling that AXIRON's formulation and axilla application patents are invalid and the applicator patent, although valid, would not be infringed by generic competitors. We have appealed the ruling. The formulation patent expires in February 2017, while the axilla application and applicator patents expire in 2027.","The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office determined that the method of use patents for Effient are invalid. Lilly, Daiichi Sankyo, and Ube strongly disagree with the PTO's ruling regarding validity of the Effient method of use patent and have appealed the ruling.","Separately, next steps are being discussed with the District Court in ongoing litigation on both the method of use patents and the compound patent. As a reminder, the method of use patents expire in 2023, while the compound patent expires in April of 2017 and we are entitled to pediatric exclusivity until October of 2017.","Finally, we distributed over $500 million to shareholders via our dividend. During the quarter we did not repurchase any stock, leaving $2.65 billion remaining on our $5 billion plan. As we announced on our second quarter earnings call, we do expect to provide annual increases in our dividend and will continue to balance share repurchase with external opportunities to enhance our future growth prospects.","And now I'll turn the call over to Phil for a discussion of our financial performance for the quarter. Phil?","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Great. Thank you, John. Slide seven summarizes our presentation of GAAP results and non-GAAP measures, while slide eight provides a summary of our GAAP results. I'll focus my comments this morning on our non-GAAP adjusted measures to provide insights into the underlying trends in our business, so please refer to today's earnings press release for a detailed description of the year-on-year changes in our third quarter GAAP results.","Looking at the non-GAAP measures on slide nine, you can see the Q3 2016 revenue increased 5% compared to Q3 2015, reaching $5.2 billion. Gross margin as a percent of revenue decreased 1.4 percentage points to 76.4%. This decrease was driven by the effect of foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold. This effect resulted in a benefit to both this quarter and last year's quarter, but the benefit this year was substantially smaller than the benefit realized last year. Excluding this FX effect, our gross margin percent increased by 30 basis points, going from 75.2% in last year's quarter to 75.5% this quarter.","Total operating expense, defined as the sum of R&D and SG&A, increased by 4% compared to Q3 of 2015. Breaking this into its component parts, marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased 2%, while R&D increased 8%. The slight increase in marketing, selling and administrative expenses was due to higher spending on new products largely offset by lower spending on late lifecycle products. The increase in R&D expense was driven primarily by higher late-stage clinical development costs. Other income and expense was income of $27 million this quarter, compared to the $87 million reported in last year's quarter.","Our tax rate was 22%. This is a decrease of 290 basis points compared with the same quarter last year. This decrease was primarily due to certain U.S. tax provisions, including the R&D Tax Credit, that are in force in 2016 but had lapsed during last year's third quarter. At the bottom line, net income decreased 2% and earnings per share decreased 1%. Slide 10 contains non-GAAP adjusted information for the first nine months of the year, while slide 11 contains a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS. And you'll find additional details on these adjustments on slides 24 and 25.","Now let's take a look at the effect of price, rate and volume on revenue growth. On slide 12 in the yellow highlighted row at the bottom of the table you'll see the 5% revenue growth I","mentioned earlier. On a performance basis, our worldwide revenue grew 4% this quarter, driven entirely by volumes. By geography, you'll notice the U.S. pharma revenue increased 17%, driven primarily by volume. Trulicity was the main driver of U.S. volume growth, with meaningful contributions also coming from Humalog and Taltz. Having completed the takeback of North American rights for ERBITUX on October 1 last year, we also benefited from booking end sales of ERBITUX this quarter.","As cited in our press release issued earlier this morning, we have experienced less product returns than anticipated for Cymbalta post its patent expiration, leading to a reduction in the returns reserve this quarter of approximately $145 million. Excluding this item, our U.S. pharma revenue grew 10% this quarter, with an 11% increase due to higher volume and a 1% decline due to lower realized prices.","The decline in EUCAN revenue of 8% was driven by the negative effect of price and, to a lesser extent, lower volumes and unfavorable FX movements. On a constant currency or performance basis, EUCAN revenue decreased 6%. This decrease was driven primarily by lower volume and price for Cymbalta and ALIMTA following patent expirations, partially offset by the uptake of new products, including Trulicity, Basaglar, CYRAMZA, and Jardiance, as well as higher sales of Humalog, TRADJENTA, and CIALIS.","In Japan, pharma revenue increased 15% in total, driven by an 18% benefit from a stronger yen and, to a lesser extent, increased volume partially offset by a 6% negative price effect from the latest biannual price cuts. On a constant currency basis, Japan pharma revenue decreased 3%. This performance decline was attributable to the entry of generic olanzapine this past June. Excluding Zyprexa, Japan pharma revenue in Q3 grew 6% on a constant currency basis, led by CYRAMZA, with additional contributions from Cymbalta, Strattera, Trulicity, Basaglar, and Jardiance.","Turning to emerging markets, we saw revenue decline 8%, primarily driven by the negative effect of foreign exchange. On a performance basis, emerging markets revenue decreased 3% due to lower volumes for off-patent brands, including CIALIS, Zyprexa, ALIMTA, and Cymbalta, partially offset by higher volumes for Humulin, Trulicity, TRADJENTA, and CYRAMZA. Also this quarter, our pharma revenue in China decreased 7% due to foreign exchange while revenue was flat on a constant currency basis.","Changes in order timing from our distributors negatively affected growth this quarter while positively affecting growth last quarter. We estimate the growth in underlying demand for our products in China this quarter was about 5%.","Turning to Animal Health. This quarter, worldwide revenue decreased 9%, both in total and on a constant currency basis, including a 14% decline in companion animal and a 6% decline in food animal. Animal Health revenue was significantly impacted by distributor inventory destocking in the","quarter following a changeover to SAP at the end of Q2. This inventory impact represented the majority of the decline in companion animal revenue in Q3 and has contributed to the volatility in our Animal Health results.","In food animal, economic weakness in Latin America combined with market access pressures in the U.S. contributed to lower revenue in the quarter. Note that on a year-to-date basis, which includes the SAP inventory impact in both Q2 and Q3, Animal Health revenue is flat. On slide 13, you'll find the same price, rate and volume analysis, but on a year-to-date basis.","As I mentioned earlier, excluding foreign exchange, our worldwide revenue grew 4% this quarter, with nearly all of that growth coming from higher volumes. In total, our new products, Trulicity, CYRAMZA, Jardiance, Taltz, Basaglar, and PORTRAZZA were the engine of our worldwide volume growth. Slide 14 shows that these products drove 6.6 percentage points of volume growth this quarter.","The takeback of ERBITUX contributed nearly 2 percentage points to our volume growth, while Humalog contributed nearly 1 percentage point. You'll also see that the loss of exclusivity for Zyprexa, Cymbalta, and Evista, while largely in the rear-view mirror, still provided a drag of roughly 2 percentage points on our volume growth.","Specifically on Humalog, you will see that U.S. sales this quarter are down 14%, as higher volume was more than offset by lower realized prices. This quarter's net realized price was negatively affected by changes in estimates for rebates and discounts. Normalizing for changes in estimates for rebates and December counts in both Q3 2016 and Q3 2015, the underlying U.S. sales trend for the quarter for Humalog was basically flat.","Now let me turn the call over to Derica.","Derica W. Rice - Eli Lilly & Co.","Thanks, Phil. As in prior quarters, I'll start by sharing some color on our new product launches. During the Q&A session, Sue, Enrique and Dave can provide more details.","As you can see on the graph on slide 15, our new products generated over $0.5 billion dollars in revenue this quarter, led by Trulicity and CYRAMZA. This represents about 10% of our total worldwide revenue, up from 8% last quarter. And as Phil mentioned earlier, these products drove over 6.5 percentage points of our worldwide volume growth this quarter.","We continue to be pleased with the uptake of Trulicity. Here in the U.S., we're capturing nearly 30% of new patient starts in the GLP-1 class. In addition to our strong performance, we're benefiting from strong growth of the class itself, with the U.S. GLP-1 market growing nearly 30%. As I mentioned last quarter, in many o-US markets, we're seeing uptake comparable to that seen with the early uptake of Victoza.","CYRAMZA continues to grow globally, driven largely by strong gastric cancer uptake in Japan. O-US markets now account for nearly 60% of our worldwide CYRAMZA sales and we look forward to continued growth in these markets, not only in gastric cancer, but also supported by the ongoing launches of the colorectal and lung cancer indications. U.S. CYRAMZA sales declined this quarter, largely as a result of competitive pressure from immuno-oncology therapies and non-small cell lung cancer, while our share of market in gastric cancer has been relatively stable.","Moving to Jardiance. While less than we expected, the SGLT-2 class in the U.S. is growing over 20% and our new-to-therapy share with endocrinologists is now over 35%. Along with Boehringer Ingelheim, we expect FDA action on the EMPA-REG OUTCOME submission in early December and continue to see an update of the Jardiance label to reflect the compelling CV data for EMPA-REG OUTCOME as a catalyst for the growing of the class and of Jardiance.","Taltz, which launched in the U.S. in April, is off to an excellent start. We're seeing strong growth of the IL-17 class in psoriasis and are pleased that our new-to-brand share of market with dermatologists, a proxy for use in psoriasis, is already over 10%. While it's still early in our o-US launches, feedback has been positive and we look forward to launching Taltz in Japan this fall for both psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis.","The rollout of ABASAGLAR in o-US countries continues and we are preparing for our U.S. launch in mid-December. Finally, we continue to see strong uptake of IO agents in first-line squamous non-small cell lung cancer, which is clearly affecting use of PORTRAZZA.","Moving to slide 16, you'll see the effective changes in foreign exchange rates on our 2016 results. This quarter, FX had a small positive impact on revenue growth. Excluding FX, worldwide revenue grew 4%. In performance terms, growth in non-GAAP cost of sales at 4% was in line with revenue growth, while non-GAAP operating expenses grew just slightly faster than revenue at 5%. Finally, excluding FX, non-GAAP operating income increased 2% and non-GAAP EPS increased 1%.","Moving on to our pipeline update. Slide 17 shows our pipeline as of October 19. Changes since our last earnings call are highlighted, with green arrows showing progression and red arrows showing movement out of the portfolio. In our NME pipeline, you'll see the green arrow denoting FDA approval of Lartruvo in soft tissue sarcoma.","We began Phase II testing of two molecules, the low-dose BACE inhibitor that we discussed at our Alzheimer's Disease meeting last December, and the BTK inhibitor in immunology we licensed with Hanmi. We also started Phase I testing for a small molecule cancer compound and we terminated development of two Phase I oncology assets and of blosozumab, a sclerostin monoclonal antibody for osteoporosis.","In our NILEX pipeline, as shown on slide 18, we began a Phase III study of solanezumab in prodromal Alzheimer's disease. Currently, we plan to recruit nearly 2,500 amyloid-positive patients for this study. The blinded treatment period will be 24 months, and we anticipate trial completion in mid-2021.","On solanezumab, John mentioned earlier that we are on track to issue the top-line press release for EXPEDITION3 before the end of the year. I'd also note that we have a small number of investor interactions with management scheduled this quarter and all of these interactions will occur before management's sees the EXPEDITION3 study results.","If we hit the most aggressive timeline for moving from last patient visit to database lock, we may be able to present the EXPEDITION3 data at the CTAD meeting in December. However, it is also quite possible that we will not present the data at a medical meeting until next year. Should we present the EXPEDITION3 data at CTAD, the presentation will be made available via a live webcast open to the investment community, so live participation will not be required to access the information in real time.","Turning to slide 19. Let's recap the recent progress we've made on the key events we projected for 2016. Since our last call, we've added green check marks for the initiation of the Phase III study of solanezumab and prodromal Alzheimer's disease, the internal data readout that John mentioned earlier of the Phase III SPIRIT-P2 study of ixekizumab in psoriatic arthritis, the presentation at EADV of data from the IXORA-S study evaluating ixekizumab head-to-head against STELARA in psoriasis and the U.S. approval of Lartruvo for soft tissue sarcoma.","Also, one event we thought that might occur in 2016, which is now expected in 2017, action on Cialis pediatric exclusivity, while another is expected in 2018, the cluster headache readout for galcanezumab.","Turning to our 2016 financial guidance on slide 20. At a high level, our expectations are largely unchanged. You'll see that our outlook for non-GAAP earnings per share is unchanged, while we've made small adjustments to our GAAP earnings per share guidance range, as well as to our line item guidance for revenue, SG&A expense, other income and capital expenditures.","In summary, our Q3 financial performance places us on track to achieve our full-year guidance. In the quarter, we posted revenue growth of 4% on a constant currency basis, driven by 7% pharmaceutical volume growth. We made progress on the pipeline, with the FDA approval of Lartruvo, recommendations for approval of olaratumab and GLYXAMBI in Europe and granting of FDA Fast Track status for our BACE inhibitor, AZD3293.","We continue to have strong momentum behind our innovation-based strategy. And, as we transition to new leadership next year, our management team will remain focused on executing our strategy to create value for all stakeholders, including shareholders.","We also remain firmly committed to achieving the mid-term financial goals we articulated on our earnings call in July, which included: driving a minimum of 5% compounded annual revenue growth from 2015 to 2020, even without solanezumab; reducing OPEX as a percent of revenue to 50% or less in 2018; increasing our gross margin as a percent of revenue in 2020 compared to 2015; launching 20 or more new products in the decade from 2014 through 2023 and providing annual dividend increases to our shareholders.","This concludes our prepared remarks. Now I'll turn the call over to Phil to moderate the Q&A session. Phil?","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Thank you, Derica. So we've got nearly an hour for the Q&A session. We would like to get as many of the callers on the line as possible, so if you would please limit your questions to your two most important ones or one with two parts, that would be very much appreciated.","Mary Beth, if you could go ahead and give the instructions for the Q&A session then go to our first caller, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly, sir. We'll go to our first question from the line of Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Wow. First time I've been asked first. Anyway, question. Couple questions on Jardiance. My first question is, why did the FDA require three more months for review? Is this a positive? Is this a negative?","And, Enrique, how are you feeling about getting the superior label in Jardiance? And are what are the options? Is the option to get a superior label, i.e., an indication for CV risk reduction? Or is the other alternative to get no mention of that in the indication section but the EMPA-REG trial mentioned in the label somewhere? If you can talk about those two possible scenarios and what they mean in terms of consensus expectations.","Secondly, just curious to know what's happening with pricing in diabetes because it does seem to be getting worse. You talked about rebates and discounts with Humalog, but it also seems that we're seeing some price discounting in SGLT-2 just based on INVOKANA's recent performance and their weakness due to discounting. So if you could talk about that as well. Thanks very much.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Great. Thank you for the questions, Jami. Enrique, those are all yours.","Enrique A. Conterno - Eli Lilly & Co.","Very good. So when it comes to the Jardiance review by the FDA, we did get this three-month extension on the action date. The new action date is now December 4 of this year. It's difficult to say always what drives that, but the FDA considers some additional information analysis that we had provided, basically a major amendment, and they basically have the right to do so. I would highlight that this is not the only major amendment that has happened in the diabetes area. There have been a number of three-month extensions. But I don't think it will be appropriate to color this in any way, positive or negative.","When it comes to the indication and the label, as you know, we have basically requested a separate, distinct indication for Jardiance, given the data from empiric outcome. Something along the lines of reducing the instance of cardiovascular death in patients with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease. We believe that the data warrants this type of indication. Clearly, there are a number of different potential outcomes when it comes to the label that we would get. The FDA is reviewing the label. And it's probably not appropriate for me to comment more at this stage, given that the action date is getting very near. I will continue to highlight that I believe that we have the strength of the evidence to be able to have a new indication.","Clearly, whether we have \u2013 in particular in the U.S., having an indication does make an important difference. So we are seeking that. Of course, if the clinical data is included in the body of the label, yes, we could still make a claim, but the strength of the claim is not the same. So we view this as important for us and for Jardiance and for Lilly and BI.","Let me answer your question on pricing in diabetes. First, as it was stated as part of the remarks by Phil, when we normalize for changes in the estimates of rebates and discounts for both Q3 and Q4, we basically see, in the case of Humalog, that our normalized sales would have been minus 1% instead of minus 14%. Now, minus 1% still implies a pretty important impact. It implies lower prices because we grew volume 10% with Humalog in the U.S. So that's basically minus 11 when it comes to price.","What are we seeing? Well, we are seeing two things. Increased rebates across the board. But in particular, when it comes to Part D, at least from how Lilly views this business, and we basically see a significant more business flowing through less profitable books of business, less profitable channels, Medicare, Medicaid, chargebacks. So as we look at those books of business, there's been an acceleration of those books of business at the expense of commercial and cash. So those impacts are pretty significant.","Now, you have seen that, in the case of Humalog, we have quite a bit of volatility. We expect for this volatility, unfortunately, to continue, given that we make estimates at the end of each quarter on those rebates and discounts, but we find out where the product flows through, which books of business, afterward and, in some cases, many quarters afterward.","So the last point that I would make, because it's probably important, as you look at your different models and as we think about the Humalog and what is the ongoing growth strength for this product, as we look at the normalization that I referred to, one-third of that normalization refers to Q3 of 2016. Two-thirds is really related to Q3 of 2015.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Enrique, thank you very much for the comprehensive response. Mary Beth, if we can go to next caller, please.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our next question from the line of Tim Anderson from Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Timothy Minton Anderson - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you. A couple of questions. On solanezumab, I know, obviously, everyone's expecting and watching the results of EXPEDITION3. But if that trial is a total fail, what happens to the prodromal trial? Would that completely continue unchanged? Or could it potentially get scrapped?","The second question was on baricitinib. I know there's a fair amount of excitement around the upcoming launch and the profile has looked promising. But I can't help but think that it's going get meaningfully sidelined by payers in the U.S., given how crowded this market is. And if that happens, then it would be a very slow launch curve like we've seen with a lot of other products. I'm wondering if you can comment on this assessment.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Great, Tim. Thank you for the questions. Dave, we'll move over to you for these two.","David A. Ricks - Eli Lilly & Co.","Great. Thanks, Tim. I think we've talked about the various scenarios with sola before. We continue to characterize it as a high-risk, high-reward program. The scenario you paint is what we think is the least probable, but it certainly could happen. In this scenario, sola would really not separate at all from placebo. I think we would be re-evaluating all of the sola programs, frankly, Tim.","And the way we've set up the prodromal program, which we've just begun, is there's a recruitment start with a special cohort that we can also evaluate more information on. We're doing this for a couple reasons. But one of the reasons is the ability to stop the trial should EXPEDITION3 be negative. So we've gated the investment in that way. As I said, we're not counting on that as the most probable scenario, but we're prepared for that contingency.","We're excited about baricitinib, too. The profile from the Phase III program, four very large studies, is extremely positive. That drug is under review at the FDA and we're anticipating a launch some time in 2017. You are identifying a key issue in that class. RA is crowded. It is heavily managed by payers. Lilly has a strategy on baricitinib to really focus on the differentiation of the product versus the standards of care of methotrexate and Humira. We want to position the product in really the pre-biologic setting. And that may take some time to achieve, as you're pointing out.","However, I would say there are all kinds of payers. And those that are more clinically-focused and focused on improving outcomes for a pretty significant condition, life-long condition for young people, RA, we think we can make early headway in those settings. Others which may be more sensitive to rebate flow, et cetera, obviously that's going to be more difficult. But I think Lilly's prepared to be patient and build out the product through time. Reminding everyone that the current IP is very long and we have a long time to fulfill full value for baricitinib. Thanks for the questions.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Great. Thank you, Dave. Mary Beth, if we can go to the next caller, please.","Operator","Thank you. The next question from the line of Tony Butler from Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead.","Tony Butler - Guggenheim Partners","Yes, thank you very much. Dave, a question on Taltz and the anti-IL-17 class. I understand the commentary around the growing class. And clearly, if we listen to Novartis, they'll be quite enthusiastic. I'm just wondering, though, as we look quarter-to-quarter at the U.S. sales, while the rate's nice, the absolute numbers I guess one could say it's rather anemic.","And so the real question is around payers, I guess, and whether or not the full channel opportunity is being utilized by Lilly and, more importantly, how you think you might be able to address that relative to Cosentyx or others that may enter that market in psoriasis. Thank you for your time.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Great, Tony. Thank you for the question. Dave?","David A. Ricks - Eli Lilly & Co.","Yeah, Tony. Thanks for the question. We are both excited about the uptake of the IL-17 class and Taltz within it. In fact, as we exited Q3, we're seeing Taltz new-to-brand share in dermatology, which is really our key leading indicator for performance, as peaking over 10% already, ahead of Enbrel, for instance, and at least at par with Cosentyx in that setting. So we're happy with the initial adoption and the breadth of trial and usage which are other key indicators for us.","At this point in the launch cycle, I'm not sure net sales should be the absolute marker we'd be looking at, although of course we're looking forward to growing that quarter-on-quarter going forward. And you did see growth from Q2, which was, reminding everyone, just a few weeks of shipments in Q2. It wasn't a full quarter.","Also, vis-a-vis Cosentyx, which enjoys three indications, we can only have the one in psoriasis, as was mentioned in the call text earlier. We do plan submissions now for PSA in the U.S. shortly. And we have an (45:40) program ongoing.","So net-net, I think we're happy with where we are. Global rollouts are beginning in the second half of the year as well in Europe and Japan, which are also significant opportunities. We've got a lifecycle coming. And where we are head-to-head against the incumbents of TNF, STELARA, and even Cosentyx within the class, which is the U.S. derm market, I think the early performance indicators are quite strong.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Great. Thanks, Dave. Mary Beth, if we can go to the next caller.","Operator","Certainly. Next question from the line of Steve Scala from Cowen. Please go ahead.","Steve Scala - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you. I have a couple. Assuming solanezumab data is tracking toward CTAD presentation, would there be a top-line release? And, if so, when would that be issued? And externally, of course, we know nothing about what was seen in EXPEDITION3. Does Lilly also know absolutely nothing about what was seen in EXPEDITION3, or is some data being analyzed or already has been analyzed? So that's the first question.","Second question is, Lilly seems to have done some opportunistic spending in Q3. Companies typically do this for various reasons, one of which is anticipation of positive upcoming developments. Certainly it would not be done when delay or disappointment is expected. So how should we interpret your opportunistic spending in the third quarter? Thank you.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Great, Steve. Thanks for the questions. It's always an exciting moment waiting to hear you give them. If we can go Dave for the sola questions on the CTAD and potential timing for a top-line press release issuance, as well as whether or not people have seen anything at Lilly on EXPEDITION3 to-date. And then, Derica, if you'd like to handle the spending question, that would be great. Dave?","David A. Ricks - Eli Lilly & Co.","Yeah, let me answer the second \u2013 sola question first. Steve, we have seen nothing on EXPEDITION3. And that will remain true until literally a few days before your second question, which is a top-line press release, which we'll do with absolute urgency after management's had a chance to look at the data coming in. Reminding everyone that the period between last patient visit and that management review involves a lot of data cleansing, QA\/QC effort to make sure what we're looking at is a true signal. And those are normal procedures that do need time and effort to make sure that the much anticipated readout is accurate.","Following a top-line release, probably by just a few days, would be CTAD, if we can make it. This will be a slide format of a summary of the top data points which would fill out things beyond what would be anticipated in a top-line release at that time. That's just reminding everyone a best-case scenario for us right now if everything goes smoothly operationally.","And just to remind everyone, you do not need to register for CTAD. They've asked us to say that. And that it will be available from the comfort of your computer to view in real-time should that presentation occur in first week in December.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Great. Thanks, Dave. Derica?","Derica W. Rice - Eli Lilly & Co.","Hi, Steve. Good morning. In regards to our operating expense and spending in the third quarter, there was really nothing unusual. Our lack of transparency in terms of what we're doing behind the scenes, it really is driven by the new product launches and our support of that. You've probably seen some of our new DTC ads that we've launched in quarter as well. That's driving the spend, as well as our launch prep. We talked about the recent approval of Lartruvo and we've been anticipating that for some time.","In addition, you also see that we continue to invest in our pipeline. And if you look at our total operating expenses for the quarter, our biggest growth was in that realm in terms of R&D and it really is progressing \u2013 continuing to progress our pipeline, and to pursue the opportunities that we have embedded there that we believe still keeps us on track to achieving that potential of 20 launches in a 10-year span. So whether you call it opportunistic, we see it more in a sustained fashion that this is what we've been geared up to do.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Great. Thanks, Derica. Mary Beth, if we can go to the next caller.","Operator","Thank you. The line of Mr. Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Christopher Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks very much for the questions. The first one was on Basaglar. You've had a few big formula wins for 2017. Can you help us just understand the dynamics of that product in the U.S. next year? I guess specifically, what percent of market do you have access to? And how should we think about Lilly prioritizing that product relative to other assets in the diabetes portfolio?","My second question was on abemaciclib. Just helping us put a little bit the continuation of the MONARCH 2 study into context. Do you still believe you can differentiate that asset from IBRANCE, even though the product didn't achieve its interim efficacy criteria? Thank you.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Great, Chris. Thank you for the questions. We'll go to Enrique for your Basaglar questions and then to Sue for abemaciclib. Enrique?","Enrique A. Conterno - Eli Lilly & Co.","So we've had a successful contracting season with Basaglar. So we feel good about our commercial access in particular. Clearly, contracting is not done yet. And just to remind everyone, we expect to launch on December 15 of this year. So I won't be able to provide specific numbers at this stage, but we are very pleased with the access that we will have.","In terms of the priority that we will basically have on Basaglar, clearly is a newly launched product. And we need to make this product relevant in the basal insulin space, really a new segment for us. So from that perspective, it's important. And it's important because also it really fully completes the diabetes portfolio that we can offer our customers. We now have a complete portfolio, a full range of insulins, a GLP-1 with Trulicity, and then great oral products.","As we look at our performance in the U.S. market and in other major markets, we're actually growing market share with every single product. I think as we launch Basaglar, I think it is key that we continue driving the entire portfolio and the success that we're seeing with Trulicity and the opportunity that we have with Jardiance.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Great. Thank you, Enrique. Sue?","Susan Mahony - Eli Lilly & Co.","Yeah, with regards to bemaciclib, we continue to be very excited by this molecule. And if we look at the interim, we as we said previously, it was a high bar. And if we look across the CDK4\/6 inhibitors, about 50% of the interims have been met and 50% haven't. So I don't know we should read too much into us progressing with MONARCH 2. We're looking forward to seeing the final data next year. And, of course, we've also got the MONARCH 3 data as well expected toward the end of next year, with an interim also earlier.","From a differentiation perspective, there were no head-to-heads. But if we look at abemaciclib, we've seen single-agent activity now in the MONARCH 1 trial. And also, if you saw the neoMONARCH data that was presented at ESMO, we saw single-agent activity there. We see 14 times more potency to CDK4 than CDK6 with abemaciclib. We continue to be able to dose this continuously. And it crosses blood-brain barrier, if I can say that. So we, as I said, continue to be excited by the molecule and do believe that it actually could be best-in-class CDK4\/6 inhibitor.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Great. Thank you, Sue. Next caller, please.","Operator","We'll go to line of Mr. Gregg Gilbert from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks. First on CTAD, is there other data you plan to present there? If not, EXPEDITION3, or with or without EXPEDITION3? What longer-term strategic and financial and possibly R&D decisions are tied to the outcome of EXPEDITION3? I think you already touched on the R&D piece, but maybe strategic and financial longer term.","Then, Enrique, what can you say about the launch of Basaglar in the U.S.? It's somewhat imminent. I'm sure you have a pretty good sense of demand and what price you're willing to part with the product. So whatever you can help us understand heading into that, that would be very helpful. Thanks.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Okay, Gregg. Thank you for the questions. Dave, if you could answer question on the CTAD data being presented, anything other than EXPEDITION3, and maybe at least within the overall Alzheimer's disease portfolio and (54:35) portfolio, what that might mean for investment perspective. Derica or John, feel free to chime in from a corporate perspective, if you'd like. And then we'll go over to Enrique for the Basaglar launch question. Dave?","David A. Ricks - Eli Lilly & Co.","Yeah, thanks, Gregg. Yeah, CTAD is an important Alzheimer's meeting. It's not a large meeting, but it's one where top experts who do clinical research around the globe in Alzheimer's all come. As a result, we are consistently at that meeting with posters, other presentations.","As you know, Lilly's done a lot of work, whether it be in diagnosis work with our PET scanning business. We have some data reading out in that area, as well as other supportive data looking at disease modification, et cetera, in different populations. So there are other presentations. I don't have a list in front of me, but we can provide that in follow-up.","The second question is really, what would change going forward if sola is positive. And I think here we've given long-term guidance without sola. But certainly we would anticipate a rapid submission and introduction to the major markets and the normal kind of go-to-market commercialization effort that would come with that, which is typically expense followed by revenue.","I would also say this, we'll present two new opportunities for Lilly, I think unique ones, within the field of neuroscience and Alzheimer's. One would be to look at acceleration and full funding for other Alzheimer's products, particularly those with a beta-based mechanism. Certainly with a lead like that in sola, we would want a fast follow with other innovations we have coming. We're doing that, but we can always look at speed and voracity of that effort.","And then finally, looking at combination and sequences of therapies that could be combined with solanezumab to further arrest the disease. That only makes sense if sola works. And we have those sort of queued up, but certainly not in our funding and expense base today. So there are many; we'll have to prioritize amongst those. And I think of course, qualitatively, the way sola works will have some bearing on how much of that additional investment we would trigger.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Great. John or Derica, any comment? No. Okay. We can go over to Enrique for the Basaglar question.","Enrique A. Conterno - Eli Lilly & Co.","So maybe just a few additional comments on Basaglar. Clearly, we will be disclosing the list price in the near future. But I think it's fair to say that the real competition when it comes to prices really happens with the rebate levels and at the net price level. As I mentioned, we do have good access.","Now, this doesn't automatically mean that Basaglar is going to be a win. We need to make this product relevant with our customers. We need to build that brand and we need to provide great experiences. Yes, in some cases, Lantus and Toujeo are excluded from formularies, but this is not the case for Treciba, Levemir. So at the end of the day, we need to make sure that Basaglar is an important compelling option for those patients and those customers. And we are working to make sure that that happens.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Great. Thank you, Enrique. Mary Beth, next caller, please.","Operator","We'll go to the line of John Boris with SunTrust. Please go ahead.","John T. Boris - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thanks for taking the questions. First question just has to do with the pricing risk and election cycle. If you look at most of the election cycles historically, it would seem as though that if investors actually owned the group coming out of an election cycle, they'd be rewarded pretty handsomely. However, you do have some things that are being tossed about, most notably Proposition 61 that'll be on the ballot November 8, on the California ballot, proposing a statute which could create a price ceiling on prescription drug costs by state programs. Just your thoughts about this election cycle and what might be different, and is there any silver lining on pricing coming out of that?","The second question just has to do with Trulicity. Just an update on REWIND and thoughts around the upcoming interim analysis and stoppage of that trial?","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Great, John. Thank you for the questions. John Lechleiter, if you'll take the first part of that question. And then we'll come over to Enrique for the REWIND question. John?","John C. Lechleiter - Eli Lilly & Co.","Yeah. Thanks, John. Prop 61, we're fighting that tooth-and-nail in California. It's not only bad legislation, it's bad for your health. And we're trying to impress that on the voters. What we've found is that the more people become aware of what's at stake here and what's the likely outcomes of Proposition 61, the more they're prone to vote against it and vote it down. So we have a pretty big campaign underway in California right now to increase that level of awareness and hopefully to continue to shift voters toward a position of being against it for a whole variety of reasons.","It's difficult to say on the larger \u2013 are we going to see some price relief after the election. I think in terms of where drug pricing fits in what I'd call the rhetoric that you're always going to get in a campaign season, particularly one that's as polarized as this one. So I think there may be some acute relief.","I think the bigger question is, if Hillary Clinton wins, what does she have in mind for health care? If Donald Trump wins, what's the direction going to be? It's pretty clear, whether you say you want to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, something needs to be done if we're going to render a health insurance availability for everybody in this country sustainable on an ongoing basis. So I think that's going to be the bigger focus for the industry is what happens in those probably critical first two years of the first term, which we know what happened in 2008 and 2009. And I think that's what the industry has to be prepared for.","At the same time, I think that, frankly, if we're successful with sola, the outcome of sola, and there's hope for Alzheimer's \u2013 keep in mind that the top 10 causes of death in this country, I think I heard the other day, Alzheimer's is the only one where we continue to see increases in the rate of mortality.","So I think if the industry can demonstrate once again, like we did with HIV\/AIDS, like we did with hepatitis C and so many other diseases, that we can make an impact on something that increasingly everybody is fearful of and concerned about, I think that changes the dynamic, too. We don't know what that outcome's going be, but it's going be a very interesting mix come January 1. And I'm sure Dave Ricks is ready to jump all over it.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Thank you, John. Enrique, for the REWIND update?","Enrique A. Conterno - Eli Lilly & Co.","Sure. So our REWIND trial with Trulicity scheduled completion date right now of July of 2018. We expect the interim later this quarter. We already had the number of events to be able to reach the interim. But the DMC will be meeting later this quarter. Clearly, we've learned a lot from both the LEADER and the SUSTAIN trials.","I think it's important to remind everyone that given the number of events that we have in interim is significantly lower than what Victoza had with LEADER, so the hazard ratio for us to be significant will have to be quite impressive. We will see what the data says once we have the readout.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Great. Thank you, Enrique. Mary Beth, next caller, please?","Operator","Thank you. That would be the line of Marc Goodman from UBS. Please go ahead.","Marc Goodman - UBS Securities LLC","Yes. (1:03:00).","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Hey, Marc. If you can hear us, it sounds like we lost you.","Marc Goodman - UBS Securities LLC","Hello?","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Yes. We can hear you know.","Marc Goodman - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks, Phil. Enrique, first, can you help explain why GLYXAMBI is not doing better? We look at the prescription trends, and I would have thought that this product would have taken off much better.","Second question is, can we get a little more color on Animal Health and just what happened in the quarter and what's going on there? And third, you mentioned the CGRP headache cluster. Can you just talk about the timeline change there and what happened and if there's been any other timeline changes to that program? Thanks.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Great, Marc. Thank you for the questions. We'll go around the table here. We'll start with Enrique on the GLYXAMBI question. Over to Jeff for more color on what's going on with the Animal Health business. And then back over to Dave for the CGRP timeline question. Enrique?","Enrique A. Conterno - Eli Lilly & Co.","Sure. So the strategy we had for GLYXAMBI was a different one prior to the readout of the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial. As we see it today, we need to make sure that we are positioned in Jardiance as standard of care and we need the new indication to truly do so and really reinvigorate the growth of the SGLT2 class.","We believe that GLYXAMBI will have very significant benefit once this happens. But investing today in a really big way in GLYXAMBI really doesn't make sense, whether it's access or promotional investment. GLYXAMBI has today fairly low access. We are in the 20s when we look at commercial access, and it's even lower than that in Part D. We need to retake that once we get the new label for Jardiance.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Great. Thank you, Enrique. Jeff?","Jeffrey N. Simmons - Eli Lilly & Co.","Yeah. Marc, thanks for the question on Animal Health. Bottom line, our Animal Health quarterly results have been more volatile this year, as you know. Inventory destocking was a significant event in Q3 and it contributed to the revenue decline this quarter. We don't see these results as a trend. Just as we enjoyed the benefits, as you recall, of the distributor purchases in Q2 ahead of our SAP cutover in the U.S., inventories were depleted in Q3, which caused the majority of the decline in our Animal business. So I would note the SAP transition has gone very smoothly.","On the companion animal side, our business is up 3% year-to-date, which really normalizes for the Q2 and the Q3 inventory impact. And what's driving this is, one, successful launches of some new innovation, as well as we believe our improved competitiveness with the combination of Novartis and Elanco.","On the food animal side, food animal's down 1% year-to-date. And really, outside the U.S., we've experience weakness in Latin America. And really this region represented the entire decline for our o-US food animal in Q3.","And then in the U.S., we face some market access challenges this quarter. In particular, Paylean, a product in our U.S. swine business, pork customers pursuing the China export market removed Paylean. They'll do that on and off. They'll come on and off the product depending on needing the export markets or not. So that in summary.","As then as John noted, two weeks ago we announced the acquisition of BI's companion animal vaccine business, subject to the closing, again, of the BI Sanofi asset swap. We see this as a tremendous complement to our companion animal business in the U.S.","Enrique A. Conterno - Eli Lilly & Co.","Hey, Phil, just a clarification. The number I quoted for GLYXAMBI is as a preferred position, so lowest branded copay. The access is higher than that we look at overlaps.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Great. Thank you for the clarification, Enrique. Dave, on the CGRP timeline?","David A. Ricks - Eli Lilly & Co.","Yeah. So I think, Marc, you're asking about the push-out on cluster headache. This is for galcanezumab, reminding everyone that galcanezumab will be the first therapy in this class \u2013 actually the first therapy ever to our knowledge, to be approved with well-controlled studies in cluster, should those studies read out.","We have pushed back the timeline into next year based on enrollment. And really to clarify that, it's actually the ability to have subjects have cluster headaches. Some forms of the condition are episodic. So while we recruited well the number of people in the program, we're waiting for the cluster events to start which can demonstrate the value of the product. So it goes part and parcel with pushing into a new therapy area like this where studies haven't even been done before with medicines on a large scale.","But we're excited about that part of the program. Again, it would be first with that indication to our knowledge. It gives us some, I think, credit with the neurologists for tackling a tough condition and potentially some value support as we go to market. Also, I'd say the migraine program is on track. We have communicated previously that that's a mid-2017 readout with potentially a submission by the end of 2017. So we're feeling good about galcanezumab overall.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Great. Thank you, Dave. Mary Beth, we can go to the next caller, please.","Operator","That line will be Vamil Divan from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Vamil K. Divan - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Great. Thanks for taking my questions. So first just on the diabetes side for Trulicity, Jardiance. Can you provide a little more color in terms of how much of the sales is coming for, I guess, the classes as a whole, and also your products from specialists versus generalists? Just trying to see if they're getting better traction with the primary care physicians.","And then second on Taltz, you mentioned psoriatic arthritis and also ankylosing spondylitis. Can you just give us a better sense there in terms of how you view the commercial opportunity for those two indications relative to the psoriasis indication? Thanks.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Great. Thanks, Vamil. Enrique, we'll go to you for the Trulicity and Jardiance question on specialist used versus PCP prescribing. And over to Dave for the psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis opportunity. Enrique?","Enrique A. Conterno - Eli Lilly & Co.","So I don't have the numbers in front of me, but when we think about specialists versus primary care, for this product to be successful we have to be relevant when it comes to primary care. We expect long term that over 80% of the volume will basically come from primary care as we think about these two products.","Now, something that is encouraging about the uptick of both of these products is that our share with specialists, it is indeed higher with endocrinologists than with primary care physicians. This is important as a leading indicator as we look at the future and a great prognosticator of what is to come ahead.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Great. Thank you, Enrique. Dave?","David A. Ricks - Eli Lilly & Co.","Yes. Thanks for the question, Vamil. What I hear you asking about is as we look forward to the future indications, how do we think about the size of those markets. I would say on PSA, which would be the next one for us, based on differentiation we think we have versus standards of care like Humira, reminding everyone that IL-17s can be used without methotrexate and you get sort of the stool, skin and joint benefit that's at least as good on the joint. We're encouraged by what we see so far in our estimates. Our own estimates actually have gone up since we started the program because treatment rates for PSA appear to be quite a bit higher than psoriasis when it comes to using biologics.","Just to give everyone a bit of frame on that, when you look at products that are indicated only for psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, take Cosentyx, for instance, they usually have a little bit more volume coming out of non-derms than derms right now. And I think that indicates that although the incidence rate is lower for PSA, rheumatologists are more comfortable with biologics. They're treating PSA at a higher rate.","Ank spo is, I would say, even more of an underdeveloped opportunity. In particular, Lilly's program will feature the potential to be indicated in non-radiographic ank spo, so this is an absence of X-ray proof of the condition. This is a recognized indication in Europe, but not yet by the FDA. Should we achieve that, I think that presents a very significant market expansion opportunity for ank spo where the biologic basis of the condition is known to be quite similar to PSA and psoriasis.","So there's a lot of promise being held out for the class in ack spo. We see some early data from Cosentyx in that regard. We're using even higher doses. So I think we are optimistic on all those indications as being meaningful part of the ultimate success story of Taltz.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Great. Thank you, Dave. Mary Beth, next caller, please.","Operator","That line of Mr. Jeff Holford from Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Jeffrey Holford - Jefferies LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking my call. The first one just very quickly on Effient. Assuming that the exclusivity wouldn't be based on the 2023 patent, could you just give us what the more conservative timeline to think about for loss of exclusivity in the U.S. would be?","And then secondly, just thinking about going into next year post-election, just thinking about some of the rebating you've already mentioned on Humalog. With the LIS and duals rebating changes that have been kicked around a few times and are being kicked around again during this election cycle, could you just talk a little bit about your exposure to the LIS and dual-eligible population, what you think the probability of any rebating changes could be there and any ways the firm could potentially mitigate those? Thanks very much.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Great, Jeff. Thank you for the questions. Dave, if you'd like to go ahead and comment first on the Effient question. And then maybe, John, if you want to comment just generally on the size of impact of the dual LIS. And then maybe, Enrique or Dave, Sue, if you want to comment on any specific impacts or mitigation that you see with your particular areas of the business that would be great. Dave?","David A. Ricks - Eli Lilly & Co.","Yeah, I'll be brief. We've been consistent through time in saying the IP that we are counting on for our own plans as sort of being quite firm is the compound patent which expires naturally in Q2 of next year and then as extended with pediatric work, which we have confirmed would take us into early Q4.","The other IP, we're disappointed and we plan to continue to fight on those. But I think we've been consistent in our own planning that that's the firm date that we were counting on, and that remains true.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","John, on the overall impact of the dual LIS proposals?","John C. Lechleiter - Eli Lilly & Co.","Yeah, Jeff, I think if the low-income subsidy patients and the duals were moved out, and that's been around bandied around for quite a while and talked about, the order of magnitude of the impact it would have on the industry is akin to the overall impact of the Affordable Care Act. So we're talking something around $110 billion, $120 billion over I think a 10-year period. So it's a significant hit.","And it's, again, as I said earlier, it's not just bad policy, it's bad medicine. These folks are not going to enjoy near the kind of care and access to modern therapy that they're able to benefit from under the Part D coverage. So you can bet we're going to fight any such proposal tooth and nail.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Any other comments from -","David A. Ricks - Eli Lilly & Co.","Well, I'll let Enrique talk a little about the Inline business because we had a very significant exposure, say, five years ago in biomed with all the neuropsych products, but that's pretty well diminished in the U.S.","I would say from a policy perspective that I think two other bad things will happen if that goes through. One is, it it'll create an incentive to actually price higher because you want to get the starting point above where it is today given the 23% from the beginning plus the accelerated rebate based on price increases. I think it'll have a perverse effect actually on pharma pricing.","And then the second is I think it will take away an incentive long term to develop medicines for dual LIS beneficiaries, which is probably the last thing anyone in Congress would be wanting, but that will be the net effect of that change if it occurred. We're optimistic that we can fight that.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Thanks. Enrique?","Enrique A. Conterno - Eli Lilly & Co.","Well, clearly when it comes to diabetes, this would be a very significant impact. Now, as we look at Lilly relative to our competition, I think we're well positioned. We have stronger access generally in commercial than in Part D. And we have continued to prioritize that because clearly it is a more profitable business, a more sustainable business. And we've done this across all of our products.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Thank you. Mary Beth, if we can go to the next caller, please.","Operator","Thank you. That will be the line of Alex Arfaei from BMO Capital. Please go ahead.","Alex Arfaei - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Good morning, folks. My apologies if these were addressed. I was disconnected briefly. How should we think about pricing for Humalog? Obviously, significant impact here. I'm just wondering if we could get your longer-term thoughts there.","And then on sola, have you had any updated conversations with regulators or just updated general thoughts regarding you changing your primary end points in EXPEDITION3. Thank you.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Alex, thanks for the question. Enrique, if you could touch briefly on Humalog pricing as you're seeing it. And then we'll go over to Dave for any discussions we've had with regulators related to the change in end point that we announced for (1:16:55). Enrique?","Enrique A. Conterno - Eli Lilly & Co.","Sure. So I've commented on some of the dynamics of the quarter and some of the mix changes as we look at the increases in Medicare, Medicaid chargebacks as a percentage of the overall business. Clearly, we expect some of those dynamics to continue. For the most part, now as we look at the different formularies, all of the large formularies have gone exclusive. So whether it's on the Part D side or on the commercial side, as of 2017, I think we basically have a situation where Humalog will be exclusive in a certain number of formularies and a competitor in some others.","Clearly, there could be switches back and forth that would deteriorate prices even further. But we have not seen that because there's a very high disruption cost at the patient level to be able to switch 100% of the business now for more incremental gains. It's difficult to say what the pricing dynamics would be. But net prices when it comes to Humalog are pretty low already.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Great. Thank you, Enrique. Dave?","David A. Ricks - Eli Lilly & Co.","Yeah, like I said, really no change. We announced in March, as you know, the shift to a primary end point for cognition. Secondary will be function, sort of the key secondary. And at that time, we said we are in constant conversation with regulators around the world, but this is really a sponsor decision. Really nothing has changed with that.","We're now, of course, past last patient visit waiting for the data later this fall. And we'll just have to take a look at the data when it reads out here toward the end of the year. And, again, maintain that we think in mild Alzheimer's, certainly in prodromal and absolutely in pre-Alzheimer's conditions, measuring cognitive changes is a much more sensitive and much more appropriate way to measure disease impact and disease modification.","Of course, we will measure function in mild Alzheimer's. But I would point out for the mild study we started with AZ called DAYBREAK with prodromal mild combination study on our BACE inhibitor with AZ as well as our own prodromal program we just began with sola, all of those use cognition as the primary end point. This is a bet we're making across the portfolio and we think is well founded based on expert advice we have and the way science has evolved.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Thank you, Dave. Mary Beth, next caller, please.","Operator","Will be the line of Colin Bristow from Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Colin N. Bristow - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Morning, and thanks for taking the questions. Just on Jardiance, sales still light again versus what's implied from script volumes. Can you give color on what's driving this? I know you said last quarter it was a mix of gross to net adjustments and high use of copay cards. I'm just wondering, should we assume that the current net pricing is like a reasonable baseline or is there a negative pricing dynamic that could dissipate?","And second, on Animal Health, just a follow-up, it seems like your comments suggest these are just one-time occurrences that are impacting performance. And so should we anticipate a rebound in sales strength in 4Q?","And then just lastly on abema, can you confirm we should expect the MONARCH 3 interim before year end? And sorry if I missed this. Thanks.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Great, Colin. Thank you for the questions. So we'll start with Enrique for the Jardiance question. Over to you, Jeff, then for the Animal Health and what you see with dynamics heading into next quarter. And then Sue on the timing for MONARCH 3, which we did actually update back in August, but we're happy to go ahead and provide you that updated language so everyone's on the call's got that. So we start out with Enrique.","Enrique A. Conterno - Eli Lilly & Co.","In my view, the most relevant factor to look at when we think about Jardiance overall is class growth. And as we look at class growth, we have shared and we have been concerned with the overall growth that we are seeing in the SGLT2 class in the U.S. The class, as we look at the last four weeks relative the same four weeks of last year, is only growing about 20%. That's significantly below our expectations.","We are hopeful that the inclusion of the empiric outcome data on the label will be a catalyst for the overall growth and we feel confident if we get the right language that we'll be able to make a huge value proposition for this product in the eyes of our customers.","As we look at SGLT2 class growth, it is a little bit different outside of the U.S. In Europe, the class is expected to double. Same case in Japan, more than double in Japan in 2016. Yes, from a smaller base, but the growth dynamics, I think, are very encouraging.","We doing fairly well when it comes to share. We now have a 30% new-to-brand share in the U.S. Our overall share in Germany is nearly 40% and above 40% in Italy, and basically growing in Spain, U.K., Canada. So I feel very good about the position that we have within the class itself.","Now, on the pricing question and rebates, I did comment on some of the copay cards and some of the impact of those. I also mentioned that the impact of the copay cards is going to lessen over time because there's a duration of this copay cards. So while we have implemented some of those changes, we have patients on these copay cards already and some of them are also on the market, so we expect this to be a long-term phenomenon and we will see this decreasing over time.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Great. Thank you, Enrique. Jeff?","Jeffrey N. Simmons - Eli Lilly & Co.","Yeah, Colin, on the Animal Health business, I think overall at a high level, as we noted last December at our Investor Conference, we are going through a transition period. What I would note is, yes, the SAP cutover is complete and that volatility is completed. So we do see less volatility going forward.","I think we're keeping our eyes on a few things that are absolutely critical for Animal Health business. One, our animal competitiveness, as I've shared, we feel very good about that. Some of our growth engines, like our Vaccine business and expansion of that. And then we noted seven big products that were critical for innovation, which you know drives Animal Health just like pharma, we've put five of those seven products into the market and they'll be foundational to our growth going forward.","Then on the margin side, we continue to stay focused on the margins where we're moving to that low to mid-20%s and we see that happening in 2016. So overall, Elanco, our Animal Health business is well positioned in the top tier to remain competitive in this competitive, consolidated industry.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Great. Thank you, Jeff. Sue?","Susan Mahony - Eli Lilly & Co.","Yeah, with regard bemaciclib, so the MONARCH 2 data, we should have final data in the first half of next year. With regards to MONARCH 3, again, these are event-driven trials, so they could change, but our projection is that for MONARCH 3 we'll have the final data towards the end of next year. We do have an interim that we would see in first half of next year. It has a high bar. Our base plan is that we will continue through to the final data.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Great. Thank you, Sue. We're reaching the end of the call. I'm going to try and put a little pressure on the next caller as well as whoever responds. If we could, Mary Beth, go to the last caller for a single question and a prompt response to the question, please, and then we'll have Dave wrap up the call.","Operator","Certainly. That would be the line of Andrew Baum from Citi. Please go ahead.","Andrew S. Baum - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","Feeling the pressure. Could you talk to the CDK4\/6 category? Firstly, in relation to the competitive adverse event profiles of the particular drugs. I'm interested, obviously, in the commission feedback about the low-grade diarrhea versus the monitoring requirement that Novartis is going to face.","And then second, should we expect that formularies are going to exercise pressure in this segment as well given LB-3 drugs with very similar profiles in the way they're pulled to signal off the formularies that CVS in CML as well as other small molecular drugs, such as XTANDI. Is this the way the world will work within small molecule oncology drugs going forward?","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Andrew, thank you for the questions. Sue?","Susan Mahony - Eli Lilly & Co.","Yeah, okay. So with regards to abemaciclib. I can't comment on the safety profiles of the other products. But if we look at abemaciclib, I think we've seen that we've got a very tolerable drug that we can continuously dose.","With regards to the diarrhea, if you again saw the newer MONARCH data, if you could give over-the-counter loperamide, we saw very little diarrhea and very manageable and feel good about the safety profile there.","Again, I think formularies, it will depend what the data shows and how they differentiate it as to what happens with regards to payers and formularies.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Great. Thank you very much, Sue, for the quick response. Now we'll go over to Dave Ricks to close our call this morning.","David A. Ricks - Eli Lilly & Co.","Thanks, Phil. For those of you listening live or to the replay, we appreciate your interest in our company and your participation in today's call. Should you have any questions we didn't address, please contact our IR team and they'd be happy to help, as usual.

Thanks, Brad.","And finally, I'd like to take the opportunity to thank John for his steady leadership during one of the most difficult periods of our company's 140-year history. Spurred on by John's vision and his commitment to innovation, Lilly is today in the midst of one of our most productive periods of new product launches and we've achieved great progress building an R&D engine that has the potential to launch 20 new products in 10 years, beginning in 2014.","John, many analysts and portfolio managers I've met with in recent weeks have expressed their sincere appreciation for your contributions to the company and to the sector. You've earned their praise. And we all owe you a debt of attitude and we wish you all the best in the next chapter of your life.","Thanks, everyone.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Chairman, President and CEO, John Lechleiter. Please go ahead, sir.","John C. Lechleiter","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today to discuss Eli Lilly & Company's third quarter 2014 earnings. I'm John Lechleiter, Lilly's Chairman, President and CEO. Joining me on today's call are Derica Rice, our Chief Financial Officer; Dr. Jan Lundberg, our President of Lilly Research Laboratories; Dr. Sue Mahony, President of Lilly Oncology; Enrique Conterno, President of Lilly Diabetes; Dave Ricks, who's President of our Lilly Bio-Medicines business; Chito Zulueta, President of Emerging Markets; Jeff Simmons, President of Elanco Animal Health; and Ilissa Rassner, Brad Robling and Phil Johnson of our IR team.","During this conference call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors, including those listed on Slide 3 and those outlined in our latest forms 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC.","The information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It is not intended to be promotional and is not sufficient for prescribing decisions.","Before we cover our third quarter results in detail, I'd like to provide some high-level comments about where I see our company at this important juncture.","Losing patent protection in relatively rapid succession for Gemzar, Zyprexa, Cymbalta and Evista created an unprecedented challenge for Lilly. Leading up to and through this period of patent expirations, our management team made disciplined choices so that we could invest to drive growth in key brands, geographies and businesses, and replenish and advance our pipeline. We've stayed focused on executing our strategy and I'm proud of the results we delivered to-date.","In the face of a series of major patent expirations, we drove strong financial results from the rest of our business. We delivered on our promise to maintain our dividend while at the same time, returning additional cash to shareholders via share repurchase. And the significant progress we've made with our pipeline reflected in the large number of regulatory and clinical milestones achieved this past quarter validates the decision we made to maintain our investment in R&D.","As we begin to turn the corner with multiple new product launches over the course of this year and next, having withstood the profound economic impact of patent expirations for 4 of our largest products, we also recognize we operate in an ever more challenging external environment. We intend to apply the same focused, disciplined execution of our strategies that we've displayed in recent years in order to succeed, and I'm confident we will. We aim to compete effectively and to win in diabetes, oncology and animal health. This includes investing in successful launches for Jardiance, Trulicity and Cyramza, including important new indications of line extensions, and continuing to drive growth in our Elanco business following the acquisition of Novartis Animal Health. In the near term and long term, these businesses represent significant growth opportunities for our company that we must capitalize on.","In our Bio-Medicines business, we have opportunities to drive a subsequent wave of substantial growth in areas that include autoimmune disorders, with molecules like ixekizumab and baricitinib; cardiovascular disease with evacetrapib; Alzheimer's disease with solanezumab and other molecules to follow; and in pain with tanezumab and our CGRP antibody, all dependent on Phase III data readouts that will be accomplished for the most part over the next 2 years.","In R&D, we will sustain the flow from our pipeline and bring ever more innovative drugs to patients and do so more quickly and effectively than in the past. On the commercial side of our business, we will continue our quest to find ever more efficient and effective ways to engage physicians, patients and payers and we intend to capitalize on compelling growth opportunities in Asia in particular, specifically Japan and China. Going forward, we'll remain focused on executing our innovation-based strategy, focusing in on those areas where we have strong presence and capabilities or where we determine we can establish a leadership position. We believe this provides the best opportunity to meaningfully improve patients' lives and create value for shareholders.","With that, let's turn to the key events since last quarter's call. For the second quarter in a row, we launched a new product. In the second quarter, we launched Cyramza in the U.S. for second line gastric cancer. In the third quarter, in collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim, we launched the oral SGLT2 inhibitor Jardiance in the U.S. and in certain European countries. We're optimistic about the potential of this brand, including the opportunities that could come with being first to market with a fixed dose combination of an SGLT2 and a DPP-4, as well as being the first SGLT2 to report out results from a large cardiovascular outcome study in the second half of next year.","We've also had a large number of positive developments on the regulatory front. In fact, I cannot recall another time in my 35 years with Lilly, so full of positive regulatory actions. In our diabetes business, we achieved regulatory milestones in the U.S., Europe and Japan for dulaglutide, our once weekly GLP agonist. Here in the U.S., the FDA approved dulaglutide or Trulicity for the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes. Trulicity truly was designed with the patient in mind. It comes in a single dose pen that does not require mixing, measuring or needle attachment and can be administered any time of day independent of meals. We're excited to enter the GLP-1 market with Trulicity and we believe this product can be a catalyst for growth of the class. We began shipments of Trulicity here in the U.S. earlier this week.","In Europe, the CHMP recommended approval of Trulicity and we anticipate European Commission approval this quarter, with European launches beginning early next year. In Japan, we submitted dulaglutide for regulatory review and expect regulatory action in the second half of 2015. The European Commission also approved the Humalog 200 units per milliliter KwikPen for the treatment of diabetes. This product is bioequivalent to our current product, Humalog 100, and is intended for people with diabetes who take more than 20 units of rapid acting insulin per day. In the U.S., we remain on track to resubmit Humalog U-200 by year end.","In collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim, we achieved additional regulatory milestones in the last 3 months. We received FDA approval of Jardiance or empagliflozin, a once daily oral SGLT2 inhibitor for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. As I mentioned earlier, we launched the product in both the U.S. and Europe during the third quarter. Also in the U.S., we submitted the fixed dose combination of empagliflozin and metformin. In addition, we made progress with our insulin glargine product as the U.S. FDA granted tentative approval of Basaglar. With this action, the FDA determined that Basaglar meets all regulatory requirements for approval. However, it is subject to an automatic stay of final approval as a result of patent infringement litigation filed by Sanofi. The FDA may not give final approval until mid-2016 unless the court determines the patent is not infringed or is invalid or unenforceable prior to that time. We're confident that we do not infringe any of the patent claims asserted and that we will prevail in this litigation.","In Europe, the European Commission granted full approval of our insulin glargine product. This product called Abasria is the first insulin approved using Europe's biosimilar pathway. Lilly and Boehringer Ingelheim will launch our insulin glargine product based on dates that do not infringe valid and enforceable patents.","As you can see over these past 3 months, we made significant progress advancing our diabetes pipeline, moving closer to our goal of offering the widest range of diabetes treatment, spanning orals, GLP-1s and insulins both basal and mealtime. We feel each of our products will be competitive in its class, putting us in a unique position to help people with diabetes as well as the physicians who help them manage their disease.","Diabetes wasn't the only area where we saw significant regulatory progress. Our oncology group has been busy as well. We achieved regulatory milestones for ramucirumab across all 3 major geographies. We received a positive opinion in Europe for ramucirumab in second line gastric cancer. This opinion included use in combination with paclitaxel as well as monotherapy use. As with Trulicity, we anticipate European Commission approval late in this quarter, with European launches beginning early next year. We submitted ramucirumab to Japanese regulators for the treatment of second line gastric cancer and were granted a priority review. We expect regulatory action in Japan in the first half of 2015. And here in the U.S., we submitted ramucirumab to the FDA as a treatment for second line non-small cell lung cancer. The FDA assigned a priority review and we anticipate FDA action before the end of this year. This could lead to a launch in early 2015. Keep in mind as well that we have an ongoing FDA review of ramucirumab in combination with paclitaxel in second line gastric cancer. The action date for this submission is in the first quarter of next year and we expect FDA to act on or before the action date.","Finally, with FDA having granted Fast Track status to necitumumab as a first-line treatment for squamous non-small cell lung cancer, we initiated our rolling submission, which we expect to complete before the end of this year.","Turning now to clinical news. During the quarter, we also had Phase III trials read out in each of our therapeutic business areas: diabetes, oncology and bio-medicines. In diabetes, we announced positive top line results of 2 Phase III clinical trials in patients with type 1 diabetes for basal insulin peglispro or BIL, which is being studied as a once daily treatment for both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. In both trials, BIL showed a statistically superior reduction in HbA1c compared with Lantus. We've now completed the clinical trials for registration and are on track to submit to U.S. and European regulators by the end of the first quarter of 2015.","In oncology, we announced positive top line results for RAISE. This is a Phase III study of Cyramza as second line treatment in combination with chemotherapy in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. RAISE showed a statistically significant improvement in overall survival in patients treated with ramucirumab plus chemotherapy compared to chemotherapy alone. We expect to initiate regulatory submissions based on these data in the first half of 2015.","This marks the fourth positive Phase III trial in which Cyramza has improved overall survival, 2 in second line gastric cancer, 1 in second line lung cancer and this 1 in second line metastatic colorectal cancer.","Finally, in our Bio-Medicines business, we announced positive top line results for 3 Phase III studies of Ixekizumab in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. All primary and key secondary objectives were met in the 3 studies, and Ixekizumab was superior to Enbrel on all measures of skin clearance in both of the active comparator trials. In our Phase III trials, up to 41% of patients treated with Ixekizumab achieved clear skin at week 12, with just 1 injection per dose. These results give us confidence that if approved, Ixekizumab could make complete resolution of psoriasis possible for significantly more people. We plan to submit Ixekizumab to regulatory authorities in the first half of next year.","We also announced our decision to discontinue development of tabalumab, our anti-BAFF antibody. This decision was due to insufficient efficacy in 2 Phase III trials in lupus as well as in a Phase II trial in multiple myeloma. I'd also highlight, at the Annual Meeting of the European Society for medical oncology, we presented detailed data from the Phase III REACH trial, studying ramucirumab as a second line treatment in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma after treatment with sorafenib in the first-line setting. While the study did not meet its primary endpoint of improved overall survival for the full study population, we saw encouraging results in patients with high baseline levels of alpha-fetoprotein. These data could form the basis of continued study of ramucirumab in this setting.","During the third quarter, we completed enrollment in our core registration program for baricitinib in rheumatoid arthritis. Later in the call, Derica will provide you an update of our plans for top line press releases for this program. We also began Phase III testing for our CDK4\/6 inhibitor, abemaciclib as we dosed our first patients in the first of 2 breast cancer trials. Dosing in the second breast cancer trials and in a lung cancer trial is anticipated later this quarter.","In business development news, we announced an agreement with AstraZeneca to codevelop and commercialize AZD3293, an oral beta-secretase cleaving enzyme or base inhibitor, currently in development as a potential treatment for Alzheimer's disease. We recognize the initial milestone of $50 million pretax or approximately $0.03 per share after-tax as a charge to earnings in the third quarter. We aim to advance this potent base inhibitor quickly into a Phase II\/III clinical trial in patients with early Alzheimer's disease. Lilly will lead clinical development while AstraZeneca will be responsible for manufacturing. The companies will take joint responsibility for commercialization.","In line with our previously announced plans, we completed the sale of Lohmann Animal Health feed additives business to a management-led group. And earlier this week, we announced an expansion of our existing research agreement with Zymeworks to include development of immunomodulatory by specific antibodies for cancer.","In other news, we announced plans to close and sell 1 of our 3 manufacturing plants in Puerto Rico. As a result of this action, we expect to record a charge of approximately $170 million pretax or approximately $0.16 per share after-tax in the fourth quarter.","The IRS issued final regulations related to administration of the branded prescription drug fee under the Affordable Care Act. The final regulations modify the timing of when a company must recognize expense for their share of the fee. As a result, we recognized a $119 million non-tax-deductible charge in the third quarter for the fee we expect to pay in 2015. This accounting change has no impact on the timing of cash payments. Also, the third quarter charge is excluded from our non-GAAP results.","Finally, during the third quarter, we repurchased shares worth $300 million under our $5 billion share repurchase program. Since authorizing the program in October of last year, we've now repurchased $1 billion worth of our shares. Combined with our dividend in the last year, we've distributed $3 billion to shareholders.","And now I'll turn the call over to Phil for a discussion of our financial performance for the quarter. Phil?","Peter J. Johnson","Thanks, John. First, I'll review our GAAP results and then discuss a few non-GAAP measures to provide some additional insights into the underlying trends in our business.","Moving to Slide 8, you can see that our Q3 revenue was $4.9 billion which is 16% lower than Q3 2013. This decrease in revenue reflects a decline of $1 billion in U.S. Cymbalta sales on a loss of exclusivity in December last year. In addition, U.S. sales of Evista declined over $150 million, following that product's loss of exclusivity in March of this year. Excluding Cymbalta and Evista in the U.S., the rest of our worldwide revenue grew 7%, mainly from volume.","Gross margin as a percent of revenue decreased 5.2 percentage points, also driven by the loss of U.S. exclusivity for Cymbalta and Evista. In Q3 both this year and last year, the effect of foreign exchange rates on international inventory sold had a minimal impact on cost of sales. Excluding this FX effect from both 2013 and 2014, gross margin as a percent of revenue declined 4.8 percentage points from 79% in Q3 2013 to 74.2% in Q3 2014. As in past quarters, we've included a supplementary slide providing our gross margin percent for the last 10 quarters with and without this FX effect.","Non-GAAP measures are shown on Slide 9. Total operating expense, defined as the sum of R&D and SG&A, decreased 8% or nearly $235 million versus Q3 of 2013. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses were down 6% while R&D was down 10%. The reduction in marketing, selling and administrative expenses was due to the reduction in sales and marketing activities for Cymbalta as well as our ongoing cost containment efforts. The decline in R&D expenses was driven primarily by a reduction in late stage development costs, partially offset by a $63 million charge associated with the termination of tabalumab development. Excluding this charge, R&D expenses declined 14% and total operating expenses declined 10%.","Other income expense was net income of $93 million in Q3 2014 compared to a net expense of $31 million in the third quarter of 2013, with the change driven primarily by gains on the sale of certain equity holdings and income from miscellaneous milestones earned. Our non-GAAP tax rate of 22%, an increase of 1.5 percentage points compared to Q3 last year. The main reason for this increase in the tax rate is the lapse of the R&D tax credit at the end of last year.","At the bottom line, net income and earnings per share declined 41%. As in the first half of the year, this decline is significant but very much in line with our expectations and places us on track to achieve our full year non-GAAP EPS guidance.","On Slide 10, we provide the same reconciliation of non-GAAP adjusted information for our year-to-date results.","Moving to Slide 11, you'll find a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS and additional details about our reported earnings are available in today's earnings press release.","As you're aware, nearly all of our peers exclude amortization of intangibles from their non-GAAP results while we include this expense. For your modeling purposes, please note that we recognized amortization expense of $134 million, representing 2.7% of revenue this quarter. Many of you on both the buy side and sell side have noted that our inclusion of amortization expense in our non-GAAP results distorts comparisons of our financial ratios with those of our peers. After careful consideration, we've decided that we will exclude amortization expense from our non-GAAP results beginning in 2015. In particular, we hope that this change will assist portfolio managers in making better buy-sell decisions.","Now let's look at how price, rate and volume affected our revenue growth. On Slide 12, you can see the total revenue decline of 16% in Q3 2014, shown on the yellow box in the middle of the page, and that this decline was almost entirely driven by volume. Price added about 1% to revenue growth, while the impact of FX was 0. Excluding U.S. Cymbalta and Evista, the rest of our worldwide revenue grew 7% with about 5.5 percentage points of growth coming from volume and the rest from price.","Touching on some of the geographic highlights. In the U.S., pharma revenue declined 37%, driven by a volume decline of 38%. Excluding Cymbalta and Evista, the rest of our U.S. pharma revenue increased 6%, about half from volume and about half from price. Pharma revenue in Japan grew 4% with exchange rate masking stronger underlying growth. As you can see, volume was up 10% in Japan and revenue growth in constant currency terms was 9%.","In Emerging Markets, we saw strong growth of 18%, almost all from volume. Sales in our largest emerging market country, China, grew 21%. I'd also highlight the consistent strong growth we've seen from our Emerging Markets business this year, with 14% revenue growth in constant currency terms through the first 9 months of the year.","Finally, Elanco Animal Health posted revenue growth of 10%. The Lohmann acquisition drove 6 percentage points of growth with our base business driving the remaining 4 percentage points. This lower base business growth is due primarily to competitive pressures and to a lesser extent, to slower market growth in the U.S.","Now let me turn the call over to Derica.","Derica W. Rice","Thanks, Phil. On Slide 13, you'll see the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates on the growth rates for select items of our income statement. FX had almost no impact on our revenue or operating expenses this quarter. As Phil mentioned, FX only had very little effect on cost of sales. As a result, the decline in our EPS is very similar with and without FX.","Slide 14 shows our pipeline as of October 16. As John discussed earlier, Lilly and Boehringer Ingelheim received European approval and tentative U.S. approval for our new insulin glargine product and the FDA approved Trulicity. These approvals leave our regulatory review column empty. However, this shouldn't last long as we expect to complete regulatory submissions for necitumumab, basal insulin peglispro and Ixekizumab over the next 3 quarters.","As mentioned earlier, we began Phase III testing for abemaciclib in breast cancer. We began Phase I testing of 2 monoclonal antibodies, 1 for cancer and the other for rheumatoid arthritis, and we added the base inhibitor through our collaboration agreement with AstraZeneca. Finally, we terminated development of tabalumab and of a Phase I oncology asset.","Next, let me remind you of our key events for 2014 and review our updated 2014 financial guidance. We're very pleased with the progress we've made on the key events we laid out for you at the beginning of the year. As you can see from the green check marks on Slide 15, all the possible regulatory actions resulted in timely approvals, and we achieved nearly all of the other pipeline milestones. It's certainly been a very productive year and a pivotal one as we emerge from our YZ patent expiry period and look to return to growth. Before the end of the year, we expect to begin our second Phase III breast cancer study as well as our Phase III lung cancer study with abemaciclib. We expect to complete the rolling FDA submission of necitumumab for first-line squamous non-small cell lung cancer.","We expect to receive FDA action on ramucirumab for second line non-small cell lung cancer, and we expect to lose European data package exclusivity for Cymbalta in depression, following a loss of data package exclusivity for stress urinary incontinence in the third quarter. We continue to expect generic duloxetine to enter the European market in 2015. Also, after discussions with Incyte, we've agreed upon our disclosure plan for the Phase III trials of baricitinib in rheumatoid arthritis. This includes issuing the top line press release for the first trial late this year or early next year. In addition, the top line press release for the final 2 trials is likely to be issued late next year, after completion of the full 52 weeks of treatment. Clearly, we've achieved a great deal in 2014 and we're looking forward to maintaining this momentum both as we close out the year and during 2015.","Now let's turn to our 2014 financial guidance. Our performance through September places us on track to achieve our full year non-GAAP EPS guidance which remains unchanged at $2.72 to $2.80. We are updating our GAAP EPS guidance which is now $2.34 to $2.42, to reflect the charges taken in the third quarter as well as those announced for Q4. In addition, we are updating a number of the individual line items. We've narrowed our revenue range to $19.4 billion to $19.8 billion due to the weakening of the euro, yen and pound that occurred late in the third quarter as well as the recent competitive pressures and market dynamics in the U.S. we're seeing in Animal Health. Both of these factors prevent future headwinds for revenue.","We raised our estimate of the gross margin percent to roughly 74.5%. A major driver of this change is the weakening of the euro. While that brings a revenue headwind, it does provide a near-term benefit on the cost of sales. In addition, a shutdown to implement production changes at one of our bulk insulin plants will now occur solely in 2015 rather than span 2014 and 2015. As a result, idle plant, a period manufacturing expense will shift out of 2014 into 2015, benefiting this year.","In total, our operating expense guidance is essentially unchanged although we have modified the range for the individual components. We've narrowed and lowered the non-GAAP range for marketing, selling and administrative expenses to $6.3 billion to $6.5 billion and we've added a line to reflect GAAP guidance for the same line item which includes the $119 million additional pharma manufacturing fee. We've narrowed and raised the range for research and development expenses to $4.6 billion to $4.8 billion to reflect the third quarter charge for tabalumab, the base deal with AstraZeneca and trends in our research spending.","Based on the amount of year-to-date other income, we've raised the non-GAAP range for other income and expense to a range of $200 million to $250 million of income. While our non-GAAP tax rate guidance continues to be approximately 19%, we're now providing GAAP tax rate guidance of approximately 20%. These tax rates assume a full year 2014 benefit of the R&D tax credit and other tax provisions up for extension. If these items are not extended, both 2014 tax rates would be approximately 2 percentage points higher. Similarly, our expectation for non-GAAP minimum net income remains unchanged at $2.9 billion and we're now providing our expectation of GAAP minimum net income of $2.6 billion.","Finally, our guidance for minimum operating cash flow as well as capital expenditures is unchanged. Keep in mind that our 2014 financial guidance assumes the acquisition of Novartis Animal Health closes in 2015. Should the acquisition close during 2014, we'll revise our 2014 financial guidance if necessary.","On Slide 17, we provided a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS for 2013 and the associated growth rates from these numbers to our 2014 guidance.","Now before the Q&A session, let me briefly sum up. From a financial perspective, the first 9 months of the year have played out much as we'd expected. We've seen our revenues and earnings decline due to the U.S. patent expirations of Cymbalta and Evista. We've prudently managed expenses, driving a double-digit reduction in our operating expense base. From a pipeline perspective, we've met or exceeded our expectations. The flow of positive regulatory and pipeline news has been substantial and we've launched 3 new products: Cyramza, Jardiance and Trulicity. The steady advance of the pipeline strengthens our confidence in our innovation-based strategy and our commitment to accelerate discoveries to the people who need them. In addition, it positions us well for a return to growth and expand margins in 2015 and beyond.","And now I'll turn the call over to Phil for the Q&A session","Peter J. Johnson","Thanks, Derica. Marla, if you could go ahead and provide instructions to the callers for the Q&A session, please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from the line of Tony Butler with Guggenheim Partners.","Charles Anthony Butler - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Two questions if I may. One perhaps to Derica or maybe even to Dave Ricks, and the second to you, John. The first is really around the sales footprint. You've done a very nice job at keeping cost down but the question is with new launches, obviously, there is the need for additional marketing expense and maybe additional salesperson. So I'd love for you to -- if you could provide some idea or thoughts around both U.S. and non-U.S. footprint with respect to sales individuals. And then the second, John, you've made a good comment about keeping the dividend at the same rate, especially as you entered this particular year, but as you move forward with these new launches, have you given some thought to when it's prudent for the overall business to actually raise that rate?","Peter J. Johnson","Tony, for the sales footprint, Dave, if you don't mind maybe talking about some of the things that have been going on in maybe U.S. and Europe and in terms of some of the restructuring since you've been very involved in that. And then maybe Enrique and Sue, if you could talk about some of the preparations for launches since that's hitting you first in terms of the progression of the pipeline. And then Derica, if you want to take the question on the plans we have for the dividend, thoughts around the dividend.","David A. Ricks","Great. Tony, as it relates to the loss of exclusivity products, as we've been discussing here over the last 2 years, we've been taking down our sales footprint market by market. Typically, those are anticipating. They have been in advance of the LOE event. So in the U.S. you're seeing the full year effect of sales reductions in 2014 which mostly occurred in 2013 related to Evista and Cymbalta. As it relates to Europe, our patents are expiring this last quarter, reporting on now, some of those actions have been taken, some have not. But we do anticipate over the next year, rationalizing the footprint to the products we have in biomed, not including Cymbalta, of course, being the major contributor. Going forward, we're quite confident we have the personnel and coverage to launch our new product portfolio effectively in those major markets. Of course, we're shifting much more to a specialty type business, so the absolute numbers are lower than what we had in the past in biomedicines. Enrique?","Enrique A. Conterno","Sure. So when it comes to diabetes, Tony, we've had a very significant footprint on a worldwide basis. I think what we have said before is that we basically expect to leverage this footprint. We do see some increases but they are limited when it comes to our overall sales force. We've seen some increases in the U.S. but more marginal when it comes to Europe.","Susan Mahony","Tony, with regards to oncology, we're going to be using the footprint that we have in oncology. We've got an experienced oncology sales team globally, very experienced in thoracic oncology and as well historically in GI and we'll be using the expertise and the people that we've got globally on that commercial perspective to launch our products.","Derica W. Rice","Tony, this is Derica. From a dividend perspective just historically, before we entered this YZ period, our dividend payout ratio was in the 40% range or the mid-40s and that's kind of been on par with where our peers were as well. We knew as we went through this period that we would see a spike in our payout ratio as we went through this income decline, so the law of the ratio itself. As it pertains to when would we consider to increasing the dividend going forward, I don't believe we'll wait until we have to get back to that 40%, 45% range. It's going to be more predicated on our confidence as we see how some of the pipeline and regulatory and launch news play out over these next couple of years.","Operator","We'll go to Mark Schoenebaum with ISI Group.","Mark J. Schoenebaum - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","If I may, just 2 quick ones. Number 1, just a clarification. Can you guys clarify what, if any, interim analyses might be available to you for solanezumab as well as evacetrapib in 2015? Again, if any. And number 2, I was wondering if you could speak about the Tradjenta outcomes trial. I'm just wondering if there is prospectively evaluated endpoint of hospitalizations for heart failure. This has obviously become an endpoint of interest to the physician and the Wall Street community.","Peter J. Johnson","Mark, if you can still hear me, are you referring to the Tradjenta outcome study or studies or are you referring to the empagliflozin outcomes that we talked about having data for in the second half of next year?","Mark J. Schoenebaum - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Actually, both would be nice.","Peter J. Johnson","I knew when I asked the question, that'd probably be the answer. All right, we'll see if we can accommodate that. So Dave, if you could start us off please with the interims for solanezumab. Enrique, if you want to handle the question on the measures for the outcome study, that would be great.","David A. Ricks","Thanks, Mark. On, evacetrapib we have said we will be conducting an interim analysis. We expect that to be happening sometime in the first half of 2015. This is of course, a safety review but also includes some efficacy features. I think as we've said before, it's a reasonably low bar given that in lipid management studies, quite a bit of the benefit is often seen in the back half of the trial. So we'll of course, await that event and communicate quickly afterward if there's any change to the program. Otherwise, we continue to expect a final readout on that data in 2016. As it relates to solanezumab, we did build into the protocol, a possibility of an interim review. We have not decided to conduct that or not. One of the key reasons for that is this review needs to be conducted late enough where we have enough patient exposures. You may remember in EXPEDITION 1 and 2, a lot of the benefits started to accumulate after 40 weeks of exposure. And there's a relationship between the rate at which we've recruited the study and whether there'd be value in conducting such an assessment or just waiting a short time further for the final result. The study continues to enroll and so we'll be making that determination sometime in the next 12 months.","Peter J. Johnson","Enrique?","Enrique A. Conterno","Very good. So just to clarify, we are expecting for our EMPA CV trial to report out next year, and when it comes to Tradjenta in 2018. So a big difference in terms of when we expect the results. Both of these trials have similar measures. So we look of course, the CV desk, we look at MI and we look at stroke. In addition to that, the Tradjenta trial has hospitalization for unstable angina. So those are the prospective measures that we look at. We do have the ability to look at hospitalization due to heart failure. This is of course, an important measure. We would know more about the DPP-4 class I think, when the tech study basically reports out from Merck's up and down [ph] , we should get some clarity in terms of this particular measure.","Operator","And next we'll go to Tim Anderson with Sanford Bernstein.","Timothy Anderson - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","As you near the launch of your Lantus look-alike, the insulin glargine product, I'm hoping you can give us your latest commercial assessment of the opportunity both here in the U.S. and then in Europe where you'll launch first. At one point in the past, you talked about what you thought could be the market share potential of your product which was quite a bit higher than how Sanofi has described it and they continue to minimize the threat to their product from your program. When are we going to learn more from Lilly on some of the EU specifics like pricing and exact launch timing? And then my second question is on as we near the end of 2014 and move into 2015, I'm hoping you can qualitatively describe the pushes and pulls in R&D spending. It seems that you've crossed a lot of milestones in your pipeline and maybe there could be some easing up on R&D spending and that's already a trend it seems like that we've started to see in 2014. So directionally, as you think about R&D in 2015, what should we be considering?","Peter J. Johnson","Thanks, Tim. So Enrique, if you'll handle the first question and then maybe Jan and I will tag team the second question for you. Enrique?","Enrique A. Conterno","Well, on glargine, I don't think that we've discussed before what we believe is going to be our share update. I think what we have shared is that we expect that glargine will continue to be a very important product going forward. Clearly, there is a very significant opportunity. How biosimilars in Europe or in the U.S., these glargine follow ons basically compete and what those dynamics will be, will be critical to see what is going to be the share of the overall biosimilar market. We clearly are not the only 1 that are coming. We are maybe the first that will be entering the marketplace. But clearly for us, we like our chances because we do have the commercial footprint, the expertise in diabetes and the very extensive manufacturing capacity and devices to make sure that we can provide an excellent customer experience and go toe-to-toe with Sanofi. So we do have expectations for this product. We have to recognize that this is a very significant opportunity overall and even any type of level of market share can be basically meaningful from a revenue perspective.","Peter J. Johnson","Tim, this is Phil. On your second question, just as a preamble. We will issue official financial guidance including R&D spend on January 7 of 2015 for 2015. In that same meeting as we have in the past, we'll talk about some of the specific late stage developments that we would expect over the course of the year including Phase III starts, so I'll limit my remarks today to some of the things that are sort of already out there and known in the public. For pushes and pulls on R&D spend, clearly we've had a lot of trials read out this year that will not be continuing into 2015 that does provide some relief in terms of year-on-year compares. We do have trials that are ramping up for things like abemaciclib as we'll have all 3 of those trials enrolling quickly, we expect, over the course of 2014 and what remains in 2015. We also, pending the full removal of the partial clinical hold by FDA, could be restarting Phase III trials and a significant number of them potentially for tanezumab that would also add spend in 2015 that we did not have in 2014. And then also the collaboration with AstraZeneca for the base inhibitor which we're excited about, we do expect more spend in '15 compared to '14. In the past, Derica on many occasions has said that going forward roughly, we're looking at the sort of $5 billion number plus or minus a few hundred million dollars likely, as the place that we will be, obviously dependent upon pipeline outcomes and good investment opportunities in the pipeline. Jan, do you want to comment maybe on some of the things that are in earlier stage development that you're following in or are very interested in?","Jan M. Lundberg","Right. I think we should remember that positive Phase III readouts also would trigger additional opportunities. And we have a number of line extension opportunities and also the new combinations and so on that -- that we could pursue which we are currently discussing, and this is oncology, diabetes and the autoimmune space for instance. We also are very keen then of how sustainability of the pipeline and looking at additional Phase II investments. And here, oncology have a number of readouts next year including the gargalunisertive [ph] the TGF-beta compound, the MetMAb and several others. Diabetes, we have the glucagon receptor antagonist or oral first in class agents. And in the Alzheimer areas, as Phil said, we have our new base program in addition and we also have our plaque specific antibody N3pG which will generate new data. And just to remind you, we have also some very intriguing preclinical data with combinations of base and N3pG which actually cause more or less a total clearance of plaque in Alzheimer models. In the pain area, Phil mentioned tanezumab, our NGF antibody which we are very excited about based on the previous data and various pain situations. And we need to clear then, the situation with the regulators, with some additional preclinical safety data. We have our CGRP antibody which we are not only testing in migraine prevention but also recently in osteoarthritis, since we believe that this could be a pain mechanist that can be applied more generally. We also are looking upon data from our PCSK9 antibody and evaluating then the efficacy and so on, to see if this could be the potential best-in-class molecule in that area. And blosozumab, as you know, we delayed Phase III start but they are working very much on a new formulation so we could come back. And finally, we are getting data from myostatin on muscle building and we have recently reported that this not only builds muscle mass, but also strength. So we have a lot of opportunities coming both on existing then enemies [ph] , but also in some of the new ones.","Operator","We'll go to the line of Chris Schott with JPMorgan.","Christopher T. Schott - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just had 2 here. First, can you maybe just elaborate a little bit more on the animal health commentary from your press release and the prepared remarks on increased competitive dynamics? Just trying to understand that a little bit better. And the second question was on the near term diabetes launches. Can you just help set some expectations in how you're kind of seeing the shape of those launch curves? It seems like we've seen some kind of non first-in-class primary care launches that have seen fairly slow initial uptick in first year ramps. And then these products go on to be very successful but I'm just trying to think with these opportunities, is that a reasonable way to think about how these products will launch? Or is there anything you think about with these profiles or that you can do from a pair perspective that might result in a different kind of uptake curve for these products?","Peter J. Johnson","Thanks, Chris. We'll have Jeff Simmons take your first question and Enrique take the second. Jeff?","Jeffrey N. Simmons","I'll start kind of at a high level, Chris. As you know, Lilly has been very intentional and strategic about its animal health business. We've outpaced the industry in growth the last 6 years. We intend this year to be at or above industry growth rates. As you saw, our growth driven by both Lohmann as well as organic growth that we've seen in our existing business. But as Derica mentioned, there's 2 competitive pressures that were anticipated and they are both first in the companion animal space, seen a couple of new competitive entrants as well as we've seen the market actually not grow as anticipated. That was driven by one, cooler weather and then second is a little bit more movement into the OTC channels. On the food animal side, we've seen market growth not be quite as aggressive as it was last year. Some of that is, as you know, the swine virus has dropped pig population around the world, anywhere from 7% to 10%, and then just some of the natural dynamics in the market. I would say the other thing that materially impacted us was Zilmax last year went off the market and we saw 1.5% or so growth in our food animal business by filling this gap in the marketplace. And so year-to-year, that impacted our growth rate as well. But overall, we feel very good. Acquisition growth, international growth and innovation growth will allow us to see in the medium and long-term, at or above industry growth rates.","Peter J. Johnson","Great. Thanks, Jeff. Enrique?","Enrique A. Conterno","Maybe some comments on the structure of the market which I think in a certain way, impacts how we basically view the upticks of new products. And this is regardless of whether the product is first-in-class or second or third in the class. First, I think when we look at access, about 50% of the market in the commercial space -- 50% of the market basically is available for access when it comes to new products. First-in-class, second-in-class, third-in-class, you're likely going to be on a lower tier when it comes to the co-pay but it is not off formulary. About 25% of the market in the commercial space is going to have some sort of restrictions -- so step edits or some sort of restriction that goes beyond just the co-pay. And about 1\/4 of the market, the rest of the market basically is of formulary. So we need to take that into account as we look at the uptick of new products in today's world. In Part D, the situation is different because it basically takes a lot longer to be able to get into the Part D formulary. And it's not as simple to be able to get into a Part D formulary in the middle of the year. Now as we look at upticks for our products, we look at our performance, we've seen the plants where we have access. Of course, we also look at our overall performance. But as I look at empagliflozin, as I look at the issue of the 2 class, I have to say that I'm very encouraged by the uptick of this class. Not just the overall volume of prescriptions that we basically see but we basically have seen an acceleration of the upticks with the additional players coming into the market. So that to me is very encouraging. But not only is the quantity of prescriptions interesting but I think the dynamics of those prescriptions. Because they are coming at the expense of sulfonylureas. So primarily, the substitution that is happening is for when it comes to new patients, our patients instead of going to an SGU, they are going to an SGLT2. That to me I think, is extremely interesting because there is the -- just today, after metformin continue to be very widely used. So I'm very encouraged by the uptick of the class. It is early for me to make many comments about Jardiance but I would say based on 6, 7 weeks that we're on the market, that we're off to a strong start.","Operator","We'll go to David Risinger with Morgan Stanley.","David Risinger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I have 3 questions. First, with respect to the SG&A outlook, should investors expect SG&A to decline or stay [indiscernible]","Peter J. Johnson","Dave, you're cutting out. We can barely hear you.","David Risinger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Sorry about that. Is this better?","Peter J. Johnson","Yes, it is.","David Risinger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, great. So the first question is with respect to the SG&A outlook. Should investors expect SG&A to decline in 2015 or stay flat? Second, with respect to the earnings impact from the Novartis Animal Health acquisition in 2015, could you just review what you've stated previously and also comment on the amount of amortization that Lilly will exclude? And then third, could you just provide some perspective on the variables that will impact your decision over the next year regarding whether or not to take an interim look at the solanezumab data?","Peter J. Johnson","We'll have Derica handle the first 2 and then Dave, do you want to do the third please? Derica?","Derica W. Rice","David, in regards to the SG&A outlook, I'm not in a position to provide you '15 guidance at this point. As Phil said, we will have a more extensive dialogue around that on January 7. So if you'll just kind of live with this till then. And then likewise also in terms of the earnings impact anticipated from the Novartis Animal Health, until we actually close the deal which we anticipate being some time in 2015, we're really not in a position to talk about that at this stage. What we did say at the time we announced the deal is that by 2017, we would expect to have achieved at least $200 million of benefit or synergistic benefit that would result in cost savings as well as we should be able to get back to our historical levels of profitability in that 2017 and 2018 time frame which for our animal health business has been at that 25% roughly level of profitability. As it relates to amortization, what we can talk about at this stages is the amortization that we're seeing in our base business today. Obviously, it will be eventually impacted once we close the Novartis Animal Health deal. But in this quarter alone, we had $134 million of amortization expense in Lilly's results. And on an annual basis, it's about $500 million, $540 million. And then obviously, if we're able to close the Novartis Animal Health deal, that number will grow or get bigger as a result of that acquisition.","Peter J. Johnson","Dave?","David A. Ricks","I think there's an earlier question on this as it relates to the sola interim review. We do have a feature to potentially conduct such a thing. But the primary -- there's many reasons why we would pull that trigger or not but the primary one relates to patient exposure versus the amount of time left in the study. So you may recall an EXPEDITION 1 and 2, most of the drug impact appeared to occur after week 40. And so what you want is enough patients with at least that exposure, to conduct the appropriate statistical analysis. On the other hand, if the study enrolled very quickly, it wouldn't be so wise to use alpha to take that look. I think our current situation for -- as investors know, is that the study's enrolling quite well. And so we're not in a position to make a statement about whether we would conduct an interim review or not but those are the considerations we would weigh. And some time next year, we'll have something to say about that.","Peter J. Johnson","Great. Thanks, Dave. Before we go to the next caller, I'm sure that our Chief Accounting Officer, Donald Zakrowski, is listening, so I do want to go ahead and just set expectations. When we provide guidance on January 7, we will still have to make high-level assumptions about how we'll allocate purchase price and what the financial impact will be to both reported and non-GAAP results for 2015. It'll be later in the year that we'll actually be able to finalize those numbers, so you should expect that there could be some variance. Hopefully, it's not very large but some variance on specific line items or the amount of purchase price allocated to intangibles that are being amortized. So again, we'll do a great job I'm sure, with our accounting group, to get as close as we possibly can for our guidance but you may see some variability as we go through the year and finalize the accounting for the transaction.","Operator","We'll go to the line of Greg Gilbert with Deutsche Bank.","Gregory B. Gilbert - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I have a few. First, emerging markets growth was quite strong. Is that based on early benefits from your new commercial model or are there other factors we should be aware of that might be shorter term in nature on the pipeline? How is the base inhibitor from AstraZeneca different from your prior experience and perhaps, from Merck's approach? And lastly, on your PCSK9, Jan, you indicated you would assess to see whether it could be best-in-class. Are you setting the bar that high because of the expense or could you shed some more light on what you think about your PCSK9 inhibitor base and what you've seen to date, and what's sort of the go, no go decision it will be based upon?","Peter J. Johnson","Chito, we'll have you take the first one on the emerging markets growth. And then Jan, if you'll the base and PCSK9. And Dave, if you have any comments to add to the PCSK9, feel free to do that as well. Chito?","Alfonso G. Zulueta","Good to have the first question for the emerging markets for the year. So delighted to have the question. We're obviously thrilled to see the strong growth for the quarter and year-to-date. Let me make sure everybody understands so that a part of that strong growth is driven by a tender that we won for Humulin in Brazil, and a few one-time items with regards to China and our anti-infectives business. The underlying business is growing at around 8% to 9%, solid growth. The key drivers again would be China, really our diabetes business; strong growth in Latin America and pockets within the Middle East. Our fastest growing product, if you exclude Humulin because of the tender, is actually Forteo which is growing at 24%, 25% year-to-date. We think there's a lot more opportunity there but so is Humalog. So with the diabetes opportunity in China and emerging markets, Humalog is growing over 20%. I think it's early to say that the actual new commercial model is having an impact. Clearly, I'm seeing across all our affiliates, that the move to nontraditional, non-salesforce alternative channels is taking shape where we're seeing a significant growth in our interactions with customers using the digital channels which I think are, from our perspective, more effective and in fact, more efficient.","Peter J. Johnson","Thank you. Jan?","Jan M. Lundberg","Okay. The base inhibitor from AstraZeneca is also an oral compound and it's a nonselective base 1, base 2 agent which is similar then to our previous agents and also the Merck inhibitor now in Phase III. This agent has Phase I data, showing a dramatic a beta [ph] lowering in cerebrospinal fluid which is a good indication there are no target engagement in the CNF. But what we need now is longer exposure data in patients in Phase II before starting Phase III, to exclude that we see similar effects as we had on the liver or potentially other side effects, remembering that this class needs a strong safety component. We are very encouraged by the data we have seen so far. But again, we need longer safety exposures before we can start Phase III. In relation to PCSK9, I think we are all very enthusiastic about this class based on initial Phase III data from several competitors, including some preliminary data on positive mace [ph] outcomes. Therefore, for us, I think being behind, we will have a very high hurdle on this agent looking at what is the LDL lowering efficacy, how long is the duration of effect and what about injection convenience, the volume and the regiment and so on. And we have not yet made those evaluations.","Operator","We'll go to the line of John Boris with SunTrust.","John T. Boris - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","First question just has to do with your gross margin going forward. On your insulin lines in particular, there's some ongoing manufacturing changes that you're making to improve the efficiency of your production of your insulins. When you benchmark ourselves against your competitors, how much of an improvement do you think we might be able to see on the gross margin line from that and the timing of that as it filters through? Second question. In autoimmune, it would appear that you have a couple of assets there that could be ideally positioned to compete in somewhat highly competitive markets. How should we be thinking about an autoimmune buildout and the implications of that for 2015? And then just the last question on Alimta. Any update in Europe on either the German or the U.K. appeals?","Peter J. Johnson","So we'll cycle among the 3 business unit Presidents. Enrique, if you take the first question, the gross margin for insulin; Dave, for the commercial support for Autoimmune platform going forward; and then Sue, if you'd like to handle the European situation for the Alimta challenges. Enrique?","Enrique A. Conterno","So improving our gross margin for an insulin portfolio I think, is critical to us. We are in the process of executing our insulin technical agenda to be able to do that. What we have shared in terms of the benefits and improvement is that we should start seeing some benefit, but it's limited in '15 and more fully in 2016. Over time, because of learning curves and so forth, we do expect this to be very significant, and we have shared that our gross margin for insulin should improve by several percentage points over time. So a very important initiative for us and also is one that gives us flexibility when we look at our facility as being able to produce different types of insulins. So important initiative and we are very much on track to deliver what we've been expecting.","Peter J. Johnson","Dave?","David A. Ricks","We're obviously very excited about our possibilities in autoimmune. I would point out that each of the products have their own marketplace. And so although they may fit into a therapeutic area that's quite broad, we'll be competing against different products in each case. We've announced in the quarter last quarter, Ixekizumab's data and we're very pleased with the fact that it met all of the 10 points in a very strong way. We are working extremely hard right now to get that submission to the FDA in the first half of 2015, and we're encouraged by the possibilities for the IL-17 class, but also about the possibility for us to have a differentiated product within that class, and really successfully be able to move patients to the possibility of complete clearance of plaque psoriasis which is -- or a significant portion of them, which is what we understand patients want. The buildout for that business is, as I mentioned on a previous question, not as significant in terms of people and organization but is significant in terms of the capabilities. So the company is hiring from the outside, we're building medical infrastructure, patient support infrastructure as well as selling resource. To do that, we plan to be completely prepared to compete with the strongest players in the psoriasis sector at the time of launch. Baricitinib, we anticipate data soon. And I think as Derica mentioned, we will likely have a top line release on the first study over the next few months. And this also will be in a very competitive space in RA. We see baricitinib as a potentially disruptive technology in that space and one in which we could really change expectations for the treatment of RA for many patients. We'll wait for the data of course which will further inform our strategy. But we will also compete effectively in areas of medical sales and patient support across that product and plan to play to win in RA, assuming the data supports a submission for baricitinib.","Peter J. Johnson","Thanks Dave. Sue?","Susan Mahony","With regards to the Alimta patent situation in Europe, as a reminder, the European patent office ruled in our favor in terms of validity, and that is being appealed. We still do not have a date for hearing with regards to that. On the infringement, the German case that was ruled for us is being appealed and a date has been set for March of next year. And in the U.K. where the English high court ruled against us, and that covers France, Italy and Spain, that is also being appealed with a date set for March of next year.","Operator","We'll go to Steve Scala with Cowen.","Steve Scala - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Two questions. Lilly's 2014 guidance range implies Q4 EPS from down 8 to up 3. Why are you still guiding to such a large range with only 9 weeks left in the year and why didn't you choose to tighten the range today? And the second question is on the base inhibitor. There would seem to be 3 possible reasons why you did this deal with Astra. The first is that you fear that Merck is too far ahead of your own preclinical candidate, the second is that you see some weakness in the Merck agent, or the third is that you need a base to combine with your other agents internally. Any thoughts on which of those is most likely?","Peter J. Johnson","We'll have Derica take your first question and then Dave, if you want to take lead maybe on the base inhibitor question. Jan, feel free to chime in as well. Derica?","Derica W. Rice","Steve, we left the guidance range unchanged, essentially to say that our business in totality and aggregate we see as being unchanged at this stage. We did modify some of the line items. As you saw, we raised the bottom end of our R&D, we lowered the top end of SG&A but in total, we believe that our total OpEx will stay about in line with what we expected for the year. And then likewise, we're dealing with some of the top line headwinds as it relates to rate when you think about our outlook for the remainder of the year. So overall, we felt comfortable with the guidance range that we had. There was nothing behind -- anything beyond that to read into it -- no change to our EPS guidance range.","Peter J. Johnson","Thanks Derica. Dave?","David A. Ricks","Steve, to answer the question on the base deal, we're very excited about the collaboration with Astra, not only because we like the asset, we like the space but also we get a very complementary type of alliance with Astra Zeneca on this. You mentioned 3 reasons why we might be interested, I think those are all good reasons, there may be a few others. This product is clearly ahead of our own internal efforts, given the setback we had in 2013 on our own clinical stage program. It is different in terms of the approach to base inhibition from a chemistry perspective, so that's a good thing. With Merck's program we, of course, watch that carefully. We do think there's opportunity for differentiation and a best-in-class approach even if it's not first-in-class. And as Jan mentioned previously, we are excited by -- I would say we anticipate that combination therapy, particularly anti-body, small molecule combinations in the treatment of Alzheimer's will become the norm. And so having all these -- as many of these mechanisms is possible is probably a good thing for combination studies and offering more value to our customers. So amongst these 3, it's really all of the above, Steve. They're all good reasons to do this deal and we're excited by it. We have an aggressive plan for development and we'll give you further updates into next year on that.","Enrique A. Conterno","And just a final comment on tanezumab [ph] which, as you probably know, have genetic validation where people in Iceland and who have some mutation in this base cleavage cycle of APP actually are protected against dementia and live very long. So I think that seems to be very attractive options they may make.","Operator","We'll go to Seamus Fernandez with Leerink.","Seamus Fernandez - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","So first, Derica, can you be a little bit more specific on the percent of the gross margin benefit from FX versus the plant shutdown delay? I presume that the plant shutdown delay would then kind of recur or be delayed into the -- 2015. Just trying to get a sense of what the magnitude of that difference would be and if that would be a repeat delay or if it's something that you would expect then to kind of -- it's shifted to 2015 and then it's shifted again to 2016, so really, there's just a benefit this year but we need to kind of anticipate a differential but not a double hit in 2015. Second question. In terms of your expectations for U.S. coverage and access relative to Trulicity. I was just hoping that you could give us a little bit of color on your hopes for overall access, unrestricted access and Medicare coverage. For Dave, the key differentiating features of Xeljanz just versus Xeljanz with baricitinib that are hoped for in the product profile. And then lastly, for Susan, maybe ramu approval. It's possible that we could see second line lung approval in the fourth quarter this year. How should we think about the pace of uptake, the percentage of second line lung patients likely eligible for therapy and the duration of a real-world therapy in that context?","Peter J. Johnson","I think I've got that down, Seamus. So we've got the percent gross margin benefit coming from FX versus the shutdown. We'll have Derek obviously handle that one. So then the U.S. access outlook for Trulicity, Enrique; Zelgan versus baricitinib profiles, Dave; and then Sue, the ramucirumab approvals, some of your thoughts on the pace of uptake and the percent it'd be eligible in the second line. Derica?","Derica W. Rice","Seamus, in regards to our gross margin revised guidance for the remainder of the year, what's -- the primary driver is the benefit or the FX benefit. So we get a top line headwind but we get a tailwind in terms of the cost of sales impact when you include the FX impact on the inventories expected to be sold during that period. As it relates to the shutdown, it is a benefit in this year. We do expect to be more on a normal cycle next year so this is we would view as a kind of a one-time movement. So we wouldn't expect to see 2015 shutdowns being -- scheduled shutdowns being pushed out.","Peter J. Johnson","Thanks, Derica. Enrique?","Enrique A. Conterno","Seamus, I wouldn't be able to give you what our access goals are for Trulicity but I will share once again, that as we look at the diabetes space, regardless of class as we -- and regardless of order, what we basically see is that about in about 50% of the commercial space, we are able to get access maybe with the higher co-pay but it is access. And we believe that we can very much compete in that space and most companies can. In about 25% of that space, you have step edits. In some cases, in the GLP-1 class, this is going to be a step edit over GLP-1. So you have to be in a GLP-1 before you could maybe go on the new GLP-1 that is launching, in this particular case, Trulicity. And in about 25% of the commercial markets, there's really no coverage until basically the P&T makes a formal decision to be able to do that. On Medicare, on Part D, I think the situation is different because of the schedules. And while we are working to try to get coverage some time in 2015, I think the discussions are typically around 2016 coverage for Part D and whether we can maybe accelerate that into 2015. I have to say that we have been having discussions with payers around Trulicity and I do believe that we have a very strong value proposition, and that's basically what our payors are sharing with us.","Peter J. Johnson","Thank you, Enrique. Dave?","David A. Ricks","Thanks for the question. Obviously, the big caveat on all this is we need to see the Phase III data from our program and we're looking forward to that first study toplining here in the next several months. Which as a reminder, the TNF-IR study, so these will be refractory patients to TNF therapy, there's a complete program which also spans pre-biologic patients as well as a head-to-head against humira [ph] which is our structure study and it's fully powered for noninferiority. So one feature that could be different from tofacitinib is the clinical program. We built this program, looking at our own Phase II data but also what they had conducted. And we are optimistic that it will yield the kind of label, should these studies demonstrate the effect that we saw in Phase II, it will be very competitive in the RA market for us. Of course also, we have a difference. Although they're both JAK inhibitors we have different receptor activity. We are selective that JAK1\/JAK2 pathway where tofacitinib is not, it's a pan JAK inhibitor, this may manifest in different side effects or effects. And again, the clinical program will have to bear that out. Recall as well that we are very happy with our dose, our ability to select the dose that yielded a very significant efficacy result that was published in our Phase II studies. Really with the side effect profile that we think is quite appropriate for the RA patients and competitive with biologics, yielding the possibility of an oral medicine with biologic-like efficacy. And so head-to-head comparisons haven't been conducted but for instance, if we look at our competition which is unable to gain EMA approval really based on lack of effect at the 5 milligram dose, we think that could also be different. Ultimately in this class for early uptake as well, the overall safety profile emerging from the Phase III program will be essential to look at. We don't have that data in front of us but have been conducting regular data monitoring committee meetings and have been pleased that there haven't been any changes made to the program. So we'll wait for our data to come out. The way we designed this was to have a differentiated profile and really be able to present to the market, something that could change expectations for patients who suffer from RA.","Peter J. Johnson","Thanks, Dave. Sue?","Susan Mahony","Seamus, with regards to Cyramza, clearly we're very happy to not only have a positive Phase III study with Cyramza in second line lung cancer, but also get priority review. So we are hoping that we'll get an action by the end of this year and be ready to launch next year. Regarding uptake, clearly, I can't give you full details of that but I will say a few things. Firstly, this is the first agent to show a benefit in a broad patient subset, both in the squamous and the non-squamous in second line setting. And we have a good experience with thoracic oncology with Alimta in first line and this would now be in broad-based second line. So we're excited by the opportunity that we've got with this agent in the second line setting and clearly, our plan is to ensure that we have a successful launch.","Operator","We'll go to Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","John, you've been quiet on this call, I have a question for you. On the last earnings call, a lot of us asked you whether or not you're interested in a tax inversion deal and in hindsight, very smartly, you said you weren't. And congratulations, it's been a mess out there. But I'm just curious what your Washington folks are telling you about prospects for corporate tax reform. With the midterm election in a couple of weeks, looks like prospects for Republicans to gain control of the Senate look pretty promising; who knows, it's pretty close. But just what -- how should we think about potential changes to tax reform which will even the playing field for U.S. companies relative to foreign enterprises?","John C. Lechleiter","Jami, up to this point, I've been delegating effectively here, but you got me. I think on tax reform, obviously a lot depends on what happens in November and some of the subsequent dynamics and of course, what else is happening in this crazy world we live in. I think I can say and then our guys in Washington would say, we're cautiously optimistic that the next 2 years will bring about some sort of meaningful tax reform. I've never seen an issue where I go around and talk to people in both parties and everybody's in agreement that we've got a lousy system now that makes American companies less competitive. People seem to agree on the fact that we need a lower rate and that a territorial system of some kind would make sense. There's not unanimity on that but I think there's -- you get a fair degree of alignment. And then we get into the details and that's where the devil is. I mean, some companies are capital-intensive, some are R&D-intensive. Some have the bulk of their operations here, some like Lilly are sort of equally divided between the U.S. and o U.S. So I don't think there's a necessarily easy answer, even if we all agree that the status quo really doesn't represent sound policy and doesn't really put the U.S. on the best possible footing to be competitive. So we're going to keep pushing for it, we're going to keep talking about it and as I say, I think there -- I believe there is a window over the next 2 years and I think you're going to see a lot of companies, not just Lilly, really beating on this drum as well, Jami.","Operator","We'll go to the line of Vamil Divan.","Vamil Divan - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So just a couple more on the base inhibitor which we've discussed quite a bit already. But one is just a very simple question. I don't understand why you guys listed on Phase I on your slideshow and your pipeline, I think, was Slide, 14, when there's already a Phase II\/III study that's ongoing that you guys talked about, at least the Phase II part has already started. So just a simple question there. And then my other question just related to that study. I couldn't tell from reading the description if you guys are actually using your amyloid imaging agent to screen patients, at least those who might have mild AD for entry in this study. And if you could just clarify if you are or not? And if not, why not? And then one other quick one, if I could, on the diabetes side with the basal insulin peglispro. It's obviously the top line release you guys put out earlier, but if you can just give us a sense at this point, now that you've seen some of the Phase III data internally, what group of patients do you think would be the best candidate for that drug? Especially given some of the side effects we're seeing there on the triglycerides and some of the changes in HDL and LDL.","Peter J. Johnson","I'll go ahead and take your first one the phase of development for the base inhibitor. Dave, if you'd like to take the second question on the trial itself; and then Enrique, for basal insulin peglispro. So I believe both AstraZeneca and Lilly follow a similar process for calling something a Phase II asset, and that's when the first efficacy dose, the first dose of the drug is actually administered to a patient. We do expect that will happen in the near term. Just recently, that trial has started to screen patients. Should they pass those screens and after a certain period, they will receive their first dose. So it should not be too long into the future, you will see that formally change, I think, for both Astra and Lilly, to show us a Phase II asset. Dave?","David A. Ricks","There are many design features in the Phase II\/III program. We've incorporated learnings from our past failures and observations and disease modification in Alzheimer's. Among those include screening patients for the presence of amyloid plaque. There are many other things and this is I think why the collaboration makes sense for AstraZeneca and us, to harvest those learnings and build that into a base program, and ultimately, try to maximize the probability of success. So, yes, we're conducting screenings on these patients.","Enrique A. Conterno","Well, when it comes to our basal insulin peglispro, we have conducted our studies across type 1 and type 2, nice patients switching from glargine and also in combination with mealtime insulin and so forth. And so we have a wide spectrum of studies. I think consistently, what we have seen is superiority when it comes to hemoglobin A1c. And as you mentioned triglycerides, we are encouraged. I think when we look at some of the CV data in terms of -- and what we have shared so far is that we have already excluded -- when we look at our trials, we have already excluded the 1.3 hazard ratio and that our observed hazard ratio when it comes to the CV event is basically below 1. So we are pretty excited in terms of what this product would offer patients now. Specifically to your question, how does the benefit would vary across different patient types, I think is a discussion that we can have when we basically disclose the detailed data at ADA.","Peter J. Johnson","As we're reaching the bottom of the hour, if there are callers still in the queue, the IR team will get back to you shortly. For those of you who have additional questions, do feel free to call us during the day. We're happy to help with your questions. John, would you close the call, please?","John C. Lechleiter","Sure. Thanks, Phil. To all those on the call, we thank you for your continued interest in our company and for your support. As we near the end of our journey through years YZ, I'm extremely proud that we have executed on our strategy and delivered on the commitments we shared with you nearly 5 years ago. We remain convinced that our strategy is the right one for Lilly in order to create value for patients, physicians, payors and our shareholders. And our ability to execute so far gives us increasing confidence in our future prospects. As always, we will keep you apprised of our progress.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session with instructions being given at that time. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, today\u2019s conference is being recorded.","I\u2019d now like to turn the conference over to our host Vice President of Investor Relations, Phil Johnson. Please go ahead.","Philip Johnson","Good morning. Thank you for joining us for Eli Lilly and Company\u2019s first quarter 2013 earnings conference call. I\u2019m Phil Johnson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Joining me today are our Chairman and CEO, Dr. John Lechleiter; our Chief Financial Officer, Derica Rice; our President of Lilly Research Laboratories, Dr. Jan Lundberg; our President of Elanco Animal Health, Jeff Simmons; and Ilissa Rassner and Travis Coy from the Investor Relations.","During this conference call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors, including those listed on slide three and those outlined in our latest Forms 10-K and 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It is not intended to be promotional and is not sufficient for prescribing decisions.","We\u2019re pleased with our performance in the first quarter of 2013 as growth in key products and regions replaced the lost revenue in earnings due to the Zyprexa patent expirations. Lilly employees remain focused on advancing the pipeline and on increasing productivity while delivering results that put us on track to meet our 2013 financial guidance and to meet or exceed our mid-term financial minimum goals.","Let\u2019s start with a quick review events that have taken place, since our last earnings call. From a regulatory perspective, the first two items that I\u2019d like to highlight were achieved in collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim. We received approval in Japan for Tradjenta, as add-on therapeutic insulin and we submitted the SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin to both the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency for review as a treatment for type 2 diabetes.","We also submitted insulin lispro U-200 in the U.S. for type 1 and type 2 diabetes patients. And we\u2019re pleased to announce that the complication with the FDA, we received Fast Track designation and have initiated a rolling BLA submission for ramucirumab as monotherapy treatment for second-line gastric cancer. The first module was recently submitted and we anticipate that the final module will be submitted before the end of the year. Based on the overall efficacy and safety data from the REGARD trial, we believe that ramucirumab has a promising treatment profile in this difficult to treat patient population and we look forward to completing the rolling submission.","In clinical news for dulaglutide, our investigational GLP-1 receptor agonist being studied as a once-weekly treatment for type 2 diabetes. We announced that the primary end points related to reduction in HbA1c were met in the Phase 3 AWARD-2 and AWARD-4 studies. Furthermore, the 1.5 milligram dose demonstrated statistically superior reduction in HbA1c from base line compared to insulin glargine in both trials. We also announced that we have discontinued the Phase 3 Rheumatoid Arthritis program for Tabalumab, due to lack of efficacy. The Phase 3 program for lupus is continuing as planned.","On the business development front, Elanco announced the investment of approximately $100 million to purchase a minority equity stake in China Animal Healthcare, one of the leading players in the animal health industry in the People\u2019s Republic of China. The investment expands Elanco\u2019s commitment to China with the goal of providing innovative, safety enhancing food production solutions to help meet the growing food demands, nutritional needs of the Chinese people. And we completed the transfer of OUS commercial rights for exenatide to Amylin, Bristol-Myers Squibb and AstraZeneca. In other news we completed the $1.5 billion share repurchase program that we announced late last year. To prepare for the upcoming loss of exclusivity for Cymbalta and Evista adapt to changing customer needs and the evolution of the U.S. healthcare environment, we initiated a restructuring of our U.S. sales force.","The main component is restructuring it is significant reduction to our U.S. biomedicine sales force, with the reductions focused on our primary care sales force. In addition the restructuring takes into account termination of our U.S. promotion of Livalo, and transfer of the rights back to Kowa Pharmaceuticals, as well as a small expansion of our diabetes sales force. Finally as part of our continued efforts to align global manufacturing capacity with long-term business needs, we announced that we will close our packaging and distribution side in Eastern Germany during 2014.","Now let\u2019s move on to discuss our financial performance, as we\u2019ve done on previous calls we will focus our comments on the non-GAAP results, which we believe provide insights into the underlying trends in our business. This will exclude certain items, such as restructuring charges, asset impairments and other special charges. I should point out that our non-GAAP results include ongoing costs such as amortization and stock-based compensation.","Turning to the income statement, on slide 7, you can see the total revenue was flat at $5.6 billion as growth in key products and regions offset lower revenue, following a loss of patent exclusivity for Zyprexa in most major markets outside of Japan. Excluding Zyprexa outside of Japan, the rest of our revenue grew 5%. Gross margin, as a percent of revenue, increased 70 basis points from 78.6% to 79.3%. The increase in gross margin percent was due to higher production volumes and higher prices, partially offset by higher manufacturing expenses.","This quarter\u2019s total operating expense, defined as the sum of R&D and SG&A was also flat. Within operating expenses, marketing, selling and administrative expenses declined 11%, as a result of the company\u2019s cost containment efforts. R&D expenses increased 17%, largely driven by higher late-stage clinical trial costs, including roughly $90 million of milestone payments to Boehringer Ingelheim for the U.S. and European regulatory submissions for empagliflozin, and about $60 million related to the discontinuation of the Phase 3 tabalumab RA program. Excluding these items, R&D expenses grew only 4%.","Other income and deductions was a net income of $34 million in Q1 2013 compared to a net expense of $46 million in the first quarter of 2012. Our tax rate was 15.5% this quarter, a decrease of nearly 9 percentage points from Q1 2012. The decrease reflects the reinstatement of U.S. R&D tax credit for 2013, as well as the one-time impact associated with R&D tax credit for 2012 that was recorded this quarter. At the bottom line, our non-GAAP EPS increased 24% to $1.14. This includes a benefit of $0.07 due to the 2012 R&D tax credit.","Slide eight shows our reported income statement while slide nine provides a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS. As expected, this quarter we recognized approximately $495 million of income or $0.29 of EPS due to the transfer of exenatide commercialized Amylin, Bristol-Myers Squibb and AstraZeneca in all markets outside the U.S. Additional details about our reported earnings are available in today's earnings press release.","Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Travis.","Travis Coy","Thanks, Phil. As you can see on slide 10, our revenue was flat as the result of a 4% increase in higher prices, offset by a 3% decline in volume and 1% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rate. You will notice that U.S. Pharma sales increased 3% driven by increased price that was partially offset by lower volume. The volume decline was primarily due to the loss of patent exclusivity for Zyprexa.","This quarter our revenues in Japan were significantly impacted by the weakening of the yen. The 13% decline from foreign exchange and 3% decline due to the Q1, 2012 by annual price decreases were partially offset by strong double-digit volume growth of 11%.","As for emerging market, which is embedded in rest of the world, revenue grew 3% this quarter or 6% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Within emerging market China continued to register double-digit revenue growth up a 11% driven by strong volume growth of 18%.","Elanco Animal Health sales grew 2% this quarter, in the U.S. sales grew 9% as increased demand for continued animal products offset lower volume for food animal products, outside the U.S. sales decreased 8% driven by lower volume for food animal products. The volume decrease in food animal products outside the U.S. was due to transition stocking in 2012 associated with the Janssen acquisition as well as weakness in demand in many emerging markets that was consistent with rather industry trends. Despite the slowing of growth this quarter we continue to expect that Elanco will deliver robust growth in 2013 and in the coming years.","Finally, the 18% decrease in collaboration and other revenue is due to the transfer of exenatide rights to Amylin. Excluding exenatide, collaboration and other revenue grew 12% this quarter, driven by Tradjenta. Foreign exchange had a relatively small impact upon our financial performance this quarter. Consequently, we have moved the slide showing the impact of FX upon line items in our P&L to the supplementary section in the back of the deck.","Next, I\u2019ll provide a brief pipeline update before turning the call over to Derica. Slide 11 shows our pipeline as of April 17. Changes since our last earnings call are highlighted with green arrow showing progression and red arrow showing attrition. As Phil mentioned in collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim, we\u2019ve submitted empagliflozin to the U.S. and European Regulatory Agencies. We are excited by the potential of the SGLT-2 class for the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes. We believe empagliflozin\u2019s ability to lower blood glucose via a mechanism of action that is independent of beta-cell function or insulin resistant could offer benefit for people managing their diabetes.","As noted by the double asterisks, we also initiated a rolling BLA submission for ramucirumab. With respect to earlier stages of the pipeline, you\u2019ll see that we began Phase 2 testing of three potential medicines, a biologic for chronic kidney disease and two small molecules for cancer (inaudible) inhibitor and EGFR inhibitor and we began Phase 1 testing of a small molecule for chronic kidney disease. In addition, we terminated development of four molecules, two in Phase 2 and two in Phase 1. In addition to empagliflozin and ramucirumab, we have the potential to complete filings for three more Phase 3 assets this year and believe this pipeline positioned us well for growth post 2014.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Derica to cover some of the key events for 2013, to review our financial guidance and to provide closing comments before we open the call for Q&A. Derica?","Derica W. Rice","","Thanks, Travis. I\u2019ll begin my remarks with slide 12, now as we mentioned previously, 2013 is an exciting year Eli Lilly and Company. Let me give you a quick reminder of the potential key events for remainder of this year, and we continue to advance our pipeline and generating share clinical data that will help you better gauge our growth potential post 2014.","A number of potential external data disclosures remain this year, these include presentation of detailed data at the American Diabetes Association from the AWARD-1, AWARD-3 and AWARD-5 trials of the Phase 3 program for dulaglutide and in collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim for multiple Phase 3 trials for empagliflozin, both potential treatments for type 2 diabetes.","On June 24 we\u2019ll host an Investor event to discuss these data. In oncology we could have presentation of data from the Phase 3 trial of Ramucirumab in first-line breast cancer now recall that the data we expect to receive in 2013 will be the final progression-free survival data, and the Ingelheim overall survival data. And finally. presentation of data for the Phase 3 trial of enzastaurin as maintenance therapy for patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.","There are also several Phase 3 trials that may produce data in 2013 although presentation of detailed data and medical meetings would likely occur in 2014. These include the initial Phase 3 trials of our novel basal insulin analogue for both type 1 and type 2 diabetes.","The pivotal trials for our new insulin glargine product ramucirumab as combination therapy for second line gastric cancer. Our Phase 3 trial for Necitumumab in combination with gemcitabine and Cisplatin for first line squamous non-small cell lung cancer and the initial trials of edivoxetine as adjunctive therapy for major depressive disorder. In total, we\u2019ll have Phase 3 data readout or detailed data presentations on 8th of our 13 Phase III assets. As Travis mentioned, in 2013, we could have up to five regulatory filings, 3 diabetes assets, empagliflozin which has been submitted in the U.S. and Europe, dulaglutide and our new insulin glargine product and two oncology assets, ramucirumab as monotherapy for second-line gastric cancer for which we\u2019ve initiated a rolling submission, as well as enzastaurin for diffused large B-cell lymphoma.","Other key events to watch for in 2013. We plan to initiate another pivotal trial of solanezumab in patients with mild Alzheimer\u2019s disease. In August, we\u2019ll have the U.S. District Court trial for the Alimta method-of-use patent and in December we\u2019ll lose U.S. exclusivity for Cymbalta.","Now moving on to guidance. We\u2019re pleased with our solid first quarter results and are encouraged that we\u2019ve been able to offset the Zyprexa patent expiration through growth and other key products and regions. As mentioned in our press release, we\u2019re not changing our EPS guidance for the full year. However, we are updating a couple of line items. Effective July 1st, we expect to see an increase in the Puerto Rico excise tax. This has the effect of increasing our cost of goods sold and decreasing our tax rate. Giving the dollar amount of gross margin, our gross margin guidance of approximately 78% of revenue is unchanged. However, given the smaller dollar amount of pre-tax income, we\u2019ve lowered our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates by 50 basis points. ","We\u2019ve also updated our R&D expense and OID guidance. The range of R&D expense increased $100 million, offset by $100 million increase to other income. This change is due to the impact of empagliflozin submission milestones that hit R&D expense, not OID, as our original guidance assumed.","While all other line items, including EPS guidance are unchanged, I do want to mention two factors affecting our business. First, we received updated information showing higher-than-expected utilization of our products and Medicare Part D, thus increasing the impact of the donut hole coverage gap to Lilly.","Second, significant devaluation of the yen is reducing the U.S. dollar value of sales from our Japanese affiliates. We anticipate that the headwinds from increased cost associated with the Affordable Care Act and those Japanese yen devaluation will be mitigated by our continued focus to drive growth in our marketed product portfolio and by our efforts to reduce expenses. As a result, we are not changing our revenue or EPS guidance for the year.","Slide 14 provides a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS for 2012, and the associated growth rates from these numbers to our 2013 guidance. You can see that our GAAP EPS has benefited substantially from income-related to exenatide.","Now, in closing, we\u2019ll continue to focus relentlessly executing our strategy; to replenish and advance our pipeline; to drive growth in our on-pattern brands and in key growth areas of Elanco, Japan and emerging markets; and to drive productivity grains across all areas of our value chain. We\u2019ve designed this strategy to observe the effect of our pattern losses while funding the dividend, at least at its current level, as well as the R&D that will drive our future growth. This has allowed us to return nearly $2 billion to shareholders in the last year on top of the dividend.","Our financial performance this quarter positions us well to continue to meet or exceed our mid-term financial projections of minimum annual revenue of at least $20 billion, net income of at least $3 billion and operating cash flow of at least $4 billion. We submitted empagliflozin in the U.S. and Europe. We\u2019ve initiated a rolling submission for ramucirumab and we have the potential for up to three more submissions this year, two more in diabetes and one more in oncology.","And we continue to generate and disseminate important data that will help investors and analysts to better gauge our longer term growth potential, with much more data to come over the course of 2013 and 2014. We believe this pipeline with drive strong growth post YZ. We\u2019re confident in our strategy and in our ability to successfully navigate our patent expirations and emerge with even greater strength and capacity to drive growth.","This concludes our prepared remarks. Now, we\u2019ll take your questions. Operator, first caller please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our first question will come from the line of Tim Anderson of Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead","Unidentified Analyst","","This is Bruce (inaudible) in for Tim Anderson. I have two questions please. Your tax rate guidance for 2013 is now on 19%. Previously you have said that your tax rate would rise to the mid 20% in the 2012 to 2014 timeframe because of patent expiries. Is that mid 20% tax rate guidance to relevant for 2014? And my second question is you mention that you expect to have Phase 3 data for enzastaurin this year. Can you give us your overall thoughts on the product?","Philip Johnson","Great, Bruce, thank you for the questions. We\u2019ll have Derica to take your first question, Jan just go into the second one then. Derica?","Derica W. Rice","Hi, Bruce. In regard to our tax rate guidance, just a reminder we said that in our mid-term guidance that our tax rate would be no higher than the mid 20s, meaning of that\u2019s the maximal we expected to go. Fortunately, we\u2019ve been very successful thus far and through the management of operations as well as where our cash has been generated, our income has been generated around the world, and we\u2019d be able to stay in that low 20s. As you see here in the first quarter, we\u2019re also benefiting from how the impact of the U.S. R&D tax credit both in terms of the full effect of \u201812 being recorded in the first quarter of \u201813 as well as the resumption of the R&D tax credit in the Q1 itself. So we still believe that we\u2019ll be able to say below that mid 20s at least. And we\u2019re also at the same time well able to bring back sufficient cash to the U.S. to fund that U.S. operations.","Philip Johnson","Great, thanks Derica. Jan?","Jan M. Lundberg","Right, so w are evaluating and the story in the Phase 3 trial for the diffused large B-cell lymphoma and the inherited test for the potential to present relapse in patients following standard of care which is called R-CHOP for this particular form of new format. We have completed the enrollment and are expecting data very soon and the primary end point is disease free survival. If positive, we could potentially have an NDA submission later this year.","Philip Johnson","Great thanks, Jan. Paul, we have the next caller please.","Operator","Next from ISI Group, Mark Schoenebaum. Your line is open.","Mark Schoenebaum \u2013 ISI Group","Hey guys. Thanks a lot for taking my question. I really appreciate it. I think Animal Health is in the room correct?","Philip Johnson","Absolutely, we\u2019ve got Jeff Simmons here with us. We\u2019ve got the expert.","Mark Schoenebaum \u2013 ISI Group","Okay, fantastic. So maybe I will ask you an animal health question if I may.","John C. Lechleiter","Absolutely.","Mark Schoenebaum \u2013 ISI Group","I saw in the press release, it looks like your ex-U.S. growth were slowed down considerably this quarter and as you said it was consistent with industry trends out of the couple of other companies. I was wondering if you could go into any detail specifically what\u2019s driving the ex-U.S. weakness whether or not you think that\u2019s kind of one-time-ish or whether or not you think we should kind of be rethinking ex-U.S. growth rates in general. I mean the second part of the question is a little bit off the beaten path but obviously in China what\u2019s going on with the bird flu? Do you anticipate this ever, do you anticipate this having any impact on the animal health business over the near-term or over the long-term? I thank you very much.","Jeff Simmons","Okay, thank you Mark. Thanks for the questions. I would say overall, if you look at our business and the animal health business, especially the food animal side OUS, we are operating in the business that is cyclical in nature. Meat, [noggin] eggs cycle relative to demand. Those cycles have now become a lot more global as there is more global companies connected to this supply and demand. And you see this every three to five years you see a cycle happen and you see that with the public meat companies as well.","Today currently meat supply is exceeding demand in certain parts of the world and that\u2019s creating, we believe a driver in the slowing of this industry growth. I don\u2019t want to forecast the severity of it or the length of it but we do see this merge relative to Q1 2013 versus Q1 of 2012. I will speak on behalf of Elanco and say that even despite this, we continue to see our strategy that built on diversity that\u2019s built on animal, food animal therapy and productivity on the food animal side. We continue to expect that Elanco will deliver robust growth for 2013 and in the coming years and exceed industry growth rate as we have in the past five years.","Now, if we look at bird flu, I would say that similar nature you see in these different flus, in different emerging diseases occur, we had bluetongue in Europe a few years, we had a bird flu occur in Mexico a few years ago, and this one in China. What we need to look for is that do anything to soften the demand of key protein groups like poultry and pork in the markets like China.","So, this will be something that we will be watching and assessing. Our recent investment in China Animal Healthcare will bring us closer to that marketplace, which will help us understand that marketplace, which is a key marketplace. So, the big impact is \u2013 watching the impact that it has on overall consumer demand.","Philip Johnson","","And the impact this quarter, Mark, would have been nil to our business.","Jeff Simmons","No impact on bird flus.","Philip Johnson","Paul, next caller please.","Operator","Next, we\u2019ll go to the line of Gregg Gilbert of Bank of America","Gregg Gilbert \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks, good morning. Jan, I was hoping if you could walk us through the specific mechanics for the ramucirumab rolling submission and gastric and why that path was decide upon. And then for Derica, it looks like pricing negativity in Europe was quite good this quarter compared to prior quarters. I don\u2019t want to get carried away but is this new inflection point or this in specific sort of one-time things there? And lastly, if Dave is on the call, U.S. bio, the commercial footprint is it right sized for the foreseeable future given you current products as well as your expectations for\u2026","Philip Johnson","","Gregg, you still there?","Operator","Apologies, your line is open.","Philip Johnson","Can you here me?","","Gregg Gilbert \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","Yeah.","","Philip Johnson","","So, we don\u2019t have Dave with us on the call. So I think we\u2019ll go ahead and have Jan handle your first question with regards to ramucirumab and then Derica you can handle the last two.","Gregg Gilbert \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great, thanks.","Jan M. Lundberg","All right. So as you know we have completed regard trial for ramucirumab and monotherapy for second line gastric cancer where we showed overall survival. The Fast Track status has been granted and we have initiated a rolling submission starting with the preclinical module, and the plan is to have everything submitted before the end of the year for ram.","Jan M. Lundberg","Okay. Gregg, in regards to price as you saw in Europe, we were down 1% in the first quarter. Typically, we\u2019re somewhere in that minus 2% to 3% that\u2019s about what would be. We did see in the first quarter an adjustment for the transfer of exenatide rights outside the U.S. And then if you\u2019re looking back at the fourth quarter, you saw that we had more of a 7% reduction and that was really for the year and that was driven by the impact of the Zyprexa patent loss in Europe, but typically, we\u2019re in that minus 2% to 3% pricing impact in the European region.","Gregg Gilbert \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And then the question on, if what this action yields that the commercial footprints right sized going forward?","Jan M. Lundberg","","Clearly, we believe we\u2019re right sized great for the moment given the mix and the composition of the portfolio that we have in hand today. Now as we look at the Phase 3 pipeline and depending upon what emerges, I think in the primary care will find, what you may find is that we may have to build some presence as some new therapeutic areas where we haven\u2019t competed previously such as autoimmune great in the neurologist. Those are all possible areas of expansion as we think about our U.S. sales force footprint. But at the moment on the primary care side, we think we\u2019re properly positioned. And Travis you\u2019ve got an add on maybe to complement Jan\u2019s response?","Travis Coy","Yeah, Gregg, I\u2019ll just give you one more detail on rolling submission. We just need to complete some typical product stability work. And as Jan mentioned, we do anticipate being able to complete that work by the end of the year.","Gregg Gilbert \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great, thank you.","Philip Johnson","Paul, next caller please.","Operator","From JPMorgan, we\u2019ll go to the line of Chris Schott. Please go ahead.","Chris Schott \u2013 JPMorgan","All right, great, thanks very much. Just a two questions, first, going back to Elanco, you said, you mentioned these kind of three to five year cycles. Can you just give us a sense of \u2013 typically, when we see one of these, how long until growth normalizes? Is this something that\u2019s going to take a couple quarters to play out or something longer than that? And maybe when you\u2019re talking about, I wonder if you are bit interested in giving us your kind of best guess at what industry growth might look like in 2013 versus where you\u2019ve been historically.","Final question, just shifting gears, just some quick thoughts on the FDA\u2019s review of pancreatic abnormality seen with the DPP-4 and GLP-1 category, just any thoughts you might have there, appreciate it. ","Philip Johnson ","Okay. Great, thanks, Chris. We\u2019ll have Jeff, obviously, handle your first question and then either Travis or Jan, I think will go ahead and handle the second one. Jeff.","Jeff Simmons","Thanks, Chris. It\u2019s hard to predict on length of cycles and severity. I think you\u2019re seeing less severe swings and cycles being a little shorter given the way that companies are able to impact their supply chain of meat, and swing to these demands are much quicker. So, I would say that I think you\u2019re going to see them last in a probably shorter period of time and less severe, but it\u2019s hard to predict. And then, I would say it\u2019s going to be a challenge this year to predict growth rates again, where we\u2019re going to continue to look at robust growth rates, and continue to exceed industry growth rates. But I think this year will be a challenging year to predict the exact growth rate number at this time.","Philip Johnson ","","Jan?","","Jan M. Lundberg","Right. So the question about pancreas effects of DPP-4s and GLP-1s have been debated for sometime and we should remember first here that diabetes patients, in general, has the higher risk for pancreatitis, and also then in the label for DPP-4s. There is an increased risk of pancreatitis dimension. ","The \u2013 in relation to dulaglutide, we are still analyzing the data which will be presented at the ADA in June. But so far we have not seen any established quarter link between the dulaglutide and pancreatitis nor pancreas cancer. We are carefully watching this area and as you know safety is very high on our agenda.","Philip Johnson","Thank you. Paul, if you can go to the next caller please.","Operator","From Cowen, we\u2019ll go to the line of Steve Scala. Please go ahead.","Steve Scala \u2013 Cowen and Company","Well, thank you, just a few questions. First, just to be clear just a rolling filing of ramucirumab and gastric and provide that\u2019s a head to head study versus chemo will be part of the filing. Second, the ramucirumab breast cancer trial I believe has done, will you top line the data in the first half of this year. And then second, then lastly that the 10-K had stated at the Alimta 2022 patent has now referred to as a vitamin dosage regimen patent as opposed to a concomitant nutrition supplement use patent to confirm to legal strategy. What should we gleam on legal strategy from this change and why was it made so late in the process? Thank you.","John C. Lechleiter","Okay, Steve thanks for the questions. I will go ahead and handle these, feel free to chime in the table if you like. So as we mentioned earlier, you\u2019re seeing us not proceed with the submission of ramucirumab and second line gastric monotheraphy without waiting for the data in that second line trial and they\u2019ll get the regulators determined as the data that we have is sufficient for them to go ahead in the time. As we mentioned in the past, we\u2019re very encouraged by the data and it\u2019s typical to treat cancer and line of therapy where there are no approved agency yet in the U.S. and Europe.","In terms of the ram breast cancer timing, we have talked about having something in mid-year or summer of the two different ways we\u2019ve described it. Appreciate the question. I am trying to nail down a little bit more closely when that might occur. We\u2019ll have to monitor receive the actually occurrence of the event that are necessary to get the final PFS, as well as the interim OS.","I would indicate probably not very likely that that would occur in time to lead to a topline in the first half, but clearly we stick with sort of this mid-year summer time type of guidance that we said we\u2019re having data internally and then very quickly getting some kind of communication out of the Street would be our intention. And then there is really nothing I think to read into the change in our SEC filing in terms of the way that the method of use path and the concomitant use of vitamin B12 and folic acid with pemetrexed as described. I think it was just some shoring up of the other language based on reviews with internal counsel. So Paul, if we can go to the next caller please.","Operator","From Goldman Sachs, we\u2019ll go to the line of Jami Rubin. Please go ahead.","Philip Johnson","Jami, are you there?","Operator","If your line is muted Jami, please un-mute, hearing nothing. We\u2019ll go to the next caller.","Philip Johnson","Okay, Paul, if you could make sure you pull Jami in as soon as he can then we should be able to reconnect that would be great.","Operator","Very good. From Morgan Stanley, we\u2019ll go to David Risinger. Please go ahead.","David Risinger \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Thanks very much. So I was particularly impressed with the SG&A controls this quarter. It seems like you made the rationalizing the sales force earlier than I expected with the main patent expiration pressures from Cymbalta and Evista next year. So this quarter, the expense level for SG&A was $1.65 billion. Should we assume that that reflects the appropriate level of spending? Or do you plan to take the run rate of SG&A down in the near-term, Derica? And then just one quick financial question for the China Animal Health deal how much incremental annual revenue does that add and how much of that move the needle for your overall global animal health business, please?","John C. Lechleiter","","Great. Thanks for the questions David and we have Derica will handle both of those.","Derica W. Rice","","Okay, David in regards to SG&A, just to remind in the guidance that we provided at the beginning of the year, it included the actions that you\u2019ve seen culminating in terms of us announcing here today in terms of the U.S. restructuring of our sales force. So all of these things have contemplated in the forward-looking statements that we\u2019ve made, in regards to kind of the future, we believe we have again the right sales force footprint to accommodate the portfolio mix that we have at the moment.","The biggest key is going to see how the pipeline plays out, and the future impact that has there, you would expect that in terms of as we progressed through the year and if we march closer towards December [11], when we lose Cymbalta that you will see us further, pull back on some of our promotional activities behind Cymbalta, such as DTC, but until that, when exactly that will happen, we will not disclose. And we will constantly going to monitor the effect that is having, and obviously as we also get into the fourth quarter, you will see us beginning to have to deal with either both by returns reserve for Cymbalta and you could see, wholesale is beginning to the stock, so these are the kinds of things we will be monitoring as we process through the year to understand what are our promotional mix should be behind that brand.","John C. Lechleiter","","And Dave in terms of the revenues that we\u2019d be bringing in from the investment and the Chinese healthcare company, Animal Healthcare company we don\u2019t anticipated this time based on the structure and the minority stake that we have taken, but that would lead to equity accounting and therefore any particular impact on our financials. I also would say, if you look historically on your first question, SG&A is typically, significantly lower in the first quarter of the year than it is in the second, third or fourth quarters.","If you force out our SG&A guidance for the full year, subtracting than the SG&A for Q1, you will see that we still do in total expect you are going to see higher levels of SG&A spend on average in these next three quarters than you saw in the first quarter of the year. Again we will have to monitor our progress both on rightsizing our detailing and marketing activities, as well progress you make on cost controls and update guidance appropriately as we go through the year. But currently we still are expecting that $7.1 billion and $7.4 billion in SG&A for the full year. So, Paul I think we can go to the next caller, please.","Operator","Yes. We got Jami Rubin back from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Jami Rubin \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Hey, I\u2019ll try that again, thank you. Just, I may have missed it, but did you update us on the solanezumab trial design, your new Phase 3 trial in moderate patients and if you haven\u2019t when might you update us? And then secondly a question for Derica, I was wondering if you anticipate any impact from sequestration, (inaudible) is obviously a very big drug that\u2019s reimbursed to Medicare Part B, and as you know the 2% price cut has been applied across the Board, and wondering what you plan to do to make sure that these hospitals are not diverting sales away from Medicare Part B to hospital based products? I mean if you plan to discount it et cetera. If you are expecting any sort of impact at all? Thanks very much","Philip Johnson","Great, Jami. And thanks for getting back in queue and thanks for the questions.","Jan, if you want to go ahead and take the first question on update for the sola trial and then we\u2019ll obviously have Travis comments as you close to that. And then Derica, you\u2019re [if you just chime] and if you\u2019d like on the second.","Jan M. Lundberg","","Okay. Let me just start by saying that we are going to test mild Alzheimer's Disease not moderate patients and that is based on the previous data than from EXPEDITION I and II, where it was the tool mild patient population that\u2019s actually had a significant benefit, particularly on commission and the slight effect those on function. What we are doing currently is that we have ongoing discussions with regulators globally to prepare them for EXPEDITION III, which we plan to start during Q3 and that is what we can say for the moment.","Derica W. Rice","","Yeah. Actually before going to that next part of Jami\u2019s question, so, Jami, clearly at some point prior to the first patient visit, we\u2019ll be posting the study design to clinicaltrials.gov. And I think we\u2019ll be looking for an appropriate way to either reactively or proactively depending on the timing of this discuss that trial design with those of you and in the investment community that are instead more details. Travis?","Travis Coy","Hey, Jami. We do understand that sequestration has introduced some challenges for oncologist with regards to treating patients that\u2019s in Medicare system. At this time we are not seeing a significant impact to our Alimta sales, but obviously we are going to continue to monitor that situation and \u2013 we\u2019ll continue to work towards making sure our patients have access to into. Thanks.","Philip Johnson","Paul. We can go to the next caller, please.","Operator","Yes. From Leerink, we\u2019ll go the line of Seamus Fernandez. Please go ahead","Seamus Fernandez \u2013 Leerink Swann","Oh, thanks very much. So, as I look at the P&L overall, I\u2019m just wondering if you guys could talk a little bit about comparisons as you know versus some of peers as it relates to the inclusion of amortization. If you\u2019ve done any studies of how much is incorporated or included in Lilly\u2019s P&L versus others. There\u2019s obviously a pretty widespread and what is see is wider spread between your operating cash flow and your adjusted earnings versus some of your peers. So may be you can just kind of give us little color on that, Derica. And then separately, can you just update us on any of the Phase 2 products that you sort of see rolling through the back half of this year or going forward that we should be particularly focused on. Thanks very much.","Philip Johnson","Great, Seamus thanks for the question. Derica has actually had, actually has the team looking at some of those P&L comp, so I\u2019ll take the first part of your question and Jan if you would like to do the second. So increasingly over the last few years, we\u2019ve seen this situation changed, prior you have the minority of the companies that would be excluding from their non-GAAP results, things like amortization, expenses or stock-based compensation. I think as you\u2019re well aware of that list of companies has continued to grow and probably now constitutes the majority of our peers.","We continue to believe that if analysts want to know the cash generation that we\u2019ve accomplished in a given period has already financial statement that gives you those details. And then making those kinds of adjustments to non-GAAP EPS are not necessarily, what we would view as the right way to use non-GAAP, but again we\u2019re very cognizant that other companies are doing that.","We try to make sure that in our SEC filings. We provide the information so the analyst can see how much that amortization expense was for us in a given period, in the past I believe we\u2019ve only been doing that in our annual filing. I think going forward you\u2019ll see that we\u2019re doing that also in our quarterly filings, as well. I think this quarter it was probably somewhere in the $170 million or $180 million but I need to consult with our Q to see the exact number, $150 million I think was the number here. Jan?","Jan M. Lundberg","Okay, here is an update on some of the programs in Phase 2 and let me start with glucagon receptor antagonist, which is an oral agent in type 2 diabetes where we have Phase 2b data showing them glucose lowering et cetera, so that\u2019s next generation agent but potentially in for that the oral part and of type 2 diabetes. And we will present some further data this year on this agent. Then the next one is tabalumab, a monoclonal antibody against Sclerostin which have been shown to be a very potent anabolic agent and we will present some data in May for this agents, it has unique anabolic than building properties also compare to current products on the market like Forteo.","The next one is our oral base inhibitor, beta-secretase inhibitor which is in Phase II trials actually then for carrying forward at Phase III with those ranging and also looking at some safety aspects, this as you know the beta-secretase is an intriguing target which recently has been associated by genetics and to be active protective against Alzheimer's disease dementia and we hope to mimic this by this all other regions.","And finally in the oncology area we have a CDK 4\/6 oral agent which has been tested in various tumors including mantle cell lymphoma where this mechanism has been particularly implied for driving the tumor growth.","Philip Johnson","Okay. Thanks, John. Paul if you can go to the next caller.","Operator","The last caller in the queue is Marc Goodman of UBS.","Marc Goodman \u2013 UBS","Yes, good morning. So, Derica can you help us quantify the impact of the donut hole and the ND valuation that you had mentioned earlier. And second, with respect to following up to Dave\u2019s question around the SG&A and what was kind of in the quarter not in the quarter and the changes in the reps, I mean, was that impacted in the first quarter or should we assume that that\u2019s going to start in the second quarter because you just announced it recently. And then third question is can you talk about the (inaudible) market it seems to be a slowdown in prescription spare over the past couple of months, wondering how you view that market and how you view that market and how you think about the SGLT2\u2019s positioning in the diabetes space? Thanks.","Philip Johnson","Okay. Mark, thanks for the question. Derica?","Derica W. Rice","I\u2019ll take the first two, Mark. In regards to the impact of the yen, as well as the Affordable Care Act of the doughnut hole, the yen as you saw, if you look at our Japanese growth, the devaluation cost was 13 percentage points in growth. And so, unless you see movement in yen to appreciate then you would expect that that\u2019s going to continue for the reminder of the year. In regards to the impact of he doughnut hole and really more holistically the Affordable Care Act, we\u2019re probably seeing an impact somewhere in the $100 million to $150 million higher than we had anticipated when we started the year. And to your third question in regards to the U.S. restructuring, you should anticipate seeing the impact of that restructuring probably more likely in Q3 versus Q2. Travis?","Travis Coy","And, Mark, regards to, I guess, two more questions, so I think you\u2019ve got a total of five in there, so that\u2019s good work. Once where the DPP-4 market, yeah, we\u2019re (inaudible) with regards to TRX. We are, as you mentioned, beginning to see a slowdown in the overall market. But we\u2019re very encouraged by the progress we\u2019ve made with regards to Tradjenta. We\u2019re now seeing around 20% need of brand, which is comparing favorably and we\u2019ll continue to work towards increasing access for that product.","With regards to the positioning of empagliflozin within the diabetes, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we\u2019re encouraged by the independence of the both beta-cell function and insulin resistance from that mechanism and believe that SGLT-2 class will have or isn\u2019t encouraging class as we filed in both U.S. and European regulatory agency. So we believe that will have a very strong positioning and in particularly due to the mechanism and potentially the combination with other products.","Jan M. Lundberg","Great. Just to be clear, Ilissa have mentioned to me, when Derica was talking about the additional $100 million to $150 million impact from the Medicare part, you don\u2019t know holders to be for that for the full year as we talk about sort of changes to we\u2019ve had in our previous guidance. We would have obviously a much smaller impact on that in this particular quarter. And okay, are there any other callers? Okay, by the way we \u2013 regards to Mark, you would also for the restructuring of the U.S. sales force we actually accrued our provision for that in the fourth quarter of \u201812","Philip Johnson","Yeah. And as you think about the yen impact recall that that particular geography contributes over $2 billion of revenue for us and that\u2019s the rate as Derica mentioned that are currently there. You\u2019re probably looking at 15% to 20% devaluation sort of depending on where the yen has from here. So obviously, you\u2019re talking about a $300 million to $400 million headwind at the top line on revenue, again for the full year. Paul, we have any more callers that have joined the queue?","Operator","Yes from Morningstar, Damien Conover. Please go ahead.","Damien Conover \u2013 Morningstar","Great thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to ask question about some of the recent announcements of expanding the insulin manufacturing facilities. As you ready to launch your next generation of insulin products, I want to know how much you can leverage your current manufacturing capacity and how much you have potentially build out for these next launches? And then secondly, I think you just talked about having a bio similar version of its own Lantus. I just want to see your comments on, if they were to come through just how that might change the context of the market. Thanks you.","Philip Johnson","Great, Damien, we\u2019ll have John to take your first question, I\u2019ll go ahead and take the second. John?","John C. Lechleiter","Damien, we talked in recent months and years about manufacturing investment from two aspects, our insulin portfolio. One is the active ingredient manufacturing process which is the biosynthetic piece. Investments that we\u2019ve made and development strategies that we\u2019ve began to put in place number of years ago, will enable us to essentially use the existing footprint that we currently have in place for manufacturing the active ingredient that goes with the Humulin and Humalog to not only continue to manufacture those medicines, but also the our novel basal insulin and our insulin Glargine product, without appreciable additional investment there is some additional investment required, but it\u2019s far less than if we had to build our new plan and it enables to meet what we expect to be demand for those products through the decade.","Now, we\u2019ve recently very recently announced a further expansion, in our drug product manufacturing part of the equation, which is essentially additional capacity for manufacturing cartridges that really reflects growth in demand, we now manufacture those cartridge products both in, we will be manufacturing them both in the U.S. and in Europe. And even as we drive productivity from those operations I think that\u2019s going to be more of a function of market demand as new products come to market and there is a greater demand in countries like China for these products you are going to see us continue to make those kinds of investments, but those are relatively smaller capital investments than investing and a plan to make new [API].","Philip Johnson","","Great, thanks John. And Damien in terms of Sanofi being involved and doing their own biosimilar version of Lantus, I can\u2019t say that we are aware of specific plans that they talked about to do that, but we are aware of we maybe referring to as if they are developing a more concentrated formula at Lantus and they\u2019ve stated publicly I think that could have a different PKPD profile, time action profile and they\u2019ve highlighted that as one of their later stage development program.","In the past we have said and we continue to believe that overall glargine molecule will continue to be widely used throughout this decade and we would expect to be able to play quite competitively given our manufacturing expertise and capacity, our device expertise and capacity and then obviously our commercial presence, within that overall glargine space, but we would anticipate that branded Lantus whether it\u2019s the current formulation or potentially this more concentrated forms that would get to market we\u2019ll probably have roughly half of that overall glargine market would be our best estimate. We\u2019ve been expect to compete very well in the novel insulin space hopefully, if we get approval of our novel basal insulin analog the name is actually improve upon the characteristics and the benefits provided to patients from the current [basals] that are available.","Paul, we have any other callers on the line up.","Operator","There is a follow up from David Risinger of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","David Risinger \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Yeah, thanks very much. So just going back to the SG&A question and you provided a lot of clarity for 2013, so that\u2019s much appreciated, I am just trying to understand going forward for 2014, directionally whether the SG&A is likely go down in 2014 or be flattish? So that\u2019s what I\u2019m after to understand what the incremental SG&A reductions are for 2014 to offset the revenue decline for Cymbalta and Evista. So any color on flat or down in 2014 would be much appreciated.","Derica W. Rice","Hi, David this is Derica again, we are really not in a position to give specific guidance for 2014 at this stage, I still believe the biggest determine of that is still going to be what emerges from our pipeline clearly\u2026","David Risinger \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay.","Derica W. Rice","We will be in a position this year to potentially submit up to five products for regulatory approval. Depending upon the outcomes of those submissions, and when we see the approval, there could be incremental spend that would be behind some of those brands if we\u2019re successful, but until we know that it\u2019s very difficult to predict at this state. What I can\u2019t say is that today with the actions we\u2019ve taken and that we\u2019ve announced here most recently, we\u2019re very consistent and in line with both the near-term and medium term guidance that we have put out here in terms of the actions that was necessary to make sure that we meet those minimum of $20 billion of revenue $3 billion in income and $4 billion in cash flow. And we see our actions very consistent with that and we\u2019re actually a little bit ahead of what we thought we would be at this stage.","Philip Johnson","Thanks, Derica. Paul, next caller?","Operator","No one currently in the queue.","Philip Johnson","Okay, fantastic. With that we will go ahead and conclude the call. I would like to thank all of you for dialing in and to participate and I appreciate your interest in Eli Lilly. We\u2019re very pleased with our performance in the first quarter and the progress we\u2019re marking with the pipeline. To that point, I want to remind you that coming up at the ADA on June 24, we\u2019ll have a Investor meeting to discuss results, we\u2019ll be presented at ADA for both dulaglutide and empagliflozin and then also to put on your calendar a reminder that on October 3, here in Indianapolis, we\u2019ll be hosting our investment community update, the last one of which we had in June of 2011 in New York City, for addition to your regular scheduled earnings call, please put those on your calendars, we hope you can join us and we\u2019ll keep it praises with our continued progress as we move forward during the year, have a great day.","Operator","Thank you and this call will be available for replay after 11 am Eastern today through May 1st at midnight.

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I'd now like to turn the call over to John Lechleiter. Please go ahead.","John C. Lechleiter - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning everyone, and thanks for joining us for Eli Lilly's & Co. first quarter 2016 earnings call. I'm John Lechleiter, Lilly's Chairman, President and CEO. Joining me on today's call, and some from remote locations, are Derica Rice, our CFO; Dr. Jan Lundberg, President of Lilly Research Labs; Dr. Sue Mahony, President of Lilly Oncology; Enrique Conterno, President of Lilly Diabetes; Dave Ricks, who is President of Lilly Bio-Medicines; Chito Zulueta, President of Emerging Markets; Jeff Simmons, President of Elanco Animal Health; and Ilissa Rassner, Brad Robling and Phil Johnson of the Investor Relations team.","During this conference call we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors, including those listed on slide three and those outlined in our latest Forms 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC. The information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It is not intended to be promotional, and it's not sufficient for prescribing decisions.","Successful execution of our innovation-based strategy has put Lilly on a positive trajectory that became most evident in 2014 and 2015, particularly with regard to sustaining the flow of innovation. Building on that positive momentum, 2016 is off to a good start.","Let me begin our call today by recapping progress we've made on our strategic objectives since our last earnings call in January. Slide four should be familiar to you, depicting the four strategic objectives for our post-patent expiration period that we first laid out in January of 2015.","On our first strategic objective, grow revenue, in the first quarter we grew revenue 8% on a constant currency for-performance basis. Nearly all of this performance growth was driven by volume. And in total, our new products, Trulicity, Cyramza, Jardiance, Basaglar and Portrazza drove five percentage points of this volume growth.","Starting with today's call, we'll include in our earnings calls an update on the performance of new products for their first three years on the market. In addition, you'll see that we've included additional product information in our supplementary slides. Course, we welcome your feedback on this approach.","Turning to our next strategic objective, expand margins, our non-GAAP OpEx as a percent of revenue was up slightly compared to the first quarter 2015 due to the baricitinib milestone payments paid to Incyte, which totaled $55 million in the quarter. Excluding these payments, our OpEx percent was flat. We're on track to achieve our full-year guidance, which, at the midpoint of our ranges, implies an improvement of 200 to 250 basis points in OpEx as a percent of revenue, even including the baricitinib milestones.","Under the heading of sustaining the flow of innovation, I've highlighted a few examples of the continued success we're experiencing. Along with AstraZeneca, we announced that our BACE inhibitor advanced into the Phase 3 portion of the AMARANTH study in early Alzheimer's disease.","Taltz, discovered here at Lilly, was approved in the U.S. for moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, and initial shipments left our warehouse earlier this month. And just yesterday we received European approval.","Also, olaratumab, a monoclonal antibody from our ImClone acquisition, has now been submitted to U.S. and European regulatory authorities for soft-tissue sarcoma.","During this call we'll provide a more complete list of the pipeline progress we've achieved over the last three months.","Finally, on our strategic objective, deploy capital to create value, during the quarter we returned over $800 million to shareholders through our quarterly dividend and ongoing share repurchase plan. On the business development front, we completed a number of smaller deals including the Aratana deal, to bolster our companion animal business, and we continue to actively pursue external opportunities to enhance our future growth projects.","In summary I'm confident that we're on track and achieve each of our strategic objectives and assure you that their achievement remains a top priority of our entire management team.","Now, let's move on to a review of the key events that occurred since our last earnings call. On the commercial front, in Europe following European Commission approval in late January, we launched Cyramza for second line, non-small-cell lung cancer and for second line metastatic colorectal cancer. We also received European Commission approval for, and earlier this month launched, Portrazza for first-line EGFR expressing squamous non-small-cell lung cancer.","As I just mentioned, earlier this month we launched Taltz in the U.S. for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis following FDA approval in the first quarter. And also here in the U.S., we launched the Humulin Regular U-500 KwikPen.","It was a busy three months on the regulatory front as well. In addition to the U.S. and European approvals of Taltz and the European approval of Portrazza, in Japan we submitted baricitinib for the treatment of moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis. This represents an outstanding achievement, as regulatory submissions in the U.S., Europe and Japan occurred within a span of less than 40 working days. This also demonstrates that our focus on development execution is paying off.","As an update to the submission announcement we made with Incyte, here in the U.S., the FDA has now accepted our submission for baricitinib, and we look forward to regulatory action in early 2017. As I mentioned earlier in both the U.S. and Europe, we submitted olaratumab for the treatment of soft tissue sarcoma.","In collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim, we submitted the once-daily combination tablet of empagliflozin and metformin XR to the FDA. And on the Animal Health front we received U.S. approval for Imrestor, a non-antibiotic Animal Health product for reduction of the incidents of clinical mastitis in dairy cows. Imrestor is a protein and a first-of-its-kind therapy that helps support the natural function of a dairy cow's immune system during the critical time around calving, when the risk for mastitis is heightened.","On the clinical front, we announced a change to the EXPEDITION3 trial, solanezumab, in patients with mild Alzheimer's disease, making the ADAS-Cog14 cognitive scale the sole primary endpoint. Functional outcomes will be evaluated as key secondary endpoints.","Along with AstraZeneca, we announced that AMARANTH, a Phase 2\/3 study of AZD3293, an oral beta secretase cleaving enzyme or BACE inhibitor, currently in development as a potential treatment for early Alzheimer's disease, will move into the Phase 3 portion of this Phase 2\/3 seamless trial. This movement into Phase 3 triggers a milestone payment from Lilly to AstraZeneca which will result in a second quarter pre-tax charge of $100 million to Lilly's GAAP and non-GAAP research and development expense.","As mentioned at our December 8 Investment Community Meeting, the transition of AMARANTH into Phase 3 will also trigger the start of a second Phase 3 study with AZD3293. That study, called DAYBREAK, will focus on patients with mild Alzheimer's disease and is scheduled to begin enrolling patients in the third quarter this year. Similar to the EXPEDITION3 trial of solanezumab, also in patients with mild Alzheimer's disease, DAYBREAK will use a single cognitive primary endpoint. In this case, ADAS-Cog13. Further, the AMARANTH trial in patients with early Alzheimer's disease will also be changed to use ADAS-Cog13 as a single primary endpoint.","So we're consistently moving to a single cognitive primary endpoint across our trials in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease. And following the successful results of the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial along with Boehringer Ingelheim, we announced plans to conduct two outcome trials investigating Jardiance for the treatment of people with chronic heart failure. The trials are expected to begin within the next 12 months and are planned to enroll people with chronic heart failure both with and without type 2 diabetes.","On the business development front, we modified our existing baricitinib agreement to provide Incyte with the right to develop ruxolitinib or Jakafi for graft versus host disease. We retain rights to develop baricitinib for this indication. As part of this deal, Lilly will receive a $35 million upfront payment that will be recognized as other income in the second quarter both in our GAAP and non-GAAP results.","On the Animal Health side of the business, yesterday we announced that we licensed rights to Aratana's Galliprant, an FDA approved therapeutic for the control of pain and inflammation associated with osteoarthritis in dogs. This deal includes an upfront payment of $45 million plus additional milestone and royalty payments upon meeting certain development, regulatory and sales milestones. Galliprant will support the growth of our companion animal therapeutic segment, one of the key growth engines for our Animal Health business.","In other news, the UK High Court decided the Alimta vitamin regimen patent would not presently be infringed by Actavis marketing pemetrexed trometamol in the UK, France, Italy and Spain with instructions to dilute the product only with dextrose solution. We plan to appeal this decision to the UK Court of Appeal.","Finally, in the first quarter, we repurchased $300 million of stock, leaving $2.65 billion remaining on our $5 billion plan. During the quarter, we also distributed over $500 million to shareholders via our dividend. We remain committed to providing a robust dividend and to returning excess cash to shareholders.","And now, I'll turn the call over to Phil for a discussion of our financial performance for the quarter.","Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations","Thanks, John. Slide seven summarizes our presentation of GAAP results and non-GAAP measures, while slide eight provides a summary of our GAAP results. I'll focus my comments on our non-GAAP adjusted measures to provide insights into the underlying trends in our business, so please refer to today's earnings press release for a detailed description of the year-on-year changes in our first quarter GAAP results.","Of note, you will see in our GAAP other income and expense we have recognized a pre-tax charge of $204 million equivalent to $0.19 per share related to the significant deterioration of the Venezuelan economy and its impact on the bolivar. This charge represents the effect of revaluing our bolivar-denominated assets and liabilities at a rate of 275.","Moving to non-GAAP measures on slide nine, you can see that Q1 2016 revenue increased 5% compared to Q1 2015 reaching $4.865 billion. Foreign exchange rates continue to provide a top line headwind. Excluding FX, our Q1 revenue increased 8% driven by higher volume from Trulicity, Cyramza, Humalog, Jardiance, and Trajenta among others, as well as by the takeback of North American rights for Erbitux. The effective price was 1%.","Gross margin as a percent of revenue decreased 1.9 percentage points to 76.3%. This decrease was primarily driven by the effect of foreign exchange rates on international inventory sold. This effect resulted in a benefit both this quarter and last year's quarter, but the benefit this quarter was substantially smaller than the benefit realized last year. Excluding this FX effect, our gross margin percent decreased by 40 basis points going from 75.3% in last year's quarter to 74.9% this quarter, driven primarily by product mix and the timing of production.","Total operating expense, defined as the sum of R&D and SG&A, increased by 7% compared to Q1 of 2015. Breaking this into its component parts, marketing, selling and administrative expenses declined 1% while R&D increased 17%. The reduction in marketing, selling and administrative expenses was due to the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates and lower litigation expenses, partially offset by expenses to support new products. The increase in R&D expense was driven primarily by higher late-stage clinical development costs, including $55 million in milestone payments to Incyte triggered by regulatory submissions for baricitinib in the U.S. and Europe.","These milestone payments added over 5 percentage points to R&D expense growth and over 2 percentage points to total operating expense growth. Excluding these milestone payments, total operating expenses increased about 4.5% which was slightly slower than revenue growth.","Other income and expense was income of $55 million this quarter and this represents a reduction of $38 million compared to Q1 2015, primarily due to lower net gains on investments.","Our tax rate was 17.9%, a decrease of 5 percentage points compared to the same quarter last year. This decrease is due to a net discrete tax benefit of roughly $50 million this quarter and the benefit of certain U.S. tax provisions including the R&D tax credit that were in force during this year's quarter but had lapsed during last year's quarter. This was partially offset by a higher percentage of earnings in higher-tax jurisdictions this year compared to last year.","At the bottom line, net income decreased 4% and earnings per share decreased 5%. While I'll cover the FX effect on our income statement in a subsequent slide, I would highlight that when excluding the effect of FX, non-GAAP net income and EPS actually increased 5% this quarter.","Slide 10 provides a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS and you'll find additional details on these adjustments on slide 23.","Now let's take a look at the effect of price rate and volume on Q1 revenue growth. On slide 11 in the yellow highlighted row at the bottom of the table, you'll see the 5% revenue growth I mentioned earlier. When compared to Q1 last year, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against many foreign currencies was a headwind to revenue growth, as shown by the 3% negative effect from FX this quarter.","On a performance basis, our worldwide revenue grew 8%, driven by volume growth of 7 percentage points with price growth of 1 percentage point.","By geography, you'll notice that U.S. pharma revenue increased 17%, driven by volume, and to a much lesser extent, price. Trulicity, Humalog, Jardiance and Humulin all made substantial contributions to U.S. pharma volume growth.","Having completed the takeback of North American rights for Erbitux on October 1, we also benefited from booking a full quarter's end sales of Erbitux. The decline in EuCan revenue of 5% was entirely driven by the negative effect of FX, while on a constant currency or performance basis, EuCan revenue increased 1%. This increase was driven by volume gains on many products, most notably Trulicity and Cyramza, but also including Basaglar, Forteo, Jardiance, Humulin, Trajenta, and Strattera that more than offset a substantial reduction in European Cymbalta sales resulting from loss of data package exclusivity. Excluding Cymbalta, EuCan sales increased 10% in constant currency term.","In Japan, pharma revenue increased 16% in total, driven by high teens' volume growth. You'll also see a slightly larger negative impact from price as the latest round of price revisions in Japan took effect on March 1. On a constant currency basis, Japan pharma revenue increased 14%, and this performance growth was attributable to a number of products, led by Cyramza but also including Strattera, Basaglar, Trajenta and Alimta, as well as by Cymbalta following a restructuring of our agreement with Shionogi last April.","Turning to emerging markets, we saw revenue decline 17%, driven primarily by the negative effect of foreign exchange. On a performance basis, emerging markets' revenue decreased 7% due to the continued impact of generics including Cialis in Brazil and Korea and Alimta in Australia and Korea, the impact of the Brazil federal Humulin tender and stocking patterns in Russia and China. Also this quarter, our pharma revenue in China decreased 14%, or 9% on a constant currency basis, with the growth rate negatively affected by high customer buying in Q1 of last year. Adjusting for customer buying patterns, we see growth in our China pharma revenue.","Turning to Animal Health, we completed the Novartis Animal Health acquisition on January 1 last year, so year-on-year revenue growth comparisons are now on an apples-to-apples basis. This quarter, Elanco Animal Health revenue increased 1%. Excluding the negative effect of FX, it actually increased 5%. This performance increase was primarily driven by U.S. products, both food animal and companion animal, including contributions from recent launched products Interceptor Plus and Osurnia.","As I mentioned a moment ago, excluding FX on worldwide revenue, our worldwide revenue grew 8% this quarter with nearly all of that growth, 7%, coming from higher volume. Our new products, Trulicity, Cyramza, Jardiance, Basaglar and Portrazza, were the engine of our worldwide volume growth. Slide 12 shows that these products drove over 5 percentage points of volume growth. The takeback of Erbitux contributed 1.7 percentage points of volume growth while in total, Humalog, Animal Health, Trajenta, Forteo and Alimta contributed over 2 percentage points of our volume growth. You'll also see that the loss of exclusivity for Cymbalta and Evista, while largely in the rearview mirror, still was a negative drag of over 150 basis points on our volume growth this quarter.","To anticipate a couple of likely product-specific questions, on this slide you can see that Humalog contributed nearly a full percentage point to our worldwide volume growth. You'll also see in our press release, however, that our U.S. sales declined 14% this quarter. This decline is not reflective of the underlying trends. Adjustments for estimated rebates and discounts, primarily related to the fourth quarter of last year, affected our reported results for Q1 this year. We believe the underlying revenue trend for Humalog is similar to the first nine months of 2015, representing mid-single-digit growth.","And for Alimta, you can see that it contributed about 30 basis points to our worldwide volume growth this quarter. I'd highlight that in the U.S., our year-on-year growth rate benefited by a few percentage points from customer buying patterns, while in Europe our sales benefited from increased clinical trial demand. We continue to be exposed to generic entry in multiple countries in Europe during 2016 that may erode sales significantly from Q1 levels.","Now let me turn the call over to Derica.","Derica W. Rice - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Global Services","Thanks, Phil. While Phil quantified the contribution to our worldwide volume growth coming from new products, I'd like to share some color behind the numbers. While it's too early to say much about Portrazza, I will provide a brief update on the other four new products: Trulicity, Cyramza, Jardiance, and Basaglar. During the Q&A session, Sue and Enrique will be happy to provide more details.","As you can see on the graph on slide 13, our new products generated $325 million in revenue this quarter, led by Trulicity and Cyramza. This represents about 7% of our total worldwide revenue. After limited access for Trulicity in 2015 following its approval in late 2014, sales have accelerated this year. Both commercial and Part D access are now in excess of 70%, and Trulicity's total prescription share of the GLP-1 class is now 17% and growing, making Trulicity the second most prescribed GLP-1 brand. During the quarter, the class continued to grow at over 30% and we see continued upside from here.","For Cyramza, this product continues to grow, driven largely by increasing sales in Japan and Europe as sales growth in the U.S. has slowed due in part to the competition from the immuno-oncology agents. Japan now makes up nearly 30% of our Cyramza global sales. We've had a strong launch in gastric cancer and we look forward to regulatory action in Japan later this year on our submissions for non-small-cell lung cancer and metastatic colorectal cancer, while in Europe, we just launched those two indications during the first quarter.","With Jardiance, we've seen a substantial increase in our new-to-brand share of market with both endocrinologists and primary care physicians. In total, our new-to-brand share approached 30% in Q1, nearly double what it was a year ago. The overall class continues to experience significant growth with class total prescription volume up about 45% in the first quarter. We continue to see regulatory approval of EMPA-REG OUTCOME data as a catalyst for growth for both the class and for Jardiance. The other catalyst for growth is inclusion of these data in treatment guidelines. In general, we expect guideline updates to come after regulators implement label updates and we are pleased with the first treatment guideline update issued in Canada during Q1.","Basaglar is early in its global launch cycle and is now marketed in a number of European countries, Japan and Canada. Early share of the total basal insulin market varies greatly by country. To provide an idea of the differences in rates of adoption, Basaglar's share of market is 17% in Slovakia, 11% in Japan and 2% in Germany. We look forward to launching Basaglar in the U.S. in mid-December this year.","Finally, our newest product, Portrazza, launched in the U.S. in December and in Europe earlier this month.","Moving to slide 14, you'll see the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates on our Q1 2016 results. As mentioned earlier, this quarter, FX was a top line headwind reducing revenues in U.S. dollars by over 3 percentage points. Excluding FX, revenue grew 8%.","In performance terms, growth in non-GAAP cost of sales at 12% outpaced revenue growth due to the negative effect of product mix and to lower production volume. Excluding FX, non-GAAP operating expense growth also slightly outpaced revenue growth due to the baricitinib milestone payments. Excluding these payments, non-GAAP operating expenses grew more slowly than revenue. Excluding FX, non-GAAP operating income increased 1% while a lower tax rate led to a 5% increase in non-GAAP EPS.","Moving on to our pipeline update, slide 15 shows our pipeline as of April 19. Changes since our last earnings call are highlighted with green arrows showing progression and red arrows showing movement out of the portfolio.","In terms of advancement, you'll see that Taltz was approved by the U.S. FDA and by the European commission for psoriasis. Olaratumab was submitted in the U.S. and Europe. The BACE inhibitor with AstraZeneca successfully passed its safety assessment and advanced into Phase 3. And two earlier-stage molecules advanced; our Notch inhibitor for cancer moved into Phase 2 and a dyslipidemia molecule moved into Phase 1.","Since our last update, we also terminated development of three Phase 2 molecules and a Phase 1 molecule for diabetic nephropathy.","Slide 16 shows select new indications and line extensions. You'll see the advancement of the empagliflozin\/metformin XR combination tablet into regulatory review as well as the initiation of Phase 2 work for baricitinib in both atopic dermatitis and lupus.","Turning to slide 17, let's recap the progress we've made on the key events we projected for 2016. Since our last call, we've added green checkmarks for the transition of the BACE inhibitor for early Alzheimer's disease from phase 2 to Phase 3. A number of regulatory submissions including U.S. and European submissions of olaratumab, Japanese submission of baricitinib and U.S submission of Empa+Met XR, and regulatory approvals for Portrazza in Europe, and Taltz in the U.S. and Europe.","We're off to a strong start this year and we look forward to sustaining this momentum throughout the remainder of the year and into the years to come.","Now turning to our 2016 financial guidance, the first thing you may notice on slide 18 is that there is a lot of yellow highlighting changes from our last call. For our non-GAAP guidance, what this really represents, however, is just two changes. First, we lowered our full-year non-GAAP tax rate and raised our non-GAAP EPS range by a nickel to reflect a discrete tax benefit recognized this quarter.","Second, we've updated our line item guidance for revenue, gross margin percent, SG&A and R&D to reflect recent foreign exchange movements. At the bottom of the slide, you'll see the major foreign exchange rates used for our revised guidance.","We've also updated out GAAP guidance for other income and EPS to reflect the Venezuela charge Phil mentioned earlier, as well as charges related to the closure of a manufacturing facility and Novartis Animal Health integration costs.","It's important to point out that our outlook for the underlying fundamentals of our business in 2016 has not changed since our last update in late January. To illustrate this point, let's look at an updated version of a slide we showed you when we provided our initial 2016 guidance in early January.","You may recall that the version of slide 19 we showed in early January highlighted our expectation for non-GAAP EPS growth of roughly 15%, excluding the effects of foreign exchange. As you can see, we continue to expect mid-teens non-GAAP EPS growth on this same basis.","As I mentioned earlier, we continue to expect robust operational growth and non-GAAP EPS driven by positive leverage as revenue growth exceeds operating expense growth. This reflects our commitment to reduce operating expenses as a percent of revenue and expand margin.","In summary, we're off to a good start to the year. Excluding FX, we drove revenue growth of 8%, with growing contributions from our recently launched products, which this quarter drove 5 percentage points of our growth. We're pleased to add Taltz to this group beginning in the second quarter. We have strong momentum behind our innovation-based strategy.","Yet again, in Q1 we made significant progress advancing our pipeline. Among many others, key milestones included the approval and launch of Taltz for psoriasis, the submission of olaratumab for soft tissue sarcoma, and the transition of our BACE inhibitor for early Alzheimer's disease into Phase 3 testing. And as John mentioned when he kicked off the call, we continue to make steady progress against each of our strategic objectives: thriving revenue growth, expanding margins, sustaining the flow of innovation and deploying capital to create value.","Continued execution of this strategy should position us to make major contributions to medical progress and create value for shareholders. This concludes our prepared remarks. I'll now turn the call over to Phil to moderate the Q&A session.","Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations","Great. Thanks, Derica. As we have on most recent calls, if you would do us a favor and your colleagues that are going to be asking questions after you, of limiting your questions to two, or a single two-part question, that would be very much appreciated. Dave, if you could give the instructions for the Q&A session and then go to the first caller please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","It'll be just a moment for our first question. And the first question will come from the line of Gregg Gilbert with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. First on sola [solanezumab], how would you characterize your interaction with regulators around the decision to tweak the end point? And secondly, can you remind us on abemaciclib, update us on what you will learn and when over the course of this year? And then the updated thoughts on positioning and differentiation. Thanks.","Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations","Great, Gregg. Thank you for the questions. Dave, if you'll take the first question on regulatory interactions for solanezumab, and Jan, feel free to complement that answer if you'd like. And then Sue, if you'll give the update on what we expect for the rest of the year for abemaciclib and how we see this one fitting in to the CDK4\/CDK6 landscape. Dave?","David A. Ricks - President-Bio Medicines & Senior Vice President","Sure. Yeah. As we said in the March press release, we have made this change and it's really a decision of the sponsor. We inform regulators but don't actively seek a formal approval step. That's really in the category of a pre-submission or submission meeting. FDA and other regulators have been consistent over the last four or five years that they would like to see co-primaries in these studies. However, I think Lilly's belief, and I don't think we're alone in the field, is that the field has moved, and that both detecting changes and function in these early patients, as well as maybe the utility of the scales we're using, is more questionable than before. However, cognition is clearly something that can be detected easily.","As you know, we've moved cognition to the key secondary endpoint \u2013 or function, rather, so that we'll continue to measure this and if we hit statistical significance on that as a key secondary, we feel confident that this is not very different in the scientific sense from dual primaries. And I think it does allow us some additional degrees of freedom in submission to look at two different ways to measure function in early Alzheimer's patients.","Jan M. Lundberg - Executive Vice President, Science and Technology; President, Lilly Research Laboratories","And Jan here. I can add that we will give FDA a robust analysis of the overall solanezumab's effect on cognition as well as function, including also the analysis of caregiver burden and various biomarkers including imaging of amyloid and tau as well then as safety, the way the microhemorrhage and edema, then detection using MRI. So I think we will have a comprehensive program.","Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations","Great. Thank you, Jan. Sue?","Susan Mahony - Senior Vice President & President, Lilly Oncology","Okay. With regards to the question on abemaciclib, we continue to believe that we could have a best-in-class CDK4\/6 inhibitor, based on the differential potency of CDK4 and CDK6 based on the ability to continuously dose this agent and on the robust single-agent activity that we have seen. We have submitted the interim data for MONARCH 1, which is the single-agent Phase 2 single-arm study. We've submitted that to ASCO and we have a presentation at ASCO on the Friday. That is based on the eighth month interim analysis. We hope to have the final data before ASCO and to include that data in the presentation. Additionally, as you're aware, we have two Phase 3 trials ongoing, MONARCH 2 and MONARCH 3. The final data on those studies should be next year, although we do have interims planned for this year, and they are based on events.","Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks.","Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations","Dave, we can go to the next caller, please.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. John, my first question's for you is sort of generally, if you could talk about sort of the drug pricing headwinds debate. You've been obviously very proactive in defending the industry and calling attention to the big difference between list and realized price. Don't know if politicians understand that yet, but I think it's an important story to be told. Can you just talk about how \u2013 is the 4% price that you took or were able to sustain in the first quarter, how sustainable is that? What do you see with respect to realized price going forward for the industry? And if you could comment on whether or not there has been a change in gross to net in various therapeutic categories, specifically, I think we've seen some differences in diabetes, if you can comment on that. And then, too, maybe if you could comment generally on just the impact of your oncology portfolio from PD-1 antibodies. We saw a bit of the impact this quarter, but generally, if PD-1 antibodies in monotherapy work in frontline lung, what sort of impact should we see across your portfolio? Thanks very much.","Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations","Great. Thanks, Jami. John?","John C. Lechleiter - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay, Jami. Thanks for your question. I think a bit of the irony to me is as we hear a lot of rhetoric about drug prices increasing sort of in the, I guess what you'd say the lay press, I don't think that there's ever been a time when there's been a more competitive \u2013 when this marketplace in the U.S. has ever been more competitive. And I think that means ultimately that medicines that provide clear differentiation and clear value propositions are going to fare better in the future here than medicines that can be easily commoditized, which really don't adequately differentiate themselves from lower-cost alternatives.","Your question about is the 4% price, net price, we realized in the U.S. in the first quarter sustainable, well I think that's difficult to say. I mean, obviously there are different dynamics going on within different categories. For Lilly, I'd say, and for most companies, I think diabetes tends to be one of the most price-competitive parts of the business. I think we've seen that and felt that with respect to net-realized prices on our insulins, for example, over a rather prolonged period of time. I recently, I think in the Wall Street Journal piece, talked about Lilly's sort of net realized price, and clearly we get better pricing in commercial plans by far than we get from government programs where there's largely, based on the regulatory mandates, a much greater discount realized.","So I think to answer your question, rather than to say there's going to be different pressure in different therapeutic areas, and I think it's going to come down more to the products that are competing against one another. And I think products really do differentiate themselves. We believe that a number of the products we're launching really do differentiate themselves and therefore while uptake, as you know, tends to be somewhat slower today based on getting listed on formularies because of the way the calendar often works, we nonetheless remain very optimistic about the prospects for those new products.","Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations","Great. Thanks, John. Sue, on the PD-1 impact to our oncology franchise?","Susan Mahony - Senior Vice President & President, Lilly Oncology","Yeah. Thanks, Jami, for the question. Yeah, we are seeing an impact in the second line setting on Alimta and Cyramza from PD-1 uptake. And I think it's hard to say from a first line perspective what may or may not be the impact because there are a lot of questions that remain at this point in time. Will they be selected patients? There's a lot of combo studies ongoing, for example, with Alimta, and we have combination studies with Cyramza as well. So I think there's a lot of questions to be asked that we'll see over the coming months and years.","I firmly believe that we will continue to have an important role for both Alimta and Cyramza and Portrazza in the non-mutated patient population. And what's going to be key going forward is really identifying those patients that benefit from particular agents and the role of combination therapies. Also I think of note it's important that as we're looking at our Cyramza sales, the majority of our Cyramza sales actually now are in the GI setting with both gastric and colorectal cancer. So I continue to see \u2013 although the lung space is going to continue to be increasingly competitive, we have plenty of opportunity to continue to grow in the other indications as well.","Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations","Dave, we can go to the next caller, please.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Tim Anderson with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Timothy Minton Anderson - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you. A couple questions. On Jardiance, obviously the product has a natural tailwind because of EMPA-REG, but other SGLT2s are presumably trying to preserve their positioning in the market. If I look at slide 38 on Jardiance new-to-brand share of the market, it suddenly seems kind of flat from the start of 2016. I'm wondering if you can talk about the dynamics in 2016 in terms of formulary shifts and possible price competition as other companies like J&J are trying to hold share here; trying to understand why slide 38 shows what it does. And then second question is on Alimta patent litigation in the U.S. Is year-end the likely timeframe when we would have an appeals court decision? And also related to Europe, what is your guidance for 2016, assume about European generic entry in the markets that were covered by that earlier UK ruling?","Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations","Great, Tim. Thanks for the questions. Enrique, if you'll take the first question on what we're seeing with Jardiance new-to-brand trends and what we're seeing in terms of formulary shifts, and then Sue for the patent situation for Alimta. Enrique?","Enrique A. Conterno - Senior Vice President & President, Lilly Diabetes","Very good, Phil. Well we are pretty enthusiastic about our prospects with Jardiance overall, not just in the U.S. but outside of the U.S. Probably the most significant aspect to our overall growth for this important product is going to be the overall class growth. We are pretty pleased with the type of share growth that we have seen when it comes to new patient share on total prescriptions, and there are indeed some dynamics at the beginning of the year when it comes to switching and so forth, but our overall access is very good. It's 85% plus in commercial and over 65% when it comes to Part D access.","Now the one piece that we have a watch-out for is once again, when we look at the class growth, even though total prescriptions are still growing above 30%, 46% I believe year-to-date, when we look at new patient growth, that is basically in single digits. Now we may recall that last year we saw the class starting to slow its growth with some of the reports when it comes to DKA and so forth. With the EMPA-REG OUTCOME data, we saw some rebound in overall class growth when it comes to, once again, new patients.","So overall I think we have to wait and see. Once again I think what I have shared is that it is critical that we see both a new label and new treatment guidelines on both of them. Each of them independently will represent important inflection points. I do want to provide a little bit of color on Jardiance outside of the U.S. because we are seeing some acceleration of the overall class growth outside of the U.S. and we see our share, whether it's Germany at over 30%, Spain at 22%, Italy at over 40%, and in the UK and Canada over 10% basically a few months after launch. All of the trends are very positive and we're actually very bullish when it comes to Jardiance overall.","Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations","Great. Thank you, Enrique. Sue?","Susan Mahony - Senior Vice President & President, Lilly Oncology","Yeah. With regards to the Alimta patent, in the U.S., as a reminder, we won our infringement and validity cases at the District Court. This has been appealed but we don't have a date set yet for the appeal, although we do anticipate that a decision would be expected towards the end of this year, as you said. With regards to guidance, we continue to actively defend our patent and believe that it is valid and would be infringed by the launch of generic products. That said, as we mentioned in our guidance call, we have been prudent in our guidance and it does contemplate the entry of at least one competitor with an alternate thought form diluted indexed rows across major European countries.","Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations","Great. Thank you, Sue. Dave, next caller please.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Andrew Baum with Citi. Please go ahead.","Andrew S. Baum - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","Sorry. So a couple of questions on Jardiance, please. for Enrique. So firstly, given the excitement over the EMPA-REG OUTCOME's cardiovascular benefit and the rapidity of how quickly the curves diverged in that trial, I imagine recruitment would be fast. These trials, if there is a real treatment effect in heart failure, could be completed very quickly. So in your expectations, do you think you could get a heart-failure label for Jardiance by the end of 2020 or somewhere around that timeframe? So that's the first question. Second question is do you plan to include Entresto in the control arm of the patients with reduced fraction at CHF within either of those two planned trials?","Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations","Great, Andrew. Thank you for the questions. Enrique, were you able to hear those fine?","Enrique A. Conterno - Senior Vice President & President, Lilly Diabetes","I did, yes. So, clearly, we are very excited about the opportunity to conduct both trials when it comes to heart failure for Jardiance. I'm not in a position at this stage as we're finalizing our protocols to comment on whether we're going to be looking at Entresto and so forth. As you can imagine, all of those are important considerations as we're finalizing that. Clearly, we are trying to expedite this trial as much as possible. We did see a very fast separation of the curves on EMPA-REG OUTCOME.","Will that repeat itself in the heart failure trial, the hypothesis is likely yes, but we do need to conduct the trial and I don't want to speculate on what the indication will read like. We really need to conduct these trials and see what the results are, and then we can discuss more appropriately. I'm unable to provide a timing, but given what we've seen, you can expect that we're going to conduct this in an as expedited fashion as possible.","Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations","Great. Thank you, Enrique. Dave, we can go to the next caller, please.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum with Evercore. Please go ahead.","Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI","Hey, guys. Couple things. Number one, hey, John and Derica, I'd just like to congratulate you for taking leadership in the mega drug biotech universe, I don't know, four or five years ago, providing long-term guidance and delivering on it.","Number two, Derica, this is one of these questions that's always awkward for an analyst to answer, but I think you owe it to your shareholders to come clean here. Did you root for the Blue Devils or the Hoosiers in the NCAA tournament? And answering that you rooted for both of them is an unacceptable answer. Then I have a follow-up.","Derica W. Rice - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Global Services","Well, Mark, I rooted for the Hoosiers and I actually serve on the Board of Trustees, so my roots run deep.","Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI","Well, there were just nasty rumors out here on the East Coast that you were rooting for the Blue Devils. So I just wanted to clear that up. I thought you had a better ethical integrity than that, but I appreciate it.","Hey, and maybe, John, on the Part \u2013 specifically back on reimbursement, kind of where Jami was probing you guys are on, on the specific proposal, the Part B, CMS's outline for the way Part B works, I'd just like to know your thoughts on those proposals. Are those good ideas, bad ideas, incomplete ideas? Do those form a structure for where things are going to go going forward in the Part B market, which of course is a relatively small part of the drug market?","And number two, Enrique, I just wanted to \u2013 we've asked you about this in prior calls. Just data continues to emerge, that the oral GLPs mainly out of Novo Nordisk, those seem to look pretty good. And if they continue to look that good, could that cause some type of an existential threat to the oral GLP business like Trulicity. Just love to hear updated observations on what's going on there. Thanks a lot.","Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations","Great. Thanks, Mark. And just for the record, it was Ilissa that was rooting for the Blue Devils. John, if you'd go ahead and handle the Part B proposal question, and then Enrique, if you'll give your updated thoughts on how you see the oral GLP-1s evolving and potentially being a threat to the injectable franchise.","John C. Lechleiter - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, so, Mark, thanks for your question. This is John. So this so-called Part B is a pilot pricing scheme which has been laid out by CMMI within CMS. We believe it's bad policy, and ultimately we believe it's bad medicine. This is \u2013 the term is pilot, but it's going to be virtually cover \u2013 it's going to cover everybody and it's going to essentially I think lay out an experiment on the backs of some very sick people who we want to make sure remain able to gain access to the medicines they need and not be directed toward a certain course of treatment based on how this formula is going to, in essence, change physician or potentially change physician prescribing behavior. So we've made it very clear that we're opposed to this. We've made our elected officials very clear that we're opposed to this, and we'll continue to fight it.","Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations","Great. Thanks, John. Enrique?","Enrique A. Conterno - Senior Vice President & President, Lilly Diabetes","Mark, first I have to say that the Blue Devils are planning to come back next year, okay? But on your question on oral GLP-1s, first just providing some context on Trulicity, because I think it's important as we look at the type of acceptance that the product is having right now. We're seeing excellent sequential growth; $74 million in Q3, $113 million in Q4 and $144 million in Q1 of 2016. Class growth is exceptional, higher than we had expected. You may recall before Trulicity launched, we were in high-single digits hovering around 10%. So we did see Trulicity as a catalyst for the growth of the overall class, and that has actually exceeded our expectations.","And Derica spoke to this, about our share gains and so forth. We are now at 18% when we look at the total prescription growth. But probably the one element that I do want to share is that the feedback that we see from patients and physicians, from using the product from adopters of the product is truly exceptional. So, unprecedented rates in terms of overall satisfaction and reception of the product.","Now, so what does that mean with we look at oral GLP-1s? We like where Trulicity stands. We do believe it's going to be a very important option long term for us, regardless of whether oral GLP-1s come into the market or not. Now Oral GLP-1s are going to have to show appropriate efficacy and tolerability. I think given the bio-availability of some of the options out there, you have to question what is going to be the relevance outside of the U.S from a cost of products sold; how profitable is that going to be?","Now having said all of that, we do like oral GLP-1s but we are behind Novo. It is an area of interest and one that we are investing to try to catch up.","Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations","Great, thank you, Enrique. Dave, if we can go to the next caller?","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Steve Scala with Cowen. Please go ahead","Steve Scala - Cowen & Co. LLC","I have two questions; first, I assume Lilly has not submitted the abemaciclib interim data to FDA, but what are the FDA requirements that MONARCH 1 has to meet in order to be registrational? Is there a specific response rate or durability of response, or a median PFS that needs to be hit? And is this bar lower at the final look than it was at the eight-month interim look? That's the first question.","The second question is, in the last decade, how many times has Lilly increased guidance after Q1 results? I think it's quite rare, so what gave you the confidence to do it this quarter? Thank you.","Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations","...Steve. Sue if you'll take the abemaciclib question, and then Derica, the Q1 guidance change question. Sue?","Susan Mahony - Senior Vice President & President, Lilly Oncology","Steve, as I mentioned earlier, we have the interim eighth-month data. We are hoping to get that the final data and to present that at ASCO. We have breakthrough therapy designation on this, so we will work with the FDA regarding the best regulatory path forward. And of course we've got the two Phase 3 studies up and coming as well.","I can't comment on specifics with regard to FDA discussions. They generally will look, as you know, at the totality of the data and we look forward to having discussions with them on this.","Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations","Thank, Sue. Derica?","Derica W. Rice - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Global Services","Steve, we continue to feel very good about the underlying fundamentals of our business. We continue to execute very well and very consistently with the guidance that we shared at the beginning of this year. So from our perspective, everything continues to be on track, and really spurred by the uptake of the new product launches that we've been talking about.","In regards to the change in guidance, it really was just two things. One, we made some assumptions at the beginning of the year about the FX rate. While it's a headwind, it's been a bit less of a headwind than we had anticipated, so it has a line item impact, but not a bottom line impact. What drove the EPS change is really the discrete tax benefit that we received in the first quarter, and we're essentially saying that should carry through for the year. So that combined with the continuation of our strong underlying business fundamentals is what gave us the confidence to raise our guidance for the year.","Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations","Great. Thanks, Derica. Dave, if we can go to the next caller, please.","Operator","Next we go to the line of Seamus Fernandez with Leerink. Please go ahead.","Seamus Fernandez - Leerink Partners LLC","Oh, thanks a lot. I have a question for Enrique and one for Dave. Enrique, can you clarify what you've submitted to the agency with Jardiance? Specifically, are you requesting an indication and a claim or just inclusion of efficacy data in the clinical section?","And just to clarify, can you just help us understand how promotion in the U.S. can differ with an indication versus just inclusion in the label and what your base-case planning assumptions are?","And then my question for Dave is, can you just give us a sense of early feedback on Taltz and the label, some of the differences in the label versus the current IL-17 competitor and how you see that competitive landscape continuing to evolve? Thanks.","Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations","Thank you for the questions. Enrique and Dave, since you're both remote, if you did not hear the questions, let us know and we can repeat it. But if you heard it, we'll go ahead to you first, Enrique, and then we'll swing it over to Dave. Enrique?","Enrique A. Conterno - Senior Vice President & President, Lilly Diabetes","Very good. Well, we are requesting an indication for Jardiance and Glyxambi. We do believe we have the data to be able to request that. I'm not going to speculate in terms of what the indication would read, but if it were just adding the data on the label from an efficacy perspective and so forth, it will really fall short of the expectations that we have. Now there are differences in terms of what we can do. And in terms of the value and how payers will see that and also in terms of how we will be able to promote the product. Of course we plan for different types of scenarios, but right now our expectation is that data warrants full indication for the product.","Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations","Great. Thanks, Enrique. And before we go to Dave, just a point of clarification. You had said Jardiance and Glyxambi; I think you meant to say Jardiance and Synjardy.","Enrique A. Conterno - Senior Vice President & President, Lilly Diabetes","That's correct.","Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations","As the products to be submitted to FDA. Dave? If you'd like to take the next question then, on Taltz?","David A. Ricks - President-Bio Medicines & Senior Vice President","Yes. Thanks, Seamus. So as was mentioned in the prepared text, we've launched in the U.S. now. Just a week and a half or so ago began shipments. At the beginning of the month we began active promotional rollout and that's happening cross-country now, as well as we're excited that EMA approved Taltz last night in Europe and promotion will begin in June in certain geographies in Europe based on the approvability of access that happens over here.","So again, how will we differentiate? We're focused on the really outstanding efficacy of Taltz, which again has proven a 90% PASI 75 rate, 70% PASI 90, and 40% PASI 100; really, rates not seen in any other program with all the caveats on comparisons of these programs. The drug works very fast. It lasts a long time. This data's been published most recently in AAD. And I think we provide a really uniquely positive and easy use experience for the patient and the doctor. So we're really excited as the class of IL-17s appears to be demonstrating really the unmet need and the benefits of this new threshold of efficacy which we think Taltz has best-in-class data on. And so we'll have to see about exactly the business results that come as we execute, too. But so far so good, qualitatively. The team's excited, physicians are excited, and the rollout's under way.","Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations","This is Phil, just to add on briefly to Dave's comment. To date we've seen relatively limited use of biologics in the treatment of psoriasis compared to something like rheumatoid arthritis, and we certainly see these higher levels of more complete clearance that this whole class offers, including Taltz, as being essentially a catalyst for significant increases in the use of biologics to help patients deal with this disease. So we very much look forward, as Dave said, to our upcoming marketing activities and believe this class can be a very significant one for the treatment of psoriasis.","Dave, if we can go to the next caller, please?","Operator","Next we go to the line of John Boris with SunTrust. Please go ahead.","John T. Boris - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thanks for taking the questions. First question for John, obviously Japan appears to be becoming a much, much more important market as you're able to launch your products almost in line with launching in the U.S. and EU. Volume growth was 18%; however, Japan does have every-other-year price increases and are contemplating going to every-year price decreases going forward. What is the industry doing to help educate the Japanese market to potentially prevent them from going in that direction?","Second question for Derica or Phil, on the gross margin benefit from the improvements made to your insulin production. Can you quantify what that benefit is in your gross margin? And then last question just for Jan on Jardiance and the two heart failure trials, have the companies been able to identify, aside from the diuretic effect, what other effect is occurring that could potentially benefit heart failure patients here pre-clinically?","Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations","Great, John. Thank you for the questions. John, if you'll start off with the Japan questions, and Derica and I may tag team the insulin manufacturing, and then Jan for Jardiance.","John C. Lechleiter - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay, John. Thanks for your question. With respect to Japan, I think Lilly, first of all, I'd say Lilly is well-positioned in Japan. We've been one of the fastest-growing, if not the fastest growing company in Japan now for a number of years actually. And these recent new product launches are keeping us on a strong trajectory there.","We are very concerned about the threat of annual repricing. The industry's been quite active in engaging with the policy makers in Japan. I myself have been engaged in that quite recently. Japan is seeing a more rapid uptake of generics. They're ahead of the time scale for generic adoption that was initially laid out by the government. We believe that, in combination with the current biennial price decreases, puts Japan on a trajectory to keep their drug costs essentially flat for the remainder of this decade and beyond.","Now, of course there are macroeconomic considerations that the government is sort of building into the entire calculus there. They try to help the economy recover, but certainly part of that economic recovery \u2013 a key part of Abe's platform has been to actually develop and grow the indigenous biopharmaceutical industry there. So part of our messaging has also included the fact that without an opportunity to realize full value from the products that we do launch there. I think the emphasis on the discovery and development of innovative new medicines in Japan is going to suffer as well.","Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations","Great. Thanks, John. Derica?","Derica W. Rice - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Global Services","John, in regards to your gross margin question regarding the impact of our insulin agenda or tech agenda, it's about, we anticipate about an $80 million benefit for the full year 2016. But also recall in addition to that, the fact that we can utilize our current footprint also allows us to have significant capital avoidance, meaning that we do not have to build a new bulk insulin manufacturing facility, and that would be in the hundreds of millions of dollars.","Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations","Thanks, Derica. Jan?","Jan M. Lundberg - Executive Vice President, Science and Technology; President, Lilly Research Laboratories","Yeah. So let me just remind you that Jardiance had an impressive reduction in hospitalization for heart failure, which was kind of an unexpected finding. We are now planning then to perform studies in both types of heart failure patients, both with a preserved injection fraction where the filling is a problem and the reduced injection fraction, where it's more contractility of the heart that is a problem. And we will do these not only in type 2 diabetics, but also in non-diabetes patients to see if we see similar benefits there.","Regarding the mechanism, as you know, Jardiance has reduction in blood pressure. It causes diuresis, which together then could be an overall volume reduction benefit. There could be other vascular effects still could be characterized. And we should also emphasize that Jardiance not only has an effect on CV outcome, but also kidney benefits that I think need to be characterized further. So overall, we are very excited about this opportunity, but I think the exact mechanism, there are more to be learned.","Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations","Thank you, Jan. John (sic) [Dave], if we can go to the next caller for the next question, please.","Operator","The next line is Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Christopher Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, great. Thanks very much for the questions. Just two here. Following up on the BACE commentary earlier, can you just elaborate a little bit about how you're thinking about end points for Alzheimer's studies going forward? I guess specifically ADAS-Cogs versus CDR Sum of Boxes? I guess what type of functional data if any do you think you're going to need for these early Alzheimer's studies? And just any comments there would be appreciated.","Second was on Trulicity and how you're thinking about the Victoza CV outcome study. It clearly seems for the class, and to the extent you're studying it as well, it's a positive. But I'm more interested in the near-term dynamics as you're ramping Trulicity and as you think about a competitor with CV outcomes data, how that plays into the nearer term ramp of the drug? Thanks very much.","Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations","Thanks for the questions. Chris. Dave, if you'd like to start off on the question with regard to endpoints in the Alzheimer's disease studies. Jan, feel free to compliment that answer if you'd like. And then Enrique, if you'll take the Trulicity CV outcomes question that Chris had. Dave?","David A. Ricks - President-Bio Medicines & Senior Vice President","Yeah, thanks, Chris. And Jan, jump in as we go through this. In terms of the base announcement today, which are that we're bring coherence to the idea that early Alzheimer's studies, the primary endpoint should be cognition. We're using it as Cog14 in the sola [solanezumab] study and 13 in the two AZ BACE studies. That's just purely a function of two very similar instruments, and one we started with in AZ BACE was different than sola [solanezumab], but we expect them to yield very, very similar outcomes.","And as we said before in the sola [solanezumab] announcement, we think that this is a much better way to detect changes in cognition, preclude and predict changes in function. And then measuring function anyway in early Alzheimer's is a difficult prospect, both because patients are losing function typically at a very, very slow rate early and then accelerating as they go through the disease, but also because the instruments being used really are unproven in drug trials.","As you know, Chris, we've done a lot of drug trials, both placebo-controlled and active, failed, and some with some positive results. You mentioned CDR Sum of Boxes. This is a composite index that looks at both function and cognition. It's quite a complicated instrument. Training and implementation at sites is one of the more onerous ones, and although it does show coherence with disease progression across the whole continuum, we have had less of that observation in our programs and find that ADAS-Cog, and for function IADL and the FAQ and other measures of function probably are a bit better in early disease.","Final comment is AMARANTH includes prodromal patients, so this is really pre-diagnosis Alzheimer's. The new study, DAYBREAK, will include mild and of course EXPEDITION3 is mild. We think the appropriate primary endpoint is all those settings is a cognitive endpoint with multiple secondaries and a measurement of function as well as biomarkers.","Jan M. Lundberg - Executive Vice President, Science and Technology; President, Lilly Research Laboratories","Yeah, and I can complement by just some future then opportunities in relation to biomarkers as potential surrogate markers of efficacy. And here, as you know, we have our tau imaging agent in Phase 3 which is undergoing studies then right now to correlate on the PET imaging and be able to autopsy location of tau, and we're also following disease progression. And we are using this as a potential surrogate marker then, in EXPEDITION3 for sola [solanezumab], and also then we include this in our base studies to see then if anti-amyloid reduction can influence actually the tau signals spreading in the brain. And we also have a tau imaging in the A4 and DIAN studies, all pre-clinical Alzheimer's. So I think that's a potential next evolution that could then also reduce the time needed then to do potentially studies in the Alzheimer's space if we could have a surrogate marker, actually, of efficacy.","Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations","Thank you, Jan. Enrique?","Enrique A. Conterno - Senior Vice President & President, Lilly Diabetes","Sure. So we view in a positive way the CV result of liraglutide. We think this is going to have a huge positive overall \u2013 it's going to be a huge catalyst for the overall GLP-1 class. And we view it with optimism because of REWIND. You may recall that we have powered REWIND, our trial, our CV trial for Trulicity, is powered for superiority. We expect to have an interim look sometime later this year and the trial is expected to be concluded sometime in late 2018. Before I can comment on any type of near-term impact, I'd like to see the data, which is going to be released in detail at ADA.","Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations","Enrique? Dave, if we can go to the next caller.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Vamil Divan with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Vamil K. Divan - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Great. Thanks. Thanks for taking my question. So the first one, again on sola [solanezumab]. Just to clarify, I think you've mentioned before the final patient for EXPEDITION3 in October and then we should get some sort of top line press release by the end of the year. I'm just curious, will that top line release also include some of the functional endpoint information? Or will it strictly stick to the primary that's on the cognition side?","And then my second one also on sola [solanezumab], I'm just curious, you talked a lot about the regulatory side and kind of the change in endpoints here and how cognition may be the better way to look at this earlier group of patients. What about on the commercial side? Do you see any more challenge in terms of reimbursement for a product if it's only showing cognition benefit and maybe a very mild sort of impact on the functional side? And maybe you could comment on U.S. versus ex-U.S. dynamics there in terms of acceptance of a product that's more driven by a cognition benefit and less on the functional side.","Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations","Great, Vamil. Thank you for the questions. Dave, if you'd like to take those, feel free to flip the first one back to me if you'd like, but if you want to comment on either or both of those, please do so.","David A. Ricks - President-Bio Medicines & Senior Vice President","Sure. You have the timeline correct from our previous communications in terms of what we expect; October and then sometime before Christmas, maybe just before, a top-line readout. I think it's probably premature to comment on the exact content of that, although as usual, we'll try to be transparent with our investors as we can be without jeopardizing publication.","I think we've also said it's difficult to predict right now what meeting we will be presenting that data, because there isn't actually an obvious one shortly after that. So we're working on finalizing all of this, and if we can, we'd like to be as transparent as we can with the top-line results, including key secondary endpoints like function and make sure we guard against jeopardizing the publication, which hopefully will be shortly thereafter. Feel free to jump on that, Phil, if I got any of that wrong.","And then in terms of commercial impact, we do believe demonstrating impact on function as well as biomarkers is important. But I think the most important thing is to establish that solanezumab is a disease-modifying agent, meaning unlike symptomatics, that if you remove the therapy, patients don't simply return to their previous state. But there's a permanent alteration in the trajectory of decline. And decline measured by whatever measure we want, whether that be function or cognition.","I think we've established some important information around that with the EXPEDITION extension data presented last summer, but obviously, we need to repeat that finding in EXPEDITION3 and really demonstrate that there's a building effect through time, and that in the open-label extensions that come out of all these studies, we can again replicate that. So disease modification is the key commercial handle I think to set up a new class for really changing the outcome for patients with Alzheimer's.","Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations","Great. Thanks, Dave. And you summarized the team's plans for disclosure for the EXPEDITION3 trial perfectly well, so I have nothing to add to that. Dave, if we can go to the next caller, please.","Operator","The next one would be David Risinger with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yes. Thanks very much. So my questions are also on sola [solanezumab]. I guess I'll start with sort of a constructive question and then transition to a more critical question. So with respect to changing the endpoint, could you just talk a little bit how making cognition the only primary endpoint makes it easier to achieve statistical significance? And explain how the statistics are now different in that function, I believe I guess will be tested as a 0.05 statistical hurdle previously as a co-primary endpoint. The statistical hurdle would have potentially been more challenging. So if you could just please explain how the statistics benefit, that would be helpful.","And then, in looking at and trying to understand the lack of confidence that you have in showing a functional benefit, it's a little bit perplexing, because Aricept shows a functional benefit within six months in just a few hundred patients. Now, granted, it's a different type of drug, and their tests did include moderate patients. But since EXPEDITION3 has 2,100 patients, so it's dramatically larger than historical Alzheimer's trials, I'm just wondering how to think about a potential lack of functional benefit over 18 months, particularly since the mild patients will transition to being moderate patients over time. And I think Lilly's conclusion is that sola [solanezumab] doesn't work in moderate patients. So just I guess the question is specifically, how should we think about a potential lack of functional benefit in a 2,100-patient trial if patients are progressing towards being moderate and the general view is that sola [solanezumab] doesn't work in moderate patients? Thank you.","Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations","All right, Dave. Thanks for the questions. We'll go to the tag team again of Dave Ricks and Jan Lundberg. So, Dave, if you'd like to lead off, and Jan, feel free to fill in.","David A. Ricks - President-Bio Medicines & Senior Vice President","Yeah. Let me address the second question first, Dave, because I don't think, based on your question, we see things the way you characterize them. We don't have a lack of confidence that solanezumab won't affect function. In fact, if we go back to the pool of mild disclosure back in 2011 \u2013 sorry, 2012, you will see that we had a 0.001 impact on all measures of cognition that we listed, and a 0.057 on ADL, a 0.045 P-value on IADL, so it's based on that we selected ADAS-Cog14 and IADL as original endpoints. Our design both powers the study more significantly and excludes patients who lack amyloid, which we believe should give us a better signal-to-noise ratio for an anti-amyloid therapy. So I would encourage investors not to be confused that this change has any bearing on our confidence. And, again, to remind everyone, we have seen nothing as it relates to the blinded data on EXPEDITION3, and won't until the final database block later this year.","So why did we do this? I guess there's three hypothetical scenarios of the outcome. On the extremes you'd have total failure to replicate the pooled mild data, meaning there is no relevant effect of solanezumab. And if that ends up being truth out of EXPEDITION3, I don't think this matters, and probably nothing would have. We don't believe that's the most probable case, but I guess critics might highlight that.","On the other hand is a scenario where we hit or replicate EXPEDITION1 and 2 pooled mild data as strongly or maybe even with a better P-value than the pool of mild information previously published. In that case, this change doesn't really matter either because we will have hit the primary and hit the key secondaries; we'll go to the regulators with both of those data sets and, I believe, meet the qualifications for approval that existed previously. I think the reason to do this is a scenario where you achieve cognition, but have a close call on function.","And given the measurement issues with function in mild Alzheimer's as I described in an earlier answer on the call, that is a possibility. We don't think the most probable, but it's a possibility. And we want to allow for that by being able to a) measure function two ways: FAQ is another instrument, a more tailored instrument for early Alzheimer's; and the IADL, which I've described already. Additionally, as Jan mentioned, we're measuring caregiver activity in a broad light and many, many other instruments we can draw upon. We think this will maximize the chance of both a submission and potential for approval, and that's why we made this move, just to be clear on all of that.","I think it's \u2013 we already have shown data that intervening with disease-modifying agent in mild Alzheimer's disease does carry over into moderate phase. That was published last year in the EXPEDITION extension data, and we can talk about that offline if you'd like to.","Finally, your first question was how do the statistics work? And I just want to highlight we have not finalized our statistical analysis plan in the finer point of detail, so I'll just talk in broad strokes here. But when you have dual primaries, you need to split your 0.05 alpha in half and allocate it to the two primaries to achieve the statistical significance on both versus just one. So in this way, there's a little wider moat on achieving ADAS-Cog14 \u2013 based on our previous finding, I'm not sure that's critical to achieve ADAS-Cog14, but it is a point to note.","And then we can then divide the alpha that's left among the key secondaries, which in this case will be the FAQ as well as the IADL functional instruments. So in theory, there could be more alpha allocated to the IADL or the FAQ based on our final design. So there is an incrementally positive impact on statistical calculations at the end of the day. Again, that's not the primary reason we're doing all this. It's because we really do believe cognition matters. It predicts functional decline, and we've powered this study, as you point out, to achieve significance on both.","Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations","Okay, great. That's an excellent response. No further comments from the group here, so, Dave, if we can go to the next caller, please.","Operator","We will next go to the line of Geoff Meacham with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. One on the BACE and one on Taltz. So on the BACE, I know there's a safety look. Was there any efficacy hurdle at all to transform or to transition AMARANTH to Phase 3?","And then how do you think about the rate of amyloid plaque reduction or cognitive decline for the BACE class in general compared to direct beta amyloid antibodies?","And then on Taltz, I mean, clearly your competition has informed us, the market about the attitudes towards the IL-17 class, but as you guys prepare for the EU reimbursement discussion, what, if any, are there subtleties between the U.S. and European markets, and how much of a role do you think switching will play in the initial stages of the launch? Thanks, guys.","Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations","Great, Geoff. Thank you for the questions. Dave, if you'd like to start off on those, and then, Jan, feel free to add what you like on particularly the rate of amyloid reduction that we might expect with BACE inhibitors, what we've seen already either in pre-clinical or clinical studies. Dave?","David A. Ricks - President-Bio Medicines & Senior Vice President","Yeah, I think my part on that will be short because as we previously announced, the interim look on efficacy which triggers a move, or a safety rather, which triggers a move of the BACE inhibitor from Phase 2 to Phase 3 was predefined and really focused only on safety. We do have biomarker data on Abeta clearance. Maybe Jan can comment on here with the AZ BACE inhibitor, but we really just focused on discharging safety in a class that has had off-target safety effects. And we were pleased with the result announced earlier this month. Maybe I'll transition to Jan on the mechanistic question in Alzheimer's and then we can go back to Taltz in the EU and switching question.","Jan M. Lundberg - Executive Vice President, Science and Technology; President, Lilly Research Laboratories","Yeah, as you know, solanezumab is an antibody that has a limited penetration to the brain, about 0.1%, and it binds free amyloid beta. BACE inhibitors, on the other hand, are oral agents that better penetrate the blood\/brain barrier and prevents the formation of amyloid beta from the amyloid precursor protein. No real clinical comparisons have been made then on these agents. What actually happens with the amyloid contents overall in the brain realizing that the amyloid in the brain is probably in different forms, and yes, there is plaques which are very solid, but they're also then intermittent forms and free amyloid there.","I think what we have seen in pre-clinical models is that the BACE molecules can reduce the amyloid load then in the various transgenic mice models. And the effects of solanezumab in those models have been more difficult I think to demonstrate in the same way.","But you know, I think overall we will have to look at the clinical data in the end. Sola [solanezumab] has a very favorable safety profile if you look overall, even than compared to some other anti-amyloid antibodies, which are in development, whilst the safety of the BACE inhibitors, particularly in larger trials, have still to be proven. And recognizing that old-age Alzheimer's patients are fragile, and you need also very safe agents. So more to come.","Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations","Great. Thank you, Jan. Dave on Taltz in Europe?","David A. Ricks - President-Bio Medicines & Senior Vice President","Yeah. So as you point out, we were quite encouraged by the early adoption of the class. I didn't read it too carefully, but I noted the Novartis antibody had strong success O-U.S. I think particularly in Germany, the early uptake.","As we look at Europe, which we do expect rollouts and launches beginning this summer and then through really the end of 2018, that's the cycle for reimbursement assessment. So the full revenue picture won't be elucidated till after 2018 really. But in Germany, we will get an early read, because of the way the reimbursement works. We have a very strong and competitive label in Europe, including first-line indication for treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. All of the same efficacy endpoints and maybe a few others that I mentioned from the U.S. question earlier. The drug works rapidly. That's noted in the label, and consistently with long duration of effect.","Switching is an important factor in this market, but perhaps not in the sense that someone achieves success and then switches to a brand that could give them even better success. What we see is a lot of patients try and lapse treatments. And as Phil mentioned earlier, we estimate less than 1 in 10 patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis is currently on a biologic. But there's quite a number that have tried one in the past and are no longer using it. So in this way switching, meaning they were on something before and now can reinitiate on this promising new therapy, Taltz.","And our share of label in Europe highlights that, that the drug is both durable and effective in patients independent of words, whether it's a first-line, naive biologic, a switch, a lapse biologic, or some refractory to multiple biologics. So that's an important pool of patients as we have early launch and uptake. And again, we're very optimistic for this product.","Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations","Great. Thank you, Dave. I think about the count clerk we got through about a dozen callers in the hour of Q&A that we have. I do apologize for those of you that are still in the queue, but we have reached the end of the call. The IR team will give you guys a call back and gals a call back after this call concludes. I'll now turn it over to John for some closing remarks.","John C. Lechleiter - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Thanks, Phil.

[Operator Instructions]","As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded.","I'd now like to turn the conference over to John Lechleiter. Please go ahead.","John Lechleiter","Good morning. Thank you for joining us for Eli Lilly & Company's second quarter 2015 earnings conference call. I'm John Lechleiter, Lilly's Chairman, President and CEO.","Joining me on today's call are Derica Rice, our Chief Financial Officer; Dr. Jan Lundberg, President of Lilly Research Laboratories; Dr. Sue Mahoney, President of Lilly Oncology; Enrique Conterno, President of Lilly Diabetes; Dave Ricks, President of Lilly Biomedicines; Chito Zulueta, President of Emerging Markets; Jeff Simmons, who is President of Elanco Animal Health; and Ilissa Rassner, Brad Robling, and Phil Johnson of Lilly's IR team.","We're also joined by Dr. Eric Siemers. Eric is a distinguished medical fellow for our Alzheimer's disease team. He is dialing in from Washington where he is attending the Alzheimer's Association International Conference.","During this conference call we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors including those listed on slide three and those outlined in our latest Forms 10-K and 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It is not intended to be promotional and is not sufficient for prescribing decisions.","Lilly's positive momentum continued in the second quarter as we delivered solid underlying business performance with productivity improvements driving bottom line leverage with double-digit operating income and EPS growth. And we again saw significant pipeline progress including multiple regulatory approvals and submissions along with positive Phase II and Phase III data readouts.","As usual I will begin today's call by highlighting key events that have occurred since our first quarter earnings call in late April. We've seen advances on a number of fronts. Starting with commercial milestones. In Japan we began promotion of Cyramza for gastric cancer. The gastric cancer indication in this market represents a significant opportunity for this product. Here in U.S. we began a promotion of Cyramza for second line metastatic colorectal cancer following FDA approval of this indication day after our last earnings call.","On the regulatory front we achieved a number of milestones. In diabetes we received approval in Japan for Trulicity, our once weekly GLP-1 receptor agonist for the treatment of Type II diabetes. We also received FDA approval for Humalog U-200 KwikPen for the treatment of Type I and Type II diabetes. In collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim, we received European commission approval for Synjardy. This is a single-pill therapy that combines empagliflozin and metformin for the treatment of adults with Type II diabetes.","Here in the U.S. the FDA issued a complete response letter for Synjardy and Boehringer Ingelheim has already submitted their response. We're pleased the resubmission was granted a two-month review and we're hopeful we'll be able to bring this product to market in the U.S. yet this year.","Moving to oncology as I mentioned a moment ago we received FDA approval for Cyramza in second line metastatic colorectal cancer. We also completed our submission for the same indication in Japan. In addition the FDA Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee, ODAC, reviewed the data supporting our submission for necitumumab in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin for us increase first-line treatment of patients with advanced squamous non-small cell lung cancer. We were encouraged by the constructive discussion on the benefit risk profile of necitumumab. We believe necitumumab represents a meaningful advancement in treatment.","And moving to our Biomedicines business we submitted Ixekizumab in Europe for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis following our U.S. submission in the first quarter. Clearly this continues to be an exciting and busy time for our regulatory colleagues across the globe.","On the clinical front we presented detailed Phase III data on three different molecules and highlighted these data on investor calls. First was the presentation of Phase III data for basal insulin PEG lispro in patients with Type I and Type II diabetes at the ADA meeting. As we've stated in the past, we decided to delay regulatory submission to generate additional safety-related data.","Next was the presentation of data from the first two of our four pivotal trials for baricitinib in rheumatoid arthritis at the U.R. [ph] in Rome. We're are encouraged by the Phase III data we've seen to date and we look forward to the data readouts from the final two pivotal trials later this year.","Last was the presentation of Phase III data for Ixekizumab in moderate to severe plaque psoriasis at the World Congress of Dermatology meeting. We believe Ixekizumab has demonstrated a compelling risk profile in clinical work to date and that Ixekizumab could help patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis better manage their disease and improve their quality of life.","Further we believe that the level of efficacy and the safety profile demonstrated by biologic agents targeting IL-17A in psoriasis represent a meaningful improvement to currently available therapeutic options and could be a catalyst for greater use of biologics in the treatment of this disease.","Just yesterday at the Alzheimer's Association International Conference we presented two-year extension data from the Expedition Ext trial. We believe the data are consistent with a potential disease modifying effect of solanezumab on underlying disease progression and we look forward to completion of the Expedition 3study in late 2016.","Apart from these Phase III data disclosures we also had some earlier data presentations that garnered investor interest. Specifically at the ASCO meeting we presented Phase II data for Olaratumab in soft tissue sarcoma. While at the American Headache Society meeting, we presented initial Phase IIb data on our CGRP monoclonal antibody in episodic migraine.","We're enthusiastic about the opportunity for both of these molecules. Derica will provide an important update Olaratumab later in the call.","On the business development front we announced five oncology deals spanning collaborations with AstraZeneca, BioNTech, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Sarah Cannon Research Institute and Immunocore. This is consistent with comments that we made earlier this year that you should expect to see us increase the level of our business development activity through partnerships, licensing, and acquisitions at ever earlier stages of development.","In addition, we struck a deal with Sanford-Burnham Medical Research Institute in the area of immunology and we announced a sales collaboration in Japan with Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma for Trulicity.","In other news we received a positive ruling from the U.K. Court of Appeal, which held that the Alimta vitamin regimen patent would be indirectly infringed by a generic competitor. This ruling reversed the initial U.K. court's decision granting declarations of non-infringement in France, Italy, and Spain.","We announced plans to establish a new drug delivery and device innovation center in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The Lily Cambridge Innovation Center in Kendall Square will help attract top scientists and bioengineers as well as enhance our business development presence in the Boston area. And just this morning we announced plans to effectively double our research presence at our Lilly Biotechnology Center in San Diego, California.","On the financial side we took advantage of very low European interest rates to issue \u20ac2.1 billion of debt while retiring $1.65 billion of higher coupon U.S. debt. Finally in the second quarter we repurchased $125 million of stock, leaving $3.3 billion remaining on our $5 billion plan. In addition, during the second quarter we distributed over $500 million to shareholders via our dividend. We remain committed to providing a robust dividend and to returning excess cash to shareholders via share repurchase.","And now I'll turn the call over to Phil for a discussion of our financial performance for the quarter.","Phil Johnson","Thanks, John. Before I discuss our Q2 results it may be helpful to review some key features of our presentation of GAAP results and non-GAAP measures.","When interpreting our GAAP results and the growth rates versus 2014, keep in mind that 2014 does not include Novartis Animal Health while 2015 includes the operating results of this business as well as all the costs associated with the acquisition.","For our non-GAAP measures we now exclude amortization of intangibles and to provide you a better idea of the underlying trends in our business, we've adjusted our non-GAAP measures for 2014 to exclude the expense associated with amortization of intangibles and to include Novartis Animal Health as if we had closed the acquisition on January 1 of 2014. This places 2014 on the same basis upon which we're reporting financials this year.","Now let's look at our results for the quarter. Slide eight provides a summary of our GAAP results. I'll focus my comments on our non-GAAP adjusted measures to provide insights into the underlying trends in our business please. So please refer to today's earnings press release for a detailed description of the year-on-year changes in our second quarter GAAP results.","Moving to slide nine you can see that Q2 revenue was nearly $5 billion. The decrease of 4% compared to Q2 2014 reflects significant foreign exchange headwinds. Excluding FX our Q2 revenue [indiscernible] on a non-GAAP basis. As we discussed before this year we will feel the negative effect of the loss of U.S. exclusivity for Cymbalta and Evista. This quarter sales of those two products in the U.S. declined by over $110 million. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates and Cymbalta and Evista in the U.S., the rest of our worldwide revenue increased 6% this quarter.","Gross margin as a percent of revenue increased 2.5 percentage points going from 76.7% to 79.2%. This increase was driven by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold, which increased cost of sales in Q2 last year but decreased cost of sales in Q2 this year. Excluding this FX effect, our gross margin percent declined by one percentage point going from 77.2% in last year's quarter to 76.2% this quarter. As on prior calls, you'll see a supplementary slide providing our gross margin percent for the last 10 quarters with and without this FX effect.","We continue to drive productivity improvements across our business. Total operating expense defined as the sum of R&D and SG&A declined by 7% or over $200 million compared to Q2 2014. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses declined 8% while R&D declined 5%. The reduction in marketing, selling and administrative expenses was due to the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates, cost reductions in the combined Animal Health organization, and ongoing cost containment efforts across Lily partially offset by marketing expenses to support recent product launches.","The reduction in R&D expense was driven primarily by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates.","As implied by our full-year guidance we do expect the level of R&D spend to be higher for the remainder of the year as we start Phase II trials for files for tonizimab [ph], our CGRP monoclonal antibody, olaratumab, and additional indications for Cyramza.","Other income and expense was income of $29 million this quarter and our tax rate was 20.8%, a decrease of 2.3 percentage points compared to the same quarter last year. This decrease is primarily due to a discrete tax benefit realized this quarter. Also our tax rate in both periods did not include the benefit of certain U.S. tax provisions including the R&D Tax Credit as those provisions had lapsed.","At the bottom line net income increased 20% while earnings per share increased 22% reflecting the benefit of our share repurchase. Slide 10 contains non-GAAP adjusted information for the first half of the year while slide 11 provides a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS and you'll find additional details on these adjustments on slide 21.","Now let's take a look at the effect of price rate and volume on revenue. On slide 12 in the yellow box at the bottom of the page you'll see the total revenue decline of 4% on a non-GAAP basis that I mentioned earlier. The significant strengthening of the U.S. dollar against many foreign currencies drove this decline as you see the 8% negative effect from FX this quarter with a favorable volume effect of 3% and favorable price effect of 1%.","By geography you'll notice that U.S. pharma revenue increased 3% driven by price, partially offset by volume. And international operations Australia, Canada and Europe or ACE you'll see that there was a decline in revenue of 19% that was almost entirely driven by the negative effect of foreign exchange while on a constant currency or performance basis ACE revenue decreased just 1%. This decrease was driven by a substantial reduction in European Cymbalta sales resulting from a loss of data package exclusivity.","In Japan pharma revenue increased 14% in total while on a constant currency or performance basis increased 37%. The size of this increase was influenced by a weak comparison period. Recall that in Q1 2014 we experienced substantial wholesaler buying in advance of an increase in the local consumption tax, which led to corresponding reduction in wholesaler buying in Q2 2014. Consequently the performance growth of 10% for the first half of this year is more reflective of the underlying trends in Japan.","Turning to emerging markets we saw a revenue decline of 15% driven by a negative foreign exchange effect of 12%. On a performance basis emerging market sales declined 4% driven by lower sales in China and the negative effect of the Brazil Humulin tender we had last year. This quarter our pharma revenue in China declined 16% driven by lower volume.","On a non-GAAP basis, which adjusts 2014 as if we'd completed the Novartis Animal Health acquisition on January 1 of that year, Alanco Animal Health declined 4%. Excluding the negative effect of foreign exchange Alanco revenue increased 3%.","Moving to slide 14 you'll see the effective changes in foreign exchange rates on our Q2 2015 results. This quarter, as mentioned earlier, FX was a top line headwind reducing revenue in U.S. dollars by eight percentage points. In terms of cost of goods sold, however, FX provided a substantial benefit, which led to FX having essentially no impact on operating income and EPS. At the bottom of the slide you can see that our non-GAAP EPS in the second quarter grew 22% with and without FX.","Slide 15 shows our pipeline as of July 20 with changes since our last earnings call highlighted, green arrows showing progression and red arrows showing attrition. In terms of advancement you'll see that our CGRP monoclonal antibody has moved into Phase III with initiation of pivotal trials in cluster headache. And we initiated Phase II testing for an oncology molecule. We also terminated element of our oral glucagon receptor antagonist for diabetes in Phase II as well as for five Phase I molecules.","With that update I'll now turn the call over to Derica.","Derica Rice","Thanks, Phil. As on our prior calls, I'll recap the progress we've made on the key events we've projected for 2015 and then review our 2015 financial guidance.","Turning to slide 16 you'll see that a majority of events anticipated for 2015 have already occurred in the first six months of the year with the vast majority being positive. Since our last earnings call, we've achieved a number of additional milestones. We initiated Phase III trials for Cyramza in both first-line EGFR mutation positive non-small cell lung cancer and in second-line urothelial cancer as well as for our CGRP monocolonal antibody in cluster headache.","As John mentioned earlier we had a number of detailed disclosure at medical meetings for basal insulin PEG lispro, baricitinib, ixekizumab, and solanezumab. You will also see that we updated the regulatory submissions category to reflect Japanese submission for ramucirumab for second-line metastatic colorectal cancer and European submission of ixekizumab for psoriasis. As we announced on our ixekizumab investor call we've added an event to our key event list for the simultaneous submission of ixekizumab in Japan for both psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis.","Earlier John mentioned the presentation at ASCO of the Phase II for Olaratumab in soft tissue sarcoma. These data were compelling and included a 10-month overall survival benefit in patients in the treatment arm that received Olaratumab. I'm pleased to announce that based on the ongoing discussions with the FDA we intend to submit U.S. and European regulatory applications for Olaratumab in soft tissue sarcoma based on these data, or based on these Phase II data. We hope to complete the U.S. submission before the end of 2015.","As a result you'll see a new item on our list of key events to reflect this positive development. In addition, the FDA has granted a Olaratumab breakthrough designation. We're pleased that Olaratumab is the third in-clone molecule following Cyramza and ixekizumab that has generated promising clinical data and that could help patients with cancer live longer.","You will also see new checkmarks to reflect three approvals John discussed earlier: Japanese approval for ramucirumab in second-line gastric cancer and dulaglutide Type II diabetes. And in the U.S. approval for Humalog U-200 KwikPen.","Finally in the other section you'll see the green checkmarks for the positive Alimta ruling from the U.K. Court of Appeal and we now have a date in mid, for mid-November for the appeals hearing at the European patent office.","We noted in the past that 2015 is another year where we're focused on demonstrating successful execution of our innovation-based strategy. We're pleased with the progress we made in the past few years and so far this year and believe this progress solidifies our near to medium-term growth prospects.","Turning to our 2015 financial guidance, we've raised the bottom end of our revenue range to reflect the solid underlying performance for the first six months of the year and the launch trajectories of Jardiance, Trulicity, and Cyramza. We've also modestly increased the range for our non-GAAP other income to reflect net gains on investments realized to date and added a new line for GAAP other income that reflects the debt repurchase charge.","To reflect the discrete tax benefit booked in Q2 we've reduced our non-GAAP tax rate by about 50 basis points. And our GAAP tax rate also reflects the impact of the debt repurchase and the BioNTech charges.","At the bottom line we've raised our non-GAAP EPS range by $0.10 and now forecast full-year non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $3.20 to $3.30 per share. Our new GAAP EPS range of $2.20 to $2.30 per share has been updated for this same $0.10 increase as well as the Q2 charges we booked for the debt repurchase and the BioNTech deal.","Finally I want to point out that we own shares of Receptos and you've undoubtedly seen Celgene's offer to buy receptors for $232 per share. At this time, it is not clear to us when a deal may get done and we've not made a determination of what we will do with our shares. We'll monitor this situation and we will incorporate any necessary changes into our future guidance updates.","In summary, while our second quarter revenue reflects the impact of foreign exchange headwinds and the lingering effects of U.S. patent expirations for Cymbalta and Evista, we remain on track to return to growth in 2015 driven by excellent progress in our innovation-based strategy. We had solid underlying business performance and our continued focus on productivity and cost controls drove strong leverage at the bottom line while providing the capacity to fully invest in our new product launches and to pursue additional promising pipeline opportunities. This solid business performance was the primary driver for increasing our non-GAAP EPS guidance.","With tangible results from our innovation-based strategy we aim to drive revenue growth and expand margins throughout the balance of this decade. As we","discussed in the past you'll see sharpen our focus on areas where we're best positioned to compete and win and we'll continue to find ways to increase productivity and do the work of pharmaceutical R&D better.","This concludes our prepared remarks and I'll turn the call over to Phil to moderate the Q&A session. Phil?","Phil Johnson","Great. Thank you, Derica. Leah [ph], if you could provide instructions for the Q&A session we'll get started with caller's questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from the line of Seamus Fernandez with Leerink. Please go ahead.","Seamus Fernandez","Thanks for the question. So congratulations on a strong quarter. Derica, maybe you can just or overall if you guys can give us your thoughts on how you see the progression of Alimta sales outside of the U.S. going forward? Sort of if we just kind of exclude the competitive landscape and think about it independent just with the court rulings how you see that going forward and what amount of sales is actually reflected and represented by that, how durable you think that is?","The second question, so as we think about the evacetrapib opportunity if you guys could give us any additional color you could provide on the number of events, the powering of the study? I know you said 15% power in the past, but historically when we've seen studies like this it's conservatively powered. So 15% at 95% or 98% reduction would imply somewhere between 1,400 and 1,600 events. So it would be really helpful to understand how conservatively powered your 15 assumption is on evacetrapib?","And then lastly on all Olaratumab just in terms of the market opportunity in soft tissue sarcoma, can you just give us a quick update on your thoughts there in terms of the patient size in the U.S. and then also globally? Thanks a lot.","Phil Johnson","Great, Seamus. Thank you for the questions. I'll go ahead and actually provide some context on your first question on Alimta O-U.S. and some of the exposures there. And then, Dave, if you'll talk about the second question for that evacetrapib powering? And then, Sue, if you'll handle the Olaratumab question?","So, Seamus, for O-U.S. if we go back to the guidance call early January, we had mentioned that last year we had about $880 million in Alimta sales in Europe. We'd indicated that about $80 million of that amount would already be subject to loss of exclusivity in markets where we did not have the compound patent or the longer dated vitamin dose regimen patent.","Of the remaining $800 million about $175 million was represented by Germany with the rest being the other European countries, of which France is the largest by far followed by Germany and then Italy and Spain with U.K. being clearly the smallest of them. So hopefully as you're thinking about rulings we've had so far in Germany and rulings out of the U.K. court that provides you some basis to understand the level of exposure that's there.","For Japan I don't have last year's number but I do have this quarter's number in front of me since we also have litigation ongoing in Japan. We have $67 million in Q2. We had $57 million of Alimta revenue in Japan in Q1. The emerging markets business is a similar size to Japan where we had about $63 million in revenue this quarter and about $63 million last quarter as well.","So the major exposure really is for O-U.S. the European both litigation in specific countries that's ongoing and as mentioned on the call earlier the outcome of the European patent office appeal hearing that will occur in November. Dave?","David Ricks","Sure. Yeah, Seamus, thanks for the question on anacetrapib. What we've said in the past is we're powered to show the effect size on LDL alone. And so your range there is about right. I don't think we've got into the exact number of events and I would remind the investors we extended the trial by six months, which is part of our Q1 communication, which actually adds to the event total that we'll see. So in a sense that may increase the powering of the study although not markedly.","So the study was designed to show an effect on LDL alone. Using the Oxford curve [ph] that we've seen play out through time we estimate about a 30% reduction in LDL so thus the mid-teens [indiscernible] outcome and that is looking at the quintuple endpoint. We also have a minimal threshold for the triple hard end points of death, MI, and stroke. And we believe we have ample events now as we look at the data coming in mid-next year.","Phil Johnson","Sue?","Susan Mahoney","Yeah. And with regards to Olaratumab, so the size of the market, it's about 11,900 patients who are diagnosed with soft tissue sarcoma in the U.S. For drug treatment there's about 5,800 and U.S. And then O-U.S. about 5,000 again. I think the important thing here is that there really hasn't been anything approved or shown an overall survival advantage in about three decades in this tumor type. So it's a big unmet need and we're very excited by the data that we have and the opportunity to bring Olaratumab hopefully to patients.","So we have announced that we'll be filing based on discussions with the FDA in the U.S. and we also anticipate doing that in Europe too. We also are planning to initiate a Phase III study over the next few months in Q3 and to do some pediatric studies. So I have to say we're excited about the opportunity with this molecule.","Phil Johnson","Yeah. Just a real quick add-on to that, Seamus. I think clearly and for good reason there's been a lot of interest in the investment community on immune-oncology agents that have shown durable responses for a number of patients. While this is not in that nice shiny penny of immune-oncology, the kind of benefit that we saw for overall survival is quite striking. You're talking about 25 months of overall survival compared to 15 months on the comparator arm.","So while this is a smaller patient population, an orphan drug essentially type of patient population, we're very enthusiastic about the data we've shown to date. Leah, next caller please?","Operator","And the next question is from the line of Tim Anderson from Bernstein. Please go ahead. Mr. Bernstein your line is, excuse me, Mr. Anderson your line is open.","Timothy Anderson","Yes. Thank you. A few questions. On solanezumab, obviously the AAIC data presented yesterday. I'm wondering if you can talk about that in the context of Expedition 3and how you will be, I should say, how or whether you will be incorporating a delayed start design into that trial. And really is that something that you would likely need for approval? Or is that something that could come later? In other words is it a regulatory necessity to show results on a delayed start design? Or is it more of a labeling matter?","Second question is on Amyvid, your AD imaging agent. Kind of a rounding error commercially but it seems that PET imaging in the future could have some real value when it helps, when it comes to kind of helping rule in Alzheimer's disease. Is there an unappreciated commercial opportunity at some point in the future with the product?","And then last question just on diabetes. If I look at sales levels of various products, it seemed to track below what I would've expected in different geographies and I'm wondering if that speaks to an increased level of price erosion that might've impacted results?","Phil Johnson","Great, Tim. Thanks for the questions. Dave, if you can handle the solanezumab Expedition 3and Amyvid questions? And then, Enrique, the diabetes question. And obviously, Chito, if you want to make any comments on the growth in emerging markets with diabetes products, please do chime in. Dave?","David Ricks","Great. Thanks, Tim, for the questions. I'll try to handle these and if I get in trouble my experts also online can help. First, regarding the data we showed yesterday on the Expedition Ext or extension study, this is a very long-term set of data with the drug effect in Alzheimer's. And I think we're pleased to see that the safety of the product continues to look very good in this population. We're happy that the delayed start impact we had hoped to see was displayed and that the later patients coming on to sola after the 18-month blinded period did in fact not catch up as tested statistically but also numerically visible and that the treatment effect appeared to persist.","So on the back of that though it's important to note that, that's only important if Expedition 3is positive. This does not represent a basis for submission or - because it's not a blinded assessment. But I think those are encouraging signs for us. And as you know and we've said many times on calls like this, we think included a number of features in Expedition 3, which give us a good shot to really thoroughly test the question of solanezumab in mild patients including your question on PET screening.","So I'll jump to that, which is we believe it's essential to eliminate from these studies and in clinical practice to screen for amyloid in patient who have dementia to really define the underlying cause. Of course that's consistent with Alzheimer's disease versus other types of dementia. Right now Amyvid is available commercially in the U.S. and many European markets. It is not a major product for us today. As you know it's not reimbursed by CMS in the U.S. for instance.","I would frame this I guess in three ways. It's useful for patients, for treators, and for our company. Why is - sales would be expected to increase of Amyvid should disease modifying agents become available including solanezumab because I expect most of those labels and\/or payer requirements will force patients to have confirmed amyloidosis to be eligible. That's good news, but probably still wouldn't be a massive undertaking in terms of revenue impact for the company.","But it's also important to look at the PET capabilities we have in two other frames. One is as a drug development tool. And really operationally being able to manage a clinical network a site that has ready access to the Amyvid PET has really helped us enroll studies quickly and make sure that we can scan patients in a timely way, keep them in the study, and synchronize that complicated machine that allows us to get Expedition 3done for instance, and future studies like the base program with AZ.","And then finally and particularly for something like our Tau Tracer, which is in Phase II, these are very useful drug discovery and scientific tools to help us accelerate and make good decisions about earlier phase Alzheimer's programs. So these are really essential parts of our total Alzheimer's vision and we'll talk more about that in December at our Investor Meeting focused on Alzheimer's.","Phil Johnson","Great. Thank you. Enrique?","Enrique Conterno","Sure. So as we look at our diabetes business, there were a number of one-time events that are impacting the quarter-to-quarter results and I thought first I would say that the underlying business fundamentals are good, not just when it comes to volume. But we've not seen any significant changes when it comes to contracting or additional price pressures over and above what we're seeing before.","Let me speak to Humalog for a second. In Q2 of last year, we had a significant adjustment related to, positive adjustment related to managed Medicaid. That was about five points in terms of the impact when we look at the compare of Q2 of 2015 versus Q2 of 2014. We had a little bit of de-stocking also in the U.S. as we look at Q2. But as we look at the business fundamentals, we continue to feel good about our prospects.","We also have some anomalies when it comes to Tradjenta and in this particular case there were two important adjustments that have been made over the last year or so. We made an adjustment in Q3 of 2014 that basically, a negative adjustment in Q3 of 2014 for Tradjenta sales because we had not accrued enough when it comes to our rebates. We were getting more of our business coming from Medicare than we had initially estimated. And then in Q2 of 2015, in Q2 of 2015 we had a negative adjustment. In essence we had overstated some of our sales in the first half of 2014 and we have in a certain way understated our sales in the first half of 2015.","To make this simpler the bottom line is if we were to normalize for some of these onetime effects and we were to reassign the accruals to the right quarter, our net sales would be growing in the case of Tradjenta in the U.S. about 15%. Clearly we have a very significant volume growth.","Phil Johnson","Great. Leah, next caller, please.","Operator","And the next question is from the line of John Boris with SunTrust. Please go ahead.","John Boris","Thanks for taking the questions. With the commercial launch activity heightened in Japan can you maybe just walk us through the opportunities for Cyramza, Trulicity there and the type of pricing if you've received any innovation type pricing on Cyramza for gastric cancer there? Any relationship with Sumitomo with Trulicity and how you'll launch there?","Second question on the CGRP antibody, can you maybe just walk through what the significant points of differentiation are relative to [indiscernible] who also have competitive antibodies here? And with the rollout of this earlier than anticipated in cluster headaches, just your thoughts on when you might be in a position to compete those clinicals?","And then the third and final question for John Lechleiter just on the political front, can you maybe address two issues that seem to be taking center stage in Washington, most notably repatriation and your thoughts whether we're going to see something that happens their along with tax reform going forward? Thanks.","Phil Johnson","Great, John. Thanks for the questions. You got a good smattering of the management team involved here so let's see, Sue, if you'll start off talking about Japan Cyramza, how we'll proceed in that, any update we've got on pricing there? We'll stick with Japan and move over to Enrique for comments on Trulicity including the recently announced partnership for the commercialization of the product there. Dave, for the CG3 monoclonal antibody questions and then John for the two last questions on repatriation and tax reform. So, Sue, please start.","Susan Mahoney","Yeah. Sure. Okay. With Cyramza we actually launched Cyramza on the 22 of June and we do see this as a really good opportunity for Cyramza given the unmet need there is in Japan and given the number of patients who are treated in Japan with gastric cancer. We estimate about 16,000 patients in Japan are treated in the second line gastric versus about 6,000, 4,000 to 6,000 in the U.S. So the opportunity there is great.","The feedback that we've got from thought leaders is good and the initial feedback from the sales force again is very positive. So it's early days, 22nd of June launch. We did get a slight sales buy-in but clearly we'll be tracking the sales going forward. From a price perspective, yes, we have got the price. The bar price for the 500-milligram is \u00a5355,000 and for the 100-milligram is about \u00a575,000. So we'll give you the exact details on that but we feel good about the price we've got in Japan.","Phil Johnson","Great. Enrique?","Enrique Conterno","Sure. As we have said before when it comes to Trulicity overall expansion of the GLP-1 class is critical for us. Just to quote a few numbers in the U.S. when we look at new patient growth that number is now close to 50%, five zero, when we look at four weeks year-on-year or 13 weeks year-on-year. So we're clearly very pleased with that.","When it comes to Japan, this is even more true just because in Japan the GLP-1 class has the lowest penetration in Type II diabetes of any major market. Now for us to accomplish this we have decided to partner with Dainippon Sumitomo in order to give us to have the appropriate reach when it comes to the small clinics. And this is going to be critical for us.","Phil Johnson","Great. Thank you. Dave?","David Ricks","Yeah. So on CGRP we're excited about this program. As was announced today we did initiate the cluster programs in both chronic and episodic in Q2. We don't have an exact timing at this point for the readout. It's enrollment dependent, John. But we would hope to be able to enroll those studies rapidly given the unmet need and then be able to submit those to regulators as quickly as possible. We'll give updates as we begin to see a little bit more rate on that and you can look at ClinicalTrials.gov, which we update religiously on these points.","That is one of the sources of differentiation we might see for our program versus others, which is indications. At this point I just want to emphasize that there's a big market. There's about 14 million migrainers who could benefit from a preventative just in the U.S. and CGRP neutralization appears to have a very profound and so far looks relatively safe method for alleviating the suffering from this condition.","So there's probably room for a number of players. Really we're going to have to wait to see the Phase III programs play out and often things like dose selection and frequency, et cetera will be different. And we'll see who comes up with the best data package at the end. Right now we're focused on execution and getting in the clinic with the Phase III program in the coming months and are excited by the recent Phase II readout we saw.","Phil Johnson","Jan, do have anything to add on CGRP?","Jan Lundberg","I think we are seeing several antibodies having more or less similar results, which I think is encouraging for the class as such. And the studies have been somewhat different in relation to the number of migraine headache days that has been the focus. Some studies have been episodic classical definition of 4 to 14, others have been 8 to 14 and there could potentially be a difference of the effects of these agents depending on how many migraine days you have. But I think overall we are very encouraged about this class for this large indication in all aspects.","Phil Johnson","Great. Thank you. John?","John Lechleiter","John, thanks for your question. I think speaking for Lilly in terms of the potential for tax reform, we're encouraged by many of the recent soundings that have come from Washington. We've been for as long as I've been CEO and I'm sure before that advocating for corporate tax reform.","We have an uncompetitive tax system in this country. It puts American companies at a disadvantage. It actually discourages investment in the United States. So we would be very anxious to see a system that takes a territorial approach to taxation and as part of that if we enable some repatriation, obviously we would be broadly in favor of that.","The devil is always the details but we're hopeful that short of comprehensive tax reform that current events the impetus for the Highway Trust Fund, et cetera might spur action here. And we're more than ready and willing to participate in a constructive discussion.","Phil Johnson","Great. Thanks, John. Leah, if we can go to the next caller.","Operator","Certainly. And that is Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Jami Rubin","Thank you. John, just a quick question for you. You had mentioned in your prepared remarks your growing in trust in deal activity but mostly confined to partnerships, licensing deals, et cetera. Can you elaborate a little further on that? And in your mind is there - does this mean that you're not going to make acquisitions but rather focus on partnerships, licensing deals? And if you, if the answer is you're not, that you are interested in acquisition activity, is there a limit as to how big you would go? And would you consider using your equity? Just given where your multiple is I would think that, that would be something that would be advantageous to you now.","And then a question for you, Derica. You've previously guided to the FX benefit on gross margin this year to unwind next year assuming exchange rates remain constant. Can you update us on what to expect in terms of the magnitude of that impact? Thanks very much.","John Lechleiter","Okay. Jami, I'll start off. Thanks for the question. I think what we called out at the beginning of the year was our sentiment favoring deals done at ever earlier stages. I think this is not inconsistent with the trend you see in the industry. I think in terms of later-stage deals or maybe even larger-size deals, we're going to be guided first and foremost by the therapeutic categories where we've chosen to compete. And again I think we sort of outlined that quite distinctly at the beginning of the year. That would be diabetes, oncology, and neurodegeneration with emerging interest and presence in pain and in autoimmune disease, again depending on the outcomes of clinical studies. Obviously we filed ixekizumab. We fully intend to move into that psoriasis angle from an autoimmune perspective once we gain approval for that molecule.","So if you go back and you look at the deals we've done since I became CEO in 2008, the ones that stand out obviously are ImClone. We think we can have as many as three molecules from that then existing ImClone portfolio that will eventually be on the pharmacy shelf that augmented and supplemented a presence we already had in oncology. The second biggest deal in that period of time was the Novartis Animal Health. We have been buyers, obviously, on the animal health side going back at least to the deal with Monsanto to acquire BST in the middle of the last decade. We very clearly aim to continue to build that business both through organic and inorganic means.","I mean in between you have a variety of smaller deals. Abbott is a good example is a good example of a unique opportunity we saw to acquire technology that as Dave said earlier gives us a real boost and I think a competitive advantage in the Alzheimer's space. I think in terms of thinking about what the magnitude of something Lilly might consider, I think the Novartis ImClone deals kind of define that. At the same time we're not anxious to go out and pay inflated prices for the hot property of the moment.","There's a bit of a, I think a bit of a bubble right now with respect to valuations on some of the smaller companies or the smaller entities in biotech. And I think it's better use of our, better for our shareholders and better use of our shareholder's equity to focus and foremost on our internal efforts, which are quite strong and I think quite robust in all these therapeutic areas and which we'll continue to augment and supplement aggressively by these earlier stage partnerships.","Phil Johnson","Thanks, John. Derica?","Derica Rice","Jami, in regards to gross margin we've said that each quarter we try to neutralize the impact of FX in gross margin by the additional slide that we provide that kind of shows you the normal run rate. And obviously this year we're running slightly above the mid-seventies. But we said when we - when I think towards 2016 to focus you all, you should be thinking about that 75% range of gross margin being net of FX.","Phil Johnson","Great, Thanks, Derica. Leah, next call please.","Operator","Next question is from the line for Mark Schoenebaum with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Mark Schoenebaum","Hey, John. Hey, guys. Congratulations on the stock this year by the way. I was intrigued by John's comments that there's a bit of a biotech bubble since I cover biotech as well. That scared me. You ruined my day. But anyway actually I do have a question for John kind of building on John Boris' question. Just and I know you're very tuned into Washington. Just this general question, this comes up all the time but I feel like the volumes just turned up a little bit on the price point for cancer drugs given the pace of innovation there.","I'd like to hear you kind of talk about your long-term view on that. Not your one or two-year kind of view but maybe put on your 10-year cap and just kind of ask the question are the current price points for cancer drugs sustainable if the current pace of innovation continues? And how you think the industry is going to react to any pricing pressure you might see?","And then just on ixekizumab, the IL-17 antibody clearly the AstraZeneca Amgen announcement on - Amgen announced they were waiting for AstraZeneca. But on their decision to pull out of the partnership because the side effect profile is a big positive for you guys. I was just wondering if you could speak, if you would be willing to speak in more quantitative terms of what that might mean. Kind of how many patients you think will ultimately be on the drug, et cetera?","This looks to me like it could be a multi-billion-dollar addition to your out year numbers. I just kind of want to know if I'm totally on the wrong track or not. Thank you very much.","Phil Johnson","Mark, thanks for the question. So, John, if you'll start off and then we'll go to Dave for the ixekizumab question.","John Lechleiter","Hi, Mark. I'm sorry if I ruined your day. I'll try to make it up in some way.","Mark Schoenebaum","No problem.","John Lechleiter","Okay. With respect to a lot of media attention and political kind of attention to the price point for cancer drugs, look, I think first and foremost up to the point where we have data, which does not include this year, we did a study that dates back to last year looking at the proportion of drug spend as part of total, the cost of total cancer care. It's remained remarkably consistent over a long period of time.","So put another way, while today we hear a lot about the cost of cancer medicine, I'm not sure I've ever heard anybody complain about the cost of that long stay in the hospital that many of our drugs, these cancer drugs, help to minimize or to eliminate and that's because hospital stays are covered by insurance. I think the question is what's the cost to the patient and how can we ensure that more patients have access, affordable access, to cancer medicine just like they've got through their insurance policies affordable access today to other forms of care that are required for people with cancer.","In terms of how we look at this in the long haul, I think we're going to have to wait and see how this plays out. We're already seeing in many of these classes two or more competitors emerging. We know in other classes of medicines, the diabetes would be one example we're familiar with, we see intense competition that has resulted in lower net effective prices based on negotiations that we must undertake with payers and insurers in that space. Obviously we haven't sort of seen that play out in quite the same way in oncology, but I think we should be encouraging innovation because innovation begets competition rather than discouraging innovation by threatening things like price cast et cetera. For a cancer patient, cancer medicines, particularly some of these new what you might call breakthrough therapies that we all know about, represent the highest quality and most medically effective approach we have in our material of any other intervention. So the calling these out for being simply based on price fails to look at the incredible value that these drugs bring, not in terms of avoiding or minimizing other system costs, but in terms of getting patients that precious additional time and quality of life that is so important.","Phil Johnson","Great. Thanks John. Dave?","David Ricks","Yeah. So Mark, thanks for the question on Ixekizumab was mentioned in the call text we submitted in the U.S. and Europe and shortly in Japan and other major markets. We're excited about the program. In terms of our assets, that's what we're focused on, which is we see a drug here that is providing a whole new threshold of efficacy for patients suffering from moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. We've reported PAZ-100 [ph] as high as 40% and PAZ-90 [ph] in sort of unprecedented range as well. So we think we've got a great asset and we had a special call in June about this and answered a number of questions about the psychiatric safety and as we said then, we don't see an imbalance numerically or statistically across arms, whether they be active comparators or the two doses of Ixekizumab. So we're proceeding through the regulatory process. Of course, we need to get through that with all the caveats.","In terms of the market opportunity in psoriasis, depending on how you count it with PSA or not, I think people would say there's a $4 billion to $6 billion opportunity right now globally and I would just point out that in our estimates less than the treatment rate with biologics in moderate to severe plaque psoriasis is probably less than half of RA. So there's just a huge amount of possibility for growth of biologics as a class in the space. Our vision for that is that the newer, more effective therapies will be a great way to drive interesting greater treatment in dermatology community. We think patients will demand it through time and the caveat there is of course, the normal access and regulatory processes are what stands between us and that opportunity. We don't know what will happen with the former Amgen asset. We're focused on our program and we think there's ample growth for a number of assets in psoriasis and we like our product.","Phil Johnson","Thanks, Dave. Leah, if we can go to the next caller.","Operator","Certainly. It's the line of Chris Schott with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.","Chris Schott","Great. Thanks very much for the questions. Maybe the first one on solanezumab and more broadly in Alzheimer's. I guess coming back from AIC, some of the feedback from the meeting is that the ARIA signal seen in some competitive products is largely asymptomatic and maybe be able to be treated through. I guess just being sure of your thoughts on ARIA and what that could mean for the competitive landscape. And maybe just part of that answer, if you could just talk a little bit more about you guys targeting monomer A-beta versus plaque given that you do have products going after both in the pipeline. Second question was a longer-term question on diabetes. There's been some market concern that this category only becomes more competitive over time and gets even more price pressure going forward. You guys obviously have a differentiated portfolio but how do you think about the risk of an even more conservative payer environment in this category going for forward? Thanks very much.","Phil Johnson","Great, Chris. Thanks for the question. So first for the Alzheimer's disease, the ARIA signal and is this treatable, [indiscernible]. Jan, if you want to start out off with a few comments and, Eric, we may see if you have additional comments that you would like to add to that. Jan, certainly if you want to talk about sort of the plaque specific approach that we've got in the clinic and then Enrique for the price pressure in diabetes segment. Jan?","Jan Lundberg","Yeah. Well in relation to the ARIA signal that was reported, I think first it's clear that Biogen has much more of that than solanezumab which I think is a key difference right now. Secondly, it was claimed that you can treat through it. On the other hand, Biogen also had dropouts I think to a large extent in the trial so it still needs to be seen in a larger situation than in phase 3 whether it really holds true and my view is that if you have an agent that doesn't have very much of this that, that's a competitive advantage for solanezumab. If you look at the types then of monomer AD antibodies versus plaque antibodies, we have both two selective agents then in Lily.","Solanezumab targets then the monomer AD which is then a precursor in a way to the plaque. We have an agent in phase 1 called N3pG which is a pyroglutamate plaque specific antibody. And in preclinical experiments we have seen as a monotherapy for N3pG very good clearance then of amyloid deposits in transgenic models than of Alzheimer's disease in mice and it's even more efficacious if you combine it with an oral base inhibitor while you more or less have a total clearance of amyloid from these mice brains. What we also have seen in the preclinical experiments for N3pG the plaque specific antibody that did not give micro hemorrhage which is kind of related to the ARIA signal out to brain edema that the Alzheimer patients have.","So we hope that we could have a plaque specific antibody with less impact then on the brain edema than what we currently see with a Biogen molecule.","Phil Johnson","Great. And, Eric, do you have anything that you like to add for the discussion around the asymptomatic nature of our ability to treat, et cetera, that you feel has been adequately covered?","Eric Siemers","Yeah. Well I just briefly mention that I think these are relatively early days in terms of the field sort of understanding how that may be managed. Fortunately with solanezumab we really haven't had to deal with the issue too much because it's just a half of percent in placebo treated and 1% in solanezumab treated without really any associated symptoms. But for other molecules where you do have ARIA that may be asymptomatic in two-thirds of people but it's so asymptomatic than in one-third of the people. So that's something that I think broadly in the field we'll just need to get more experience with.","Phil Johnson","Great, Thanks, Eric. Enrique?","Enrique Conterno","Sure. It's difficult to speculate when it comes to the payer environment on diabetes but I think it's helpful for us to be able to look back because that means, because that was the first class in diabetes that was under pressure when it comes to the narrowing of formularies. And that started sometime in 2009. Through this period from 2009 to today what we have been able to see is that Humalog, we've been able to have fairly stable net prices for Humalog over this period. If anything, they are slightly up but clearly not much.","So I would say that yes it is likely that there's going to be narrowing of formularies in other segments in the diabetes space. But I do not expect a significantly different behavior when it comes to some of the net prices and Humulin insulin actually behaved. So that's basically what I would offer there.","Phil Johnson","Great. Thank you. Leah, can we move to the next caller, please.","Operator","Certainly. It's the line of Steve Scala with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.","Steve Scala","Thank you. I have three questions. Even at the high end of your new EPS guidance range, it implies a slightly down second half after a very strong first half. Other than a tougher compare in Q4, what is driving the second half weakness? It seems like Lilly is setting up for a better-than-expected second half as well. Secondly, on Jardiance, the CV [ph] outcomes data in Q3, since it is Q3, is the data in house? How will it be released? And Enrique, are you anything but very confident in the data? And then lastly, what does the lowering of the ADAS-Cog delta at the end of EXPEDITION 1 and 2 from the 2.01 to the 1.83 in July tell us about the patients enrolled and or how they changed over time? Thank you.","Phil Johnson","Great, Steve. Thank you for the questions. So clearly, Derica, to you on the first question related to the guidance in the second half performance, Enrique for the Jardiance CV [ph] outcomes, and then Dave, if you want to kick off the response for the ADAS-Cog question we received. Derica?","Derica Rice","Good morning, Steve. We've had really solid underlying performance in the first six months of this year. And we expect that that solid performance to continue for the second half of this year as well. What you should see also in the second half of the year, and I'm going to kind of reflect on some of the comments that Phil made in his remarks, where in the second half we do expect to make incremental investments in our R&D pipeline given the positive data readouts that we've seen. So we talked about the start of phase 3 trials for tanezumab, our CGRP monoclonal antibody, laratumab, as we highlighted earlier, as well as the intent to invest in additional indications for Cyramza. And as we continue to see more positive data readouts, you'll see is fully investing in our pipeline opportunities.","At the same time, as you heard Sue say, we're in the midst of launching in Japan for Cyramza as well as the ongoing launches in other geographies. So we will fully invest behind that as well. So we really are expecting our top line momentum to continue. You'll see us continue to drive productivity gains, but what that does is it gives us the capacity to make these kinds of investments while still returning to growth this year and margin expansion.","Phil Johnson","Thanks, Derica. Enrique?","Enrique Conterno","Steve, we expect to see the data this quarter, to see the data soon. As we have said, once we have the opportunity to see the data, we will issue a top line press release with the results. We are planning to showcase those results in September at EASD, but that's as much as I can share right now.","Phil Johnson","Great. Thank you. Dave?","David Ricks","Yeah. As it relates to the question of, I guess, the final endpoint displayed in the cooled mild EXPEDITION 1 and 2, two-and-a-half years ago, versus what was displayed yesterday, you're right, there is a small difference. I think that you mentioned it there. In terms of what those absolute numbers are and the difference, the reason for this, and I'll try to put this in very lay terms, is the statistical technique that is both preferred by the FDA sort of by consensus and we use in Alzheimer's studies is called MMRM. It's different from other techniques you may have seen like LOCF. What it does is it relies on all the data available to estimate the missing data. And this technique is thought to reduce type I error. That's what the FDA prefers. It's a technique we used in both assessments that you're referring to. Because the second assessment includes more data, that is the continuing patients, the number does move around slightly. The core data underneath it is identical. That data was locked in 2012, and it's the same data. What we're doing is estimating missing data using this statistical technique.","So I'm not sure there's much news or read through with that but if you'd like to learn more, Steve, we could set up the background on why that occurs. The bottom line take away is I think the same that there is a meaningful difference at the end of the 18 months, and that difference persisted through the open label extension.","Phil Johnson","Great. Thanks, Dave. Leah, next caller, please.","Operator","And the next question is from the line of Andrew Baum from Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Andrew Baum","Okay. Thanks. Just returning to the question of building out your immuno-oncology franchise. And would you mentioned some of the deals you've done. And I know you've had these two very experienced immuno-oncologists. Some of your competitors are engaged in rather more frenetic activity in this area. So along those lines, three questions. Number one, in terms of preclinical, one wouldn't normally ask about compounds but [indiscernible] very fast in this category. Is there anything close to clinic from your preclinical portfolio within the next 6 to 12 months? Second, what is the disease [ph] interest in adoptive cell [ph] therapy given your highest individual [ph] was closely aligned in that area? And finally, should we assume that you have largely done the build out [indiscernible] ? Or as I suspect you're really just getting going in terms of building out franchise? Many thanks.","Phil Johnson","Okay, great. Thank you very much for the questions. I think, Sue, you want to handle those? January, feel free to chime in if you'd like to complete any of the answer? Sue?","Susan Mahoney","Yeah, sure. So as you've seen, we have had a lot of activity. I wouldn't say it's frenetic. I think that was the word you used, frantic, but we have got focused activity in three areas in our R&D portfolio and strategy. We are focused on cell signaling, the micro environment, and immuno-oncology. And we will continue to focus on those areas because we believe that it's going to be rational combinations of molecules within those three areas that's going to be important in the future.","With regard to immuno-oncology, as you said, we have a number of announcements that we've made on collaborations over the past 12 months and it's really into areas. One is in partnership to combine our pipeline and marketed products with agents. In fact, we have seven trials either planned or ongoing in combinations with ROI [ph] agents with four different companies. And then we have our own clinical development where we have three agents in clinical development: our TGF-beta, small molecule inhibitor, our CXEL 4 [ph] inhibitor, and a TSF-1R [ph] antibody. And then we do have a number of agents in discovery. I don't know if January wants to comment more but we have a number of agents in discovery and we do see that we're going to be bringing some of the I-O agents out over the coming months and years.","So I think on the cell therapy, yes, it's an area that we look at. It's not an area that we are driving at this point in time but I think we need to look at all areas in I-O. And we see this as - the I-O there's so many unknowns at the moment in I-O and our view is this is a long-term plan. We're going to be smart in where we focus. We've really looked at T cell [ph] redirection as an area and you can see that a number of the deals that we have done are in that area. And I think that covers the question. Anything you want to answer or add, Jan?","Jan Lundberg","It's evident in immuno-oncology that we've seen the first generation of single agents then, like the PD-1 and PD-L1. And we are part of the second generation coming, when we are combining, for instance, different checkpoints inhibitors into bio-specific antibodies. And we also are very keen to activate T cells in a more specific way using the Immunocore technology. So I think we are just seeing the first door open in the immuno-oncology field and there is very much more to do.","Phil Johnson","Great. Thank you. Leah, next caller please.","Operator","Next question is from the line of Tony Butler from Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead.","Tony Butler","Yeah, thanks very much. Three brief questions from me. I wanted to go back to Tim's question on solanezumab. [indiscernible] modification from EXPEDITION 3, is that still potentially a theme [ph] that the FDA could get you? Or are there some other statistics or clinical information that you may need to show them?","Phil Johnson","Tony, I'm not sure you can hear me. We're having a real hard time making out the question. Can you repeat it?","John Lechleiter","Start again.","Phil Johnson","Yeah. Are you there, Tony?","Operator","His line is still connected.","Tony Butler","Yes, hi. Is this better?","Phil Johnson","Yes, it is. Yeah, thank you.","Tony Butler","My apologies. So back to Tim's question on solanezumab, I'd like to just understand, is Expedition 3 itself sufficient for a disease modification claim? Or will other clinical information be required? Second, is there any or could you elaborate on the biological rationale for JAK1\/JAK2 which could be more beneficial in RA or in dropping AACR source versus an anti-TNF? And third I guess just to Sue as you think about Cyramza at least in the U.S. and we'll leave out CRC for the moment, where are you getting the best traction with respect to non-small cell lung or gastric? Thank you.","Phil Johnson","Great, Tony. Thanks for the questions. So Dave, if you'll talk about maybe the first two, Yon [ph] feel free to complement the answer as well and then Sue for the question on Cyramza, particularly here in the U.S. what we're seeing. Dave?","David Ricks","Yeah. Good question on Expedition 3. We've designed this to be a stand-alone pivotal study to support registration of solanezumab in Alzheimer's patients. In terms of the exact claims underneath that, the FDA themselves have admitted they've been vague and it's a moving landscape because the science is moving so fast in Alzheimer's, I'm aware of two clear statements they've made and I think yesterday's data supports one of them, which would be in addition to a marked change, a clinically relevant change in ADAS-Cog and in the ADL measures, or some composite thereof to support disease modification they said they would look at supportive data in a delayed start format. And I think the speaker yesterday spoke about that. They have a very elegant trial design they proposed. No one's actually ever conducted such a thing. Our data, which is a sort of delayed start is helpful in that regard.","Tony, that's how I would describe it and then they've also spent a lot of time talking about biomarkers and, of course, unlike other fields we don't yet have a validated biomarker for disease progression in Alzheimer's. And we are conducting a sub-study in Expedition 3 using our tao tracer. We see this as a very important part of not only expedition 3 program potentially to support disease modification and other claims for solanezumab but also to advance the fields understanding of how tao progression maps to cognitive decline in people with confirmed amyloid, which we don't have that data today. So we'll have to wait and see on the specific claims. Of course, we've got a lot of irons in the fire to support solanezumab in that regard but regulator in the whole field is moving rather rapidly here. So it's difficult to predict.","On bemaciclib and the JAK1\/JAK2 and what is I guess you're saying theoretical basis why it could be better than anti-TNF, the bottom line is we're running that experiment and we will see that experiment readout in the fall. And we're really going to have to wait to see whether bemaciclib could be better than a TNF or equal to, which is the first test we'll run. There are lots of plausible explanations why it could happen. JAK1\/JAK2 signaling and we continue to point this out that JAK2 signaling is important to have an IL-6 like effect as well as GM [ph] CSF, both of which we have human data validating those targets in RA. Whether that yields better than TNF, which is a quite different target is the test we're running.","Phil Johnson","Thanks, Dave. Sue?","Susan Mahoney","Okay. And with Cyramza in the U.S. we're actually seeing a good uptake in both gastric and in lung. As we look at gastric, I mean, we launched the single agent indication earlier last year. So the majority we used last year with single agent, then towards the end of last year we launched the combo and we're seeing more uptake in combination. With gastric prior to the regard data there wasn't anything approved in the U.S. in the second line treatment of gastric cancer. So clearly we're seeing this as all people are seeing this as an advance and we're seeing a good uptake, good feedback so far about the experience that people are having as well.","In lung, we launched earlier this year, and we again are seeing good uptake in the second line post platinum patients. We see these as very two different opportunities with the lung indication being much larger but clearly it's going to be more competitive. The feedback we're getting is positive, about 40% of our sales in Q2 came from lung indication and we continue to see a good opportunity to continue to grow in lung as well as to expanding gastric going forward.","Phil Johnson","Thank you, Sue. Leah, next caller please.","Operator","And the next question is from Gregg Gilbert from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Gregg Gilbert","Thank you. Three quick ones here. First perhaps for Dr. Siemers or perhaps Dave. How would you summarized how actual Alzheimer's treaters took the data that was presented down in D.C. if that was it all on your agenda to kind of feel out folks that are not just clinical trial gurus? Perhaps secondly, Chito can comment on what's happening in China. There's been a pretty sudden slowdown for pharma sales for the industry. Curious if you could comment on that and how long those conditions might persist. And for Derica, were there any meaningful wholesaler inventory level changes in the quarter versus last Quarter? It looks like A.R. was up a bit. Thanks.","Phil Johnson","Great, Gregg. Thanks for the questions. So we'll start off with Dave on the first question. We may see if Eric has something he'd like to add since he's been out at AAIC. And then to Chito on the China question and Derica for the wholesaler inventory impact in the quarter.","David Ricks","Yeah, Gregg, thanks for the question. I think the field as we talked to practitioners is obviously anxiously waiting for a disease-modifying agent in the absence of any way to slow down this horrible condition. The question of clinical meaningfulness always comes up and the research we've done would say most practitioners would say a one-third reduction over an 18-month period of time is quite meaningful. But we have Dr. Siemers on the line here who's a neurologist and I'm sure spoke to many of your colleagues. Enrique, what are your views on how the lay field is interpreting the data?","Enrique Conterno","Yeah, it's a great question. I think going into the meeting, we wondered ourselves whether this would be interesting just to clinical trial gurus or geeks or whatever you want to say or whether it would have more of a broad interest and I think the interest was fairly broad and I think there's maybe two major reasons for that. One is that just by showing these delayed start results, I think it was in a sense supporting what we initially showed in the placebo-controlled period. Now, of course, that was a secondly outcome we always worry about those a little bit, but these delayed start results would actually add to the weight of evidence that those results in face, we hope will be replicated in Expedition 3. The other piece is that this whole concept of disease modification has been discussed is something where the science is evolving. There has been fairly good agreement, including by regulators, that this delayed start design can provide evidence of disease modification and I think the data were really accepted as evidence of that. Again, it's a secondary analysis from Expedition and Expedition 2, but I think it gives us some real confidence that we'll see very similar results in Expedition 3 and that's one strong piece of evidence of disease modification.","Phil Johnson","Great. Thanks, Enrique. Chito?","Alfonso Zulueta","Gregg, as I'm sure you've heard from other companies, there has been a pretty significant drop in the market growth in China. I think as we all recall from the mid-teen growth in the last few years, year-to-date growth is somewhere around single digit and if you look at the multinational cohort of companies, I think May was around 2% growth over the same period last year. Now, I think the primary factor that's driving the slowdown is really some government initiatives and policies that are curtailing volume growth and we're seeing more hospitals and institutions shifting to lower-priced generics. So we see this continuing at least in the short-term as there is pressure within the national government to curtail expenses. There's discussion also in curtailing pricing and linking together all types of products from the original brands to generics. So there's pressure on the volume side and moving forward I think you'll see more pressure on pricing, particularly for off patent brands.","Now, we need to balance that with the medium-term opportunities and long-term positive opportunities in China. We have obviously very positive demographics and there is a sincere commitment, I believe, by the national government to expand healthcare coverage to a broader set of the Chinese population. But I think we should expect that the short-term will be challenging, again because of policies related to volume control in the hospitals and pressure for original brands.","As far as Lilly's concerned, I think the better measure to look at our performance with the year-to-date performance, given the quarter-to-quarter variability of wholesaler buying patterns, and year-to-date we're below on 5%, but it's really driven by very [ph] - a decline in our growth and some of our off-patent products, primarily in neuroscience, oncology and anti-infective products, again because of volume control but also because of the generics. However, if you look at the - our patented products, we're very pleased to see strong performance from Cialis growing at 23%, Forteo growing at over 50%. And our Analog business, I know there was question earlier to Enrique, the Analog Insulin business in China is growing 12% year-to-date. Now, we're getting significant pricing pressure on the unit insulin side where local companies are beginning to win the provincial kids. But once again, we anticipate pressure in the short-term, but we're very confident that [indiscernible] the long-term prospects remain very, very positive.","Phil Johnson","Great, [indiscernible]. Thanks for that color. And Derica, on the wholesaler changes in the quarter?","Derica Rice","Sure. Hi, Gregg. As it pertains to wholesalers, there was really nothing unusual or unique as it pertains to wholesaler activity in the quarter.","Phil Johnson","Great. Leah, if we can go to the next caller, please.","Operator","Certainly. It is the line of Colin Bristow with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Colin Bristow","Thanks for taking the questions and congrats on the quarter. A couple of quick ones. On Trulicity, could you talk about the progress you've made in terms of access, and any additional color you could give on the launches of Trulicity and Jardiance that would be helpful. And then number two, what do you see as a potential impact on the trajectory of the SGLT-2 class and then Jardiance within that, if there was a positive CV [ph] benefit. Do you expect a heavy asymmetrical benefit for Jardiance, or do you think this would just be bled through as a benefit for everyone? And [indiscernible] , just a third quick one on saler [ph]. Any additional updates we should expect prior to the Expedition 3 readout? Thank you.","Phil Johnson","Great, Colin. Thank you for the questions. Obviously we'll go to Enrique for the first two on some of the access and uptake we're seeing for Trulicity and Jardiance, as well as then, what the impact might be a positive CV [ph] outcomes trial for Jardiance, and then over to you, Dave, for the solanezumab question and either [ph] updates we've got on that program going forward. So, Enrique?","Enrique Conterno","Sure. So we are pleased with the progress that we've made with both Trulicity and Jardiance. We now have about 70% access when we look at commercial access in the U.S., and about 30% being Part B with Trulicity. As I shared earlier, I think for us, a key to be able to get long-term value for this product is to ensure the GLP-1 class is growing, and we clearly see a significant acceleration of the GLP-1 class.","In the case of Jardiance, the situation is similar. When it comes to - continue to basically get asked this. I would say that we have, differently from the GLP-1 class, we have seen a slowdown, significant slowdown when it comes to the HCLT-2 [ph] class, when it comes to new patient starts this year, so that's something that we're watching of course very closely. And it is difficult to speculate on what relative share of the benefit, disproportionate benefit will we get on, if we were to have a positive CV [ph] outcomes result. Clearly this is going to provide a lift to the entire class, and we do expect that we're going to get a disproportionate share of that benefit, how much I think is difficult to say.","Phil Johnson","Great. Thank you, Enrique. Dave?","David Ricks","Yeah, on - so on what we will expect to - starting with yesterday and until the end of the Expedition 3 study is, there will be some scholarly articles and other data coming out on the original Expedition 1 and 2, including the Pool of Mild's [ph] paper we do expect to come out. Also I had a - there was an interesting presentation yesterday, looking at the amyloid changes using a more modern and accepted method, which did show a difference between active and placebo, so these types of reanalysis and additional data filling out the picture from 1 and 2 will continue. But the big data readout, Expedition 3, which we guide people to really focus on won't happen until after the last patient visit and data analysis, last patient visit we project Q4 of 2016.","And we have made the decision just to communicate it formally that we will not conduct an interim analysis for EXPEDITION 3 so we will run the trial to completion. Enrollment went so quickly in that trial. There's very little time and benefit for us to go ahead and garner from doing the early read. We'll look the trial play out and preserve all the powering for the final readout at the end.","Colin Bristow","Sure.","Phil Johnson","I know were getting close to the bottom of the hour but I believe we've got one more caller. We're happy to take that question before wrapping up the call.","Operator","Certainly. And that is from Vamil Divan from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Vamil Divan","Great. Thanks for sneaking me in here. So just a couple of quick things I could, maybe some different topics and we focus on so far. One, just on the Animal Health side. You kind of close the Novartis deal. Just kind of if we can get a sense from Jeff for how he's viewing that business kind of going forward and kind of the growth we should expect going forward. There's 2% constant currency growth this quarter or year-to-date so just want to see how - what you think there.","Second, just on the PCSK9 obviously a lot of interest and excitement around the industry on that because the first ones, most of the market, you guys still got yours in phase 2. And if you can just give an update on how you view that opportunity for Lily? And then third maybe it's a little bit early for this but just around the dividend with all the news you've been having on the pipeline in the kind of return to growth you're seeing, how should we think about your view on the dividend going forward? Thank you.","Phil Johnson","Great. Fantastic. Thanks, Vamil. So, Jeff, you'll start us off and we'll shift over to Dave for the PCSK9 question and finish up with Derica.","Jeffrey Simmons","Yeah. The overall Animal Health business Cylanco [ph] is tracking to our plans and expectations. This year has been focused on integration after coming out of an era of a lot of growth. We're planning to return to that but this year's big focus is on the integration. Our previously committed savings level on the integration of $200 million by 2017, 2018. What I would say is we see that as a minimum expectation and we'll have an Animal Health investor conference in December in Boston where we'll get into more detail what we would say is today we're seeing ourselves meeting and exceeding all the key milestones on Novartis and that'll be a key driver in returning to growth.","So yes, we saw 3% growth this quarter but what we would say is we see the combination of the integration as well as our pipeline and innovation returning us back to top-tier industry growth once we come to the integration. We'll articulate more of these details again in Boston at the end of the year. Thanks.","Phil Johnson","Dave?","David Ricks","Yeah. On PCSK9 there's really no update from the last call where we have the question. We have our phase 2 data complete, we're looking at our strategic options for this program recognizing there's three competitors ahead of us and we would want to see differentiation or perhaps look for other options to have them all move forward.","Phil Johnson","Thanks, Dave. Derica?","Derica Rice","In regards to the dividend, we're very encouraged and excited about the current performance of the business and as we've seen us kind of turning the tide and returning to the spirit of growth and margin expansion it really is giving us the capacity if you've seen this year to return to more regular cadence of dividend increases and we see that going forward over time. And then likewise you'll see us continue also to look to supplement that with returning additional excess cash to shareholders via our share repurchase program.","Phil Johnson","Thanks, Derica. John, would you like to go ahead and conclude the call for us?","John Lechleiter","Sure, Phil. We appreciate your participation in today's earnings call and your interest in our company. We've received a positive feedback on the recent calls we hosted to discuss our diabetes business and late stage data from two key molecules in our Biomedicines business. They're sitting there [indiscernible]. So building on that experience, we plan to host an investor event in Boston, as Jeff mentioned, on Tuesday, December 8 to highlight to other areas of our business that obviously are generating significant investor interest and that's Alzheimer's and Animal Health. So we hope the information we share at this upcoming events will be likewise helpful you.","Finally, if you have questions we didn't address in today's call, please contact our IR team. I can tell you that they are standing by and would be happy to help. So have a great day and thanks again for joining us.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this conference is available for digitized replay after 11:30 a.m. Eastern time today through July 30 at midnight.

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Dr. John Lechleiter. Please go ahead.","John C. Lechleiter - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning everybody. Thanks for joining us for Eli Lilly & Company's second quarter 2016 earnings call. I'm John Lechleiter, Lilly's Chairman, President and CEO. Joining me today in the room are Derica Rice, our Chief Financial Officer; Dr. Jan Lundberg, President of Lilly Research Laboratories; Dr. Sue Mahony, President of Lilly Oncology; Enrique Conterno, President of Lilly Diabetes; Dave Ricks, President of Lilly Bio-Medicines; Chito Zulueta, President of Emerging Markets; Jeff Simmons, President of our Elanco Animal Health business; and Ilissa Rassner, Christina Wright (1:13), Brad Robling, Chris Ogden (1:17) and Phil Johnson of Lilly's IR team.","During this conference call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors including those listed on slide three and those outlined in our latest forms 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC. The information we provide about our products pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It is not intended to be promotional. It is not sufficient for a prescribing decision.","Before we dive into this quarter's activities and financial results, I'd like to provide a few brief remarks at a more strategic level. 18 months ago on our guidance call in January 2015, as we emerged from the series of patent expirations we referred to as the YZ period, we described refinements to our innovation based strategy as well as our key strategic objectives for the remainder of the decade. Those four strategic objectives were grow revenue, expand margins, sustain the flow of innovation and deploy capital to create value. I'd like to provide a bit more detail than we have in the past on our future expectations for each of these objectives, starting with the sustained the flow of innovation.","At our meeting in Boston last December, we discussed in great detail both our animal health business and our comprehensive Alzheimer's disease R&D efforts. We followed that up at our meeting this past May, where we took an in-depth look at our R&D efforts in diabetes, oncology, immunology and pain. Between these two meetings, we hope you've gained a greater appreciation for the significant future growth opportunities we see in each of our human pharma focus areas as well as in Elanco Animal Health.","As an innovation-based pharmaceutical company, our future growth prospects are determined by the flow of innovation from our pipeline. As we discussed at our R&D meeting in May, we believe we've made substantial progress building an R&D engine that can sustain a flow of innovation to support our growth aspirations.","Over a 10-year period starting in 2014, we believe we could launch 20 or more new medicine. These 20 launches span the five therapeutic areas we focused on: diabetes, oncology, neurodegeneration, immunology and pain. And the revenue growth from these new product launches will be reinforced by new indications and line extensions, which on average could number two per year.","So how do we see this translating into revenue growth for the balance of this decade? Having already launched six products in the past two years, with more launches possible in the next few years, we expect to generate robust revenue growth from 2015 to 2020, despite facing a number of significant patent expirations.","To provide a floor for our expectations, we've analyzed a range of scenarios for clinical, regulatory and commercial success. Based on this analysis, we expect annual revenue growth over this period to average at least 5% on a constant currency basis driven by higher volume, not price. And we certainly see scenarios for clinical, regulatory and commercial success that would drive revenue growth significantly higher than this minimum expectation.","I would point out that our revenue growth expectations do assume increased price pressure in the US, but do not include any significant government action on Medicare Part D, for example, and also assume that we maintain Alimta patent exclusivity in the US throughout the period.","With regard to our margins, we remain on track to achieve our goal of reducing operating expenses, sum of R&D and SG&A, to 50% of revenue or less in 2018. And when excluding foreign exchange, we expect to increase gross margin as a percent of revenue over the remainder of this decade.","Finally, on deploying capital to create value, we will follow the priorities we've outlined for you since early 2015. First and foremost, we'll fund the considerable opportunities provided by our existing products and our pipeline. Second, we will actively pursue opportunities to bolster our future growth prospects through business development. You should expect these efforts to be concentrated on our existing human pharma therapeutic areas and our animal health business. Finally with the strength of our current business and pipeline, we plan to return to annual dividend increases to our shareholders beginning in December of this year, and to return excess cash via share repurchases.","I hope this provides you with greater clarity on the progress we expect to make on our four strategic objectives through the end of this decade.","Now let's move to this quarter's results. As I did last quarter, I'm going to use that same strategic objectives framework to summarize our progress. On our first strategic objective, grow revenue, we grew revenue 8% in the second quarter on a constant currency or performance basis. All of this performance growth was driven by volume. And in total, our new products, Trulicity, Cyramza, Jardiance, Basaglar, Portrazza and Taltz drove 6 percentage points of this volume growth.","On our next strategic objective, expand margins, our non-GAAP OpEx as a percent of revenue declined 90 basis points compared to the second quarter of last year. Excluding the $100 million milestone payment to AstraZeneca, our non-GAAP OpEx percent decreased nearly 3 percentage points. We remain on track to achieve our full year guidance, which at the midpoint of our ranges, implies an improvement of 200 to 250 basis points in OpEx as a percent of revenues.","Under the heading of sustaining the flow of innovation, Taltz was approved in Japan for both psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. For the PSA indication, this marks the first time I can recall that a new indication was first approved in Japan. Kudos to our Japanese regulatory colleagues on this outstanding accomplishment.","Olaratumab, a monoclonal antibody from our ImClone acquisition, received priority review status here in the US, and an FDA advisory committee voted 12 to 11 that substantial evidence exists to establish that Jardiance reduces cardiovascular death in adults with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease. During the call, we'll provide a more complete list of the pipeline progress we've achieved over the last three months.","Lastly, on our strategic objective deploy capital to create value, we completed a number of smaller deals to bolster both our human pharma and animal health businesses. We will continue to actively pursue additional external opportunities to enhance our future growth prospects. And finally during the quarter, we returned over $500 million to shareholders through our quarterly dividend.","In summary, I'm confident that the progress we're making in 2016 places us on track to achieve each of our strategic objectives through 2020. And I assure you that their achievement is a top priority for our entire management team.","Now let's move on to a review of the key events that occurred since our last earnings call. On the commercial front, earlier this month we began initial launches of Taltz in Europe for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis and Elanco Animal Health launched Inteprity, a first-in-class animal use only in-feed antibiotic approved for the prevention of necrotic enteritis, a significant and costly intestinal disease in poultry.","Once again, it was a busy three months on the regulatory front. In Japan, we received approval of Cyramza for two new indications, one in metastatic colorectal cancer and the other in non-small cell lung cancer. Also in Japan as I just mentioned, we received approval for Taltz for both psoriasis and for psoriatic arthritis. Along with Boehringer Ingelheim, we received two FDA approvals for a once daily form of Jentadueto for the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes and for a larger 80-unit Basaglar KwikPen, we remain on track for a mid-December launch of Basaglar.","The FDA determined that we met the requirements for pediatric exclusivity for Effient. Based on this decision by the FDA, Lilly has gained an additional six months of US market exclusivity with compound patent exclusivity now expiring in October 2017.","In oncology, the FDA granted priority review for olaratumab for soft tissue sarcoma. As a result, we expect FDA action before the end of the year, and as I mentioned earlier, an FDA advisory committee voted 12 to 11 that substantial evidence exists to establish that Jardiance reduces cardiovascular death in adults with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease. Jardiance as you know is marketed by Boehringer Ingelheim and Lilly.","On the clinical front, at ASCO we presented results from the Phase II MONARCH 1 study of abemaciclib, our CDK4 and CDK6 inhibitor in patients with hormone-positive HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer. The data showed single-agent activity as measured by objective response, clinical benefit rate and progression-free survival in metastatic breast cancer patients for whom endocrine therapy was no longer a suitable treatment option.","As Sue mentioned on our recent investor call to discuss these data, the interim Phase III readout for MONARCH 2 will occur in the near future. Given the close proximity of this readout to the final MONARCH 1 data, we expect to submit MONARCH 1 data to the FDA as early as later this quarter after the interim MONARCH 2 readout.","Also at ASCO, along with Merck, we presented promising early-stage clinical data on the combination of Keytruda with Alimta in frontline non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer and of Keytruda with Cyramza in later lines of non-small cell lung cancer. At ACR, along with Incyte, we presented data for baricitinib in rheumatoid arthritis from the Phase III long-term extension study, RA-BEYOND. Among other things, these data show that baricitinib was superior to placebo at inhibiting joint damage. We continue to be pleased with the data generated on baricitinib in RA, and we look forward to regulatory action next year in the US, Europe and Japan.","At the American Diabetes Association along with BI, we presented results from the Phase III MARLINA trial demonstrating that Trajenta, a DPP-4 inhibitor, reduced blood sugar in adults with type 2 diabetes who were at risk for kidney impairment with a renal safety profile similar to that seen in other trials. And from the EMPA-REG OUTCOME study, showing that Jardiance reduced the risk for new onset or worsening kidney disease by 39% versus placebo when added to standard of care in adults with type 2 diabetes with established cardiovascular disease.","Also at ADA, we presented results from the AWARD-9 study, showing that Trulicity significantly reduced blood sugar and body weight as an add-on to insulin glargine compared to placebo plus insulin glargine.","In other news, Lilly and BI announced a collaboration to evaluate the safety and tolerability of abemaciclib in combination with BI 836845, Boehringer Ingelheim's insulin-like growth factor, ligand neutralizing antibody in patients diagnosed with hormone-receptor positive HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer. And Elanco Animal Health announced a collaboration with EnBiotix to use EnBiotix' technology to develop alternatives to traditional antibiotic therapies for animals.","We were pleased that the German Federal Supreme Court granted our appeal in the Alimta patent case versus Actavis, vacating the prior decision denying infringement. This ruling supports our continuing belief that Alimta's vitamin regimen patent would be infringed by the entry of generic pemetrexed products, including alternative salt forms in Europe prior to June 2021. And the US Patent and Trademark Office granted petition seeking inter partes review, or IPR, of our Alimta vitamin regimen patent. We expect final IPR written decision in mid 2017.","Finally, we did not repurchase any stock in the second quarter, leaving $2.65 billion remaining on our $5 billion plan. During the quarter however, we did distribute over $500 million to shareholders via our dividend. We remain committed to providing a robust dividend and returning excess cash to shareholders.","Now I'll turn the call over to Phil for a discussion of our financial performance for the quarter. Phil?","Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations","Great. Thanks, John. Slide eight summarizes our presentation of GAAP results and non-GAAP measures. Now let's look at our results for the second quarter. Slide nine provides a summary of our GAAP results. I'll focus my comments today on our non-GAAP adjusted measures to provide insights into the underlying trends in our business. So please refer to today's earnings press release for a detailed description of the year on year changes in our second quarter GAAP results.","Moving to non-GAAP measures on slide 10, you can see the Q2 2016 revenue increased 9% compared to Q2 2015, reaching $5.4 billion. Gross margin as a percent of revenue decreased 3.2 percentage points to 76%. This decrease was driven by the effect of foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold. This effect resulted in a benefit both this quarter and last year's quarter, but the benefit this quarter was substantially smaller than the benefit realized last year. Excluding this FX effect, our gross margin percent decreased by 50 basis points, going from 76.2% in last year's quarter to 75.7% this quarter, driven primarily by product mix.","Total operating expense, defined as the sum of R&D and SG&A, increased by 7% compared to Q2 2015. Breaking this into its component parts, marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased 1% while R&D increased 14%. The slight increase in marketing, selling and administrative expenses was due to higher spending on new products, largely offset by lower spending on late lifecycle products and lower litigation expenses.","The increase in R&D expense was driven primarily by higher late-stage clinical development costs, including the $100 million milestone payment to AstraZeneca triggered by the transition to Phase III testing for the oral-based inhibitor for Alzheimer's disease, AZD3293. This milestone payment added 8.5 percentage points to R&D expense growth and over 3.5 percentage points to total operating expense growth. Excluding this milestone payment, total OpEx increased just over 3%, which was substantially less than revenue growth.","Other income and expense was income of $21 million this quarter, slightly less than the $29 million reported in last year's quarter. Our tax rate was 22.4%, an increase of 160 basis points compared with the same quarter last year. This increase was primarily due to a net discrete tax benefit in last year's quarter of approximately $24 million, which lowered that quarter's tax rate by about 2 percentage points. In addition, this year's tax rate benefited from certain US tax provisions including the R&D tax credit that are in force in 2016, but had lapsed during last year's quarter. This was largely offset by the tax impact of an increased percentage of earnings in higher tax jurisdictions this year compared to last year.","At the bottom line, net income increased, I'm sorry, decreased 5%, and earnings per share decreased 4%. While Derica will cover the effect of FX on our income statement in a subsequent slide, I would highlight that when excluding the effect of FX, non-GAAP EPS actually increased 4% this quarter.","Slide 11 contains non-GAAP adjusted information for the first half of the year, while slide 12 provides a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS. And you'll find additional details on these adjustments on slides 25 and 26.","Now let's take a look at the effect of price, rate and volume on revenue growth. On slide 13 in the yellow highlighted row at the bottom of the table, you'll see the 9% revenue growth I mentioned earlier. For the first quarter in quite a while, FX was not a headwind as a stronger yen offset weaker emerging markets currencies. As it did in Q1, on a performance basis, our worldwide revenue grew 8% this quarter, driven entirely by volume.","By geography, you'll notice that US pharma revenue increased 15%, driven primarily by volume. Trulicity and Humalog were the main drivers of US volume growth, with meaningful contributions also coming from Cialis, Taltz, Jardiance, Humulin and Trajenta. Having completed the take-back of North American rights for Erbitux on October 1 of last year, we also benefited from booking end sales of Erbitux.","The decline in EuCan revenue of 1% was driven by the negative effect of price, which was nearly offset by the positive effect of volume and to a much lesser extent FX. On a constant currency or performance basis, EuCan revenue decreased 2%. This decrease was driven primarily by lower price and volume for Cymbalta following patent expiration, partially offset by the uptake of new products including Trulicity, Cyramza, Basaglar and Jardiance, and higher sales of Humalog, Trajenta and Cialis. Excluding Cymbalta, EuCan sales increased 7% in constant currency terms.","In Japan, pharma revenue increased 21% in total, driven by mid teens volume growth and an 11% benefit from a stronger yen, partially offset by a 7% negative price effect from the latest biannual price cuts. On a constant currency basis, Japan pharma revenue increased 10%. This performance growth was attributable to a number of products, led by Cyramza, but also including Cymbalta, Strattera, Basaglar, Trulicity and Trajenta.","Turning to emerging markets, we saw revenue decline 3% driven by the negative effect of FX which was partially offset by higher volume. On a performance basis, emerging markets revenue increased 5% due to volume growth from a number of products, most notably Humalog and Trulicity, partially offset by continued sales erosion of off-patent brands including Alimta, Cialis, Zyprexa and Cymbalta.","Also this quarter, our pharma revenue in China increased 15% or 23% on a constant currency basis. This quarter's growth rate did benefit from customer buying patterns in both last year's quarter and this quarter. We estimate that underlying demand for our products in China increased 5% in the second quarter.","Turning to animal health, we completed the Novartis Animal Health acquisition on January 1 last year. So year on year revenue growth comparisons are now on an apples to apples basis. This quarter, Elanco Animal Health revenue increased 2%. Excluding the negative effect of FX, Elanco revenue increased 4%. This performance increase was primarily driven by the uptake of new products as well as by wholesaler buying patterns of US companion animal products.","On slide 14, you'll find the same price, rate and volume analysis but on a year to date basis. As I mentioned a moment ago, excluding FX from our worldwide revenue, our growth would have been 8% this quarter, with nearly all of that growth coming from higher volume. Our new products, Trulicity, Cyramza, Jardiance, Taltz, Basaglar and Portrazza were the engine of our worldwide volume growth.","Slide 15 shows that these products drove over 6 percentage points of volume growth this quarter. Humalog contributed nearly 2 percentage points of volume growth, while the take-back of Erbitux contributed nearly 1 percentage point of volume growth. You'll also see that the loss of exclusivity for Zyprexa, Cymbalta and Evista, while largely in the rear-view mirror, still provided a drag of roughly 1.7 percentage points on our volume growth.","Finally, Alimta reduced our worldwide volume growth by nearly 1 percentage point this quarter. The major driver of the decline in worldwide Alimta volume was the US, where we've seen increasing competitive pressure from immuno-oncology agents, and to a lesser extent from targeted agents. Notably, Alimta volume across EuCan was relatively flat this quarter with the exception of the UK, where we have begun to see generic competition.","Now let me turn the call over to Derica.","Derica W. Rice - Executive Vice President, Global Services & Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Phil. As I did last quarter, I'd like to start by sharing some color on our new product launches. During the Q&A session, both Sue, Enrique and Dave can provide more details.","As you can see on the graph on slide 16, our new products generated $428 million in revenue this quarter, led by Trulicity and Cyramza. This now represents about 8% of our total worldwide revenue. And as Phil mentioned earlier, these products drove 6 percentage points of our worldwide volume growth this quarter.","Cyramza continues to grow globally, driven largely by strong gastric cancer uptake in Japan and Europe. And we look forward to continued growth in these markets, not only in gastric cancer, but also supported by the ongoing launches of the colorectal and lung cancer indications. Sales in the US declined slightly this quarter due to competition in non-small cell lung cancer, primarily from immuno-oncology agents. Sales outside of the US now account for over half of Cyramza's global sales, with Japan making up nearly a third. Trulicity continues to gain momentum globally.","Here in the US, we're now capturing over 25% of new patient starts in a GLP-1 class while in many O-US markets, we're seeing uptake comparable to that seen with Victoza when it launched. Of note, in Germany, Trulicity is now the most prescribed GLP-1 brand for patients new to the class. In addition to our strong performance, we're benefiting from strong growth of the GLP-1 class, with the US market growing 30%.","Another class that is showing rapid growth is the SGLT2 class, where we see US class growth in the 25% range. This is however below the class growth we'd expected to see. In the US, our new-to-therapy share with endocrinologists continues to increase, exceeding 35% in the most recent IMS data, as shown in our supplementary slide 41.","Outside the US, we've seen very strong uptake in Italy, with encouraging trends across all countries. In addition to the guideline update in Canada I mentioned last quarter, we've seen initial regulatory approvals of a CV indication for Jardiance in markets like Ecuador and Mexico, and we look forward to the FDA action later this year. We've now launched a Basaglar in a number of O-US countries.","As I mentioned last quarter, in countries where local pricing authorizations have produced a copay advantage, share of market performance has been higher than our expectation. This includes markets like Japan, Poland and Slovakia. In countries like Germany and Spain, where there isn't a copay advantage, we're running on an annualized share of the total Basal insulin market of 3% to 5%. In aggregate, we are pleased with our performance. Here in the US, as John mentioned earlier, we recently gained FDA approval of an 80-unit KwikPen and look forward to launching Basaglar in mid December.","It's still early days for Portrazza, with the US launch having occurred in December and the initial European launches in April. In the US, we are encouraged that the vast majority of US payers are now covering Portrazza, although we continue to see strong uptake of IO agents in first-line squamous non-small cell lung cancer, which is affecting Portrazza's uptake.","Finally, our newest product, Taltz, launched in the US in April and in Europe earlier this month. Early prescription data in the US is encouraging. Given the recent approval in both psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, we also look forward to launching Taltz in Japan this fall.","Moving to slide 17, you'll see the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates on our 2016 results. This quarter, FX had a small positive impact on revenue growth. Excluding FX, worldwide revenue grew 8%. In performance terms, growth in non-GAAP cost of sales at 12% outpaced revenue growth, due primarily to the negative effect of product mix.","Moving down the income statement, excluding FX, non-GAAP operating expenses grew slightly slower than revenue at 7%. Excluding the $100 million AZD3293 milestone payment, non-GAAP operating expenses grew much more slowly than revenue at just 3.5%. Finally, excluding FX, non-GAAP operating income increased 7%, while a higher tax rate and slightly lower other income led to a 4% increase in non-GAAP EPS.","Moving on to our pipeline update, slide 18 shows our pipeline as of July 19. Changes since our last earnings calls are highlighted, with green arrows showing progression and red arrows showing movement out of the portfolio. In our NME pipeline, we started Phase I testing for four molecules, including a CHK1 inhibitor and a PD-L1 monoclonal antibody for cancer, a double incretin mimetic for diabetes and a tau antibody for Alzheimer's disease. I would note that increasingly, even in areas outside of oncology, we are testing our molecules in patients in Phase I, in addition to healthy volunteers. You will also see that we terminated development of two Phase II molecules in non-core areas.","In our NILEX pipeline, as shown on slide 19, along with Boehringer Ingelheim, we received FDA approval of the once daily version of Jentadueto as well as our first global approval for ixekizumab in psoriatic arthritis which occurred in Japan, and we began Phase III testing for ixekizumab in AxSpA.","You will also see that we're showing baricitinib for diabetic nephropathy and for psoriasis as attrition as we decided not to pursue these indications at this time. We will invest in additional indications for baricitinib and have trials ongoing in atopic dermatitis and lupus and you shouldn't be surprised to see more in the future.","Turning to slide 20, let's recap the progress we've made on the key events we projected for 2016. Since our last call, we've added green check marks for the initiation of Phase III for ixekizumab in AxSpA; the internal data readout and subsequent presentation at ASCO of detailed results from the Phase II MONARCH 1 trial of abemaciclib as a single agent treatment for advanced breast cancer; the presentation at ACR of data from the RA-BEYOND study of baricitinib in RA; the presentation at ADA of the MARLINA study of linagliptin; the approval of Taltz in Japan for both psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis; in collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim, the US approval of once daily Jentadueto XR; and the favorable German Federal Supreme Court Alimta ruling.","I'd also note that we now have a date, September 7, for the CAFC appeal hearing in our US Alimta patent litigation. Given this timing, we could have a CAFC ruling before the end of the year.","You will also see that we moved the ixekizumab head to head psoriasis trial versus Stelara to the potential Phase III data external disclosures section, as we now hope to present data from this trial at a scientific meeting this year. Also, two events we thought might occur in 2016 are now projected in 2017, the cluster headache readout for galcanezumab, and the Phase III start for our ultra-rapid insulin.","Turning to our 2016 financial guidance on slide 21, is as straightforward a picture as you could possibly have. All GAAP and non-GAAP guide line items, including EPS, remain unchanged from what we communicated on our Q1 earnings call in April.","So in summary, 2016 is shaping up to be another strong year. Excluding FX, we drove revenue growth of 8% this quarter entirely driven by volume, with growing contributions from recently launched products, which this quarter drove 6 of the 8 percentage points of our volume growth. We reduced OpEx as a percent of revenue compared to Q2 last year, and we remain on track for our full year reduction of 200 to 250 basis points.","The strong momentum behind our innovation-based strategy continued, with Taltz being approved in Japan, olaratumab being granted priority review here in the US and the FDA AdCom vote for Jardiance. We also completed early stage deals in oncology to build out possible abemaciclib combinations, and in animal health to bolster our R&D efforts at finding alternatives to traditional antibiotics.","As John mentioned when he kicked off the call, our management team is committed to making steady progress against each of our strategic objectives in the coming years. Our success to date gives us increasing confidence in our ability to make contributions to medical progress, to meet or exceed our minimum midterm financial expectations and to create value for shareholders.","This concludes our prepared remarks. Now I'll turn the call over to Phil to moderate the Q&A session. Phil?","Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations","Great. Thanks, Derica. And for the callers that are in the queue, as we have done on some of the past calls, it would be greatly appreciated if you could limit your questions to two or to a single two-part question so we can get to as many of the callers in the queue as possible. Christy, if you could now go ahead and give the instructions for the Q&A session and then go to the first caller please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And we will go directly to the line of Mark Schoenebaum with Evercore. Please go ahead.","Michael DiFiore - Evercore Group LLC","Hi, guys. This is Mike DiFiore in for Mark Schoenebaum. Congrats on the quarter and thanks so much for taking my call. Just two questions. Sola still remains, like solanezumab still remains top mind amongst investors. So I have a question regarding its MOA and plaque removal. Clearly sola was targeting of monomeric forms of A-beta along with its peripheral sink mechanism clearly differentiates it from BIIB's aducanumab, the theory being that sola can almost potentially act like a BACE inhibitor by preventing the accumulation of plaque versus simply clearing it from the brain. So my question is, if in the event that sola does not hit its functional end point in EXPEDITION-3, but does get FDA approval, can you comment on how it could compete with aducanumab and BACE inhibitors in the marketplace?","And just a totally unrelated question after that, just if you could kindly comment on the disparity between cardiologists and endocrinologists voting ways in the Jardiance AdCom and what that could potentially mean for the label change and treatment guidelines? Thank you.","Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations","Great, Mike. Thanks for the question. So for the first one on solanezumab and if we're in this scenario where we're not hitting on functional but having cognition, how we might compete with other agents that might come through, if, Jan, you want to start off and give some of your comments, and Dave, feel free to complement. And then Enrique, if you can comment on the AdCom vote that was apparently split between cardiologists and endos and what that might mean for labeling in our view.","Jan M. Lundberg - Executive Vice President, Science and Technology, and President, Lilly Research Laboratories","Yeah. And I guess your question targets also then the different mechanists we have across the industry today to influence then the amyloid component of Alzheimer's disease. And as you said, solanezumab then binds monomeric free amyloid-beta, which has the intention then to prevent further buildups of plaque but potentially also then have a peripheral sink effect. And in the EXPEDITION trials, there is now tau, or sorry, amyloid imaging in all patients, which means then we will also be able to follow actually if there is a change in the plaque deposits of amyloid in these patients after long-term solanezumab treatment.","The other antibodies then, aducanumab, are directed more towards the plaque in Alzheimer's patients. And the difference here could be both related potentially then to the clinical effect but also in particular safety, since aducanumab has shown changes then in MRI, suggesting brain edema as one of the components. And I think the early data on cognition, et cetera, for aducanumab clearly was a relatively small trial and needs be confirmed in the longer and larger trial. The BACE inhibitors prevent formation of amyloid then from the precursor protein APP, having better brain penetration but also potentially then a different safety profile which needs be established in larger and longer trials.","So I think it's hard to speculate actually what's going to happen using these three agents. But I think what is clear is that it is very important to include only amyloid-positive patients. It's also very important to start very early in the disease. It's also a key, in my view, to have global studies which involve some highly trained sites that can do these trials. Another aspect of the sola trial is also that we have Tau imaging in a proportion of patients. And as you know, tau is more related to the decline than on particularly the ADAS-Cog, and here we have another way potentially of showing then if there is disease modification. I think I'll leave to Dave to talk about the cognition and functional endpoints and the potential outcomes there.","David A. Ricks - Senior Vice President and President, Lilly Bio-Medicines","Thanks, Jan. Yeah, I think it's early days in terms of understanding mechanisms in Alzheimer's. For sola, as we described in the past, we've moved our primary endpoint to be cognition and then key secondary endpoints, which will have control for Type I error, will be primarily the functional endpoints. I won't rehash why we did that, but I would just reinforce that our base planning scenario is that we achieve both significance on cognition and function, reminding everyone that the pooled mild data, which we're trying to replicate and we've made improvements in the study in seeking to replicate, has statistical significance on both function and cognition in that pooled mild subset. So should we miss on that, look, I think we'll have to talk about that when we get there. Clinicians in my experience are interested in outcomes and they're interested in safety.","And so Jan has covered the safety topic. We know solanezumab is extremely well tolerated by patients. In fact, I can share that now that we have a majority of patients in EXPEDITION 3 rolling off into the open label study, we're seeing a very similar effect from EXPEDITION 1 and 2 in that 95% of patients are electing to continue on therapy or in a blinded way switch to therapy from their placebo. I think that's a very high number for what is a fragile and elderly population, reinforcing the tolerability of the medication. We'll have to wait until December to see the results and fully answer your question.","Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations","Great. Enrique?","Enrique A. Conterno - Senior Vice President and President, Lilly Diabetes","Sure. So on the Jardiance AdCom, we had a positive 12 to 11 vote that we had substantial evidence to reduce the incidents of cardiovascular death in patients with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease. If I recall the vote, the five practicing cardiologists voted in favor. And they were, excluding pediatric endocrinology, there were five endocrinologists in the panel and they voted three against and two in favor. I think it's difficult to try to assign a particular view of whether it's cardiologists or endocrinologist based on the vote of 10 people. What I would say is we were very pleased with the overall discussion. We thought it was robust and we believe that the right discussion happened. And for that reason we feel optimistic that we have a really good chance of getting an indication come late Q3, early Q4.","Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations","Great. Thank you, Enrique. Christy, if we can go to the next caller please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Seamus Fernandez with Leerink. Please go ahead.","Seamus Fernandez - Leerink Partners LLC","Thanks for the questions. So just a couple of quick ones here. So can you guys update us on what's assumed for sola and the Jardiance indication in the minimum top line guidance?","The second question, and this is a little bit a couple of sort of sub parts here so I apologize. But can you just remind us again the assumed timing for the interim look for abemaciclib in the MONARCH 2 study? Can you tell us whether this will be at 50%, 60% or 70% to 75% of events? And then lastly, on the same abemaciclib topic, just when we compare across the MONARCH 2 study and the PALOMA-3 study for Pfizer's palbociclib, can you just help us understand what might be the differences between those studies that would have the control arm performed differently? Thanks.","Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations","Great. Seamus, thank you for the questions. Derica, if you'll take the first question that was posed on what's included in the revenue guidance with relation to solanezumab and Jardiance. And then, Sue, if you can comment on Seamus' questions for abemaciclib specific on MONARCH 2.","Derica W. Rice - Executive Vice President, Global Services & Chief Financial Officer","Good morning, Seamus. In regards to the minimum financial or revenue guidance that we put out there, let me state this again. We expect that we can achieve at least 5% revenue growth on average between now and the end of the decade. And of course, as we looked at that, we considered a number of different scenarios including the downside of if we were unsuccessful with solanezumab. And clearly if we are successful and we also see scenarios where we could be higher than the 5%. So we feel very good about our ability to at least achieve the 5% through the end of the decade. What it does not include, as we noted in our upfront remarks, is that any significant pricing action in the US in terms of legislative impact such as rebates and Medicare Part D. It also includes that we will maintain our IP for Alimta in the US.","Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations","Great. Thanks, Derica. Sue?","Susan Mahony - Senior Vice President and President, Lilly Oncology","Yeah. Okay. So with regards to abemaciclib, we should be getting the interim data on MONARCH 2 soon. And as we have said previously, our intent is to submit MONARCH 1 as early at the end of this quarter once we've seen the MONARCH 2 data. We do plan to issue a press release once the interim has happened. As a reminder on that, we have a high bar. The data we're looking at will be PFS, and the data monitoring committee, the independent data monitoring committee will look at that data and then advise us accordingly. And we have not given data with regards to the cutoff, and so we will not do that.","And then with regards to the differences, there are some differences in populations with regards to having prior chemotherapy and also first line and second line patients. So I think it's fair to say that we'll have to wait and see what the control arm looks like in the MONARCH 2 data.","Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations","Great. Thank you, Sue. Christy, if we can go to the next caller please.","Operator","Thank you. We'll now go to Gregg Gilbert with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yes, hi. John, how would you handicap the likelihood of Part D rebates between now and 2020? Then my follow-up is for Jeff. Perhaps you could talk about what a normalized run rate quarter would have been without the wholesaler buying patterns? And what did you have to impair that you acquired? Thanks.","John C. Lechleiter - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay, Gregg, I think the likelihood of Part D, you said Part D rebates. But I guess the extreme would be the repeal of the noninterference clause. And then there's a lot of scenarios in between, for example, moving the LSI patients or the duals to more of a Medicaid type system. I think the likelihood is low, quite honestly. I think that Part D is a rare example of a government program that comes in exceeding expectations at a cost of hundreds of billions of dollars less than had been forecast at the beginning. The Congressional Budget Office has several times stated that if price controls are placed into Part D, the only way the government would save money in that event is to restrict access to drugs on the formulary. Today most seniors have access through the private plans to the whole formulary, and that's why senior satisfaction rates are so high. That doesn't sound like something a politician would want to mess with.","Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations","Great. Thanks, John. Jeff?","Jeffrey N. Simmons - Senior Vice President and President, Elanco Animal Health","Yeah, Gregg, on the animal health side, we had a major SAP cut-over in the US business. So that did move about $20 million of impact into Q2. So we see when we normalize it, Q2 revenues grew at 2% year over year. And if you look at year to date, we would normalize our 4% sales growth to 3%, 3% when you take out that. And then we've seen very strong as highlighted in the results, again we've seen very strong EBIT growth of 19% year to date as well. So again we're seeing the value and the integration of Novartis come through as we had talked about in the December Investor Day.","Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations","And Gregg, this is Phil. I'll follow up after the call. I'm not aware of anything that we impaired in the quarter that we had acquired. We did have some charges in the quarter that were related to integration and severance costs for the Novartis Animal Health acquisition, but nothing else to my knowledge. So I'll follow up and see what, if there was something else I missed that you were referring to.","Christy, if we can go to the next caller, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Tim Anderson with Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Timothy Minton Anderson - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you. A few questions. Just to clarity on the guidance on sola. Are you saying that if sola was a zero and completely failed, that your revenue guidance would remain intact? Just a clarification question on that.","And then two other questions. On Portrazza, I think I heard you say that uptake has slowed because of PD-1 usage in first-line lung. I'd be surprised if that was happening because there's no published results. There's no compendia listing and that sort of thing. So did I hear that incorrectly?","And then Jardiance, naturally your product will be the only one with cardiovascular outcome data in the label in 2016 and 2017. Do you think that will lead to significant formulary coverage shifts in favor of your product in 2017? Or could that be viewed as a class effect by payers and P&T committees, and you could find incumbent products, like Invokana actually keeping a good portion of their formulary positioning?","Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations","Hey, Tim. Thanks for the question. So, Derica, if you will handle the first question related to the revenue guidance; Sue, on what we're seeing in first-line squamous non-small cell lung cancer for IO uptake, and then, Enrique, to you for the Jardiance question.","Derica W. Rice - Executive Vice President, Global Services & Chief Financial Officer","Tim, good morning. The short answer to your question is, yes. Even in a scenario where sola is a zero, we still believe we can keep a minimum of 5% average revenue growth between now and the end of the decade. Now recall, we've always been saying that when we looked at our future growth prospects for Lilly, we were never reliant on a single asset. The real thesis behind Lilly is that we've been building this broad portfolio. And the fact that we had the opportunity to launch multiple new molecules, we believe 20 in 10 years, is what gives us confidence that we've got the substrate to support that revenue guidance that we put out there.","Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations","Thanks. Sue?","Susan Mahony - Senior Vice President and President, Lilly Oncology","Yeah, Tim, you did hear correctly. There is no data yet in first-line squamous non-small cell lung cancer. And yet, we are seeing quite significant use with over 20% share of market in the first-line setting of PD-1 inhibitors, mainly Opdivo. That's impacting most products in that marketplace, including the uptake on Portrazza.","Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations","Great. Enrique?","Enrique A. Conterno - Senior Vice President and President, Lilly Diabetes","Sure. There is no question that a new label with an indication for a reduction on the CV, or the incidence of cardiovascular death will be very significant from a payer perspective. Now in this particular case, we already have excellent coverage and access. We are at 85% plus when it comes to commercial and above 70% in Part D. So our access is very good, and it can only get stronger once we get the label.","Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations","Thanks, Enrique. Christy, next caller please?","Operator","Next we have John Boris with SunTrust. Please go ahead. Your line's open.","John T. Boris - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thanks for taking the questions and congratulations on the results. On your slide 20, you indicated that you still have solanezumab, the prodromal Alzheimer's trial on track for rollout. Can you help us understand how you're thinking through the endpoints for that trial, how the FDA draft guidance potentially shapes that? And are you going to ask the FDA or have them review it under an SPA?","And then second question on Jardiance. Obviously, you have one positive trial in EMPA-REG coming out favorable. Can you give some commentary on the design of your heart failure trials and how you think those trials might be able to capture data that could help with additional build-out of your label on Jardiance? And then lastly, just on galcanezumab, what actually contributed to the delay in migraine?","Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations","All right, John. Thank you for the questions. So Dave, if you want to comment on the solanezumab prodromal question, and I guess is galcanezumab also potentially faulty as far as what led to the delay. Do you want to comment on that? And then John, you can fill in. And then, Enrique, if you'll comment on the heart failure trial and how that might help to expand the labeled indications for Jardiance.","David A. Ricks - Senior Vice President and President, Lilly Bio-Medicines","Okay. Yeah. So for the sola prodromal study, we're anticipating enrolling patients very soon. As we said in our December 8 investor conference on Alzheimer's, we fully expect to get that study up and running this year and sort of rolling into the EXPEDITION 3 rollout, have that underway.","In terms of primary outcome, we've disclosed that, which is going to be cognition is the primary endpoint, with key secondary endpoints of function. Just like EXPEDITION 3. I think the general logic here is that the earlier you go in disease, the less meaningful functional changes are and frankly, the more difficult they are to detect. So moving from a mild-only study like EXPEDITION 3 to the prodromal, that's entirely logical. By the way, we've also made those changes in the BACE inhibitor programs in partnership with AZ.","Your second question, just to be clear, John, we've not announced a delay in the galcanezumab migraine program but rather the cluster headache program. This was a kind of quasi-orphan speed play we announced in parallel with the migraine start. One of those studies, although enrolling well, requires episodic cluster episodes to begin before we place patients on medication. We had to predict the rate at which patients would have episodic cluster headaches. I think we estimated too high, so we're waiting for people to have those episodes before we can begin treatment, and that's slowing down that particular study, although the chronic cluster study is on track time-wise. So we'll have to make some decisions as we get closer to the end of the chronic cluster study about submission and labeling, et cetera. But the migraine study's on track time-wise, just to be clear.","Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations","Perfect. Thank you, Dave. Enrique?","Enrique A. Conterno - Senior Vice President and President, Lilly Diabetes","John, we are not in a position right now to disclose the specific design for our heart failure trials. Just to remind everyone, we will be conducting two trials, one for reduced ejection fraction and one for preserved ejection fraction. We expect the first of those trials to start still this year and also to note that we are studying that in people with and people without diabetes. So clearly, we will be seeking an indication when it comes to heart failure with those trials.","Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations","Christy, next caller please?","Operator","Thank you. We'll now move to Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Chris Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks for the questions. First one for maybe John or Derica. Can you just elaborate on some of your comments about increased pricing pressures in the US through 2020 that's reflected in the 5% minimum target? I guess how are you thinking about pricing dynamics for the next few years? Do you see the industry with less pricing power? Do you see more volume driving growth? Just any color there would be great.","Second question is on 2017, just pricing and kind of coverage outlooks. Any major shifts in coverage we should be thinking about as we think out towards next year? And maybe specifically on diabetes, anything we should be keeping in mind there in terms of either coverage or pricing as you've been talking to payers about the 2017 season? Thanks.","Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations","Great. Thanks, Chris. So Derica, if you want to take the first one. And then for the second one, Chris, I'd just say as a preamble, typically we comment on access much later in the year, closer to the new plan year and oftentimes need to wait to say anything until the payers themselves have announced these. But I will leave it open to any of the three, our therapeutic business unit presidents, if you want to give any general comments on what you might be seeing or expecting in trends. Derica?","Derica W. Rice - Executive Vice President, Global Services & Chief Financial Officer","Sure. Hi, Chris. When we talk about increased pricing pressure, if you look at the trends that we're seeing, one, we're seeing a decline or a decay in the net price benefit that we're receiving on kind of annual basis. And when we look to the environment going forward, we are also seeing an environment where we're seeing increased rebating or discounting going on. We've experienced that in our diabetes business, and we know that we're looking to going into some highly competitive spaces in terms of some of our new product launches. So our focus has been on driving volume-driven revenue growth, and that really gets to the clinical differentiated profile of our new products that we are in the midst of launching and that's where we've centered our attention. So that's really the thesis behind our comment as it relates to increased pricing pressures.","Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations","Great thanks. Enrique? Dave? Sue? Any comments on access, or does that cover it?","Enrique A. Conterno - Senior Vice President and President, Lilly Diabetes","You said it well, Phil. I think it's premature right now to discuss that.","Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations","Okay. Great. Thanks. Christy, next caller please?","Operator","Next we have David Risinger with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks very much. I have two questions. First, could you just explain why the MONARCH 1 filing is pending interim MONARCH 2 data? And then second, regarding the increased US price pressure that you expect later this decade than you're currently experiencing, Derica, could you just remind us how you report US pricing trends year over year with respect to factoring in drugs going generic? As I understand it, when a drug goes generic, even though Lilly doesn't reduce the list price of the drug, there's a negative impact on the calculation of net pricing that you report. And maybe you could tie in how the pending patent expirations of Cialis and Forteo will thus play into that greater price pressure this decade than you're currently experiencing. Thank you.","Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations","Great, Dave. Thank you for the questions. Sue, if you'd take the MONARCH 1 filing question, and then Derica, the pricing question.","Susan Mahony - Senior Vice President and President, Lilly Oncology","Yeah, Dave, with regards to the MONARCH 1 data, as a reminder, this is a single arm study looking at single agent abemaciclib. Given the close proximity of the MONARCH 2 interim, we announced after ASCO and on our last call that our plan would be that we would submit the MONARCH 2 data, sorry, submit the 1 data once we'd seen the interim of MONARCH 2. And we're anticipating seeing that soon, and therefore we'd be submitting MONARCH 1 as early as this quarter.","Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations","Great. Derica?","Derica W. Rice - Executive Vice President, Global Services & Chief Financial Officer","Hi, Dave. In regards to just more color on the pricing pressure and our thinking going forward, just recall if we look at our LOE products or our brands that are going off patent, we have a distinction between our original brand versus the branded generics that we have historically potentially launched into the market such as we did with Zyprexa. When you looked at our PRV slide that's captured in our call materials, that is the true realized pricing effect that we're seeing rolling across our business. So you should expect on a go-forward basis that it will still be on that same apples to apples.","When you then think about the future patent expirations of Cialis and Strattera and brands like that, you will see it also parceled in the same manner. So when we again look at our business, and I think that's pretty much reflected in the results you saw here in the second quarter, even in the midst of launching, we're focused on driving a volume-driven growth profile. And the fact that we could achieve 8% volume growth this quarter and really relatively no price benefit really speaks to our commentary around increased pricing pressures going forward.","Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations","One thing real quick, Dave. As you think about this, it is true that a number of years ago when we would have had, for example, an authorized generic, and we would have shipped out a very large amount of product in a given quarter, we would have only recognized the relatively modest sales price for that product that was shipped, not the potential share that we would have gotten in the revenues once the product was sold. That led to significant negative price impact at the time we would ship that product and we'd actually recognize the revenue later. With no units against it, it would lead to a very large price increase. It really had nothing do with price increases.","What Derica's mentioned is, for a while now we've been treating our brand and an authorized generic as totally separate products, so you no longer have those aberrations in your net price calculation. And it will be a true underlying price change as Derica just mentioned. Hopefully that helps give you some context for what you might have seen in the past and what you have seen recently and will see going forward.","David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations","You're welcome. Christy, next caller please.","Operator","Next we'll go to Vamil Divan with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Vamil K. Divan - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Great. Thanks so much for taking the questions and for the commentary on the long-term guidance. So just a couple questions if I could. One just to follow up. I'm sorry if I missed this on the last question that Dave asked. But just, I still don't fully get why the interim for MONARCH 2 impacts the mission. You may have mentioned it before. But I'm sorry if I missed it just when you were commenting to Dave's question. But can you explain why it's exactly tied to that? Why wouldn't you just submit when you're ready to submit? And then if the FDA ever wanted to see that data during the review process, they could obviously ask for it and see it then.","But my questions were actually, one was just on Jardiance. You mentioned that the year over year growth for that class is a little less than what you had expected. Can you just comment on that in terms of why you think that is? Is it some of these safety concerns we're seeing kind of across the class, or anything else that's maybe keeping that growth a little bit below where you were expecting?","And then my second one was just on Taltz. I know it's still relatively early days, but if you could just give a little more color on the feedback you're getting from physicians on that product specifically relative to Cosentyx, and then on the data we should expect later this year versus secukinumab? I assume the goal of that study is to show superiority. Can you just confirm that that is the case? Thanks.","Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations","Great, Vamil. Thanks for the questions. I'm going to flip it up on our group here. I'm going to go in reverse order. So Dave, if you'd like to go ahead and handle, and with your team if you want to involve who we've got in the room here, feedback we're hearing on the launch versus Cosentyx and the head to head for Stelara later this year.","Enrique, if you'll comment on the year on year growth for the overall (63:59) class and whether it'll be differing than our expectations. And then Sue, for the timing of submission relative to the MONARCH 2 interims.","David A. Ricks - Senior Vice President and President, Lilly Bio-Medicines","Yeah, thanks, Vamil. I'll take the first part of this on Taltz and Alex Azar, my colleague who runs the US will answer the second part on what he's seeing in the early uptake. The head to head against Stelara which will read out by the end of the year is fully powered for superiority on all the standard psoriasis metrics. And this is an important study in particular for O-US access. Alex, you want to comment on what you're hearing from physicians?","Alex M. Azar II - President, Lilly USA LLC, Eli Lilly & Co.","Yeah. You bet. Thanks, Dave. As you mentioned, it's still very early, especially with a specialty biologic like this in terms of the data flows and information that we would get. But thus far, we're very pleased with the initial performance of Taltz. If you look, for instance, at the IMF's New to Brand NPA, just dermatology specialty focused data, we're bouncing around right at the Enbrel, New to Brand level. We're closing in very closely on the Cosentyx New to Brand among derms there.","Revenue in the second quarter totaled $19 million. A portion of that was wholesale stocking in there. But as I mentioned, with a specialty product going through specialty pharmacy channels, it'll take a while before we get really complete data there. So I just want to caution that we can look at IMS a bit, but really it's going to be when we see the actual script-level data coming through the specialty pharmacy data flows that we'll have much more clarity.","The feedback from physicians has been very positive. We're just hearing wonderful things anecdotally about their experiences with it with their patients, in terms of their interactions with us. We think Taltz has a very attractive value proposition to our patients, to our physicians, to our payers. Including our Taltz savings card, which I think is a really important thing for folks to know about is, with this Taltz savings card that we've got out there, the patients will pay as little as $5 a month if they're commercially insured and covered by their insurance.","If they're commercially insured and are not covered by their insurance and have filed a script, have that denied and filed an appeal and had it denied, they will pay no more than $25 a month. This really removes a prescribing burden and hurdle for the physician, for the patient and the doctor's office in getting people initiated on the medicine. So right now everything seems to be positive from the experience but in a wait and see mode. Thank you.","Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations","Thanks a lot. Dave, any comment on the head-to-head versus (66:26).","David A. Ricks - Senior Vice President and President, Lilly Bio-Medicines","I did. I covered that already.","Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations","I'm sorry. Enrique?","Enrique A. Conterno - Senior Vice President and President, Lilly Diabetes","Very good. So we've had over the last year or so a number of strength in warnings or new warnings when it comes to products in the issued P2 class starting with the DKA which was a warning that was added across the class. And then we've more recently have had two strengthened warnings that have not covered Jardiance. These covered other products, not Jardiance. One, when it comes to bone fractures specific to canagliflozin and then a strengthened warning on acute kidney injury that covers both dapa and canagliflozin.","All of these warnings or strengthened warnings come. We saw that counterbalance where today we cannot, we're unable to promote our CV data until we basically get our label updated. So we continue to feel the benefit risk profile of the class is very strong, but that of Jardiance in particular given that our data basically speaks for itself when it comes to some of these safety assessments. And then also the benefit when it comes to CV.","When we look at the class in general, the class is growing year-to-date over 30% and one can say that seems like a very good growth. But when we look a little more closely at the new patient starts and the growth of that, we basically see that completely flattening. And for that reason, we are a bit concerned and we are hopeful and optimistic that once we get both the new indication and new treatment guideline, that we will see a significant inflection. Jardiance needs to be the catalyst for the overgrowth of the class.","Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations","Thanks, Enrique. Sue?","Susan Mahony - Senior Vice President and President, Lilly Oncology","Yeah. With regards to the MONARCH 1 submission, there really isn't that much more to say. We've made the decision that given the proximity of the MONARCH 2 interim, we'll wait for the MONARCH 2 interim. We believe that this is the fastest way of getting this medicine to patients. And also given the breakthrough therapy designation that we've got on MONARCH 1, obviously we will continue to have discussions with the FDA.","Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations","Thanks, Sue.","Vamil K. Divan - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thanks.","Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations","Christy, if we can go to the next caller please.","Operator","We'll now move to Steve Scala with Cowen. Please go ahead.","Steve Scala - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you. I have a couple questions. The long-term guidance is very reassuring, but I'm wondering why it was given at this time. What perspective does Lilly have now that it didn't have at for instance your Analyst Meeting in May? Is it product related, is it industry related or is it something else? And then secondly for Jan in Alzheimer's, preclinical data suggests PD-L1 blocking could have a benefit in Alzheimer's disease. Does Lilly have any plans to explore this area? And what dose of solanezumab is being used in the prodromal trial? Thank you.","Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations","Great. Steve, thank you for the questions. We'll have Derica take the first and if, Jan, if you'll take the second question or set of questions on Alzheimer's disease. Derica?","Derica W. Rice - Executive Vice President, Global Services & Chief Financial Officer","Hi, Steve. Really, our discussion on our longer-term guidance today is really just kind of the natural next step in progression or discussions that we've been having with the investment community. Recall that back in December, we began to do a more in-depth look at our R&D prospects. We started with a deep dive on our Alzheimer's platforms as well as our animal health business. We were able to then follow that up in May with a deep dive discussion on the other four therapeutic, human pharma four therapeutic areas.","And based upon the substrate we talked about, and we shared there about the potential of 20 launches in 10 years as well as combined with our market guidance, is really what's supporting our extended discussion here today about those other items that could be affected, positively in this case, by the data points we've shared in our previous discussion. So for us it's really just a continuation of the dialogue that we've been having. And again, as we see more in our business prospects, we will share more with you going forward as well.","Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations","Steve, this is Phil. Just real quick before turning over to Jan. I think we've discussed in the past having some of these days that are not the soup to nuts Lilly commercial update, R&D update, financial update is really intended to ensure that we can spend quality time talking with investors and potential investors as well as the analyst community about specific parts of our business. And we do think we achieved that both in December and in May by having that really focused on those topics and not having a particular discussion about financials at that point in time. Jan?","Jan M. Lundberg - Executive Vice President, Science and Technology, and President, Lilly Research Laboratories","Yeah, well the whole area of immunology and the importance for Alzheimer's disease is one of our recent interests in research. And I mean just to remind you, we already have a molecule in the clinic that actually most likely reduces plaques at least, and in animal models via microglia activation, the N3pG molecule, where actually we will report some data tomorrow in Toronto from the initial early studies in the clinic. We're also have an interest in other mediators then of immune activation, and I think you will see us test new then immune activating agents in various animal models initially.","David A. Ricks - Senior Vice President and President, Lilly Bio-Medicines","400 milligrams once a month. Same dose in prodromal as in the mild Alzheimer's study.","Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations","Great. Thanks, Dave. Christy, next caller please?","Operator","Thank you. We'll now move to Andrew Baum with Citi. Please go ahead.","Andrew S. Baum - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","Thank you. Two questions please. First, could you outline your marketing plans for Jardiance assuming you get approval with the cardiovascular indication added? Expressly, are you building out your cardiovascular sales force or bolstering your primary care sales force for the product? And then second, could you remind us of the prophylactic use of loperamide? Was that included within the trial protocol for the individual abemaciclib program? And are you including it for any future ongoing trials given the GI diarrhea adverse event which has been characterized by the trials to date? Thank you.","Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations","Great. Thank you, Andrew. So Enrique, we'll go to you for the first question on what we're doing with regard to cardiovascular and primary care sales reps to support Jardiance going forward, and then Sue on the use of loperamide.","Enrique A. Conterno - Senior Vice President and President, Lilly Diabetes","Clearly we view this as a very significant opportunity, so we're going to be fully resourced. And that basically means making all of the proper investments when it comes to ensuring that we have the right reach for both primary care, cardiologists, endocrinologists. So yes, we have a very robust plan together with our partner Boehringer Ingelheim.","Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations","Great. Thanks, Enrique. Sue?","Susan Mahony - Senior Vice President and President, Lilly Oncology","Yeah, with regards to the diarrhea, no. We didn't have a prophylaxis loperamide in our studies. We have one study, our neoMONARCH, which is our neoadjuvant study that we have looked at that. We should have a report out of that this year. But in our MONARCH 1, 2 and 3 studies, we did not require prophylaxis, and as a reminder in our MONARCH 1, the diarrhea was manageable with over-the-counter loperamide as needed and only one patient discontinued due to diarrhea.","Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations","Thanks, Sue. Christy, next caller please?","Operator","We'll now go to Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Enrique, just a question for you, again back on Jardiance. Would you be satisfied if the CV data were included in the label but without the CV indication per se? And can you describe the guidelines process and the importance of updated guidelines and specifically what you need to see in order to see that obviously important inflection point with Jardiance? And then secondly, Sue, for you, when do you plan to file on MONARCH 2? Thanks.","Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations","Great, Jami. Thanks for the questions. So first to Enrique and then Sue.","Enrique A. Conterno - Senior Vice President and President, Lilly Diabetes","Sure, so on the CV indication, first, we do feel optimistic. Now you asked me I would be satisfied. I will be honest. No. I would not be satisfied. We will make it work, but my view is that we basically have the appropriate data to be able to obtain a new indication when it comes to the reduction in the incidence of CV deaths on that specific population. I don't recall the second part of the question.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","The second part related to guidelines. Guidelines. And the importance of guidelines.","Enrique A. Conterno - Senior Vice President and President, Lilly Diabetes","They are also very important. But clearly the way we view it is, in particular in the US, we view the FDA action date coming before basically new treatment guidelines. We could have new treatment guidelines in the US sometime early next year.","Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations","Great. Thanks.","Susan Mahony - Senior Vice President and President, Lilly Oncology","Yeah, Jami, with regard to MONARCH 2, clearly it would depend on the data and if the interim data is positive, we would plan to discuss that with regulatory authorities and plan to submit it as soon as we could.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you.","Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations","Sue. Christy, next caller please.","Operator","Next we have Tony Butler with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.","Tony Butler - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Yes. Thank you. Just one brief product related or pipeline related question. I wanted to go back to CGRP, and less in cluster headache, but perhaps in overall migraine, as REGAIN and the EVOLVE studies are underway, there are other programs from other competitors which are moving forward as well. And I was just curious, Dave or Jan, if you could just provide some clarity on the advantages that Lilly's program or antibody may have versus those of other programs, and whether you think you could be first to market. Or if you're second to market, what in fact might be the attributes that your product may have over that which is first to market? Thanks very much.","Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations","Thanks, Tony. Dave?","David A. Ricks - Senior Vice President and President, Lilly Bio-Medicines","Sure, yeah. Thanks, Tony. Well, we're excited about the galcanezumab program, which is the new name for a CGRP antibody. Putting aside the cluster, which again is a possibility to get to market earlier, although we have as was mentioned earlier, a slowdown in the episodic cluster study. As it relates to migraine, we remain excited about the profile. It is very competitive, as you mentioned. There's at least three players kind of neck and neck from our read. Execution and enrollment and getting the studies complete is important.","You'll see on clintrials.gov, we've actually closed the submission gating study, the critical path study which was the long-term safety study already. So that puts us on a good path to remain on track. Ultimately, I think the product profile will need to achieve the maximum effect possible via this mechanism, with the minimally intrusive administration for patients. This will be a product used by healthy people in primary care offices, in everyday neurologists. Simple injection and dosing protocols coupled with very strong effect will win. That sounds kind of boilerplate. But I think we're testing a couple different dosing setups. Others are testing different ones. We'll just have to see who can produce the best numbers with the minimum doses. And I think that's what we'll be looking for as we read out the data sometime late next year.","Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations","Thanks, Dave.","Jan M. Lundberg - Executive Vice President, Science and Technology, and President, Lilly Research Laboratories","Yeah, a small addition here is that the Amgen antibodies are against the CGRP receptor, whilst the other antibodies bind the free CGRP peptide. And also the older antibodies, intravenous, the Teva and Lilly and Amgen are subcutaneous injection.","Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations","Great. Thank you, Jan. Christy, if can we go to the next caller, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Arfaei with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Alex Arfaei - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Good morning, folks, and thank you for taking the questions. First for John and Derica, a follow-up regarding your long-term guidance. It is obviously reassuring but not really surprising, given that you're coming from a lower base following patent expirations and launching a number of new products. So would you be willing to provide more color regarding the different scenarios that you mentioned earlier? And the follow-up, can you comment on the approximate magnitude of dividend increases that you're committing to, and is there a specific payout ratio target that you have? Thank you.","Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations","Alex, thank you for the questions. John, if you want to go ahead and take the first question and Derica the second.","John C. Lechleiter - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I think, Alex, the long-term guidance contemplates obviously a number of scenarios. We have products like baricitinib that are under regulatory review, abemaciclib, which is headed that way, products that's still in the pipeline, the sola readout later this year. So there's still some, I guess, some big unknowns up ahead, coupled with the sure patent losses that we're going to experience with products like Cialis and Strattera, for example.","So while there's still a lot of moving parts, I think similar to sort of the guidance we provided back in late 2009, we were entering this patent expiration period. We wanted to provide some floor, some minimum set of expectations for investors, recognizing that there are scenarios that could take that above that floor. Now, we did call out the fact that this does not contemplate major changes in government reimbursement policy. It does contemplate Alimta continuing to be patent protected in the US through the early 2020s.","So with those caveats, I think that we feel very comfortable providing that as a framework for investors thinking about Lilly in the next five years with all these potential scenarios, a number of which could provide upside above this number and then coupled with the guidance we've given about not only our operating, our OpEx to sales, but this morning reaffirming our belief that we could also improve our gross margin as a percentage of sales over this period as well.","Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations","Thanks, John. Derica?","Derica W. Rice - Executive Vice President, Global Services & Chief Financial Officer","Alex, in regard to the magnitude of dividend increases, we're not prepared to provide any commentary on that here today. We've increased our dividend over the last two years. One could think, well, why the commentary if we're already kind of on that glide path. Well, while we've done that, we've never committed to going forward each year that we would increase our dividend. So we wanted to be more clear about that today and to set that expectation.","Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations","Yeah, I think it's probably safe to assume that you will see over time some decrease in the payout ratios since we had that spike at pretty high levels. We went through the patent expiration period. But as Derica mentioned, we can't be more specific than we'll have a slightly lower dividend increase, probably the net income increase to bring that down somewhat. Stay tuned for more as we go forward. We can go to the next caller please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Colin Bristow with BoA Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Colin N. Bristow - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good morning, and thanks for taking the questions. Just a few quick ones. So on Jardiance, the 2Q sales looked a little light versus what was implied from scripts. If you could give any more color around the impact of discounting, rebating and inventory buildup, be helpful.","And second on the Trulicity REWIND trial, can you remind us if it is just a futility look or is there potential for early stoppage? And if the latter, how should we be thinking about this, given the outcome of Novo's LEADER study, and the fact that I believe you're approaching a similar duration of treatment? And then just finally on solanezumab, can you just confirm we should still expect a top line update before year end? Thanks.","Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations","Great, Colin. Thank you for the questions. We'll go to Enrique for the Jardiance and Trulicity questions and then to Dave for the solanezumab confirmation.","Enrique A. Conterno - Senior Vice President and President, Lilly Diabetes","Yeah. So on Jardiance, you are right. If you look at the scripts and sequential script growth, it will have implied higher revenues. There are two things that are weighing down on Jardiance. One of them, we've had some gross to net adjustments during the periods that were from prior periods, and second we also saw much higher utilization on our copay cards. We recently have changed the design of our copay card so it's less generous than it used to be. But that takes a little bit of time to basically wash out. So we should expect an improving picture when it comes to that.","In terms of Trulicity, we do have an interim later this year. Clearly we've all seen the LEADER data. Probably the best way to think about the interim for Trulicity, but if we were to expect a similar, were to observe a similar hazard ratio versus what LEADER showed, we would not stop the trial. So given that we're going to have a significantly less number of events than basically Novo had at the conclusion of their own trial, now we are confident on the profile of the product and now we just really need to wait for the interim. But we'll either stop or we will \u2013 if we stop we will know; if we continue to with the trial clearly we will have to wait.","Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations","Great. Thanks, Enrique. Dave?","David A. Ricks - Senior Vice President and President, Lilly Bio-Medicines","Yeah, so on sola, we continue to expect top line as we announced I think in the Q1 call, we've completed enrollment on time and we're just waiting for the last patient visit. There are some variability around that but it's measured in weeks. So we expect to have a top line by end of year.","Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations","Great. Thank you. I know we have a number of callers still left in the queue. We're going to try and shoehorn in one more and then I apologize to those who won't have had a chance to ask a question. We will definitely call you back when we get back to our desks. So, Christy, if we can go to the last caller before we have John wrap up the call.","Operator","Thank you. And due to time constraints our last question will come from Marc Goodman with UBS. Please go ahead.","Marc Goodman - UBS Securities LLC","Yes, morning. First on the gross margin comments, can you give us a sense of the push and pulls over the course of the decade where some of the products that have higher gross margin that'll be bringing it up and what'll be bringing it down? And then on abema, can you talk about what are you waiting for before starting the early breast cancer studies? Thanks.","Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations","Great, Marc. Thank you for the questions. So Derica, if you'll handle the gross margin question, and to Sue for the early stage plans for abema.","Derica W. Rice - Executive Vice President, Global Services & Chief Financial Officer","Hi, Marc. In regards to gross margins, clearly when we endured the impact of the loss of many of our biggest products, but at the same time they were also small molecule. So at the gross margin line they were very highly profitable. These are products like Cymbalta, Zyprexa and Evista. Then as those products expired, those revenues were replaced with insulins becoming our biggest brands in franchise in Lilly at the moment, which obviously is coming with a lower gross margin or lower profitability. And that's where you've seen the decline in our gross margin rate over the this YZ period.","Going forward, it's really going be dependent on the nature of the molecules and which ones are launching at what time. So if you look at products like Jardiance, we booked our portion of the income so it actually has a boost to our gross margin as a percent relative to our base. Likewise, when you look at the opposite, you've got baricitinib which we own, but we have a pretty high royalty rate that we also pay in the high 20s. So the mix effect is really what's going to drive or have a significant impact on what that gross margin profile looks like over time. However in aggregate, when we look at all the pushes and pulls, we still feel very confident that in total our gross margin will improve between now and the end of the decade.","Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations","Great. Thanks, Derica. Sue?","Susan Mahony - Senior Vice President and President, Lilly Oncology","Yeah, with regards to the early phase breast cancer plans, as a reminder, we do have the neoMONARCH study ongoing which we plan to read out yet this year. And other plans will be informed by the data coming out.","Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations","Thank you, Sue. John, can you close the call please?","John C. Lechleiter - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Thanks, Phil. We appreciate everyone's participation in today's earnings call and your interest in our company. We continue to be pleased with the success we've had implementing our innovation-based strategy, and we're excited by the potential we have to make life better for people around the world and to provide substantial returns to our shareholders. Hopefully, the additional clarity we provided on our midterm financial expectations is helpful as you consider our future prospects. As always, we look forward to keeping you appraised of our progress.","Also, this is the last earnings call for Ilissa Rassner, and I'd like to thank her personally for her considerable contribution to our IR efforts over the past four and a half years, and to wish Ilissa luck in her new role here at Lilly.

Replay information will be given out at the conclusion of the conference. ","Your hosting speaker, Dave Ricks. Please go ahead, sir.","Dave Ricks","Good morning. Thank you for joining us for Eli Lilly and Company\u2019s Q2 2018 earnings call. I\u2019m Dave Ricks, Lilly\u2019s Chairman and CEO. Joining me on today\u2019s call are Josh Smiley, our Chief Financial Officer; Dr. Dan Skovronsky, President of Lilly Research Labs; Enrique Conterno, President of Lilly Diabetes and Lilly USA; Dr. Sue Mahony, President of Lilly Oncology; Jeff Simmons, President of Elanco Animal Health, and unfortunately Christi Shaw, our President of Lilly Bio-Medicines is ill and won\u2019t be joining us today.","We\u2019re also joined by Kristina Wright, Jim Heaney, Kevin Hern and Phil Johnson of the IR team. This will be the last earnings call for Sue Mahony, President of Lilly Oncology who will retire at the end of August. Sue led Lilly Oncology through the integration of ImClone, successfully launched several key brands, including most recently Verzenio; and has now refocused our Oncology R&D strategy. I want to thank Sue for her leadership over the past 18 years at the company and for her inspiring passion for helping patients. Please join me at a round of applause for Sue.","During this call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially, due to a number of factors, including those listed on Slide 3 and those outlined in our latest Forms 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC. The information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It is not intended to be promotional and it is not sufficient for prescribing decisions.","We continue the strong start to 2018 with the second quarter revenue growth of 9%, non-GAAP operating income growth of 28%, and non-GAAP EPS growth of 35%. New pharmaceutical products continue to be the driver of our worldwide revenue growth, led by Trulicity, Basaglar, Taltz, and Verzenio.","New product growth more than offset revenue declines resulting from the loss of exclusivity on a number of our established products. We continue to expand margins this quarter. Excluding the effect of FX, on international inventories sold, non-GAAP gross margin as a percent of revenue increased by 130 basis points over Q2 2017, and non-GAAP operating income, as a percent of revenue increased by nearly 600 basis points to 30.6%.","We made significant progress with the pipeline, including the approval and launch of Olumiant in the U.S. FDA and EMA submissions of Nasal Glucagon, as well as positive Phase 3 read-outs for galcanezumab and episodic cluster headache, Taltz and ankylosing spondylitis, also known as radiographic axSpA and tanezumab in OA pain in collaboration with Pfizer.","In terms of capital deployment, we completed the acquisition of ARMO BioSciences, which added pegilodecakin to our Phase 3 portfolio. We returned nearly $600 million via the dividend. And we repurchased $950 million of stock, which completed our previous $5 million share repurchase program. And we authorized a new $8 billion share repurchase program. And as reflected in the press release, we released this morning, we concluded the review of our strategic alternatives for our Elanco Animal business and intend to establish Elanco as an independent publicly traded company via an IPO and subsequent separation.","Since announcing the strategic review last October, management and the board of directors carefully considered a wide range of options, including the retention, the sale or the initial public offering of the Elanco business. Based on this review, we concluded that after-tax value for Lilly\u2019s shareholders would be maximized by pursuing an IPO and subsequent separation of Elanco.","We believe independence will allow Elanco to efficiently deploy its resources to those growth opportunities that best serve its customers. This will also allow Lilly even greater focus on the human pharmaceutical business to pursue our purpose of creating life changing medicines for patients. Execution of the IPO is dependent upon and subject to a number of factors and uncertainties, including business and market conditions.","From a timing perspective, we anticipate a registration statement will be available to the public in the next few weeks and we are targeting an IPO of less than 20% of Elanco\u2019s shares before the end of this year. Given the quite period imposed by securities laws, on today\u2019s call we will not be able to respond to many if any questions on the potential IPO.","Moving on to Slide 6, and 7, you will see more details on key events since our April earnings call, but now let me turn it over to Josh to review our Q2 results and to provide an update on our financial guidance for 2018.","Josh Smiley","Thanks Dave. Slide 8 summarizes our presentation of GAAP results and non-GAAP measures. While Slide 9 provides a summary of our GAAP results. I\u2019ll focus my comments on our non-GAAP adjusted measures to provide insights into the underlying trends in our business. So please refer to today's earnings press release for a detailed description of the year-on-year changes in our second quarter GAAP results.","Looking at the non-GAAP measures on Slide 10, you'll see the revenue increase of 9% that Dave mentioned earlier. Gross margin as a percent of revenue decreased to 76.1%. This decrease was due to the effective foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold. Excluding this FX effect, gross margin as a percent of revenue actually increased 130 basis points, primarily driven by manufacturing efficiencies, partially offset by the timing of manufacturing production.","Total operating expense decreased 1% with marketing, selling, and administrative expense decreasing 4%, offset in-part by an increase to R&D expense of 5%. Total operating expense as a percent of revenue declined 450 basis points, compared to Q2, 2017, driven by our continued efforts to reduce our cost structure and increase our margins, accelerated by the restructuring actions we took late last year.","Total operating income increased 28% compared to Q2 2017, which put our operating margin at 29.1% for the quarter. And as Dave mentioned earlier, excluding the effect of FX on international inventories sold, our operating income was 30.6% of revenue, an improvement of nearly 600 basis points versus last year\u2019s quarter. Other income and expense with income of $12.2 million this quarter compared to income of $60.4 million in last year's quarter.","Our tax rate was 17%, a decrease of 470 basis points, compared with the same quarter last year, driven primarily by the impact of U.S. tax reform. At the bottom line, net income increased 31%, while earnings per share increased slightly faster at 35%, due to a reduction in shares outstanding from shares repurchased. We achieved a significant earnings growth by delivering high-single-digit revenue growth, while reducing our operating expenses, significantly improving profitability again this quarter. ","Slide 11 details these same non-GAAP measures for June year-to-date. While Slide 12 provides a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS. You will find additional details on these adjustments on Slides 24 and 25.","Moving to Slide 13, let\u2019s take a look at the effective price rate and volume on revenue growth. This quarter, the effective foreign exchange provided a 2% benefit, excluding this benefit our worldwide revenue growth on a performance basis was 7%, driven entirely by volume. ","For a sixth straight quarter, our Human Pharma business delivered volume growth in each major geography. U.S. Pharma revenue increased 11%, driven almost entirely by volume. Notably our diabetes portfolio delivered over 30% U.S. volume growth again this quarter. We also benefited from higher U.S. Adcirca revenue, which totaled $96 million.","Moving to Europe. Pharma revenue grew 5%, excluding FX, driven entirely by volume despite the loss of exclusivity for Cialis. Excluding the impact of the Cialis LOE, volume grew over 17%. This volume growth was led by Olumiant, Trulicity, Taltz, Lartruvo, and Jardiance.","In Japan, pharma revenue increased 3%, excluding FX, driven entirely by volume. Volume growth was driven by new products namely Trulicity, Cyramza, Taltz, Jardiance and Olumiant, with a significant contribution also coming from Cymbalta. This volume growth was partially offset by price and the impact of the biannual pricing cuts which took effect in Q1. Our pharma revenue in the rest of the world increased 8% on a performance basis this quarter, led by volume growth of Trulicity, Cyramza, Jardiance, Basaglar, Lartruvo and Taltz. ","Turning to animal health. In total, our Elanco revenue declined 1% this quarter in performance terms. Our core-Elanco business, which is the foundation of the business going forward increased 8% in performance terms. Core-Elanco excludes strategic exits, which are listed on Slide 41. New products contributed $75 million to our Animal Health sales in Q2, driven primarily by the companion animal portfolio. This was nearly double the amount in Q2 last year.","The core food animal business increased 10% in Q2, driven by U.S. purchasing patterns in 2017, as well as strong growth in poultry and aqua products, partially offset by continued ractopamine competition. The core companion animal business grew 5%, driven by uptake of Galliprant, Credelio and INTERCEPTOR PLUS, partially offset by continued Trifexis competition. We continue to take actions to focus Elanco\u2019s business in its core areas and to improve profitability.","Since our last call, we completed the sale of the Sligo, Larchwood and Augusta manufacturing facilities and we exited a distribution agreement and a product that is not core to Elanco\u2019s strategy. We also made the decision to suspend marketing of Imrestor, while we pursue additional indications that could allow Imrestor to provide more value to our customers.","Slide 14 outlines the same information for our June year-to-date results. Now, let\u2019s take a look at the drivers of our worldwide volume growth on Slide 15. In total, our new products, including Trulicity, Taltz, Basaglar, Verzenio, Olumiant, Jardiance, Lartruvo and Cyramza were the engine of our worldwide volume growth.","You can see that these products drove 12.4 percentage points of volume growth this quarter. The loss of exclusivity for Effient, Strattera, Cymbalta, Zyprexa, Evista and Axiron provided a drag of 450 basis points, while Cialis accounted for 170 basis points of volume declines due to the entry of generic erectile disfunction products.","When excluding LOEs and Cialis, the rest of our products had volume growth of approximately 16%. Slide 16 provides a view of our new product uptake. In total, these brands generated over $1.7 billion in revenue this quarter, and represented 28% of our total worldwide revenue.","I'd like to highlight the compliance [ph] of Taltz, which grew by 39% in the U.S. and 59% worldwide versus Q2 2017, driven almost entirely by volume. This growth was due to the continued uptake in psoriasis and to a lesser extent the launch of our second indication for Taltz in psoriatic arthritis, both here in the U.S. and in Europe.","We\u2019re also pleased to announce this quarter that Taltz had positive Phase 3 results for our second study in axSpA, which Dave mentioned earlier and was granted a label update in both the U.S. and Europe to include data and difficult to treat genital psoriasis. Later this year, we plan to initiate a head-to-head trial with Tremfya, which will be power to test superiority on key measures in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. This investment underscores our confidence in Taltz, as well as Lilly\u2019s long-term commitment immunology.","Moving to Slide 17, continuing with our non-GAAP explanations, this quarter the effective FX on our income statement was minimal with a small positive impact on revenue and a small negative impact on earnings.","Turning to our 2018 financial guidance on Slide 18, you will see that we\u2019ve updated our guidance to reflect an increase of $300 million on the top line, driven by strong performance across our portfolio, particularly in diabetes and the continued uptake of our new launch brands, as well as higher collaborations revenue, partially offset by the impact of weaker foreign currencies.","An increase in gross margin percent of 50 basis points on a reported basis, primarily driven by the favorable impact of foreign exchange movements, partially offset by an inventory charge related to the suspension of Imrestor sales. A percentage point increase in the non-GAAP gross margin percent, primarily driven by the favorable impact of foreign exchange movement, and finally an increase in our tax rate on a reported basis from 17% to 22.5%, which is driven by a non-deductible IP R&D charge for the acquisition of ARMO BioSciences.","On a reported basis, earnings per share for 2018 is now expected to be in the range of $3.19 to $3.29, while our non-GAAP earnings per share is now expect to be between $5.40 and $5.50. At the mid-point of the range, this represents an increase of 27% over 2017. Our updated guidance implies second half non-GAAP EPS of between $2.57 and $2.67, which exceeds our consensus, and does not assume U.S. price increases for the remainder of the year.","However, it\u2019s lower than our first half EPS, due to the expected U.S. generic competition for Cialis in September, higher second half R&D expenses to support additional late stage investments, including mirikizumab, Olumiant and Taltz NILEX, and the IL-10 from the ARMO acquisition, launch investments for galcanezumab and to a lesser extent, the higher U.S. Adcirca collaboration revenue that we realized in the first half. ","In total, we expect strong second half performance led by volume gains in our new products, which allows for targeted investments in our long-term portfolio and which positions us well to achieve our 2020 financial objectives.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Dave to review the pipe line and key future events.","Dave Ricks","Thanks Josh. Slide 19 shows select NME\u2019s and NILEX as of July 17. In my summary of the quarter at the beginning of the call, I mentioned the positive movements for Nasal Glucagon and the Phase 3 addition of pegylated IL-10 from our acquisition of ARMO BioSciences. The ARMO acquisition also includes Phase II studies for pegilodecakin, which are now reflected in the pipeline.","Additional movements at our earnings call include the start of Phase 3 studies from mirikizumab our IL-23 antibody in both psoriasis and all ulcerative colitis. The start of Phase 2 for our Tau antibody for Alzheimer's; the addition of the Aurora A kinase inhibitor into Phase 1 with the completion of the Orca acquisition. Attrition of lanabecestat, the BACE inhibitor for Alzheimer's diseases we were studying in collaboration with AstraZeneca and the attrition of one Phase 1 diabetes asset. ","On Slide 20, we provide an update on expected key events for 2018. In addition to the pipeline movement I\u2019ve already noted, you will see that we have added a new line to reflect our expectations that the U.S. Alimta label could be updated before the end of the year for the Phase 3 KEYNOTE-189 data.","Under regulatory submissions, you\u2019ll see the submission of Nasal Glucagon and the new indication for Cyramza, second line liver cancer, as well as Lilly and Boehringer Ingelheim's revised expectation that the U.S. submission for the combination of empagliflozin, linagliptin and metformin XR will occur in 2019.","In the Phase 3 data presentations at publication section, we reflected presentation at ASCO of the REACH-2 study of Cyramza, as well as the presentation at the American Headache Society of the Phase 3 cluster headache trials for galcanezumab. And in the Phase 3 topline data disclosure section you\u2019ll see the announcement of positive Phase 3 data for tanezumab in OA pain and the attrition of lanabecestat.","In terms of Phase 3 study initiations, you\u2019ll see the Phase 3 starts for mirikizumab that I noted earlier, and now expect to start Phase 3 before the end of the year for baricitinib in lupus and in adaptive Phase II\/III for alopecia. We've also added a line for initiation of Phase 3 for our novel GIP\/GLP agonist in type 2 diabetes. We now have data inhouse from the Phase 2 study of this next-generation incretin.","In the past, we\u2019ve said that we have a high bar for efficacy to move this molecule into Phase 3, given the competitive intensity in this category. The Phase 2 results met this high bar. We look forward to presenting this data at EASD this fall. And following the data presentation, we will host a call to discuss the data. In addition, we plan to start Phase 3 in late 2018 or early 2019.","Finally, we had positive Alimta rulings in both the U.S. and Japan, while the German Federal Patent Court held our Alimta vitamin regimen patent invalid. We strongly disagree with this ruling and we plan to appeal the decision. This was clearly a busy and productive quarter for the company, and there are still many events to look forward to in 2018. Notably, I\u2019d highlight the expected regulatory actions for galcanezumab in the U.S., Verzenio in Europe and Japan, as well as the data readout of the REWIND study for Trulicity.","Before we go to the Q&A session, let me briefly sum up the progress we\u2019ve made this quarter. In Q2, new products accounted for nearly 28% of our total revenue, and over 31% of our Human Pharma revenue. Volume grew 9% in our Human Pharma business. Despite recent patent explorations and when excluding strategic exits and FX, our animal health business grew by 8%. We realized significant efficiencies in our cost structure leading to operating margin expansion of nearly 600 basis points, excluding FX.","We\u2019ve made excellent progress this quarter in the pipeline with the launch of Olumiant for RA patients in the U.S., the submission of Nasal Glucagon to the FDA and EMA and position Phase 3 data for tanezumab, as well as new indication data for Taltz and galcanezumab. We also returned over $1.5 billion to shareholders via the dividend and share repurchase. We authorized a new $8 billion share repurchase program and made a significant strategic decision on the future of our Elanco Animal Health Business.","Before we move to the Q&A, I would like to share that we will hold a live investor meeting this December to provide our initial 2019 guidance and highlight pipeline progress, including life cycle opportunities for select marketed products. Given the limited space available, our investor relations team will be in contact on the coming days to issues invitations and provide more logistical details.","This concludes our prepared remarks and now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Phil to moderate the Q&A session.","Phil Johnson","Great, thank you Dave. We would like to take questions from as many callers as possible. [Operator Instructions] Kevin, if you can please provide the instructions for the Q&A session and then we are ready for the first caller.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] First question is from the line of John Boris, SunTrust. Please go ahead.","John Boris","Thanks for taking the questions and congratulations on the operating results in the quarter. Dave, first question just has to do with the blueprint, obviously proposed by HHS secretary and the White House administration, what do you view as the base case scenario potentially coming out for the industry and or best case scenario that could come out of that blueprint? And then just any thoughts on this issue that\u2019s rising on copay accumulators that are certainly blunting manufacturers ability use copay assistance against co-pay accumulators, it seems to be very detrimental to patients getting access to medicine, so, any thoughts that you have around that? Second question just has to do with the emerging pain, franchise, just to your optimism over that franchise, especially galcanezumab, which seem to have hit some pretty decent data in cluster headache, which is an area where nothing seems to have worked in that area, so just your thoughts on that and Lasmiditan, the timing profiling of Lasmiditan here in the back half? Thanks.","Phil Johnson","Hi, John, thank for the questions. Dave if you want to go ahead and comment, and then Dan if you want anything on the pain franchise that would be great. Dave?","Dave Ricks","Okay, great. Thank John and thanks for the questions. Just on the policy side, of course blueprint was rolled out in May. And recently, and all actors in the industry seemed to have responded to the requested information. So, you asked me to guess where this will land, that is a really difficult thing to do at this point. Because there is dozens of ideas in there. I think we can comment on actions that have been initiated though because I think that indicates where the administration might be going first and of course many of you may have noted, last week the administration sent to OMB a proposed rule change for the Anti-Kickback safe harbor, which relates to rebates.","We don\u2019t know the substance of that rule change, but this is heavily commented on through the archive via questions and I think you\u2019ve right to assume that there will be some changes to the Anti-Kickback Statute as it relates to rebate treatment. We don\u2019t know what those are and I think we\u2019re preparing for all scenarios there, but this is consistent with the broad theme of looking at ways to reduce the growth in that spread in the industry and to allow patients to have more \u2013 a price point in high deductible or without insurance that is closer to net pricing. ","Overall, we support that. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a bad thing for innovators and we\u2019ll have to watch how that rule develops. We don\u2019t have any specifics as of today. You also saw the administration move on putting a task force together related to addressing off-patents, brands, who take super inflationary price increases. In the absence of IP this is really a regulator failure from our perspective, the administration is talking about importation. We think that\u2019s the wrong road to go down, but rather to fix the regulatory system to begin with. Nonetheless, clearly, that is a hot-button issue, and we agree it should be solved.","The method we disagree with, but we will have more to say about that in the future. I think for innovators over the \u2013 I think I said in the Q4 call in January, we could expect a busy year in regulatory reform and I think in fact that\u2019s what we are seeing. For innovators at the end of the day, as long as we can embrace a pro-innovation market driven set of changes that embrace this choice, I think we\u2019re going to be fine. Getting from A to B, we\u2019ll have to see how these changes unfold; and as of today, it\u2019s difficult to say more than I did already, but of course we watch it very carefully at various investor updates. We\u2019ll be happy to provide additional commentary as additional actions come forward.","On the copay accumulators, this is going in the opposite direction of everything I just said. This is shifting cost, back to consumers by standing the time they spend in high deductible phase. We don\u2019t think by itself it\u2019s a good policy, now coupled with many other things, it could block the impact of that, but frankly I think this although I would say, for Lilly, it's had very limited impact on our performance. It is a concerning thing to watch as we watch the back and forth in commercial markets. Of course, payers and, ultimately employers, are doing this so they want to control drug spending cost, we understand that there may be other ways to do that though.","Finally, on pain, you know we\u2019re excited about the pain portfolio, you\u2019re seeing data emerge now from tanezumab, we have the data as you mentioned on galcanezumab\u2019s of all the Phase 3 in-house. And lasmiditan, we do plan to submit before the end of the year as well. Clearly pain is a huge unmet need in this country. I think you\u2019re seeing good interest in the first CGRP antibody launch that we expect that to continue migraines in enormous problem in this country and there are many chronic and episodic sufferers there that we hope to reach with CGRP antibodies, as well as products like lasmiditan, which can relieve acute suffering.","So, we\u2019re bullish on that category. Of course, we need all the data and the caution on tanezumab remains the safety study. There is a large safety study that will read-out in 2019 and that\u2019s really the pivotal question to answer on this program. We know the drug, yes, can reduce pain based on prior Phase 3 studies.","Phil Johnson","Dan do you have any additional comments to make or\u2026?","Dan Skovronsky","Yes, I will just reiterate that we\u2019re pleased with the data we\u2019re seeing with good galcanezumab of course and I think probably I\u2019ll highlight three opportunities here for Lilly, specifically in the migraine space. First, we\u2019re really quite pleased with the quality of our data galcanezumab works fast and has a prolonged maintenance of efficacy in our clinical trials. I think we\u2019ll be, right now, as far as we\u2019ve seen the only CGRP antibody that has 100% clearance data. So, 100% reduction in migraines. That\u2019s statistically significant in our clinical trials.","The second opportunity here is with Lasmiditan, as you heard from Dave having both of these products we think could be important for patients and then of course the third is what you mentioned, which is cluster headache, which is another important indication and we\u2019re pleased with the data that we have there. So, differentiated opportunity for Lilly.","Phil Johnson","Thanks, Dan. Kevin, if we can go to the next caller please.","Operator","And next question is from the line of Chris Schott, JP Morgan. Please go ahead.","Chris Schott","Great. Thanks very much for the questions. Just two here, maybe first on tanezumab, can you put this initial Phase 3 data we say into context as you think about your enthusiasm for the program and specifically on safety is there a threshold on rapidly progressing osteoarthritis that the FDA is focused on here, how should we think about that safety profile going forward? My second question was on price increases, it seems like the tone across the industry is a bit more restrained than the past on willingness to take increases, is this a 2018 dynamic or do you see this trend continuing out into 2019 and beyond? And I guess given a disconnect we\u2019re seeing between gross and net pricing, if there is a slow down in list price increases going forward, should we think about that impacting net price increases or is that less corelated than it has been in the past? Thanks so much.","Phil Johnson","Great. Chris thank you for the questions. Dan if you want to comment on tanezumab and then Dave feel free to complement that answer and then we would take the price increase question. Dan?","Dan Skovronsky","On tanezumab, of course we previously said, we have a lot of confidence in this mechanism of action based on the wealth of data that\u2019s been generated in the past, and of course the challenge here is to discharge the safety risk. Having said that, we also changed some aspects of how we minister the drug in the new Phase 3 program on which we\u2019re collaborating with Pfizer. So, this first study was primarily focused on that aspect and so this is a titration study where we\u2019re investing a subcutaneous of 2.5 and 2.5 going up to 5 milligram doses. And we're pleased that we hit our efficacy outcomes here.","With respect to RPOA rapidly progressive osteoarthritis your question on thresholds, of course we and others here have thresholds in our clinical trials that we\u2019re watching for, we haven\u2019t spoken specifically around what those might be and our trials continue to proceed. So, we\u2019re excited about that. This study wasn\u2019t designed to discharge the safety risk that study will come with data probably next year or late this year and that\u2019s a next year 3000 patient 56-week clinical trial. ","Phil Johnson","[Indiscernible] Dave?","Dave Ricks","Yes, I would do that. I think, as I said before the key gating thing is this large safety discharge study we now, I guess more than a dozen Phase 3 trial on tanezumab on efficacy, really the question is, is it safe for long-term use. You know, on price increases it\u2019s difficult to comment on others actions or even what happens long term. We\u2019ve as this blueprint has been rolled out, I think our point of view is, is this a potentially sweeping set of changes let\u2019s see what develops here in 2018 as those changes get implemented or not and then on the backend of this important public conversation about how do we reduce out of pocket cost for patients, while preserving innovation and allowing market forces to prevail, how can we reshape the system on those principles.","On the backend of that, of course we\u2019ll reevaluate our strategies. You know net pricing of subject not just to list price changes. And as you know Chris the yield of those is quite different across different categories, but also subject to prior period adjustments on assumptions made in gross to net on current channel mix in many, many other things. So, you will see I think in U.S. we will reflect being a 1% positive, which reflects prior increases, as well as all those other dimensions. As Josh said, we don\u2019t have list price changes in our outlook and it\u2019s still very robust and that\u2019s kind of where we are focused is driving volume of new products here in the U.S. and abroad.","Phil Johnson","Thanks Dave. Kevin if we can go to next caller please.","Operator","And the next question is from the line of Greg Gilbert, Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Greg Gilbert","Thanks. First for Dave. I was hoping you could share with us not a question about the IPO here, but how are the Elanco transaction or transactions in the coming quarters shape your thinking about capital allocation priorities for Lilly? And then shifting gears to diabetes, you touched on this a bit, but given the strong profile for the current injectable GLP-1\u2019s and the emerging oral GLP-1 can you put a little more meat on the bones in terms of that bar you talked about, is that the primary endpoint or the multitude of endpoints that shaped your thinking there and perhaps you can fill in any updates on your own oral GLP-1 work? Thank you.","Phil Johnson","Great Greg. Thank you for the questions. So, Dave, if you comment on Lilly capital allocation moving forward. And then Dan and Enrique, if you'd like to take the question on what we saw with our GIP\/GLP in Phase II. Dave?","Dave Ricks","Thanks Greg. Well as I said, you know this move is really the result of a deep and thorough analysis at the value maximizing decision for Lilly\u2019s shareholders. We think an IPO produces the after-tax value and also that it will allow more focus, focus for Elanco on its priorities, allocating its capital to the produce to grow that business, and serve its customers and focus for Lilly, which for us assuming this all goes forward as planned will be a human pharmaceutical business with, I think many opportunities to invest in creating breakthrough products for patients.","Our strategy on capital allocation doesn't change as a result of this decision, which is really first to invest on our business on our organic ID and the launches in capital needed to manufacture those products et cetera. Secondly, to look at business development, to build our pipeline as the commentary there isn't different than before, which is really we\u2019re mostly interested in clinical stage assets that can build at our core five therapeutic areas.","I think you saw a number of moves in Q2 in that regard, most notably the ARMO acquisition as an example of the kind of thing we\u2019re interested. And then finally, if we run out of those ideas, we will return capital to shareholders and this quarter we\u2019re announcing a share repurchase program, which will allow us to continue to do that. As we said, there was 900 million or so in share repurchase activity in Q2 consistent with those priorities. So, I think we have taken a balanced approach on capital allocation. You can expect that to continue and we have more capital to balance. We\u2019ll do just that.","Phil Johnson","Thanks, Dave. Dan?","Dan Skovronsky","Yes, sure. We previously said that we see incretin biology as an important platform for Lilly to continue to build on that there is a lot more opportunities here for patients, and so over the years we\u2019ve invested here and developed and tested now a number of different molecules that could offer differentiated efficacy in this platform. So, for example, the oxyntomodulin molecules, we're now testing a second one of these in clinical trials, the GLP and other molecules that are in earlier development.","In each of these cases, we\u2019re really looking for what we consider to be breakthrough efficacy. In the case of GLP here we were encouraged that dual agonism of both of these receptors which we think is very important in our preclinical studies showed highly differentiated weight loss and glucose controls. So, we're encouraged by that. We took it into Phase 1 clinical trials. We commented that we\u2019re encouraged by what we saw there and therefore moved it into Phase 2 clinical trials. And I\u2019ll hand it to Enrique for the future of this module.","Enrique Conterno","Yeah, no. I think you\u2019ve framed it well, but we do have a high bar for any type of next-generation incretin. And this product clearly met that bar, but we won't be able to comment on the specifics of the efficacy just to say that we do plan to have a full presentation at EASD and then an Investor Call following that.","Greg Gilbert","That would be early October.","Enrique Conterno","That\u2019s correct.","Phil Johnson","Thank you. Kevin you can go to the next caller please.","Operator","And that will be Andrew Baum, Citi. Please go ahead.","Andrew Baum","Thank you. Couple of topics. Just to zoom in on the first question around the blueprint particularly the proposal on rebates. Our understanding is this totally relates to federal forms of the plan. I just want to make sure that\u2019s consistent with your understanding? Second, assuming that is the case, how do you envisage the world working if PBMs could meaningfully amend their structure of that rebates or remove rebates altogether for federal plan. Is it conceivable that the commercial side of the business will remain as is? Or would you anticipate that may change? And finally, timing, we assume that nothing is going to assume happen just given the plan is that until 2020 if the earliest again is that system. And then the second topic, just one question on tanezumab. What are you anticipating in terms of enabling requirement, radiographic scans given in the real-world patients maybe premedicating with NSAIDs, which may increase some of the stakes that you saw in the earlier trials? Thank you.","Phil Johnson","Okay. So, we\u2019ve had a series of questions essentially on the blueprint, specifically on the rebate program, and is that only applying in our understanding of the federally programs? What will be the impact of PBMs during the commercial business of that same kind of change we you go into effect, earliest timing that we are thinking is 2020 appropriate? And we also had the question on tanezumab in terms of labeling required for radiographic scan. So, Dave if you want to take the first question. I'm not sure as much we can say, but whatever we can see on the blueprint speculation and then Dan if you want to comment on tanezumab? ","Dave Ricks","I was just going to reiterate. Andrew it is difficult to speculate on a proposed real change when all we have is the title of the rule. I think if you read it like we can, which basically says the change to the rebate rules and the Anti-Kickback Statute and replacing it with a new set of safe harbors. Mike Harrington's with us, who is our General Counsel, I think it came about with and I think that statue, the first two, but I believe it is just federal programs, Mike you want to comment on that?","Mike Harrington","Well I think we\u2019ll have to see. The Anti-Kickback Statute addresses payments made to induce prescribing. So, we will have to monitor it closely, but it is potentially, yes that it could expand more broadly beyond just the federal programs.","Phil Johnson","Thank you. And then tanezumab and the radiographic labeling?","Dan Skovronsky","Yes sure. So, certainly premature to speculate on the labeling on tanezumab, given that we don\u2019t have the primary safety data yet, but as you know we made some changes to the Phase 3 program to try and decrease the risk of RPOA. I think most significant among those is lowering the dose of tanezumab. And so that\u2019s again why this titration study was the first step in demonstrating that. We still have the efficacy that we need. Another change was reducing or eliminating the concomitant use of NSAIDs in OA patients, as well as changing our screening methods as you mentioned. Let's see what the data show and based on that we\u2019ll be able to talk more about where we\u2019re headed in labelling.","Phil Johnson","Thank you, Dan. Kevin, next caller please.","Operator","And next we have David Risinger, Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","David Risinger","Yes, thanks very much. I have a few questions. First, with respect to the strategic exits that you mentioned for Elanco, obviously you can't talk about the IPO, but I just wanted to better understand when those strategic exits were completed that had a negative impact on revenue in the second quarter and thus when they will annualize? So that\u2019s the first question. Second and, with respect to Jardiance and Trajenta, both of those products were flattish sequentially, so they were outliers, obviously the rest of the portfolio was extremely strong, could you help us better understand why they were flattish sequentially, despite the prescription growth that we saw? And then my final question is with respect to your Alzheimer's candidates, you have two candidates in Phase 2 with readouts in coming years, can you just provide a framework for those two Phase 2 programs, including the timing? Thanks very much.","Phil Johnson","Great Dave, thank you for the questions. So maybe Josh if you want to take the first questions on when we've completed some of the strategic exits and sort of what the time course is for those eventually to annualize and then Enrique on the sequential growth patterns for Jardiance and Trajenta, and then over to Dan for the question for our Alzheimer's programs in Phase 2. Josh?","Josh Smiley","Thanks David. The most significant and the strategic exits would be our Posilac business in the Augusta manufacturing plant in Georgia, but we really just completed that exit over the course of this month. So, as you know Posilac has been declining over the course of 2017 and 2018, so I think you\u2019ll start to see this annualize in total revenue beginning in the second half of this year just as we start to walk through some of the significant headwinds we saw last year. I think it will be totally opposite numbers by the time we get into sort of late 2019, but the majority of the effect that we see for Posilac that\u2019s gone down every quarter because the product before the strategic exit the product was declining pretty significantly. ","We also announced that we were on a smaller basis exiting a few contracts, including a manufacturing contract that we had around BI when we acquired the vaccine portfolio, low margin opportunity, but on the topline that will start to come out of the numbers in the second half of this year as well. Remember when we gave guidance for Elanco, at the beginning of the year we said, you would see a pickup in growth in the second half of the year as some of these big items began to normalize in the numbers. I think that\u2019s why we are focused on core Elanco business, which really looks at that portfolio, which is not, we\u2019re not exiting from, and is the basis of our growth going forward.","Phil Johnson","Thanks Josh. Enrique?","Enrique Conterno","Very good. So, let\u2019s start with the easier one. Trajenta net sales in the U.S. reflects the trends that we see when it comes to total prescriptions basically it\u2019s a steady number of prescriptions quarter-on-quarter and that\u2019s basically what we see when it comes to net sales. When it comes to Jardiance just maybe to provide a bit more color, we show in the case of Jardiance a 58% TRX growth versus the previous year quarter-on-quarter. On a sequential basis that growth is 13%, so very solid growth when it comes to Jardiance, but the net sales, there is a disconnect there because the net sales for the quarter versus the previous year only increased 28%. ","We did have an adjustment due to changes in estimates for rebates and discounts normalizing for the growth versus the previous year would have been 46%. Now, when we look on a sequential basis in the case of Jardiance, some of those changes and estimates for rebates and discounts really belonged in Q1, so you basically have a double whammy effect when you look at the sequential quarter-on-quarter comparison.","Phil Johnson","Thank you, Enrique. Dan?","Dan Skovronsky","Yes, thanks for the question on the question on the neurodegeneration portfolio. We actually have 3 neurodegeneration-targeted molecules in Phase 2 trials starting with D1 PAM. This is designed to be a symptomatic molecule for patients suffering with dementia. Initially, we\u2019re testing it in Parkinson's diseases dementia. We have reason to believe that there is a higher probability of success in that population, but if we get a positive signal there we would very quickly move that also in parallel to Alzheimer's disease. So, that\u2019s the first. ","The other two that you mentioned, the next one behind it is N3PG that\u2019s an anti-plaque A-beta antibody. Based on what we saw in some pretty standard Phase 1 trials. This molecule can clear plaques really to a very dramatic depth. So, a great degree of clearance and also with a great amount of speed. So, faster clearance I think that we\u2019re seeing with other mechanisms. So, we\u2019re excited about that. We\u2019re testing that as monotherapy. ","We\u2019re also testing it in conjunction in combination therapy. I believe it\u2019s the first combo trial of two disease modifying drugs and Alzheimer's disease with a base inhibitor, with a thought here that although base monotherapy has been disappointing if you turn off A-beta production, also clear out the plaque that could have added benefits. So, that trial is enrolling and then we also have the Tau monoclonal antibody. This is specific for aggregated forms of Tau and we think this is an important therapeutic morality and Alzheimer's. ","Both of those Phase 2 or really all three of the Phase 2 trial are designed to give us efficacy signals both on biomarkers and on cognitive endpoints. I think on clinical trials.gov, we show the disease modifying trials ending in 2020, it\u2019s an 18-month treatment period, but depending on enrolment rates and depending on potential for interim analysis this is also potential to have data read-outs earlier, even next year. You will have to wait and see how those trials go.","Phil Johnson","Great, thank you, Dan. Kevin if we can go to the next caller.","Operator","And the next question is from the line of, one moment please, it\u2019s going to be Jami Rubin, Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Jami Rubin","Thank you. David just want to go back to some of the questions around rebate structures and I recognize that it\u2019s early and it\u2019s hard to predict how this is going to play out, but just when you look at your own numbers and think about different scenarios, looking at filing Lilly's gross to net of 48% is the widest in the industry, largely because of your diabetes franchise. Is there a change to those rebates, what would you expect to happen to volumes, you just said that volumes that rebates are used to induce volumes, so would you expect volumes to go down for that business? Conversely, if rebates go away, Lilly has about 10 billion in rebates, how can this not be a net positive even if you take into consideration lower volumes and potentially lower risk price, how are you thinking about the different scenarios that can play out here? Thanks.","Phil Johnson","Great Jami, thank you for the questions. Dave?","Dave Ricks","Thanks Jami. I mean the huge opening caveat here is, we don\u2019t know right. We don\u2019t know what this rule. We don\u2019t know where the system will go. We paused on the list price changes in the U.S. waiting to seeing what is happening here. So, just to get the numbers right, we reported last year of 51% gross to net spreads, you were right in that diabetes segment in particular drug that primarily because you have a very large Medicaid population and you have a very large gross to net spreads and Medicaid approaching the federal capital to 100%. So, we have been pretty open about all that. It depends on how this rule would be enacted, whether it would change the Medicaid system, whether it would treat that commercial et cetera, to really guess at what would be on the other side of it.","As I said in my first response though, you know we make innovative products, hopefully products people want and need, I think the current system has resulted in basically a structure of the industry where the hospital systems, insurance carriers, distributors, and manufacturers seem to be fine with the current system, the problem is we're shifting too much costs via list pricing directly to consumers. I have to believe that if consumer pricing came down, it would improve volume, improve medication adherence, improve outcomes for patients. So, we think, that\u2019s why in general we think this direction travels a good way. Now, we have to see all the specifics just clearly there is a lot of room for disruption in a negative way here and it'd be very difficult for Lilly to predict what would happen to their gross to net line you're talking about or, more specifically, without seeing the totality of the regulatory reforms.","Jami Rubin","Is that a scenario there where this is a net positive for the industry, even if volumes do go down, but your rebates go away as well?","Dave Ricks","I think it is a lot of scenarios Jami, it is hard to speculate.","Jami Rubin","Okay, thank you.","Dave Ricks","Yes, great.","Phil Johnson","Thanks Jami. Kevin, if we can go to the next caller.","Operator","And next we have Geoff Meacham, Barclays. Please go ahead.","Geoff Meacham","Hi guys, thanks for the question. On Olumiant, I would just want to ask you guys a little bit more detail about the strategy going forward for the 4 mg dose in RA. What are the options you are looking at and maybe just put this in the context of the priorities compared to your label expanding studies in atopic dermatitis, psoriatic arthritis, et cetera? And then, Dave or Josh, with the Elanco spin-out, you've \u2013 pipeline progress and obviously a few smaller scale deals already done it on oncology, maybe just help us with, you know, is it fair to say BD is now a lower priority, is there a category that you feel like you still need to add assets like for example in oncology to be more competitive? Thank you?","Phil Johnson","Great, Geoff thank you for the questions. So, Dan maybe if you can comment on strategies going forward for the 4 mg in RA and how that may compare with other NILEX opportunities that we're evaluating and then Dave obviously the comment on the business development priorities that we have moving forward. Dan?","Dan Skovronsky","Yes, thanks. We are excited about the potential of baricitinib for patients that potentials being realized, of course, to a greater extent outside the U.S. in places where both doses are approved. At the advisory committee, I think we were clear in our position about the benefits that each doze could have for patients and we are clear that after the outcome in our disappointment, I think in terms of next step for, next steps for the 4 mg dose we are still considering what different possibilities might be internal at this time. ","I think that in terms of the prioritization here there is great opportunities for baricitinib in RA, but also in some of the other indications, so the lupus data, which was recently published in Lancet, I think, represents a really great opportunity for patients and an opportunity here for us to be first in class here in lupus. We\u2019re also excited about atopic derm where we now have a Phase 3 trial ongoing. So, lots of opportunities for patients with bari remaining.","Dave Ricks","Yes, I would just add, you know we\u2019ve launched just now sort of promoting in July and in the U.S. with the 2 mg anecdotal feedbacks very positive and we know from the German launch French launches, which are ongoing, that patients have rapid pain relief. This is a different modality than are used to in disease modifiers for RA and we\u2019re far from disappointed with the performance of the molecule at a global basis. More to do in the U.S., we\u2019ll update investors and probably in more detail at the Q3 call on that performance in the life cycle as Dan pointed as potentially quite broad.","On the second question of BD priorities, I hate to say this, Geoff, but I think you have it exactly wrong. I wouldn't attribute it all that would satisfy with BD. We are in a position now with, we are growing \u2013 the top line, we\u2019re growing income, we\u2019re growing cash flows, we are very interested in acquiring assets that all of our therapeutic areas of interest. We are not plugging a whole here, it is really about building value for the long-term and because we are optimistic about the short and mid-term in terms of growth prospects, we are in a position to do just that. So, I would expect to see a continuous flow of pipeline ads from \u2013 hopefully from our own labs, but if not from outside labs as well. And we have more than enough resources to execute that strategy.","Phil Johnson","Great, thanks Dave. Kevin, if we can go to the next caller please.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Jason Gerberry, Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Jason Gerberry","Thanks for taking my questions. I guess just first question on Humalog. You've now gotten first half of the year the benefit in terms of the changes and estimates. But just on the, I guess, rebates, but can you talk about second half where you are in terms of comps and then kind of moving forward into 2019, how comfortable are you at this stage that the biosimilar competitor won\u2019t really represent a meaningful source of competitive pressure to the business? And then my second question, just on galcanezumab. The feedback from the Amgen launch in the CGRP space seems to be pretty favorable. I'd just be curious to get your evolving thoughts on, do you think payers are going to cover multiple CGRP agents on par or parity or do you think that they will opt for exclusive contracts out of the gate? Thanks.","Phil Johnson","Jason, thank you for the questions. Enrique we\u2019ll go to you for Humalog, I am not sure Dave, if you may want to handle or will it\u2026?","Dave Ricks","I\u2019d start [indiscernible].","Phil Johnson","Absolutely. Enrique?","Enrique Conterno","Sure. So, Humalog had an excellent quarter. We did have a benefit in Q2 due to changes in the estimates for rebates and discounts. That benefit was \u2013 relative to the previous year was about 9 points, so an important benefit. Now, as we \u2013 it is difficult for us to be able to project forward, but we are seeing a bit of a benefit also when it comes to mix. So, when we look at the different segments, which is a positive for Humalog for the insulin franchise. Now, as it relates to Admelog, it's very difficult to \u2013 for us to forecast and predict how the competitor would basically play in the market. Clearly at this point-in-time we will basically see them as gaining share in particular in the area of managed Medicaid, but it is difficult for us to predict what type of access and uptake we will be able to have in 2019. ","Dan Skovronsky","Great. As it relates to the assets in the migraine category, you know it is pretty early days here. I understand mostly payers haven\u2019t listed the new therapy. We\u2019re of course for the guidance in FDA and early conversations with payers about our data and seeking that kind of feedback from them, I could tell you what our strategy is, which is reading broad access to these medications as appropriate and particularly given the population.","So, these are mostly commercially insured, working women who are having anywhere between 4 and 20 headaches a month that is our study population, which causes absenteeism, debilitation, lack of ability to predict and schedule and plan, not to mention just the human suffering cost. So, we think employers will be very interested in covering this class. We need to get that message through. It could be a great category for some value and outcomes-based pricing approaches, and we're optimistic long term that the class will have good coverage. Enrique, do you have anything from your conversation with payers to add?","Enrique Conterno","No, I think we are very excited about the opportunity that this new product would represent for us and we are working actively to try to ensure broad access.","Phil Johnson","Great. Thank you. Kevin, next caller please.","Operator","Next, we have Steve Scala, Cowen. Please go ahead.","Steve Scala","Thank you, several questions. First, on Taltz. In Q1, inventory was down 33%, how much of the stellar second quarter performance was restocking the trade versus underlying demand? Second, a filing of galcanezumab in episodic cluster headache is not in the events table, so why is it 2018 filings not likely, is this a result of the miss in the chronic cluster headache setting and then lastly, do you have any early reading on 2019 formulary discussions? Are they resulting in similar positions as 2018 or is there a step change in anyway? Thank you.","Phil Johnson","Okay, Steve. I\u2019m not sure with Christi being ill [ph] if we have a strong answer for you on the Q1, but we'll give at least a short answer for you. We can follow up later if needed, on the Taltz question for Q1. And then maybe Enrique if you would like to also comment on the 2019 formulary question and I\u2019ll be happy to go ahead and provide a comment on the galcanezumab filing for cluster.","Enrique Conterno","I think the short answer is that Taltz performance when we look at Q2 is really demand driven. We have seen improvements on across our prescription trends in both derm and rheumatology. So, we are very encouraged with the Taltz performance. We typically do not comment on specific formulary focus for 2019.","Phil Johnson","And Steve on your question for galcanezumab and cluster, very pleased with the results that we saw in the Phase 3 studies and certainly will discuss those with regulators but are not making any kind of a comment this point in time on potential filing or timing for such filing. Kevin, if we can go to the next caller please.","Operator","And that will be Umer Raffat at Evercore. Please go ahead.","Umer Raffat","Hi, thanks so much for taking my questions. I had three if I may, Dave, first, someone brought it up early as well and I wanted to make it a bit more specific on a product level as it relates to rebates and I guess my question was, when I look at mealtime influence, Lilly and Novo basically split the market, and Sanofi has minimal share. So, do you foresee any scenario on rebates where Sanofi becomes a more meaningful player in mealtime insulins? So that\u2019s first. And second and third are maybe more on R&D, first on IL-10, my question is in your ongoing Phase 2 trials of PD1 plus IL-10, they are both open label and long. And any observation from that trial to date? And then also on R&D on tanezumab, have you - do we know what the rate of conversion was from Type 1 to Type 2 RPOAs in your prior trials? Thank you very much.","Phil Johnson","Raffat, thank you for the question. Enrique, maybe if you'd like to comment on the first question about any possibilities we see for Sanofi to become a meaningful player in mealtime insulins? Maybe Sue or Dan, if you'd like to comment on data from the IL-10. And then, Umer, I'm sorry, I actually can't read my own chicken scratch for what you asked on tanezumab. Oh, it's conversion from RPOA 1 to RPOA 2. And maybe, Dan or Dave, if you want to comment. So, Enrique, I'll start with you.","Enrique Conterno","Yes. The premise of the question was under a - some sort of a different structure when it comes to rebates and so forth. It's - and I think Dave already mentioned this, but it's very difficult to speculate what the changes would be and what the competitive dynamic would be as a result of that change. Clearly, we do track Sanofi's products in the mealtime insulin space. But so far, I think, the uptake is very minimal.","Phil Johnson","Great. Thank you, Enrique. Sue, you want to start on the IL-10 question?","Sue Mahony","Yes, sure. We have two Phase 2 studies with IL-10, as you mentioned, one in the front line and the - one in the second line. Those - both those dose are currently enrolling. The endpoint is response rate data, and we\u2019re anticipating seeing that next year.","Phil Johnson","Great. Thank you, Sue. Dan, do you want to add anything, or are you\u2026","Dan Skovronsky","It\u2019s fine.","Phil Johnson","Okay. And then on the tanezumab question?","Dan Skovronsky","Yes. So, I understand your question about rates of conversion into RPOA 2 from RPOA 1 in previous trials. I know there's a lot of interest in comparing what will be seeing in this current trial and future trials with tanezumab with the past experiences. But there's some really important differences, I think, that should lead us to avoid those kinds of comparisons, primarily around the way that we screened and for events and adjudicated events, which is quite different in this trial. And understandably since we knew what we're looking for, much more thorough.","So, we don't have relevant data from the past to compare to. With regards to this current trial, we're not disclosing any more details at this point in time. But that should happen in a future meeting.","Phil Johnson","Right. Thank you, Dan. Kevin, next caller, please.","Operator","Next is from Vamil Divan, Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Vamil Divan","Great. Thanks so much for taking my question. So maybe just two on the oncology side. One, on Verzenio, the performance is pretty good this quarter. Just if you can give a little more color on which patients are getting Verzenio relative to IBRANCE or to Kisqali?","And then second one, on Alimta, you mentioned you're open to have label update to include the keynote 189 data later this year. Just if you can comment on what you're seeing in terms of adoption of that regimen in practice to date, which Alimta uses now in combination with Keytruda in the frontline setting? Thanks.","Phil Johnson","Vamil, thank you for the question. So, Sue, for you on both Verzenio and Alimta updates.","Sue Mahony","Sure. Yes, thanks for the question. Yes, we're really pleased with the update on Verzenio today. The sales this quarter was $57.7 million, so that's a $20 million increase versus last quarter. What we\u2019re seeing is, as you know, we're the third-to-market CDK, but we are second now in terms of both NRx, so new to brand and also in TRx. In this quarter, our NBRx share was 18.7%, and we continue to see that increase. So, we are pleased with the uptake.","What we're seeing is when physicians are using the brand, they like it. So, our focus is in ensuring that we continue to get trial of Verzenio. And so far, we have about 1,500 physicians who have trialed Verzenio. The patients that they're using in is across the spectrum in the frontline and mainly in fulvestrant. And we do have some single-agent activity. But really, we\u2019re starting to see much more now uptake in the frontline.","So, with aromatase inhibitors as well as with the second line in fulvestrant. And the things that are resonating is the continuous dozing. The single-agent activity is clearly a differentiator. People are also interested, and I think the data is resonating in the fact that we see positive data in patients who\u2019ve got concerning clinical characteristics.","So, we feel pretty good so far about the uptake in Verzenio. We see opportunity to continue to grow that brand. The market is growing about 22%, and we - and only about 50% of patients are still getting a CDK4\/6 inhibitor. With regards to Alimta, we've got the data uptake now in - for the KEYNOTE-021G data is now in the label. We have also submitted to the FDA to include the KEYNOTE-189 data.","What we\u2019re seeing is, as you heard, we are growing Alimta in the U.S. We have a 2% growth based on volume, 1% price, so 3% overall. And although the data was only presented at ASCO fairly recently, since that time, we are seeing an increase in new patient prescriptions. So, sort of as a reminder, about 50% of Alimta use is in the sort of in promoted areas. We do have Alimta - some of the use for the KEYNOTE-189 regime is sort of in addition to Alimta use that we've now. But we're clearly also seeing an increase in the typical use and we continue to believe that we'll see that going forward.","Phil Johnson","Great. Thank you, Sue. Kevin, next caller, please.","Operator","Next is from the line of Louise Chen, Cantor. Please go ahead.","Louise Chen","Hi, thanks for taking my question. So, first question I had was, what gives you confidence that you will hit stat sig versus just non-inferiority in the REWIND trial for Trulicity? And even if it's not stat sig, can Trulicity still continue with robust growth trajectory that you see currently?","And second question was just back on tanezumab. How do you think the FDA will balance the side effect profile of your drug versus the need for alternatives to opioids? Thanks.","Phil Johnson","Great. Louise, welcome to the call. So, Enrique, if you'd like to handle the question for REWIND. And then, Dan, over to you for the question on tanezumab. Enrique?","Enrique Conterno","So Trulicity today is having fantastic growth. Clearly, the GLP-1 market is growing very fast at 26%, but Trulicity is also having continued share growth over the last few months. We have an excellent access position and quite frankly, an unmatched patient experience when we look at the real-world efficacy that Trulicity delivers. So, we'll look at patient adherence and very simply delivered.","So very excited about the core performance of the product. Clearly, REWIND, as we said before, is an important trial for us, and we believe that we've designed this trial in the appropriate way. We expect that we're going to have a top line sometime by the end of the year.","But we - one of the differences for REWIND versus other trials is the time the patients are going to be on the product. This is not a short product. It's fairly long, and we expect that the patients would be on average over five years on Trulicity. So, we look forward to the results of the trial. But at this point in time, we're not going to speculate.","Phil Johnson","Great. Thank you, Enrique. Dan?","Dan Skovronsky","Yes, they're strict with tanezumab. But of course, with Pfizer, our priority here in the current slated trials is to demonstrate the benefit, risks of this drug for patients in a variety of settings. Having said that, your question was sort of broader about the societal impact here of the opioid crisis and the need for non-opioid alternatives for chronic pain.","Of course, we also see that. That's one of the reasons we're excited by the potential of the pain portfolio, one of the reasons that several years ago we decided to invest in the future for tanezumab. I think how regulators will see the interplay between new molecules for pain versus the opioid crisis is important. And we think that we have an important role to play there in helping solve that problem.","Phil Johnson","Thanks, Dan. Kevin, next caller.","Operator","And we do have a question from Steve Scala, Cowen. Please go ahead.","Steve Scala","Thank you. Back on REWIND. On the Q1 call, it was stated that the top line press release could be anticipated in early Q4. Enrique, you just said year-end, so I\u2019m wondering if there has been a change in timing?","Secondly, on Alimta, does the ruling in Germany change anything in the market, such as allowing a generic launch?","And then lastly, on Verzenio, a Phase 2 study in MCL had completed in March, but there has been no update when might we see the data? Thank you.","Phil Johnson","Great, Steve, thank you for the question. So, when we came back to you for the REWIND follow-up, and then Sue, to you for the Germany ruling for Alimta and the Verzenio Phase 2 and MCL.","Enrique Conterno","There has been no change in timing. We expect that the top line would be released in Q4.","Phil Johnson","Okay, great. Thank you, Enrique. And Sue?","Sue Mahony","Yes, with regards to Alimta Germany, we - we're having junctions in place. So, it's really hard to say what the situation is with regards to generics. I mean, some may go at risk, but it's really hard to say with regards to that.","Phil Johnson","And then for Verzenio, we have the MCL Phase 2 wrap-up. Any thoughts on plans for MCL going forward?","Sue Mahony","Yes, I'm going to have to get back to you on that one. I\u2019m not sure the plans with regards to the publication on that, but we\u2019ll certainly get back to you on that one.","Enrique Conterno","Great. And then also just to place in context for our Q2 results, European sales of Alimta were about $145 million less than $30 million of that came from Germany.","Phil Johnson","Kevin, if we have another caller, well, we\u2019re happy to take the question.","Operator","Next will be Hima Inguva, BoA. Please go ahead. And your line is open at this time. Hima Inguva, your line is open.","Hima Inguva","Can, you hear me okay?","Operator","Yes.","Phil Johnson","Yes, we can.","Hima Inguva","Okay, great. Thanks very much for taking the question. On Slide 5, you're indicating a potential debt offering prior to the IPO, and not asking in terms of those transaction details. But do you expect this Elanco to be a levering up event for Lilly?","Phil Johnson","So, Josh, if you want to respond to the question in terms of what would cause Lilly to actually lever up.","Josh Smiley","So, the debt offering will - the intent at this point is to do that before we launch the IPO of less than 20% obviously over time that that sits on Elanco\u2019s books. I think, if you look at Lilly\u2019s capital allocation priorities and cash flow, we do expect to be more levered over time as a function basically of tax reform. You'll recall that prior to tax reform, we were in a position where we had cash that was restricted in how we could use it. And it was in effect trapped overseas and that has freed up, we don't need to keep as much cash.","So, you should expect to see Lilly on a net basis be more levered. And, in fact, in Q2, we moved into a net debt position. So, it\u2019s less an issue of what will happen with a Elanco, because that will normalize over time and more a function of our capital structure, which is now - gives us much more flexibility as we're able to manage and use cash around the world.","Phil Johnson","And this is Phil. I get to my new role as Treasurer. When we would separate a Elanco should that occur, which is our plan, we would lose a certain amount of EBITDA, there would not be a significant reduction to our debt. So, there would be a modest maybe 20 basis point increase in the debt to EBITDA kind of numbers that we have a very minimal change in terms of Lilly's leverage moving forward. Kevin, do we have any more callers in the queue?","Hima Inguva","That's very helpful. Thank you.","Phil Johnson","You are welcome.","Operator","No further question in queue at this time.","Phil Johnson","Excellent. Thank you very much, Dave. If you'd like to go ahead and conclude the call with some comments.","Dave Ricks","Thanks, Phil. We appreciate your participation in today's earnings call and your interest in Eli Lilly and Company. Our strong first-half growth makes us increasingly confident in our ability to deliver 5% compound revenue growth from 2015 to 2020 and to achieve a 30% operating margin in 2020.","While our first-half pipeline accomplishments continue to highlight the depth and breadth of our prospects for growth beyond 2020. As demonstrated most recently by our decision on Elanco, we continue to take concrete actions to focus our resources and allocate capital to best serve our customers and create value for our stakeholders. With a diverse set of new product opportunities to drive growth, a strong R&D capability and a clear path to margin expansion, we believe Lilly continues to be a compelling investment.

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded. ","I'd now like to turn the conference over to your host, Kevin Hern. Please go ahead.","Kevin Hern","Good morning. Thank you for joining us for Eli Lilly and Company's Q4 2019 Earnings Call. I'm Kevin Hern, Vice President of Investor Relations. Joining me on today's call are Dave Ricks, Lilly's Chairman and CEO; Josh Smiley, Chief Financial Officer; Dr. Dan Skovronsky, Chief Scientific Officer; Anne White, President of Lilly Oncology; Patrik Jonsson, President of Lilly Bio Medicines and Mike Mason, President of Lilly Diabetes.","We're also joined by Kim Macko and Mike Czapar of the Investor Relations team. During this conference call we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors, including those listed on slide three, and those outlined in our latest forms 10-K, 10-Q and any 8-K's, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","The information we provide about our products in pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It is not intended to be promotional and is not sufficient for prescribing decisions. As we transition to our prepared remarks, a reminder that our commentary will focus on non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude the financial contribution from Elanco during 2018 and 2019 and present earnings per share as though the full disposition via the exchange offer was complete on January 1, 2018.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Dave for a summary of our Q4 results.","Dave Ricks","Thanks Kevin. 2019 was a solid year for Lilly and our strong Q4 financial results highlight the strength of the underlying business. We exited 2019 with momentum and will continue to focus on executing our strategy in 2020, which is to deliver excellent business results, develop and launch new medicines for patients and drive increased productivity.","Revenue growth accelerated in Q4 increasing 8% versus Q4 2018 or 9% in constant currency. This strong performance was driven entirely by volume, which contributed 10 percentage points of growth despite continued headwinds from the loss of exclusivity in the U.S. of Cialis and the global withdrawal of Lartruvo. Excluding Cialis and Lartruvo, worldwide volume growth was an impressive 15%. ","Newer medicines continue to be our growth engine representing 46% of our revenue this quarter. We made good progress in Q4 on our productivity agenda, as operating income grew 10% versus last year. We posted strong revenue growth and held marketing, selling and administrative expenses flat versus last year, while increasing our investment in R&D. ","Our non-GAAP operating margin was 26.3%, an improvement of 40 basis points versus Q4 2018. We finished 2019 with a full year operating margin slightly below our guidance of approximately 28% as we made targeted, strategic investments in Q4 across both our commercial portfolio and pipeline, which will enhance our opportunities for future growth. These investments provide good momentum heading into 2020 and keep us on track to achieve our 31% operating margin target this year. ","We\u2019ve announced multiple pipeline milestones since our Q3 earnings call. These include positive results in the remaining two Phase III trials of the baricitinib BREEZE-AD program in atopic dermatitis, the submission of selpercatinib in the U.S. and Europe, and the FDA granting selpercatinib a priority review; the submission of tanezumab for OA pain in the U.S., in collaboration with Pfizer; the submission of higher doses of Trulicity in the U.S. and Europe, and the submission of baricitinib for atopic dermatitis in Europe and Japan. ","During Q4 we put our strong operating cash flow to work, returning approximately $900 million to shareholders via share repurchase and dividends. In addition, as previously announced we increased our dividend 15% for 2020. This marks the second consecutive year of a 15% dividend increase, reflecting our confidence in the outlook for the business. ","Finally, we recently announced the pending acquisition of Dermira. The company focused on developing new therapies for chronic skin conditions. Dermira is an exciting \u2013 has an exciting asset Phase III for atopic dermatitis, baricitinib in addition to the currently marketed products for excessive underarm sweating, QBREXZA. This transaction enhances our Phase III pipeline and complements our existing efforts in atopic dermatitis with baricitinib. We look forward to closing that transaction here in Q1.","Moving to slide five, you\u2019ll see the list of key events since our last earnings call. In our continued efforts to help make medicines more affordable and reduce out-of-pocket costs for patients, we recently announced plans to introduce two additional lower priced insulins, Humalog\u00ae Mix75\/25 KwikPen and Humalog Junior KwikPen, both products will be available by mid-April and will be offered at a 50% lower list price compared to the branded versions. ","Once these additional options are available more than 90% of Lilly\u2019s Humalog options will be accessible to help patients reduce their out-of-pocket costs, and we hope to see payers provide increased access to patients for these solutions. ","During the month of December alone Insulin Lispro helped nearly 79,000 patients in the U.S. These recent addition complement existing offerings in the Lilly Diabetes Solution Center which currently helps as many as 20,000 patients per month better afford their insulin. As a company that has been in business for over 140 years, it invests over $5 billion per year in long term research and development, we take our responsibility to pursue sustainable business, social and environmental practices very seriously. ","Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Josh to review our Q4 results and to provide an update on our 2020 financial results. ","Josh Smiley ","Thanks Dave. Slide six summarizes our presentation of GAAP results to non-GAAP measures, and slide seven provides a summary of our GAAP results. ","So looking at the non-GAAP measures on slide eight, you\u2019ll see revenue increase 8% or 9% in constant currency. Gross margin as a percent of revenue declined 70 basis points to 79.9%. Excluding the impact of FX on international inventory sold, gross margin as a percent of revenue was 79.6% and on the same basis our gross margin percent decreased by approximately 50 basis points compared to Q4, 2018, driven by unfavorable product mix and the negative impact of price on revenue. ","Moving down the P&L, operating expenses grew 6% versus last year's quarter. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses were flat as cost containment and productivity measures offset investments in key growth products. ","R&D expenses increased 14%, reflecting higher develop expenses for late stage access, including tirzepatide, selpercatinib and mirikizumab. Operating income increased 10% compared to Q4, 2018 and sales growth outpaced expense growth, resulting in an operating income as a percent of revenue of 26.3% for the quarter and 27.2% for the full year. ","This quarter's results are indicative of the potential for growth and margin expansion our portfolio of new medicines offers. We are well positioned to drive top-tier revenue growth and invest in the next wave of new medicines, while driving margin expansion at the same time. We exit 2019 with significant momentum executing our strategy and are on track to achieve our 2020 full year operating margin target of 31%. ","Other income and expense was income of $206 million this quarter compared to income of $31 million in Q4, 2018, driven by investment gains on public equity. As we highlighted previously, this line item can be volatile as public market valuations fluctuate. Gains in Q4 were primarily generated by our investments in China biotech companies through our Lilly Asia Ventures ARM and strategic investments in companies focused in newer technologies like RNAi. ","While we appreciate the gains, we are even more pleased with the relationships and the potential to develop new medicines for patients that accompany some of these investments. Our tax rate was 12.6%, a decrease of 300 basis points compared with the same quarter last year, driven primarily by an increase in net discrete tax benefits, including tax benefits from the resolution of U.S. and foreign orders. At the bottom line net income increased 26%, while earnings per share increased 31%, due to a reduction in shares outstanding from share repurchases. ","Slide nine outlines the same non-GAAP measures for the full year. While we are excited with our performance in Q4 and the momentum headed into 2020, we are also pleased with our overall performance for the full year in 2019. Last year we experienced the full effect of the Cialis patent expiration and the impact of the withdrawal of Lartruvo. ","In spite of these headwinds we grew the top-line at 5% in constant currency and generated EPS growth of 11%, while investing behind our newer products and pipeline. We are also generating good shareholder value and established a strong strategic foundation, through our split-off of Elanco and the acquisition of Loxo Oncology. As we highlighted in December last year, we are well positioned in 2020 to deliver our five your financial goals and continue this period of sustained growth. ","Moving to slide 10, you will find a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS. Additional details are provided on slides 26 and 27. On slide 11, we quality the effect of price, rate and volume on revenue growth. As mentioned earlier, worldwide revenue grew 9% in constant currency during Q4, driven by strong volume growth of 10% partially offset by price. Foreign exchange had a modest negative impact on revenue growth. ","For the fourth straight year we delivered worldwide revenue growth each quarter despite headwinds from patent expirations. U.S. revenue grew 7% compared to the fourth quarter of 2018, volume growth of 8% was led by Trulicity, Taltz, Verzenio, Jardiance and Emgality. Excluding Cialis and Lartruvo, volume grew over 50. ","Pricing was a 1% drag on U.S. revenue growth this quarter, impacted by increased funding during coverage gap in Medicare, unfavorable changes in estimates for rebates and discounts and disproportionate volume growth in lower net price segment, which was partially offset by the net of modest list price increases and higher rebates, as well as reduce reliance on patient assistance program, primarily due to improved commercial access for Emgality. The full year impact of price was a headwind of 3% consistent with our 2019 and 2020 expectations for U.S. price having a moderate drag on revenue growth. ","Moving to Europe, revenue grew 12% in constant current, driven by impressive 15% volume growth, partially offset by the negative effect of foreign exchange and price. Volume growth was led by Trulicity, Olumiant, Taltz and Verzenio. We are pleased with the uptake of our new products across Europe and are looking forward to continued strong growth in 2020. ","In Japan revenue grew 7% in constant currency, driven entirely by volume growth, somewhat offset by a modest pricing headwind due to the government mandated price decreases that went into effect in 2019. Verzenio, Cymbalta, Trulicity and Olumiant were the key contributors to grow. ","Revenue in the rest of the world increased 14% in constant currency led by 44% growth in China on the same basis. China growth was driven by strong performance across a number of key products, including Tyvyt, so we are excited about the recent launches of Trulicity, Taltz and Olumiant. The same information for our full year revenue is at the bottom of the slide. ","As shown on slide 12, our key growth products continue to drive impressive worldwide volume growth. These new medicines delivered nearly 15 percentage points of growth this quarter, continuing the strong trajectory we've seen throughout 2019. ","Brands that have experienced loss of exclusively provided a drag of over 400 basis points driven primarily by Cialis. As a reminder, generic tadalafil entered the U.S. market in September 2018, significantly impacting Cialis revenue, with erosion further accelerating in Q2 2019 as multisource generics entered the market. While the impact of this event is beginning to sunset, it\u2019s still had a meaningful negative impact on growth in Q4, 2019. ","Slide 13 highlights the contributions of our key growth products. In total these brands generated over $2.8 billion of revenue this quarter making up 46% of revenue. Our newest medicines again had impressive results in large and growing therapeutic areas and our ability to reach more patients continues to demonstrate the strength of our commercial execution.","Within diabetes, the injectable GLP-1 class continues to add new patients despite the entry of the new oral therapy. In the U.S. total injectable clip prescriptions grew 29% versus Q4, 2018 and Trulicity grew faster than the market, hosting an increase of 32% in total prescriptions during that same period. ","Net pricing in the U.S. for Trulicity declined in the mid-single digits in-line with our expectations for Q4 and for 2020. As we discussed on the Q3 call Trulicity price in Q1 through Q3 of 2019 with impacted by a number of factors that we don't expect to persist in 2020. SGLT2 inhibitors accelerated their trajectory as full U.S. prescription for the class grew nearly 20% versus last year\u2019s quarter and new therapy starts grew over 46% as the market leader Jardiance continues to drive strong class growth and accounts for over 55% of total prescription. ","Our sustained market leadership in these two important and growing classes within diabetes is a competitive advantage for our diabetes business and positions us well for future growth. In analogy Taltz continues to have growth as U.S. total prescriptions grew nearly 40% versus Q4 2018. Despite an increasingly competitive market, Taltz gained over three share points in dermatology during 2019 and rheumatology weekly prescriptions have more than doubled during that same time frame. ","In 2020 we look to build on the strong momentum demonstrated in 2019 and reach even more patient. In pain, Emgality continued its U.S. leadership and share of market for new to brand prescription at over 47%. While pleased with the uptake, we believe there is room for significant additional grow as we expand our commercial presence in primary care. We continue to see progress with roughly 80% of prescriptions reimbursed at the end of Q4, reflecting the strong access of Emgality. ","Within oncology, Verzenio U.S total prescriptions grew over 46% versus Q4 2018 and the CDK four and six markets is showing encouraging growth as total prescriptions increase by over 16% during the same timeframe. Additionally Cyramza continued to post solid growth as we realize the rapid synergies across our portfolio. ","In addition to the strong performance of our key growth drivers and look forward to potentially launching three new medicines in 2020, with Rayvow, selpercatinib and Ultra Rapid Lispro. We believe all three new medicines have potential to be first in class or best in class and to improve the lives of patients. In addition, launching new medicines in to therapeutic areas where we have existing commercial infrastructure will support further margin expansion. ","Slide 14, shows the year-over-year change in select lines of our income statement, focusing on our non-GAAP results, foreign exchange rates had a moderate \u2013 negative impact on revenue, gross margin, operating income and EPS, and a moistest net positive impact on operating expenses. ","On slide 15 we provide an update on capital allocation. In 2019 we invested over $13 billion to drive our future growth through a combination of business development, capital expenditures and after tax investment in R&D. In addition we returned approximately $7 billion to shareholders via dividend and share repurchases. As Dave mentioned earlier, we also announced the 15% dividend increase for the second consecutive year, showing our confidence and the outlook for the company. ","We're focused on utilizing the strong cash flow our business generates to develop the next wave of new medicines through both internal and external sources, that\u2019s highlighted by the recently announced acquisition of Dermira. We remain active in assessing bolt-on acquisitions or in-licensing where we can create shareholder value and enhance our future grow prospectus. ","Turning to our 2020 financial guidance on slide 16, you'll see that we've updated our non-GAAP guidance to reflect the impact of the planned acquisition of Dermira and a recent strong business performance. Specifically we're increasing our revenue range by $100 million to include QBREXZA and to reflect strong prescription trends we see in the underlying business. ","Updating our SG&A guidance to accounts for the addition of the Dermira sales force and the commercial expenses to support QBREXZA and maintaining all other line items and confirming our non-GAAP earnings per share range of $6.70 to $6.80, an operating margin target of 31%. ","On a reported basis the impact of the Dermira acquisition will have an impact $0.21 and earnings per share for 2020 is now expected to be in the range of $6.18 to $6. 28. We continue to execute our innovation based strategy while leveraging our young commercial portfolios of new medicine to drive margin expansion over the mid-term. ","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Dan to highlight our progress on R&D.","Dan Skovronsky","Thanks Josh. Slide 17 shows select pipeline opportunities as of January 27. Positive movement since our last earnings call includes the submission of selpercatinib in the U.S. and Europe, as well as the initiation of Phase III for selpercatinib in patients with RET Fusion-Positive Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer or RET-mutant medullary thyroid cancer. ","The submission of tanezumab in the U.S. for osteoarthritis pain, the submission of higher doses of Trulicity for Type 2 diabetes in the U.S. and Europe, the submission of baricitinib for atopic dermatitis in Europe and Japan; the addition of lebrikizumab for atopic dermatitis to the Phase III portfolio pending the closure of the Dermira acquisition; the initiation of a Phase III of Tirzepatide in obesity and a Phase II study Tirzepatide in NASH; the initiation of Phase II for our checkpoint agonist, CD200R in immunology and the initiation of Phase I for four assets, as well as the termination of three early stage oncology assets. ","In addition, we had some important early stage readouts, including LOXO-305 our novel BTK inhibitor, which we highlighted on the 2020 financial guidance call and continues to progress quickly in development.","We also had internal data readouts from to Phase II trials, of pegilodecakin in combination with immunotherapy agents in patients with non-small cell lung cancer, CYPRESS 1 and CYPRESS 2. Although the full data will be presented at a medical meeting later this year, I can say that both studies were negative. ","So we are disappointed in the lack of efficacy for pegilodecakin in combination with checkpoint inhibition in lung cancer, we remain committed to finding new therapies for people with cancer. Although we are still analyzing the totality of the data that we have obtained with pegilodecakin, at present we do not anticipate additional trials with this agent. ","Moving to slide 18, we show a final tally of how we finished 2019 versus the key events we expected to occur. 2019 was a very productive year and we made significant progress in bringing new medicines to patients. In total, we added four new Phase III clinical programs to our pipeline, all with the potential to be first in class or best in class. ","We reported 12 positive Phase III or registrational trials readouts, including a mix of NMEs and new indications or new data for launch products. We submitted 12 NMEs or new indications for regulatory review in geographies around the world and we received positive regulatory action on two new medicines, Reyvow and Baqsimi, as well as four important new indications across Trulicity, Taltz, Emgality and Cyramza. ","We're proud of the significant achievements we made in 2019, and we are focused on discovering and developing more new medicines to help patients as we enter another promising decade. ","Moving to slide 19. While it\u2019s early in the year, we've already made good progress on our 2020 goals, having announced the initiation of additional Phase III trials for selpercatinib, positive results in the remaining two trials of the baricitinib BREEZE program for atopic dermatitis. The submission of baricitinib for atopic dermatitis in the EU and Japan, the submission of tanezumab for osteoarthritis pain in the U.S. in collaboration with Pfizer. FDA approval of Trijardy, a fixed dose combination of empagliflozin, linagliptin, metformin and regulatory approval of Cyramza for first line EGFR positive non-small cell lung cancer in Europe. ","Before turning the call back over to Dave, I'd like to spend a few minutes providing additional details on important milestones for two clinical programs that I mentioned earlier. It is the initiation of additional clinical trials for tirzepatide and the completion of the baricitinib BREEZE-AD atopic dermatitis program. ","Beginning with tirzepatide on slide 20, we previously shared our plans to initiate a cardiovascular outcome study for tirzepatide this year, assessing tirzepatide head-to-head against the most widely used GLP-1therapy, i.e., Trulicity. This is a bold move. It signals both our confidence in the strength of tirzepatide as well as our desire to deliver meaningful data for patients and physicians on how new medicines measure against leading therapies. ","Through very collaborative discussions with the FDA, we've gained alignment on the key design features of this unique study called SURPASS CVOT. This trial will include approximately 12,500 patients with Type 2 diabetes and confirmed atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and will measure time the first occurrence of the composite endpoint of CV death, myocardial infarction or stroke. The study will assess both non-inferiority and superiority of tirzepatide versus Trulicity and we anticipate it will take just over four years to complete. ","In addition to SURPASS CVOT, we're pleased to share that the Phase III Type 2 diabetes program, SURPASS, is progressing extremely well. Investigator interest has been very strong, and four of the eight SURPASS clinical trials are already fully enrolled. We look forward to sharing topline results for the first study readout from the SURPASS program later this year.","Finally, we are exciting that the SURMOUNT Phase III obesity program is actively dosing patience and that the synergy Phase II program and NASH is currently under way as well. Given the profound weight loss scene in Phase II trials of tirzepatide we are excited about the potential opportunity these additional clinical programs presents to help patients. Together with the ongoing SURPASS studies, these additional studies will expand the current Phase III tirzepatide program to over 20,000 patients. We're excited about the breakthrough that tirzepatide represents for patience and will continue to invest fully to maximize this opportunity. ","Moving to slide 21, we recently announced the completion of the final two studies in the BREEZE-AD clinical program, BREEZE-AD4 and BREEZE-AD5. The full BREEZE program was comprised of five studies assessing baricitinib in both monotherapy and in combination with topical corticosteroids in patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. ","Well not all the data have yet been presented, we are particularly encouraged by the strong results for the 2 milligram dose in the U.S. trial. We believe that the full data package generated from BREEZE-AD shows the potential that baricitinib could offer as an additional treatment option for patients with atopic dermatitis where there are limited choices. ","In addition these data add to the large safety database of baricitinib having over 10,000 patient years of safety data. We recently submitted baricitinib for atopic dermatitis in the EU and Japan and we expect regulatory action late in 2020. We plan to submit in the U.S. later this year. We anticipate that baricitinib will be the first oral JAK inhibitor for the treatment of atopic dermatitis and we look forward to bringing a new treatment option to patients. ","Finally we recently announced the planned acquisition of Dermira. Pending deal closing, this transaction would add an additional medicine to the Lilly pipeline for moderate to severe atopic dermatitis, that is Lebrikizumab, which is an injectable antibody targeting IL-13 currently in Phase III trials. ","We view Lebrikizumab as highly complementary to our efforts with baricitinib in atopic dermatitis. The unmet medical need here is large and we anticipate physicians and patients we use a range of oral injectable therapies similar to current common practice for the treatment of psoriasis. ","Now I'll turn the call back over to Dave for some closing remarks. ","Dave Ricks ","Thank you, Dan. Before we go to Q&A, let me briefly some up the progress we've made in the fourth quarter of 2019 and the full year. ","We deliver impressive performance in Q4. Our revenue grew 8% as our newest medicines were again the catalyst for volume-based growth. Our worldwide prescription trends are strong and we are well positioned entering 2020 to continue our positive trajectory and deliver our 2020 financial guidance. ","We advanced our productivity agenda, controlling operating expenses, while investing behind key commercial growth drivers and our late stage pipeline. We grew sales in Q4 while keeping marketing, selling and administrative expenses flat versus Q4 \u201918, demonstrating our ability to drive margin expansion. ","We've made important pipeline progress in Q4, tapping a year that featured significant new additions for the Phase III portfolio, several positive readout in Phase III trials and a multitude of regulatory submissions and approvals. ","Finally we returned nearly $600 million to shareholders via the dividend and completed $300 million of share repurchases as well. ","As we shared during our 2020 financial guidance call last December, we are in the early stages of a period of sustained growth at Lilly. The balance of new medicines we plan to launch over the next five and the continued scaling of our newer medicines compared to our limited patent exposure sets up an exciting period ahead. ","We are pursuing new medicines in some of the most important diseases with both significant unmet medical need and sizable business opportunities. We are pleased with our finish to 2019 and our position of strength as we enter 2020, and the next decade of this company's history.","This concludes our prepared remarks. Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Kevin to moderate the Q&A. ","Kevin Hern ","Thanks Dave. We'd like to take questions from as many callers as possible, so we ask that you limit your questions to two for follow-up. Sean, please provide the instructions for the Q&A session and then we are ready for the first caller.","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is going to come from the line of Geoff Meacham from Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Geoff Meacham","Good morning guys. Thanks for the question. Just say we\u2019re on Taltz and one on the Olumiant Filing in AD. So for Taltz the growth has been solid, but what would you say could be a demand tipping point looking to 2020 and beyond. Is it a new contract agreement or is it a broader indication base. You have to invest more commercially. ","And then on the Olumiant Filing in AD, I wasn't sure if the effect of the 4 mega-dose changes the regulatory conversation in the U.S. Maybe you\u2019ve had an RA Indication since approval obviously, which was mostly focused on the 2 mega-indication and 2 mega approval but wasn\u2019t sure if that changes at all on the back of this new data. Thank you. ","Kevin Hern","Thanks Geoff. We\u2019ll go to Patrick for both of those questions. ","Patrik Jonsson ","Thank you very much. We are very pleased with the performance of the policy in the fourth quarter last year with the growth of growth of total RX with approximately 40%. If you look at the difference space its possible in dermatology despite the increased competition. We think we are holding ground very nicely and we are maintaining our total RX share of market in Q4 despite the increased competition. ","Also added to the body of evidence, we had a diverse strength by the IL-23, but we have gained demonstrated superiority on skin clearance; and that's the third study combined with Stelara and in Enbrel where we have again demonstrated superiority. So we are confident in the continued growth phase of dermatology. ","The biggest opportunity for us remains being in rheumatology where we \u2013 in Q4 announced the old IL-17 to demonstrate superiority versus humera in the SPIRIT-Head-to-Head (H2H) study, and we saw something \u2013 this consideration in Q4 in terms of new to brand and we are confident that we will continue to grow in the rheumatology space where there are a lot of opportunities for us. ","We also filed during the second half of last year the Non-Radiographic AxSpA, and that's an indication where we\u2019ll also see a lot of patients that are not being appropriately diagnosed and even if diagnosed, not appropriately treated. ","Lastly, both in dermatology and rheumatology, a huge amount of patients are still treated with [inaudible]. In Dermatology 40%, in rheumatology 70% and we believe that remains the biggest opportunity for all new assets to ensure that patients are being upgraded to new modern modifications and save the treatment. ","In terms of Olumiant, why we don't comment on regulatory actions for specific brands, we continue to explore options to get the 4mg dosage approved in the U.S.; however, in the light of most recent regulatory actions without the JAK inhibitors, we are also realistic in terms of our expectations to get four milligrams approved in the U.S. in the near term. ","But as Dave mentioned, we are very much encouraged by the 2 milligram data of Olumiant in atopic dermatitis and where we\u2019re demonstrating hitting our primary objective both in terms of at least 75% improvement on skin inflammation, but also in terms of patient reported outcomes, improvements on itching. So that is encouraging for us in terms of the Olumiant submission in the U.S. ","Kevin Hern","Thanks Patrick. Geoff, thanks for your questions. Next caller please. ","Operator","Thank you. The next question is going to come from the line of Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Chris Schott","Great! Thanks very much. First question was just on the quarterly progression of sales and earnings as we go through 2020. I think last year we saw depressed first quarter sales relative to the rest of the year that\u2019s surprised the street a bit. Should we expect a similar dating of sales in 2020 and are there any particular products we should be watching where I guess 2020 kind of resets of plans could impact those first quarter results. ","My second question was just on the Alzheimer's strategy more broadly. How would the approval or I guess not of Zagotenemab impact how you're thinking about your pending Alzheimer's readouts and development strategies from here. Thanks very much. ","A - Kevin Hern","Thanks Chris. We\u2019ll go to Josh for the first question and Dan for the second one. ","Josh Smiley ","Thanks Chris. If we look at 2020, you know we don't provide quarterly guidance, but if we look at sort of the trajectory of sale that we\u2019d expect, if you look at our guidance for the full year you know we're somewhere in the high single digits for sales growth. We\u2019d expect that kind of growth to be pretty consistent through the year, although keep in mind in Q1 we still will have a little bit more of the overhang from things like Cialis. So you might expect to see a little bit more sales growth through the year, but pretty consistent. ","On an absolute basis though Chris, we do always see sales in Q1 lower than Q4. One of that just has to do with shipping patterns and otherwise so \u2013 again, growth should look good in Q1 relative to the year. Absolute sales will be less. I think that is a trend that you see I'm sure across almost all companies. There's nothing unique going on there other than normal shipping patterns between Q4 and Q1. ","Dan Skovronsky ","Chris, thanks for your question on our Alzheimer's strategy. You know of course we like many others will be watching aducanumab closely, and of course we\u2019ll adapt our plans and thinking to meet wherever we see the regulatory bar placed, but I don't think you should expect us to pivot in our Alzheimer's strategy one way or another. ","We\u2019ve placed some pretty important bets. We are excited to see those readouts over time, both with Solanezumab, but also our own plaque clearing antibody Donanemab, as well as our anti-tau antibody that\u2019s in phase II. We also have a tau small molecule in phase I and other agents earlier in development. So we\u2019ll continue to progress those. We think we have smartly designed trials that will give us import readouts over time. ","A - Kevin Hern","Thanks Dan. Chris, thanks for your questions. Next caller please. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is going to come from Louise Chen from Cantor. Please go ahead.","Louise Chen","Hi, thanks for taking my questions here. So the first question I had for you is can you provide more color on what might be driving your stronger volume growth when compared to other companies out there in the space, and if this is durable over the longer term. ","And then my second question for you, is with this growing competition in atopic dermatitis, where do you see Lilly fitting into the evolving treatment paradigm. Thank you. ","Kevin Hern","Thank you. So we\u2019ll go to Josh for the first question and Patrick for the second. Thanks guys.","Josh Smiley ","Thanks Louise, good morning. I think in terms of volume growth, what we see at a corporate level is the function of our portfolios. We mention about a little bit less than half of our sales are coming from new products that we launched since 2014. 10 of those, they are all still in \u2013 very much in their growth phases; Trulicity growing at 31% for example, Taltz at 37%. ","So we've got a relatively young portfolio. We expect the volume gains that we saw in Q4 to be sustainable between 2020 and 2025 as we mentioned on our guidance call. We expect to see top tier revenue growth over that period. It'll be driven by volume gains; it'll be driven by that cohort of products, as well as the new launches that will expect over this period, including the three that we\u2019re planning for this year. You couple that going forward with last generic exposure, then probably most of the companies that you know we compete against or that you cover and I think that would certainly say to us that the volume gains we're seeing or something that we\u2019re planning for and think are sustainable. ","A - Kevin Hern","Thanks Josh, Patrick.","Patrik Jonsson ","Apparently it\u2019s estimated that approximately 18 million Americans are suffering from Atopic dermatitis and 10 million of those are suffering from severe to moderate Atopic dermatitis and the treatment opportunities are very limited. One is saying that they feel Atopic dermatitis is pretty much where psoriasis was 15 years ago. ","In the light of that we believe that we are extremely well positioned. As we shared, we are encouraged by the most recent data on Olumiant, both in the U.S. and outside the U.S. and we have submitted Olumiant for approval in Japan and EU and we\u2019ll take regulatory actions in 2020 here in the U.S. and we believe that Olumiant could definitely be an option for patients that are having fear of injection. ","And we're also excited about the announcement we made a few weeks ago about our intent to acquire Dermira, and lebrikizumab is the big driver of that deal and we see lebrikizumab based upon the phase II(b) data as the medicine will at least be competitive with Dupixent and we have an opportunity given the best in class differentiating on each. ","So overall we believe that we can play a very important role in the field of Atopic dermatitis. We built the first oral JAK inhibitor for patients of fear of injections and the potential best in class medicine in lebrikizumab.","A - Kevin Hern","Thanks Patrick. Louise, thanks for your questions. Next caller please. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Tim Anderson from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","I apologize, the next question then will come from the line of Umer Raffat from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Umer Raffat ","Hi, thanks so much for taking my two questions. Both of them are Kevin\u2019s favorite topic. ","So the first one is on the CNS penetrance of your GLP-1 and I have two parts on the first one. So there's feedback out there that Trulicity doesn't cross blood-brain barrier very much, perhaps in part because of its size. A, can you comment on that, and in that same question I also want to ask, tirzepatide does not have an IGG. So presumably, it should have good CNS penetration. I just want to make sure I hear your take on the CNS penetrant of both Trulicity and tirzepatide. ","Secondly, Dave perhaps for you, so the A4 trial in asymptomatic Alzheimer's, my understanding is it was fully enrolled in December 2017 and at this point it's already past two years in every single patient and by end of 2020 you would have hit a three year landmark in every single patient. So my question is, strategically thinking if regulators are being more accommodating of late. Wouldn\u2019t it make strategic sense to possibly consider taking an efficacy read at three years, because even at three years it's 2x the duration of all prior sola and aducanumab trials. Thank you very much. ","Kevin Hern","Thanks Umer for those questions. This is \u2013 Butler Bulldogs basketball is probably my favorite topic, but we don\u2019t cover that on the call; this is a close second though. We'll go to Dan for both of these. ","Dan Skovronsky ","Okay, great. Thanks very much. So with respect to CNS penetration of GLP ones, you're right that these are large molecular weight molecules. Actually both FC fusion molecules like Trulicity and also isolated peptides like tirzepatide. Those modifications to the peptides are what gives them the long half-life that enables once weekly injection and molecules of that size typically don't penetrate the blood brain barrier. ","Having said that, we don't see those attributes, blood brain barrier penetration as being important for the efficacy of this class of drugs as evidenced I think by the tremendous efficacy that we\u2019ve seen with Trulicity and unprecedented efficacy that we've seen with tirzepatide, so I think that addresses that.","With respect to A4, you're right that this is a longer duration trial and really I think any other large Alzheimer's trial has ever been. The reason for that though is because these patients are asymptomatic at the beginning of the trial, so they are very early in the disease course and it takes a great deal of time to let these patients progress in their disease course and it's only through progression of patients on the placebo group and hopefully differential, less progression of patients on therapy that we could hope to see an effective drug. So that's why the design includes such a long follow-up period.","Kevin Hern","Thanks Dan. Umer, thanks for your questions and we'll go to the next caller please. ","Operator","Thank you. And once again we\u2019re going to have a question from the line of Tim Anderson from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Tim Anderson","Hi! A question on your PD-1 with an event and really plans for that product outside the U.S. It seems like last summer when I talked to management it was really described as the China only opportunity with limited potential, but it seems that you may have pivoted in recent months and may have bigger plans to bring them in to other geographies, so I'm hoping you can give us your latest thinking.","And then second question is just on the Dian-Tu Alzheimer's trial confirming that we should see those results really any time, can you confirm that? And then just how do you view odds of success. It kind of seems to me that it's highly improbable that this will yield positive results for solo, but what are your views? Thank you. ","Kevin Hern","Thanks Tim. We\u2019ll go to Anne for the first question and Dan for the second.","Anne White","Well Tim, thanks for the question on Tyvyt and our business collaboration. So as you said, our current focus is on development and commercialization of Tyvyt in China, however it\u2019s been really important and a perfect strategic partner to us and so we're always open to discussing opportunities to expand that for mutual benefit. There's really not more we can say at this time. We're really pleased. ","I think as Josh and Dave mentioned, the performance of Tyvyt in China, it's been a remarkable story and really now as you know the only PD-1 that\u2019s included on the NRDL list and I think that demonstrates how the NHSA has recognized its clinical value and then we were able to share the great news that we had the first line non-squamous read out at interim that\u2019s positive, so we\u2019ll be planning to submit that this year and we expect additional read out in first and second line squamous this year with an event. So it's been a great product and we look forward to what more we can do here. But thanks for the question.","Kevin Hern","Thanks Anne. Dan?","Dan Skovronsky ","Yeah Tim, on DIAN, just reminded for everyone that this is dominantly inherited type of Alzheimer's. It's rare and sort of severe and fast progressing form of Alzheimer's disease where we testing solanezumab. Your question on timing of results, we don't have the data yet, but we do expect that this quarter. ","In terms of the odds of success, I think it's hard to speculate, but as you know this is a very small trials, small population is being studied and it is as I said a severe form of Alzheimer's. So those factors weigh against it, there is other factors that weight for it. We know that it\u2019s driven by mutations here and amyloid over production and has a relatively longer follow-up, but we\u2019ll just have to wait and see that data. ","Kevin Hern ","Thanks Dan. Tim thanks for your questions. Next caller please. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question then is coming from the line of Andrew Baum from Citi. Please go ahead.","Andrew Baum ","Thank you. A couple of questions. [inaudible]","Kevin Hern ","Hey Andrew, this is Kevin. Andrew, we are really having trouble hearing you and can't really pick up the question, other than we heard tirzepatide. ","Andrew Baum ","Is that any better? ","Kevin Hern ","No, not much, we\u2019ll try it. ","Andrew Baum ","My question is on tirzepatide, talking about your outcome trail. You are running a head-to-head trail versus Ozempic, which you described as a high bar. There is some literature on potentially GIP agonism could potentially be increased in cardiovascular, rather than decreasing it, given its evidence is a marker for heightened cardiovascular disease as well as some preclinical data. ","Perhaps you can talk to your thoughts on the relevant development literature and then second more broadly we\u2019d like to think that Lilly is perhaps second in place than many of your pears, in understanding the direction of this particular administration in terms of healthcare reforms. ","There has been some discussions about the IPI proposal could be expanded to include Medicare part D drugs rather than just part B. Perhaps you could share your thoughts on what you expect in that direction. Apologies for the long question? ","Kevin Hern","Thanks Andrew. We\u2019ll got to Dan for the question on tirzepatide and then Dave on the policy question. ","Dan Skovronsky","Yeah thanks. First of all, just a clarification that tirzepatide trial it had again against Trulicity. Look I think that there is a little bit of literature out there as you referenced about \u2013 it\u2019s actually GIP-1 but our thinking is really based on the clinical data we've already obtained with tirzepatide in the Phase II trials. ","I think everything we see in those trials, point to a large cardiovascular benefits for drug like this, and so that's the driver\u2019 that's what gives us confidence is the real clinical data with this molecule. The combination of GLP-1 and GLP-1 gives certain effects which we are able to see. So for example there improved day-1 C control and notably the very dramatic improvement on weight loss, which I think will drive cardiovascular benefits even higher than we saw in Trulicity. ","Kevin Hern","Thanks Dan. Dave. ","Dave Ricks","So on the policy front, we continue to advocate for change in the U.S. system because although we're in a \u2013 as an industry and certainly as Lilly a deflationary price environment those savings are not reaching consumers at the pharmacy counter. And so either through a combination of passing through a transparency of those discounts or insurance reform, we're for change. And our focus is primarily right now with the legislative pathway on both those fronts. There is one more vehicle probably left in this Congress to work on those, but progress is difficult in Congress. So we continue to advocate for change on the other patience though. ","As it relates to IPI, you know this proposal was part of the blueprint in spring of \u201918. It's been sitting out there for a while. We've yet to see any draft guidance for proposed rulemaking or any version of this in detail. There is always a lot of swirling rumors about it, including expanding it to other parts of government programs or changes to it in terms of the objectives. ","We see it largely as misguided, primarily because in Part B patients hardly have any cost sharing to begin with. So if we're worried about out of pocket costs for patients, IPI will do very little, it's mostly just a punitive measure against the industry going back to decisions made on European pricing sometimes decades ago. It won't probably change those prices in Europe if that\u2019s the present goal, and it certainly won't change the affordability equation for patients in the U.S. So we oppose it for those reasons. ","That said, it's administrative potential action and want to read it if it comes out and decide what to do from there, but it pretty much is a difficult thing to support for our industry and you\u2019ll probably see pharma universally oppose it. So we'll wait and see. ","Kevin Hern","Thanks Dave. Andrew thanks for your questions. Next caller please. ","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Seamus Fernandez from Guggenheim. Please go ahead. ","Seamus Fernandez","Thanks for the question. So maybe that the first question is really for Josh. Josh, can you just help us understand the progression of margins as we move through the balance of next year, or sorry this year in 2020. ","When I look at the original guidance from this year, I think you guys had said 28% was the target. I think ultimately we ended up at 27.2% at the final point in the year. But on the guidance call in December, you had \u2013 you stated and reiterated the 31% target. Can you just help us understand the past to that 31% just because the second half of this year I think kind of came in below investors\u2019 expectations to some degree, and we're just trying to understand a little bit better the very strong moves in margins going higher. Obviously the pieces of guidance makes sense. I think we're just trying to understand the path as we move through the balance of the year. ","And then the second question. You know that the pegilodecakin update, thanks for that. Appreciate the understanding and the challenges. Can maybe \u2013 Jay can just sort of update us on his thoughts and also Dan, could update us on your thoughts for the growth of the oncology development portfolio and directionally where you're headed? Thanks. ","Kevin Hern","Josh, and then Dan. ","Josh Smiley ","Great! Thanks Seamus. In terms of margin this year, again we reiterated that we are on track for 31%. And the one thing that we have said is Q1 will likely be below 31% that\u2019s mostly a function of the less absolute sales that I talked about on a prior question, on top of a relatively fixed OpEx absolute amount. ","So I think as you look or model OpEx for the year, we see that it's pretty constant on an absolute base quarter-over-quarter. Of course some small variation, and then you'll see absolute sales dollars on a quarter over quarter basis grow. So we don't expect to be at 31% in Q1, but that\u2019s - again that the function of the dynamics of the growth through the quarters. ","Remember though in terms of how to get there in totals for the year, we said for 2019 that we would grow our R&D at a unusual growth rate in in 2019 as we scale up programs like tirzepatide and Mirikizumab. In 2020 those programs are running at, you know more like full speed, we are able to bring and a an asset like Dermira and keep that with you know relatively smaller growth rate and R&D. ","So I think we are confident that the sales growth that we are seeing, that we talked about in Q4 and should persist for the year on top of a slower growing OpEx that we can predict and manage, will get us to 31% and again I wouldn't be too concerned in Q1 if we are not at that level, but you should expect it as we move through the year. ","Kevin Hern","Thanks Josh, Dan. ","Dan Skovronsky ","Thanks for the question on oncology strategy. Of course on the last call we talked about our Loxo Oncology at Lilly and how that's changed oncology strategy and we're quite pleased with the progress that we made on executing against that strategy. You can see some portfolio changes in our pipeline update and we also talked about the three key early stage programs, 305, KRAS and SERD, all of which are progressing in the clinic. ","While we said we're going to focus on a lot of our resources on high probability, biology that's well understood, bets like those, we will also from time to time continue to pursue more novel biology, higher risk, high reward bets like Pegilodecakin was and that will be a smaller part of our portfolio in the future. ","Kevin Hern","Thanks Dan. Seamus, thanks for your question. Next caller please. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Risinger from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","David Risinger","Thanks very much. I have two questions, first just going back to the high level on GLP-1s and Alzheimer's. Novo has recently conveyed enthusiasm about the potential for GLP-1 treatment in Alzheimer's. Could you just comment on your view of whether GLP-1 treatment over a few years can actually change the progression of Alzheimer's? And then second with respect to hide those Trulicity, could you please frame what we should focus on when we see the Phase III data and your planned positioning of that product. Thank you. ","Kevin Hern","Thanks Dave. We\u2019ll go to Dan for the first question and then Mike for the second one. ","Dan Skovronsky ","Yeah thanks. Of course we are aware of the comments that Novo has make on GLP-1 and Alzheimer's disease and the potential there. Look forward to seeing data from that first trial. Look I think we know that GLP-1 treatment has beneficial cardiovascular outcomes, including we've seen reductions on stroke, probably that's a tip of the iceberg and there's other micro infarcts that are decreased by GLP-1 therapy. That could overtime contribute to a slower rate of cognitive decline. Is there a direct effective of GLP-1s on Alzheimer\u2019s pathology? I think that's not yet known. ","So we'll watch how the field evolves. If it turns out that there are great opportunities, I think we have the best in class incretin in the form of tirzepatide and we'd be opened to future opportunities for it. ","Kevin Hern","Thanks Dan, Mike. ","Mike Mason","David, thanks for your question on our favorite subject. It proves we had another great quarter, growing by 32% on volume of 29% on revenue. We are still quite excited about the overall GLP market growth. The 52 week rate was at 29.7 while the monthly rate in December was at 31.5. So the market continues to grow and Trulicity continues to hold up in a very strong market share leadership position outpacing TRS class growth in the phase of some of the type of product launches. ","So we expect that both the new Trulicity rewind, as well as the high dose label enhancements will continue to drive class growth as well as certify our market leadership position place. So we're excited about that. I think as you take a look at the results of that, take a look at increased are A1C results, as well as the weight loss results. ","And what we think is the strength of Trulicity is the fact that you get little more benefits by having powerful efficacy simply delivered and this will just give people using Trulicity another reason to stay on it. ","Kevin Hern","Thanks Mike. David, thanks for your question. Next caller please. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Terence Flynn from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. ","Terence Flynn","Great, good morning and thanks for taking the questions. The first one is on tirzepatide and the CVOT trial. I was wondering if you can share any more details on this states or powering assumptions there, as well as the discontinuation rate that you're assuming in the arms of the trial. ","And then for Emgality you mentioned you know look into the next phase of growth here in the primary care market. What are some of the markers beyond obviously sales that we should look to you know gauging successful uptake there and then any thoughts on potential impact from oral CGRP? Thank you. ","Kevin Hern","Okay thanks. We\u2019ll go to Dan for tirzepatide and then Mike and then Patrick for the oral CGRP question. ","Dan Skovronsky","Yeah, thinks for your question asking for more detail on the tirzepatide SURPASS-CVOT trial design. I think at this moment we don't sort of comment on any of the finer details around clinical trial design and dropout rates. But I would say that having a trial like this where it\u2019s a head to head with two great active drugs, one on each arm should be a very compelling opportunity for enrolling physicians and a great opportunity for treatment for patients as well. So I think those kinds of factors should help with both enrollment and retention in the trial. ","Kevin Hern","Go ahead Mike. ","Mike Mason","I think as we look at the opportunity and really learn from what providers and payers want, they want active competitors. I think this provides a lot of value and lot of insights into the incremental value of one product over another product. And so obviously doing a head to head trial versus Trulicity is a bold bat, but I think it really reinforces the confidence we have in tirzepatide in its population. So we're very excited about the study. It is a bold bat, but one that we are very excited about the potential of product and CVOT. ","Kevin Hern","Thanks Patrick. ","Patrik Jonsson","Thank you. If you look at on the prevention market with currency 6 million patients eligible for prevention treatment in the U.S., but only 3 million of those are being treated. So that's a big opportunity for us with increased competition in the market place as well to drive patient activation. And specifically for Emgality, if you look from the prescriber base today, its relatively limited and only 15% of our targets are currently, regularly prescribing Emgality, so that's why were we see a tremendous opportunity both in specialty care, as well as in primary care. ","In terms of the oral CGRP, I think it\u2019s important to have in mind that they are only approved or will be approved for the treatment of acute migraine this year and the prevention indications coming later on. We are very confident with the profile of Emgality, particularly taking into account that we are now the market leader and the preferred CGRP in the marketplace and particularly with a differentiation, we have been labeled with both efficacy 57 till 5 and 100% level and also the convenience at the device offers from the same device platform as Trulicity. ","The oral CGRPs will be competing at a huge pace and we are also very excited about the announcement that was the pre-publication notice from the DEA that was publicly displayed this morning and will result in an announcement in the Federal Register tomorrow, enabling us to bring Reyvow to the marketplace, probably late next week. And that\u2019s where we have a tremendous opportunity to bring more value in the space of acute migraine and for the first time we\u2019ll be able to talk about complete pain elimination already after two hours with one single dose of Reyvow and not just compete pain elimination, but also complete elimination of bothersome symptoms such as sun phobia, light sensitivity and nausea. ","So we believe that we have very well positioned us in the preventive space as well as the acute phase but patient activation will be key and that's something that would be beneficial with also new entrants in the marketplace.","Kevin Hern","Thank you, Patrick. Terence, thanks for your questions. Next caller please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steve Scala from Cowen. Please go ahead. ","Steve Scala","Thank you. I have a couple of questions. I'll take the other side of an earlier question and suggest it would be surprising if DIAN-TU didn't hit it end point given the signal you saw in the expedition trials and the fact that DIAN-TU is testing a higher dose in a more homogeneous population for a longer time with the tailor made end-point. ","So Dan, I'm trying to understand your pessimism and maybe you could please tell us on which of the points that I stated you disagree? And then there are four components to the primary endpoint. Do you need to hit all four to achieve success? Thank you. ","Kevin Hern","Thanks Steve, Dan. ","Dan Skovronsky","Okay Steve. So look most of the commons you said are right. The importance of those factors in the outcome of the study is what we don't now, and there are other factors as I said earlier going against us here. The one that should give anyone the most pause I think is the small sample size and Alzheimer's trials are \u2013 I think even in large trials notorious for surprising us because of the heterogeneity of the fact and variability in the outcome measures. So its factors like that that could make it difficult to really know what is true. ","Look I still think it's regardless an interesting scientific question, a partner experiment we'll look forward to seeing the data. ","With respect to the specifics around the composite, I think the nature of a composite is that you have to hit the overall composite score as the primary endpoint, which could be driven by the various sub-measures or not, but as you point out this was custom made for this trial. ","Kevin Hern","Thanks Dan. Steve thank for your questions. Next caller please. ","Operator","We have a question from the line of Navin Jacob from UBS. Please go ahead. ","Navin Jacob ","Hi yes, thanks for taking the questions. Just on Verzenio, Pfizer has slightly delayed its IBRANCE adjuvant trial PALLAS to early 2021. Wondering \u2013 and they highlight the event rate progressing much slower. Wondering how relative to your expectations the event rate has been progressing and MONARCH? And is the time line still for an early 2021 readout, and any color on the potential for an interim would be appreciated? That's on Verzenio. ","And then just on Humalog, I think your press release suggested that pricing in the U.S. benefit from a better segment mix. Is that because of the volume shift to the Humalog authorized generic and that\u2019s assuming that the authorized generic is being recorded within the Humalog revenue line. I just wanted any if you can provide any clarity on that. Thank you so much. ","Kevin Hern","Great, thank you. We\u2019ll go to Anne for the question on Verzenio and Mike for the question on Humalog. ","Anne White","Navin, thanks for the question on Verzenio. So as you know we have not disclosed any interim analysis. Now this is an event driven trial similar to PALLAS, but our estimates make us quite confident that we are looking at a readout in the first half of 2021. So we continue to expect that and as you know the trial unrolled remarkably well and so we're able to roll ahead of schedule, which helps obviously drive [inaudible] rates for that. And again we specifically designed this trial with a high risk population and that was both a strategy of where we believe that Verzenio would really different, but as well it drove the speed of the trial. So again we feel quite confident in that. ","As you know the positive MONARCH-2 overall trial results, particularly as we saw those with primary resistance and visceral disease, really an eight month survival benefit in the patients with visceral disease really reinforce our confidence and the potential, the success of MONARCH. So we designed it with that high risk population and really used what we think are thoughtful selection factors the physicians use today to make prescribing decisions in that adjuvant setting. So things like the number of nodes involved, the tumor size and the measure of proliferation and so we feel quite confident in the design of the study and again look forward to the readout in 2021. ","Kevin Hern","Thanks Anne, Mike. ","Mike Mason","Thanks for your question on Humalog. The biggest drive in Humalog segment mix is the fact that with Humalog uptake they are taking volume away from Humalog in Medicaid since our Medicaid rebate rates are essentially 100%, that TRx decline actually doesn't have \u2013 had a flat to positive impact on that revenues for Humalog. ","Navin Jacob ","And just to confirm the AG products are consolidated into the Humalog. ","Kevin Hern","Thanks Mike. Navin, thanks for your questions. We\u2019ll go to Dave for the close. ","Dave Ricks ","Okay, thank you all. I appreciate the participation in today's earnings call and your interest in Eli Lilly and Company. ","2019 was a strong year for the company and we anticipate another great year in 2020. We remain focused on executing our innovation based strategy to bring new medicines to patients and create value for our shareholders.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Vice President, Investor Relations, Phil Johnson. Please go ahead.","Philip Johnson","Good morning. Thank you for joining us for Eli Lilly & Co.'s Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. I'm Phil Johnson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Joining me are John Lechleiter, our Chairman, President and CEO; Derica Rice, our Chief Financial Officer; Dr. Jan Lundberg, our President of Lilly Research Laboratories; Dave Ricks, President of our Lilly Bio-Medicines business; Enrique Conterno, President of our Diabetes business; and Ilissa Rassner and Travis Coy from the Investor Relations team.","During this conference call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements that are based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors, including those listed on Slide 3 and those outlined in our latest forms 10-K and 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It is not intended to be promotional and is not sufficient for prescribing decisions.","We're very pleased with our performance in the second quarter 2012. In the face of significant reductions in revenue and earnings due to the Zyprexa patent expiration, Lilly employees around the world continue to focus on execution. They delivered results that position us to raise our 2012 financial guidance, and it places us on track to meet or exceed our financial minimum goals through 2014.","Let's begin today's call with a review of events that have taken place since our last earnings call. First, 2 important decisions from Washington. In a much-anticipated ruling, the Supreme Court upheld most aspects of the Affordable Care Act, and the FDA Safety and Improvement Act was signed into law, which included the reauthorization of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act or PDUFA.","From a commercial perspective, Cymbalta received pediatric exclusivity from the U.S. FDA. As a result U.S. exclusivity for Cymbalta will expire in December 2013, and Amyvid became available to imaging centers in many U.S. cities across the country.","On the regulatory front, the U.S. FDA approved Erbitux in combination with FOLFIRI as first-line treatment for patients with KRAS mutation-negative EGFR-expressing metastatic colorectal cancer, and Europe's CHMP issued a positive opinion recommending approval of Jentadueto for use along with diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes who are inadequately controlled by metformin or sulfonylurea or a combination of both, as well as those who were already taking linagliptin and metformin. I'm pleased to report that we just recently received European Commission approval for this indication.","In clinical news, we presented Phase II data on 3 compounds. At the American Diabetes Association scientific sessions, we presented data on our novel basal insulin analog from Phase II studies in patients with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. At the meeting of the American Society of Hypertension, we presented the data from a large Phase II ambulatory blood pressure monitoring safety study of dulaglutide. And along with Incyte at the European League Against Rheumatism's Annual European Congress of Rheumatology, we presented 12-week data from the Phase IIb trial of baricitinib in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis.","We believe that these Phase II data support the decisions we've made to move our novel basal insulin analog and dulaglutide into Phase III testing. And in the case of baricitinib, if supported by the 24-week data, of moving that molecule into Phase III testing in rheumatoid arthritis later this year or early next year.","In other clinical news, we also announced the first of 2 pivotal trials for pomaglumetad  methionil as monotherapy therapy for schizophrenia did not meet its primary efficacy endpoints. Interim data from the second pivotal monotherapy trial and final data from a Phase II adjunctive trial are expected later this year and will inform future development plans for the molecule.","At the meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, we presented overall survival data from the Phase III PARAMOUNT trial with Alimta induction therapy followed by Alimta's maintenance therapy. Patients on the Alimta continuation maintenance arm achieved a median overall survival of 13.9 months from randomization compared to 11.0 months from randomization for patients on the placebo arm. We expect FDA action later this year on our sNDA for this indication.","There are a few other important events over the past few months. Our Board of Directors authorized the resumption of a share repurchase program begun in 2000. We expect to purchase the remaining 420 million in shares by the end of this year. Following the completion of the current program, we anticipate resuming share repurchases with size and timing subject to board approval.","The district court judge provided a ruling in the Markman hearing held as part of litigation on Alimta's method-of-use patent, which expires in the U.S. in 2022. The judge's ruling was in line with Lilly's interpretation of the 2 disputed terms: \"patient\" and \"vitamin B12.\" The trial will now move into the discovery phase. A trial date has not yet been set.","Finally, we took a number of actions to reinforce Lilly's vibrant long-term presence in China. Specifically, we opened a Lilly China Research and Development Center focused on discovering innovative diabetes medicines tailored to the Chinese population. We inaugurated the Lilly China East Lake [ph]  Manufacturing site, which will provide insulin capacity for anticipated growth in our sales of Humulin and Humalog. And we announced an expanded collaboration with Novast Laboratories, a generic and specialty pharmaceutical company based in Nantong, China. Lilly will increase its equity position in Novast by $20 million, while Novast will increase the manufacturing capacity at its Nantong site over the next several years. We expect this expanded collaboration will enhance our efforts to build a portfolio of Lilly-branded generic medicines in China.","Now let's move on to discuss our financial performance. As we've done on previous calls, we'll focus our comments on the non-GAAP results, which we believe provide insights into the underlying trends in our business. This view excludes certain items such as restructuring charges, asset impairments and other special charges.","Turning to the income statement on Slide 7, you can see that revenue in Q2 was $5.6 billion, a decline of 10% from Q2 of last year. This decrease in revenue was due to the loss of patent exclusivity for Zyprexa in most major markets outside of Japan, partially offset by growth from other products. Excluding Zyprexa outside of Japan, the rest of our worldwide revenue grew 8%.","Gross margin as a percent of revenue decreased to 0.9 percentage points from 80.4% to 79.5%. The gross margin percent was negatively affected by lower Zyprexa sales. However, this was largely offset by the impact of foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold. Excluding this effect of FX from both 2011 and 2012, gross margin as a percent of revenue declined by nearly 4 percentage points from 81.7% in Q2 of 2011 to 77.9% in Q2 of 2012. As in past quarters, we've included a supplementary slide providing our gross margin percent for the last 10 quarters with and without this FX effect.","Moving down the income statement, this quarter's total operating expense, defined as the sum of R&D and SG&A, declined 2%. Within operating expenses, marketing, selling and administrative expenses fell 5%, while R&D expenses grew 5%. The reduction in marketing, selling and administrative expenses was driven by lower marketing expenses and, to a lesser extent, by lower administrative expenses. The growth in R&D expense was largely driven by higher late-stage clinical trial costs.","Other income and deductions was a modestly smaller net expense in this year's quarter. In Q2 last year, we recognized a write-down in the value of the liprotamase that was only partially offset by a gain on sale of investment securities.","Our tax rate was 22.1% this quarter, an increase of 1.2 percentage points from Q2 2011, primarily due to the expiration of the R&D tax credit at the end of 2011. At the bottom line, our non-GAAP EPS decreased 30% to $0.83 per share.","In summary, our Q2 results clearly reflect Zyprexa patent expirations outside of Japan. At the same time, we've continued to drive revenue growth for many products and prudently managed expenses in the rest of our business, putting us on a solid financial footing going forward. We'll continue that same focus, and we'll rigorously prioritize investments to achieve our midterm financial targets and position the company to return to growth post 2014.","Slide 8 shows our reported income statement, while Slide 9 provides a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS. Additional details about our reported earnings are available in today's earnings press release.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Ilissa.","Ilissa Rassner","Thanks, Phil. As you can see on Slide 10, the total revenue decline of 10% for the quarter was driven by a negative volume impact of 9% and a negative foreign exchange impact of 2%, partially offset by a favorable price impact of 1%. By geography, you'll notice that U.S. volume decreased 20%. This was entirely due to Zyprexa sales erosion. Excluding olanzapine from both 2011 and 2012, volume in the rest of our U.S. business was up about 1.5%.","Similarly, in Europe, the volume decline of 12% was entirely due to the Zyprexa patent expiration. Excluding Zyprexa from both 2011 and 2012, volume growth for the rest of our European products was 6%.","The year-on-year European price change of negative 8% was also heavily influenced by Zyprexa. Excluding Zyprexa, European price declined 3%. Historically, we've experienced a 1% to 2% price decline in Europe. So this 3% decline confirms that we've not seen significant new austerity measures that impact our products.","Staying in Europe, accounts receivable, particularly in Southern Europe, has been a hot topic lately. And thinking about our exposure, keep in mind that the majority of our European sales are to private sector wholesalers. Payments by these customers have remained timely throughout the European crisis. A smaller portion of our sales are to government entities, particularly sales to hospitals. Receivables from these customers have been and continue to be immaterial to our financial position. Currently, our European receivables and the percent of receivables that are overdue are lower than they've been for many years. Given the economic situation, we will continue to closely monitor and manage our European receivables.","Turning to Japan, robust volume growth of 18% was driven primarily by Forteo, Alimta and Zyprexa, while the negative 5% price impact reflects a full quarter of the biannual price decreases, with Alimta and Gemzar seeing the largest impact.","Within the ROW line, I'd highlight continued strong growth in China, which grew 28% this quarter, with strong growth across multiple products, most notably Humalog, Humulin and Zyprexa, as well as Alimta, Cialis and Cymbalta. More generally, emerging market sales declined 3%, driven by a 5% decline from weaker foreign currencies. Excluding FX, Emerging Markets' revenue grew 2% despite a significant impact of generics, particularly in Brazil and Mexico.","As we discussed when providing 2012 guidance in early January, in 2012, we expect generics to negatively affect our emerging market sales by about $250 million, or roughly 10% of 2011 Emerging Markets sales. Excluding the effect of generics in Q2, our Emerging Markets business would have grown 12% in performance.","Elanco Animal Health once again delivered strong growth, with volume increasing 26%. Driving the strong quarter were continued growth of Trifexis, the inclusion of Janssen and ChemGen animal health sales and continued strong demand for our food annual products. Elanco continues to outperform the broader animal health market and is poised to deliver double-digit income growth during the YZ years and beyond.","Finally, the 13% decrease in collaboration and other revenue is due to the transfer of U.S. exenatide rights to Amylin. Excluding exenatide, collaboration and other revenue grew 22% in the quarter.","Slide 11 shows the year-on-year growth of select line items of our non-GAAP income statement, with and without the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates. Before I run through the specific numbers, however, I want to highlight that despite weaker foreign currencies, FX contributed positively to EPS growth in Q2. This is because the negative effect of FX on our revenue was more than offset by the positive effect of FX on operating expenses and on international inventories sold that flows through cost of sales. As we've discussed in the past, this effect on cost of goods sold provides a near-term natural hedge against movements in FX rates. Getting into the details, I'll focus on the second column of numbers since the numbers in the first column are the same as those on Slide 7.","In Q2, FX movements reduced growth in revenue and operating expenses by only a couple of percentage points. You can see that excluding FX, revenue declined 8% and operating expenses were flat. While FX had a relatively modest impact on revenue and operating expenses, that was not the case for cost of goods sold. As I mentioned earlier, cost of goods sold was significantly affected by the impact of FX on international inventories sold. Specifically in Q2 of last year, this FX affect substantially increased cost of goods sold, while in this year's second quarter, it substantially decreased cost of goods sold. It was this affect that drove cost of sales as reported to decrease 7% year-on-year.","Excluding FX, cost of sales grew 10%. Compensation and benefits and depreciation make up the majority of our manufacturing expenses. And these items actually declined versus last year. The 10% performance increase in cost of goods sold was driven by a host of miscellaneous items. At the bottom line, you can see that excluding FX, Q2 EPS declined 37%.","For your information, on Slide 12, we've provided the year-on-year growth of select line items of our reported income statement, with and without the effect of foreign exchange rates.","Next, I'll provide a brief pipeline update before turning the call over to Derica.","Slide 13 shows our pipeline as of July 15. Changes since our last earnings call are highlighted, with green arrows showing progression and red arrows showing attrition. You'll see that we began Phase II testing of our once-daily oral beta-secretase inhibitor for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. In addition, we began Phase II testing of 2 potential oncology medicines. One is the JAK2 inhibitor Jan discussed at last June's investment community meeting, while the other is a Chk1 inhibitor. And we began Phase I testing of potential medicines for osteoarthritis and chronic kidney disease.","Finally, we terminated development of a Phase I diabetes molecule. We believe our pipeline of 12 potential new medicines in Phase III testing, 8 of which are biotech molecules, spanning oncology, diabetes, neuroscience and autoimmune diseases, positions us for growth post 2014.","Now I'll turn the call over to Derica to cover some of the key events for 2012, our financial guidance and some closing comments before we open the call for Q&A.","Derica?","Derica W. Rice","Thanks, Ilissa. As I've have done in the past, I'll start with the progress update on key events we've highlighted for 2012. The green check marks show what we've achieved so far this year, including regulatory approval of Amyvid and of new indications or line extensions for Trajenta and Erbitux, as well as important data disclosures for Alimta, dulaglutide, ixekizumab and our novel basal insulin analog.","In the remainder of 2012, we anticipate an FDA decision on Alimta as continuation maintenance therapy for patients with non-squamous, non-small cell lung cancer. We also could begin Phase III trials for evacetrapib, our CETP inhibitor, as well as for baricitinib, our oral JAK1\/JAK2 inhibitor for rheumatoid arthritis in partnership with Incyte. In addition, we expect to compete and disclose data from a number of important Phase III trials, including the EXPEDITION studies with solanezumab for Alzheimer's disease; the TRILOGY study with Effient and ACS medically managed patients; and the POINTBREAK study with Alimta, a non-squamous, non-small cell lung cancer.","We will also complete a number of the Phase III trials for dulaglutide, and in collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim, for empagliflozin. We expect to disclose results from some of these trials at the ADA in 2013. And we plan to disclose 24-week data from the Phase IIb trial of baricitinib at a medical meeting later this year.","As outlined in our press release, we've updated our 2012 financial guidance. This update takes into account the impact of weaker foreign currencies, strong sales performance for Cymbalta, Cialis Evista, Forteo, Alimta and Elanco and the expectation that OUS [ph]  Rights for exenatide transfer in 2013 and not in 2012. Our guidance does not assume accelerated repayment of Amylin's revenue-sharing obligation.","In terms of the individual line items, we still project revenue to be between $21.8 billion and $22.8 billion. Gross margin as a percent of revenue is now projected to be approximately 78%. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses are now forecast to be between $7.3 billion and $7.7 billion. R&D expenses are still expected to be between $5 billion and $5.3 billion.","OID is now expected to be in the range of a net deduction of $75 million to a net income of $50 million. The tax rate is still expected to be approximately 21%. This assumes the R&D tax credit is passed before year end and is made retroactive to January 1. We believe it is likely that this will occur in the fourth quarter and will result in a meaningful EPS benefit in Q4 as our Q4 tax rate will be significantly lower than in Q3 or the first half of the year. Driven primarily by stronger underlying sales performance that offsets the negative effect of FX, as well as by the positive effect of FX on cost of goods sold, EPS is now expected to be in the range of $3.30 to $3.40 per share. Finally, we still expect capital expenditures to be roughly $800 million.","Now slide 16 provides a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS for 2011, and the associated growth rates from these numbers to our 2012 guidance. Now looking beyond 2012, we've built a solid foundation to bridge this period of patent expirations and return to sustainable growth post 2014. Since 2009, we provided you with our minimum financial performance goals through 2014 and mile markers to track our progress. We said we expect annual revenue to be at least $20 billion, net income to be at least $3 billion and operating cash flow to be at least $4 billion. We continue to hold these goals.","This will position us to fund the R&D that will drive our future growth, recapitalize our physical assets and engage in opportunistic business development, while paying the dividend at least at its current level. Now we said that at our top priority was to replenish and advance our pipeline and that we expected to have at least 10 assets in Phase III testing by the end of 2011. As you know, we finished last year with 12 assets in Phase III, including 4 in diabetes, 3 in oncology, 3 in neuroscience and 2 in autoimmune. We also have more than 20 assets in Phase II testing and expect to maintain a robust Phase III portfolio, which gives us the confidence that we can deliver a more sustainable flow of innovative medicines than in the recent past.","As I mentioned, in the coming months we could begin Phase III testing for evacetrapib and baricitinib, both of which have generated very encouraging Phase II data. We also said that we would invest to drive growth in Japan, emerging markets and Elanco, as well as in brands not losing patent protection during this period, brands like Alimta, Cialis, Forteo and our insulins. We've continued to deliver strong growth in these areas.","Collectively, Japan, emerging markets and Elanco grew over 11% in Q2, which was nearly 14% excluding FX, and now represent 30% of our total corporate revenue, up from 24% in Q2 of last year. In total, Alimta, Cialis, Forteo and our insulins grew 5% in Q2 or 8% excluding FX.","Finally, we said that we would improve productivity across our business, reducing our cost structure to help fund R&D. We exceeded our goals of reducing our projected 2011 costs by $1 billion and reducing our headcount by 5,500, excluding strategic additions. We've put in place the fundamental building blocks necessary to overcome our patent expirations and return to growth.","Now today I'd like to discuss for the first time at a high level our outlook for our financial performance in years beyond 2014. Hopefully, this will provide you with insight into how we view our prospects and how we intend to manage our business. At the highest level, we anticipate a return to revenue and income growth post 2014, fueled in large part by our pipeline. This growth, combined with leveraging our existing infrastructure and managing cost, should lead to expanding margins.","More specifically, post 2014, we expect to return to levels of R&D spend as a percent of revenue that are more consistent with our historical averages, in the 18% to 20% range. Just as we don't intend to reduce our investment in R&D due to temporary reductions of revenue from patent expirations, we will not increase our investment in R&D at the same pace as revenue as we return to growth post 2014. We believe this will be sufficient to support our innovation-based strategy.","For SG&A, it's reasonable to expect that within a few years post 2014, we'll move more in line with the industry averages, in the range of 28% to 30% of revenue. We've made important investments in commercial infrastructure that we intend to leverage in the coming years. For example, we've expanded the commercial footprint of our diabetes business. With the anticipated launch of some or all of our 4 Phase III diabetes molecules, we'll be able to leverage this investment to expand margins. We've made similar infrastructure investments in Japan, China and Elanco that we also expect to leverage to drive future revenue growth and expand margins.","Now this expected expansion will be helped by anticipated revenue growth. However, I want to emphasize that expense management will play a significant role and that we aren't waiting until 2014 or 2015 to take action.","As we've discussed in the past, in our manufacturing operations, we're in the midst of implementing a process technology agenda to standardize along common platforms for insulins and devices. By 2017, and without building a new manufacturing plant, we expect to double capacity to meet projected demands of our entire range of insulins while reducing capital requirements, reducing unit cost and improving insulin gross margin by several percentage points.","On the commercial side of our business, we're taking steps in Europe to respond to difficult market conditions for branded pharmaceuticals to better position Lilly to successfully market our future product portfolio and to optimize future profitability across the continent. While Europe will continue to be an important market for Lilly, we expect it to decline in value, driven by the difficult macroeconomic environment, faster generic erosion than in the past and excessive hurdles for reimbursement and access of new products. In the coming years, we also expect our product portfolio to become more focused on specialty care products than on primary care products.","To respond to this external environment and to our evolving portfolio, we're streamlining certain European operations. Specifically, we're simplifying the organization from 12 to 5 geographic hubs, giving us critical mass and delivering efficiencies across markets. In addition, we'll organize marketing, medical and other commercial support functions into Pan-European therapeutic communities. These changes will create a more focused organization, one able to respond effectively to customer needs. We anticipate that these changes will deliver substantial savings in the coming years.","Now to sum up, we continue to execute the plan we first outlined for you in December of 2009. We've been hitting many of our mileposts and remaining on track to meet or exceed our financial targets, and we're approaching these next 2 years with the same diligence, focus and commitment as the past 2 years.","When we prepared for the Zyprexa patent expiration, we took actions early to position Lilly to overcome the challenge posed by the loss of revenue and income just when we needed to fund our maturing pipeline. We're now applying the same disciplined approach as we prepare for the Cymbalta patent expiration in the U.S. at the end of 2013, and for our return to growth and expanding margins post 2014.","With more than 30 assets in Phase II and Phase III, we have tremendous opportunities ahead of us, and we're determined to make the most of them.","In closing, I want to again recognize my Lilly colleagues for their resolve in facing head on the challenge of the Zyprexa patent expiration. They've continued to deliver solid financial results in those areas of our business not affected by patent expirations and have been diligently executing our strategy to replenish and advance our pipeline, to drive growth in our on-patent brands and in Elanco, Japan and emerging markets, and to drive productivity gains across all areas of our business. The progress that we've made to date positions us to meet or exceed our midterm financial minimum goals and has given our management team and board the confidence to resume our share repurchase program.","As I outlined, we expect the margin compression caused by our patent expirations to be temporary. Post 2014, we anticipate revenue growth and expense management to expand margins. We remain committed to our innovation-based strategy, and we believe it is the best strategy to create value for shareholders. Over the next 18 months, we'll generate a significant amount of clinical data that will help you better gauge our longer-term growth potential. We'll keep you updated on our progress.","This concludes our prepared remarks, and now we'll take your questions. Operator, first caller, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] So our first question will come from the line of Tony Butler with Barclays.","Charles Anthony Butler - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Two questions. Derica, you did make a comment about implementation and standardization for insulins and devices that would actually double capacity for insulin. I wonder if you could flush that out more. And does that actually imply or does that also include that the basal insulin needs to be on the market in order for gross margins to improve? And then my second question, which is totally separate, is you had previously given guidance that Elanco profit would double in YZ. And I wondered if you could actually flush that out a little bit. What -- I mean, I understand the word double, but can you give us some idea of the magnitude of -- in absolute numbers?","Philip Johnson","Tony, this is Phil. Since we do have Enrique Conterno with us, we'll actually have him address your first question on the insulin manufacturing agenda and then come back to Derica for the Elanco profit expansion.","Enrique A. Conterno","Tony, yes, it does include the full range of insulin. So as we think about our manufacturing plant, they will have the capability of being able to make the full range of insulin that we have available today and the ones that we plan to make available in the future. As you can appreciate, this provides significant flexibility for us. And as Derica said, we will be able to support twice the current demand that we have with the same manufacturing footprint that we have today.","Derica W. Rice","Tony, this is Derica. In regards to Elanco, yes, we still expect to double the size of our Elanco business over this YZ time period, this 4- to 5-year period. And at the same time, we're also expanding margins. So if you were to look, we have gone from about 18% to about 25% profit margins in our Elanco business over this time frame as well. So they're performing quite well.","Operator","From ISI, we'll go to the line of Mark Schanberg (sic) [Schoenebaum].","Mark J. Schoenebaum - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","It's Mark Schoenebaum. I had one question perhaps for Derica, and that is I think a question on a lot of people's minds. The guidance is predicated on both revenue growth post 2014 as well as expense management, and so I guess the question on everyone's mind, including mine, is what if your revenue doesn't grow or certainly doesn't grow very much? Should the investor community still expect that you'll be able to honor your new R&D and SG&A expense guidance? And then sort of the partner question I suppose is, is it realistic to expect that you could, if needed, reduce R&D and SG&A dollars, not just the percent of sales? And then finally just a quick one, you've said that you expect your Phase III pipeline to -- the probability of success to be in near industry averages. I was wondering what your data show the industry average probability of success is?","Derica W. Rice","Okay, Mark, this is Derica. Let me try to answer at least 2 of your first 3 questions. First of all, in regards to our expense management and our margin expansion, we are absolutely committed to prudently managing our business. And definitely, obviously, today we're factoring in revenue growth coming out of the 2014 time period, as well as continued prudent expense management. One could argue that if we are in a scenario where our pipeline is not successful, then that will call for even more prudent management of our expenses. So we're still committed to the longer-term outlook that we shared with you all here today, and we believe it is absolutely achievable. In regards to your question around are we able to reduce SG&A or R&D spend in absolute dollars, I think that will be one thing that we'll have to see how it plays out. Obviously, as we go through and see how the pipeline matures, especially given some of the therapy areas we're in, based upon where we have success and where we have failure will be a key determinant in terms of what our commercial footprint looks like. So if we find that, for example, neuroscience, if we're not successful there, then one could argue, do we still need the neuroscience footprint that we have today? So we'll have to see how this plays out. But obviously, we're prepared to be nimble and agile and respond to the outcomes of our pipeline. I'm not sure I understand your last question, to be honest, in regards to the probability of success of the pipeline versus industry averages. I think when we were talking about returning the industry averages in our call text, we were talking about returning for SG&A to more be in line with industry averages. And for our R&D spend as a percent of revenue, we said we'll return back closer to our levels of historical averages of the 18% to 20% range.","Philip Johnson","Yes, if I can go ahead and add, and this is Phil. We have had some comments in the past where we cited some of the industry benchmarking data that indicate that in past years you would have seen something like 70% to 80% probably as a more likely success rate for Phase III compounds. That maybe I think what  [indiscernible] was referring to.","Operator","We'll go to the line of Tim Anderson with Sanford Bernstein.","Tim Anderson - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","On your long-term guidance, on the spend element post 2014, to give those aspirational percentages you obviously have to have a revenue forecast. And any chance you would be willing to bracket your assumptions for revenue growth in that post-2014 period? Also what's embedded in that guidance for Alimta exclusivity? And then on solanezumab and upcoming data release, if you see hints of efficacy that support the beta-amyloid hypothesis, but those data are not good enough for approval, can you say whether you'd likely push solanezumab into the next round of clinical trials or whether you'd more likely move on to other approaches like BACE inhibition?","Derica W. Rice","Tim, this is Derica. Let me take your first question regarding post 2014 in revenue. We're not prepared to share our revenue forecast at this time frame. Obviously, as we continue to work through YZ, we'll have an opportunity to reengage in that particular specific aspect of our business going forward. But I did want to get out there today in terms of what the profile of Lilly should look like in terms of our business longer term. That should begin to hopefully give you guys greater insight as to how we look to manage our business.","Philip Johnson","Tim, on the Alimta exclusivity, currently we have a compound patent that with the pediatric exclusivity and other provisions would expire in January of 2017. We believe we have valid IP that we intend to pursue and uphold for the method-of-use patent that would expire in 2022. So really any outcome that would be negative on that method of use patent really wouldn't come into play until that 2017 time frame. And then in terms of the strategy for solanezumab data, obviously, if we do, as you're mentioning, fall short of hitting the primary endpoints, clearly we'll look to see if there are any strong signals and subpopulations. There's been some talk about this in prior investment meetings we've had. Obviously, we'd want to discuss that with the agency if we would see such results. At this point it would be premature to speculate on whether or not that would require or whether or not we would pursue additional clinical studies with solanezumab. As you mentioned, we do have a BACE compound that just started Phase II, very encouraged by the data we've seen today with that compound and excited to take that forward into development.","Operator","From Leerink Swann, we'll go to the line of Seamus Fernandez.","Seamus Fernandez - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","So just a couple of quick questions. The performance in the diabetes portfolio this quarter, can you just kind of comment on again the sort of slowing script trends. Is that entirely due to Caremark in your view, or is there some other contributing feature in that regard? And then how would that trajectory, how do you see that trajectory changing with a basal insulin? And then separately, I think just following up on one of the earlier questions, I think Tony's earlier question -- historically, you've kind of in some meetings characterized the value of having the expanded manufacturing capability as contributing the value of a blockbuster from an operational perspective. Can you help us think about that? Should we be thinking about that as kind of a $350 million number relative to a blockbuster in terms of cost avoidance?","Philip Johnson","Thanks, Seamus. We'll have Enrique respond.","Enrique A. Conterno","Yes. So when we look at the performance in U.S. for diabetes, which is what I think you are referring to, because when we look outside of the U.S., it is pretty clear that when we look at our mealtime [ph] share performance, we have shared trends that are positive, whether it's in Europe, Japan or emerging markets. In the U.S. we specifically lost very -- we -- Humalog got removed from a very large formulary. And the impact that we see is basically very specific to that. Of course, there's always some spillover effect that we see. But 80% of the share loss can be directly attributed to basically lines [ph]  That are covered by the large formulary. If we were to look outside of that specific segment, for example, we've talked in the past about our hospital share. Our hospital share continues to go up and continues to increase with the introduction of the [indiscernible]. The dynamics of our performance outside of this one event continue to be very consistent. I think it's important to emphasize that we are very much looking at protecting the gross margin that we have when it comes to our insulin business. Clearly, we are concerned about single-source type deals and this dynamic that is happening in the marketplace. But we're monitoring this very, very closely. At the end of the day, we need to make sure that patients are going to be in Lilly insulin products. Clearly, when we look at the future portfolio, additional critical mass and starting patients on basal insulin, will make us more competitive. We know that patients start insulin on a basal product. So to the extent that that is Lilly insulin, that will make us even more competitive when we're able to have that. As far as the impact, the financial impact from manufacturing, we have characterized this. We should be thinking about a gross margin expansion of several percentage points whenever we look at our overall insulin business. So this is very significant, but it's going to take time for this to materialize.","Philip Johnson","One of the things, Seamus, that I'd have you consider on the overall financial benefit of this manufacturing technical agenda -- as Enrique mentioned, we expect to expand margins by several percentage points. To put that into the context we had a $3.5 billion insulins business last year, and we see that business expanding pretty considerably over time. And the other thing that contributes very favorably to the overall financial impact is significant capital avoidance. When we were talking about this having the essential value of a blockbuster, it was the combination of the 2 things -- the reduced costs over time and then significant capital avoidance. Just to put that into perspective, to put in a new insulin plant you're talking multiple hundreds of millions of dollars for that similar kinds of investment, somewhat smaller on the fill-finish side.","Operator","To the line of Catherine Arnold from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Catherine J. Arnold - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I have a question about Alzheimer's and then I wanted to talk to you about evacetrapib. On Alzheimer's, could you just share if you know the percentage of patients in EXPEDITION that were ApoE4 carriers, and is it in line with the generally quoted sort of incidence of 60%? And does the  [indiscernible] study change your probability of success in any way? And then on the evacetrapib, is there a possibility of partnership for this molecule given the large-scale work and expense? And is that a gating factor before starting Phase III? How does it impact your R&D guidance for the longer term?","Philip Johnson","Great, Catherine, this is Phil. I'll take your first one on Alzheimer's and I'll have Dave Ricks take your second question on evacetrapib. So we have not had any kind of a presentation or publication of baseline characteristics of the patients in the solanezumab studies. The one piece that we have commented on over time is that in the general population there would be roughly about 1\/3 mild, 1\/3 moderate, 1\/3 severe. If you recall, our trials are just in the mild-to-moderate patient population, and we have said that there is a larger percentage of the mild patients as opposed to moderate. But we've not presented other baseline characteristics to date, including the percentage of ApoE4 carrier versus non-carrier. And then, Dave, on the evacetrapib question?","David A. Ricks","Sure. Catherine, we remain very excited about this program based on the data we released at AHA last year which shows a compelling benefit on both HDL and LDL. As mentioned earlier, we are hoping to start this program very soon. Without commenting specifically on evacetrapib, I can say broadly we always look at our options to maximize the molecule, share risk and bring them forward through the Phase III process with partners or without. And I think that's certainly an option on this program, as well as others, but we have made no specific determinations at this time.","Operator","From Cowen, we'll go to the line of Steve Scala.","Steve Scala - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Two questions. First, apologies if I misunderstood, but the post-2014 guidance, to what years does it apply? It sounds like it does not contemplate what happens in 2017 when Alimta's substance patent expires. And the second question is back on Alzheimer's disease, Merck has said its beta-secretase inhibitor lowers CSF Abeta by more than 90% than a once-daily oral formulation based on a very early study. Can you characterize how yours might compare?","Philip Johnson","Steve, we'll have Derica take the financial question and then Jan respond on the base inhibitor.","Derica W. Rice","Steve, this is Derica. In regards to the post 2014, we haven't given a specific time frame, but you got to think that we're talking about in that '15, '16, '17 time frame as being in the range of years when we should be able to move back into those levels of profitability. Jan?","Jan M. Lundberg","Yes, we recently communicated, as you heard, that our new beta-secretase oral inhibitor has entered Phase II. Some data were recently communicated about the effects of this agent on healthy volunteers. And the reduction we reported at the 35-milligram dose was around 60% reduction in the cerebrospinal fluid A-beta. It's not really known currently how much you need to reduce A-beta to have a significant potential effect. In the paper about the mutation in APP at the close to the beta cleavage side, which then has protective components against Alzheimer, dementia and also other aging dementia, the tentative reduction that this mutation caused was around 40% reduction. That had then the protective effect. Then realizing of course that that is present during the whole lifetime while we then are trying to influence this process by treating people later in life. So our molecule is very potent and we are very encouraged of what we have seen so far.","Operator","We'll go to the line of Marc Goodman with UBS.","Marc Goodman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Derica, in the past you've talked about that extra $1 billion of cost savings that you guys were going to get out of the business. And I was curious, your comments about Europe, is this kind of wrapped up in it, or is this an additional type of effort to bring cost down because of European austerity that's really kind of kicked in so much over the past 6 to 12 months? And is there anyway you can help quantify like how much you're talking about taking out of Europe if it is additional? And will we see it in the 2013 numbers, or when will we start to see that kind of kick in? Second question is just from the tofacitinib panel, I was wondering if there was anything that happened or any learnings that you'll have that you can comment on relative to your product. And then in emerging markets, can you talk about any key launches that will occur, whether it's the rest of the year or over the next year in 2013 that will drive emerging markets once again?","Philip Johnson","Mark, we'll have Derica start off and then go over to Jan for the tofa question. And then we'll congregate here and see who can answer your question on the emerging markets piece. Derica?","Derica W. Rice","Mark, in regards to Europe, just to remind everyone we said that we would take out the $1 billion by the end of '11. And we more than exceeded that goal. So the actions we're currently talking about in Europe are more in response to the evolving environment and portfolio as we've described it. So as we see the austerity measures in Europe and how that market is evolving, as well as when we look at our own portfolio and if it we'd be progressing more towards a specialty-focused portfolio rather than a broad primary care portfolio, we see the changes that Dave and his team have outlined as being essential and mitigating those kinds of risk and addressing those kinds of challenges. In regards to quantification, we haven't put any specific numbers out there at this time.","Philip Johnson","And real quick on that piece, the $1 billion that I think you may be referring to, Marc, you may be referring to a slide Derica presented last June. We talked about $1 billion of operating improvement. That was actually through '05 to '10. The other $1 billion that was talked about on the call today was the $1 billion that we had talked about removing from our 2011 cost structure, so this would not have been contemplated in that 2011 cost basis. This is an action now that we're talking about in '12 would impact by '13 and beyond. Jan?","Jan M. Lundberg","We are very keen to apply the comments from the advisory committee for then the Pfizer JAK inhibitor, tofacitinib. The key learnings were, first of all, that the advisory committee felt that this could be a major advance as a class of drugs then as new oral disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs actually than the first one in 10 years. The second thing is that different JAK inhibitors may have different safety profiles in particular. And we know that the Pfizer molecule is more a pan-JAK inhibitor including JAK3, whilst our molecule is selective for JAK1\/JAK2. And thirdly, we need now to design the right Phase III trials to then exploit these type of reasonings, both regarding efficacy and safety. And as communicated earlier we anticipate starting those trials before the end of this year or early next year.","Philip Johnson","And Marc, in terms of the emerging market launches, for sure we'll have continued rollouts of Trajenta. And then I'll follow up off-line with our Emerging Markets business to see if we're missing any major line extensions that can be rolled out during this time frame as well.","Operator","From JPMorgan, we'll go to the line of Chris Schott.","Christopher Schott - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","First question, I guess, for Derica and then very much appreciate those long-term margin targets. On those targets though, what gives you the confidence in providing these updates versus just your prior floor estimates? Is this based on some of the pipeline data we've seen so far this year, or as you're thinking of all of done [ph] your expense base? And then the second question is shifting over to the insulin franchise, can you just elaborate a little bit more on the feedback you've had on the Caremark formulary change either from patients or employers using that Caremark formulary? Just I guess on some of the questions really, are you getting any sense that other plans are considering moving maybe to a single insulin for their formularies as well?","Philip Johnson","Great, Chris. We'll have Derica and Enrique respond, respectively.","Derica W. Rice","Chris, this is Derica. It's a great question. What gives us the confidence is the performance the we're seeing to date. The goals that we outlined wasn't just those minimum financial performance, but we also talked as a part about the -- how we would progress our pipeline. We talked about how would we address our cost structures as we were managing through YZ. And I can sit here today and say along many of those elements, we are actually achieving the mileposts the we laid out. So we absolutely feel confident about staying above the $20 billion in revenue. We took out the additional $1 billion by the end of '11 in our cost structure. And if you look at our pipeline, we have 12 assets in Phase III. More importantly, we also have a Phase II pipeline that's positioned to sustain that same type of output going forward. So when we look at each of the elements of our business in aggregate, we're seeing the pieces of the puzzle come together. And that's also what gave us the confidence even when we talked about capital allocation that we felt comfortable, both management and the board, and beginning to return some of our excess capital back to shareholders through the resumption of our share repurchase program. So we feel very good about where we are. Enrique?","Enrique A. Conterno","Without commenting about any specific formulary. We do see significant disruption at the patient level. Clearly, diabetes is a complex disease. And while some may think that there is some sort of savings when it comes to the medicine that can be passed to employers, there are significant hidden costs -- and we're planning to study this very, very carefully -- that go beyond the medicine when it comes to the treatment of diabetes. So it is difficult to say where the trends will go. But long term, the more that these get studied, in particular when it comes to patients in late-stage diabetes utilizing insulin, we will see that the other costs completely overburden any type of savings that people believe they may have in the medicine.","Operator","From Bank of America, we'll go to the line of Greg Gilbert.","Gregory B. Gilbert - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I have a few. First on Alimta. It was good to see the positive Markman ruling. But can you discuss the patent and exclusivity picture for Alimta in key non-U.S. markets and whether anything's changed there from a ruling standpoint? Second is on Effient. It seems that you clearly have a share of voice [ph] opportunity would with Plavix going generic. Can you comment on how access and cost of access is shaping up for next year? And lastly, for Derica, you touched on this in your prior answer. I wanted to know if you could talk about the board and management discussion around resuming the share repurchase and whether there's been a change in how you view that particular mechanism even beyond the current authorization that's left?","Philip Johnson","We'll have Ilissa handle your first question on the Alimta Markman hearing and then Dave Ricks for Effient and then to Derica for share repurchase. Ilissa?","Ilissa Rassner","Yes, Greg, as we mentioned earlier, in the U.S. we had the Markman hearing and had a positive ruling in Lilly's favor, and we are waiting for a trial date to be set. In Europe, a similar patent has been challenged and a ruling was also issued in Lilly's favor in the first instance. This ruling has been appealed, but no date has been set yet for the appeal. There was another company that submitted third-party observations in this pending appeal, but we're still in the very early stages of that.","Philip Johnson","And the patent date in Europe is slightly different in the U.S. That would go into 2020.","David A. Ricks","On Effient, Greg, as we see in the Q2 results, we reported very strong sales growth for this product, both in Europe and the U.S. I think your question is really referring to the Plavix exclusivity, and clearly Bristol and Sanofi pulling out of that. We don't see that as a trend changer, in any case for Effient. Effient is used in the cath labs with very sick patients. And the choice-making there really is driven by the clinical benefits. And as you know from the TRITON-TIMI 38 study, we've got a compelling advantage, we believe, over Plavix, generic or branded, in patients who -- particularly those with diabetes, with high-risk cardiovascular disease and in the STEMI population. That's where we're driving share and were seeing that convert into nice sales growth across the globe. Derica?","Derica W. Rice","Greg, quite honestly our capital allocation strategy actually hasn't changed. We've always been very clear that in regards to utilization of our capital, our first protocol was making sure we were properly investing and resourcing the internal opportunities that we had, specifically the pipeline. Our second protocol was then to pursue opportunistic business development, opportunities that were out there that we felt could compliment our existing footprint. In this case, bring in revenue and cash generating opportunities or augment our pipeline. And then at the end of that if we had excess capital, we would look to return that to shareholders. We believe that we've -- we're accomplishing the first 2. We feel very good about where we are with R&D and our resourcing. As it relates to business development you've seen the type of deals we've been active in. We continue to look for in-licensing opportunities. We believe we can still continue to do that while, at the same time, beginning to return some of our excess capital back to shareholders being the resumption of the share repurchase program throughout the end of this year. And obviously, to going beyond this year, it will be a continual discussion we'll have with our board around the timing and the amount of any potential future share repurchase activity.","Philip Johnson","Since we are a couple of minutes past the top of the hour, we'll go ahead and close the call here. We do hope you found some of the additional commentary that was provided on the post-2014 time frame helpful. We do recognize there are a few of you still left in queue. The IR team will get back to you very shortly, and our team will remain available during the rest of the day for any other questions you may have post today's call.","Thank you very much for your interest in Lilly and for spending time with us today.

Welcome to the Eli Lilly Q1 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to your host, Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Phil Johnson. Please go ahead, sir.","Philip Johnson","Good morning. Thanks for taking the time to join us for Eli Lilly & Co.'s First Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. I'm Phil Johnson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Joining me are our Chairman and CEO, John Lechleiter; our Chief Financial Officer, Derica Rice; our President of Lilly Research Laboratories, Dr. Jan Lundberg; and Ilissa Rassner and Travis Coy for Investor Relations.","During this conference call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors, including those listed on Slide 3 and those outlined in our latest forms 10-K and 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It is not intended to be promotional and is not sufficient for prescribing decisions.","We are very pleased with our performance in the first quarter of 2012. In the face of significant reductions in revenue and earnings due to the Zyprexa patent expiration, Lilly employees around the world have remained focused on execution. They delivered results that solidly position us to meet our 2012 financial guidance, and it placed us on track to meet or exceed our midterm financial minimum goals. Let's begin with a quick review of events that have taken place since our previous earnings call.","From a commercial perspective, we're pleased that Jentadueto, the linagliptin plus metformin fixed-dose combination for treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes, is now available in U.S. pharmacies.","On the regulatory front, Japan's Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare approved Zyprexa for treatment of depression in bipolar disorder and Cymbalta for treatment of diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain. ","Amylin's Byetta received European Commission approval as an adjunctive therapy to basal insulin, with or without metformin and\/or pioglitazone, for the treatment of type 2 diabetes in adults.","We received a Complete Response Letter from the FDA for Erbitux in first-line non-small cell lung cancer. Lilly and Bristol-Myers Squibb do not plan to further pursue this FLEX submission but will continue to market Erbitux in the U.S. for certain types of head and neck and colorectal cancer.","And lastly, the FDA approved Amyvid for use in patients being evaluated for Alzheimer's disease and other causes of cognitive decline.","In clinical news, we announced the results of a Phase III study that showed both Cialis and tamsulosin significantly improved scores on the International Prostate Symptom Score in men with signs and symptoms suggestive of benign prostatic hyperplasia. ","And we announced new Phase II data, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, that showed ixekizumab, and anti-IL-17 monoclonal antibody, met its primary endpoint in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.","Now let's move on to discuss our financial performance. As we've done on the previous calls, we'll focus our comments on the non-GAAP results, which we believe provide insights into the underlying trends in our business. This excludes certain items, such as restructuring charges, asset impairments and other special charges.","Turning to the income statement. On Slide 6, you can see that revenue declined by 4% in Q1 to just over $5.6 billion. This decrease in revenue was due to the loss of patent exclusivity for Zyprexa in most major markets outside of Japan, partially offset by growth from other products. Excluding Zyprexa outside of Japan, the rest of our revenue actually grew 10%. ","Gross margin as a percent of revenue decreased 1.2 percentage points from 79.8% to 78.6%. This decrease in gross margin percent was primarily due to lower sales of Zyprexa, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold.","This quarter's total operating expense, defined as the sum of R&D and SG&A, grew 3%. Within operating expenses, marketing, selling and administrative expenses grew 3%, while R&D expenses grew 2%. The growth in marketing, selling and administrative expenses was driven by the diabetes collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim and increased expense for newer pharmaceutical and animal health products, partially offset by lower administrative expenses. The growth in R&D expense was largely driven by the Boehringer Ingelheim collaboration as well as other late stage clinical trial costs.","When thinking about our year-on-year growth and operating expenses, keep in mind that in Q1 last year, we only had a partial quarter's worth of expenses for the Boehringer Ingelheim collaboration. The level of operating expenses in Q1 of this year is squarely in line with our expectations and our full year guidance.","Other income and deductions was a higher net expense this year compared to last year due to recognition in the first quarter of 2011 of a gain on an equity investment and an insurance recovery, partially offset by increased interest income in the first quarter of 2012.","Our tax rate was 24.4% this quarter, an increase of 3.5 percentage points from Q1 2011, primarily due to the expiration of the R&D tax credit at the end of 2011, as well as a discrete item that increased taxes in the first quarter of 2012 due to changes in estimates concerning certain prior year tax items. ","At the bottom line, our non-GAAP EPS decreased 26% to $0.92 per share. Please note that as planned, we did retire the $1.5 billion of debt that came due this March and with no additional short-term or long-term borrowing.","In summary, our Q1 results clearly reflect the Zypresa patent expirations outside of Japan, as well as the additional operating expenses associated with the Boehringer Ingelheim collaboration. In the face of these known headwinds, we've continued to drive revenue growth from many products and prudently manage expenses in the rest of our business, putting us on a solid financial footing going forward. We will continue that same focus, and we will rigorously prioritize investments to achieve our midterm financial targets and position the company to return to growth post-2014.","Slide 7 shows our reported income statement, while Slide 8 provides a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS. Additional details about our reported earnings are available in today's earnings press release.","Now I'll turn the call over to Travis.","Travis Coy","Thanks, Phil. As you can see on Slide 9, the revenue decline of 4% for the quarter was driven by a negative volume impact of 7%, partially offset by a favorable 4% price impact. Foreign exchange had a negligible impact on worldwide revenue.","By geography, you'll notice that U.S. volume decreased 16%. This was entirely due to Zyprexa sales erosion. In fact, excluding olanzapine from both 2011 and 2012, volume in the rest of our U.S. business was up 2%.","Also of note is U.S. price, which increased 12% this quarter, following an 18% decrease in Q4 of 2011. Both periods were affected by our authorized generic olanzapine agreement with Prasco.","In this quarter, we recognized our share of Prasco's authorized generic olanzapine revenues, with no corresponding units sold by Lilly. This serves to increase our reported U.S. price by nearly 3.5 percentage points. In addition, we had favorable adjustments to prior period rebates and accruals that contributed roughly 3 percentage points to U.S. price.","For Europe, the decrease in revenue was also due to the Zyprexa patent expiration. Excluding Zyprexa from both 2011 and 2012, the rest of our European revenue was essentially flat, with volume growth up 6% that was offset by a price decline of 3% and an FX effect of minus 3%.","Japan growth of 5% reflects a negative effect of the biannual price decreases. This includes lower prices on our sales in March as well as lower customer buying ahead of the price decreases.","Also, in Q1 2011, we saw precautionary buying as a result of the earthquake that increased sales by about $30 million to $35 million. Excluding the $30 million to $35 million of sales from the Q1 2011 base period, Japan sales were up 12% to 13% this quarter.","As for Emerging Markets, which is embedded in Rest of World, we began to experience the impact of generic competition that we discussed as part of our 2012 guidance. In terms of products, the largest impact is coming from Zyprexa. While in terms of countries, the bulk of the impact is coming from Brazil and Mexico.","As a reminder, we anticipate...","Operator","[Technical Difficulty]","Travis Coy","Apologies. We experienced a power failure actually in the studio, so what I\u2019ll do and not knowing exactly where we cut out. This is Travis, by the way. I'll start from the beginning of the paragraph.","As for Emerging Markets, which is embedded in Rest of World, we began to experience the impact of generic competition that we discussed as part of our 2012 guidance. In terms of products, the largest impact is coming from Zyprexa. While in terms of countries, the bulk of the impact is coming from Brazil and Mexico.","As a reminder, we anticipate that generic competition will reduce our 2012 Emerging Markets sales by roughly $250 million, which equates to 10% of our 2011 Emerging Markets sales. This quarter, the generic impact reduced sales by about 13 percentage points.","Within Emerging Markets, China continued to register strong growth, up 41%, or when excluding FX, 34%.","The Elanco Animal Health delivered another quarter of robust performance, with volume increasing 31%. Driving the strong quarter were continued growth of worldwide Trifexis sales, the inclusion of the Janssen Animal Health sales and a combination of strong demand and customer buying patterns. We expect Elanco to deliver double-digit income growth during the YZ years and beyond.","Finally, the 26% increase in collaboration and other revenue is due to royalties from telaprevir, as well as gross margin sharing with Boehringer Ingelheim for Tradjenta. Neither of which were present in the Q1 2011 base period.","Slide 10 shows the year-on-year growth of select line items of our non-GAAP income statement, with and without the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates. I'll focus on the second column since the numbers in the first column are the same as those on Slide 6.","As discussed earlier, FX had a negligible impact on worldwide revenue. It also had a negligible effect on underlying foreign currency operating expenses. However, FX did have an impact on cost of goods sold due to its effect on international inventory sold. Recall that this is an accounting effect only that has no impact on cash flow. This FX effect increased cost of goods sold in Q1 2011, while it slightly decreased the cost of goods sold in Q1 2012. Excluding the FX effect on international inventory sold, cost of goods sold increased 10% and EPS decreased 30%.","For your information, on Slide 11, we've provided the year-over-year growth of select line items of our reported income statement, with and without the effects of foreign exchange rates. ","Next, I'll provide a brief pipeline update before turning the call over to Derica. Slide 12 shows our pipeline as of April 18. Changes since our last earnings call are highlighted, with green arrows showing progression and red arrows showing attrition. As Phil mentioned, earlier this month, the FDA approved Amyvid for use in patients being evaluated for Alzheimer's disease and other causes of cognitive decline. Beginning in June, a limited number of radiopharmacies will be distributing Amyvid, with the goal of making their product available in more areas as soon as possible. When Amyvid becomes available in June, this gain will not be covered -- will not be a covered service under the Medicare benefit. This is due to a Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services policy, which has been in place since December 2000. Lilly is working diligently with a broad group of stakeholders to explore and collaborate with CMS to define a path forward for coverage.","You'll also see that we began Phase II testing of 2 potential oncology medicines. One, a hedgehog antagonist, and the other a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor. And we began Phase I testing of 3 new molecules, spanning oncology, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. In addition, we terminated development of 4 molecules, 3 in Phase II and 1 in Phase I.","We now have 12 potential new medicines in Phase III testing, 8 of which are biotech molecules, spanning oncology, diabetes, neuroscience and autoimmune diseases. We believe this pipeline positions us well for growth post-2014.","Now I'll turn the call over to Derica to cover some of the key events for 2012, our financial guidance and some closing comments before opening the call for Q&A.","Derica?","Derica W. Rice","Thanks, Travis. I'll start with Slide 13. Now while I'll focus my comments on events expected to occur later this year, we will now use this slide to report our progress on achieving key events we've highlighted to you for the year. Now hopefully this provides you with greater transparency on how we're doing.","In the remainder of 2012, we anticipate a couple of FDA decisions. We'll continue to advance our pipeline, and we'll generate and share clinical data that will help investors better gauge our growth potential post-2014. We anticipate FDA decisions on Alimta as continuation maintenance therapy for patients with nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer, and Erbitux for first-line metastatic colorectal cancer. ","We anticipate beginning Phase III trials for evacetrapib, our CETP inhibitor. In addition, we could begin Phase III trials yet this year for our oral JAK1\/JAK2 inhibitor for rheumatoid arthritis in partnership with Incyte.","We also expect to complete a number of important Phase III trials in 2012 including: The EXPEDITION studies with solanezumab for Alzheimer's disease; the TRILOGY study with Effient in ACS-medically-managed patients; and the PARAMOUNT and POINTBREAK studies with Alimta in nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer. The overall survival data from PARAMOUNT will be disclosed at ASCO in June.","In addition, we'll complete a number of the Phase III trials for dulaglutide and in collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim for empagliflozin.","So we recently generated key data from 2 important Phase II studies, and we plan to disclose these data at upcoming medical meetings. The first is a dulaglutide Phase II hemodynamic study. Our plan is to disclose data from the study at ASH, the American Society of Hypertension, in May. The second is the Phase IIb trial of the JAK1\/JAK2 inhibitor being studied for use in rheumatoid arthritis, in partnership with Incyte. Our plan is to disclose 3-month data at EULAR in June, and 6-month data at a medical meeting later this year. In addition, we'll disclose Phase II data at the ADA meeting in June for our novel basal insulin analog being studied for both type 1 and type 2 diabetes.","Now moving onto guidance. We're pleased with our solid first quarter results, and we're encouraged by the current trajectory of our business. Based upon this trajectory, we are increasing our non-GAAP EPS estimate to a range of $3.15 to $3.30. Now please note that we have now included EPS guidance in both a reported and a non-GAAP basis to reflect the charge taken in the first quarter. All other line items of our guidance remain unchanged.","Slide 15 provides a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS for 2011 and the associated growth rates from these numbers to our 2012 guidance.","Now in closing, we knew 2012 would be a challenging year as we experience the full effect of the Zyprexa patent expiration in most major markets, and we are well prepared for this challenge. For many years, we've had a relentless focus on executing our strategy: one, to drive productivity gains across all areas of our value chain; second, to drive growth in our on-patent brands and in the countercyclical growth areas of Elanco, Japan and Emerging Markets; and third and most importantly, to replenish and advance our pipeline. We designed this strategy to enable Lilly to absorb the effect of our patent losses while funding the dividend at least at its current level, as well as the R&D that will drive our future growth.","Thus far, we've had a solid start to the year. Our financial performance this quarter positions us well to continue executing our strategy and to meet or exceed our midterm financial projections: minimum annual revenue of at least $20 billion, net income of at least $3 billion, and operating cash flow of at least $4 billion.","We remain committed to our innovation-based strategy. We'll maintain a productive investment in R&D through this period of patent expirations, and we'll keep our focus on the keys to the Lilly's long-term success, advancing our late stage pipeline and sustaining the flow of innovative medicines in the future.","Now as Travis said, we have 12 molecules in Phase III development and another 21 in Phase II. They include a balance of small molecules and biologics, an exciting potential to new medicines in diabetes, neuroscience, oncology and autoimmune diseases.","We believe this pipeline will drive growth post-YZ. This year, we've already begun to generate and disseminate important data that will help investors and analysts better gauge our longer-term growth potential, with much more data to come over the course of 2012 and 2013.","We're confident in our strategy and in our ability to successfully navigate our patent expirations and emerge with even greater strength and capacity to drive growth. ","This concludes our prepared remarks, and now I'll turn it over to Phil.","Philip Johnson","[Technical Difficulty]","[Operator Instructions]","Okay. We apologize for the technical difficulties. Hopefully this will resolve those. And we'll go ahead. Kaylie, if you could start with the first caller and move into the Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Jami Rubin at Goldman Sachs.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I have a question related to gross margins. The gross margin this quarter came in well ahead of what we were expecting. And just and going back when the company initially gave guidance for the year, back in early January, The Street was I think at around $3.60, and you guided to $3.10 to $3.20 in large part because of generic Zyprexa, which of course, wasn't new. Now you're raising that guidance again by $0.10, and the gross margin came in well ahead of what I think people were looking for. So maybe, Derica, if you could just talk to some of the variables that have driven your guidance. And help us to think about the evolution of gross margins. I mean, at least that's what we missed this quarter. But you're not changing your gross margin guidance. So would you expect Q2 and Q3 because of the onslaught of generic competition to be meaningfully below your average guidance of 77%? Maybe if you could just add color there. And then just on another note, with animal health, which performed very well, if you could talk about the variables that are driving that. And also, if you could remind us what the Janssen acquisition provided for this quarter.","Derica W. Rice","Okay, Jami, this is Derica. In regards to gross margin, just a few things to keep in mind. One, as we move throughout the year with each quarter of 2012, we will have further declining Zyprexa revenues. So in 2012, we expect Q1 to have the greatest share of our Zyprexa revenue, and then with each subsequent quarter, it will decline. With that decline, it has an increasingly negative effect on our gross margin. So that's going to be bringing our gross margins down as we move through the period. Secondly, you also saw that in the first quarter, we had a slightly favorable impact just from exchange rates. So as the euro has been weakening against the dollar and we've talked about this on past calls, you see that, that has a favorable impact on our cost of goods sold of inventories during the period, which obviously has a favorable impact on gross margin. I don't if that's sustainable. And then the third piece is just when you look at the price effect element of it, we did see in the first quarter, as Travis said, there were some growth to net adjustment. So as we were looking at our AMP calculations, and based upon new insights, we were able to -- we made some adjustments to our growth to net reserves on the book, which turned out to be -- come out \u2013 it\u2019s favorable in terms of price. Now that's what's highlighting and driving our gross margins as we look through the remainder of the year. In regard to your second question around animal health and what are some of the key things that's driving our guidance in our increase, what we saw in the first quarter was very strong revenue growth relative to our expectation. Animal health alone grew 33%, of which volume growth of that was 31%. Within that volume growth, it was primarily driven by both our companion animal business, as well as our food animal business. In the companion animal segment, we continue to experience an outstanding launch with Trifexis -- This is our flea and heartworm product -- as well as we continue to actually have good sales of Comfortis. And then likewise, we've seen good performance on the food animal side as well. In regard to the Janssen acquisition, as well as ChemGen, which we completed earlier this year, that attributed about 1\/3 of that total growth. And so if you look at the 33%, 2\/3 of that was organically driven.","Philip Johnson","Jami, this is Phil. One thing I might add in terms of the gross margin percent, as you're aware for a while now, we've been providing a backup slide. This will be Slide 18 in this quarter's deck. That strips out from each of the quarter's results this FX effect on international inventory sold. These are the 2 lines of numbers at the bottom of that chart. What that will show is actually in Q1 of last year, we had nearly 1 percentage point reduction in the gross margin percent due to FX. So our true underlying base with 80.7%. When you look at this quarter, we're actually seeing a 2.4 percentage point reduction in the gross margin percent. So very substantial. It seems to be in line with what people had been expecting. And I'm wondering actually if people -- they were looking at the base to figure their decline off of and they had been looking at the base that included that negative effect from FX last year that wouldn't necessarily have been the appropriate base to take it down from. As Derica mentioned, we do expect to see further deterioration through the year, particularly given the Zyprexa erosion that we anticipate largely here in the U.S. We've now entered, I think as of today or yesterday, the period where multiple generics can now come to market. And that will bring a different dynamic than we saw in the first quarter.","Derica W. Rice","The last thing I'll leave you with, Jami, is that we were able to drive outside of the Zyprexa patent erosion, and the remaining elements of Gemzar, good volume growth across the other elements of our business. So in addition to animal health, we saw good growth in China, 41%, as well as key brands like Cymbalta, 23%. And even in insulins, which grew -- Humalog grew 12%. So that was always part of our strategy in terms of those 3 strategic levers, making sure that we were driving growth in those areas where we weren't experiencing patent expiration.","Operator","We'll go to the line of Marc Goodman at UBS.","Marc Goodman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","A couple of questions. First, can you just tell us what were the key products impacted by that gross to net adjustment? Second, Alimta o U.S. looks like it flattened out. And I was wondering if you could just give us a little bit of insight what was going on there. And then third, I get this question so I figured out I'll ask you. If solanezumab ends up being positive data later this year, what do you do differently as a company with respect to R&D, SG&A? And if it fails, what do you do differently as a company with respect to spending?","Philip Johnson","Okay. Marc, this is Phil. I'll take your first 2, and then maybe Derica want to a crack or John, at the last one. So the products on the gross to net adjustment, it really was across the board. This was -- it's a phenomenon, Marc, that we've seen each and every quarter. Sometimes it's as a slight benefit; sometimes it's a slight headwind. This quarter, it was a little larger benefit than we've had in some prior periods, due to the size of the adjustment. And would have contributed about 3 percentage points of growth; that shows up in the price column to our U.S. sales. A slowdown in Alimta o U.S., the primary driver compared to prior quarters really is FX. If you go back sort of mid-last year, and you had FX contributing double digits. I think in Q2, for example, it peaked maybe at 11% contribution to overall growth, whereas it actually reduced sales by 1 percentage point this quarter. We also have seen the volume growth in percentage terms begin to decrease somewhat as we have a larger base that we're comparing against. The last thing I'd highlight is we did have price reductions that go in effect for the public April 1. They'll actually go in effect for us and sales to wholesalers as of March 1 in Japan, the partner biannual price adjustment process. And Alimta had a substantial price reduction on the order of magnitude of 25%. So we saw one month of that in the quarter.","Derica W. Rice","Marc, in regards to your question around solanezumab and how does that affect Lilly in terms of its potential outcomes, it does -- in terms of our overall strategy, it doesn't affect us significantly at all. We've stated all along that solanezumab was not the homerun bet for Lilly. And it's one of the 12 molecules that we have in Phase III development. So therefore, if we're unsuccessful with solanezumab, we continue with our action plans as stated. We will continue to progress the remaining 11 molecules that we have in critical development in Phase III as well as the other 21 in Phase II. And we'll continue to try to invest to drive the growth in our key growth opportunities. Obviously, if it's successful, given the low probability that of technical success, it represents upside for the firm. But R&D innovation is still going to be the cornerstone of our strategy. So it doesn't lessen our focus still on those remaining 11 molecules in Phase III.","Operator","That will come from the line of Chris Schott at JPMorgan.","Christopher Schott - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","First question, was just with regards to your JAK potentially moving into Phase III later this year. Can you just elaborate a little bit about how you see that product differentiating from Pfizer's product? And just maybe more broadly, the evolution of the RA market. How do you see the oral drugs playing here? Do you actually think maybe it's a positive that you could be the second JAK in the market over time, given how slow this market seems to evolve over time? The second question I had is maybe just following up on the expense structure here. Beyond solanezumab, you obviously highlighted a number of important pipeline data releases this year, more coming in '13. Does there come a point where you do a broader strategic review of the overall spend level relative to new product opportunities? I guess, basically should we expect at some point you take a broader look at the pipeline once all this data comes in? Or is this really an evolutionary process -- as individual data points come in, you evaluate and kind of go from there?","Philip Johnson","We'll have Jan handle JAK1\/JAK2, and then we'll move over to Derica for your second question. Jan?","Jan M. Lundberg","Yes, the overall JAK class is an interesting new opportunity then for oral agents in autoimmune disease. And the interesting piece coming up here will be, how differentiated will these different JAK molecules be? They do have differences in their selectivity versus various members of the JAK family, at least then in pharmacology, in-vitro. And I think it needs to be determined what type of clinical significance do these differences have. We know that our and the Incyte molecule is more JAK1\/JAK2 selective, while the Pfizer molecule is more a pan-JAK molecule. We also know that our molecule is likely to be once daily, where as the Pfizer molecule is twice daily. We need to see now in our bigger extended trials what happens in relation to efficacy and also in particular, safety, if there are any differences versus the Pfizer agents. And as stated here, we will communicate our 3-month data as well as 6-month data this year. So you will see more data from our agent. And we're also eager to see what the outcome, which is certainly happening then for the Pfizer molecule, will give us in relation to additional information in this important class.","Philip Johnson","Derica?","Derica W. Rice","Clearly, we have plans in place in terms of how we saw navigating our way through this period of patent expiry. And that was all centered around driving growth where we could, which we create the capacity to fund R&D in our pipeline as well as sustain our dividend. Now as those cards begin to be turned over and as we see data unveil from our pipeline, our plans are not static. As so, obviously, we will adjust along the way. Now our expectations are that we believe we should be able to yield enough positive outcome for our pipeline that will support our long-term strategy. If the result ends up being different than that and we saw through what the implications to that are, and obviously, we'll go and begin to pull some of those levers. But at this stage, we put forward you guys in our call text as well as in the slides, we tried to lay out in as transparent manner as we can what are the key events that we're monitoring both internally, and hopefully you're tracking externally. And we're trying to highlight there in those key events, as those cards are unfold or turned over, what's the outcome? So each one of those checks, we're very encouraged here both with the approval of Amyvid this quarter, as well as what we believe to be exciting data that we unveiled on is IL-17, our ixekizumab, for the treatment of psoriasis in moderate to a severe patient. And as we continue to see data like that, that gives us even more encouragement about the future prospects of Lilly.","Operator","We'll go to the line of David Risinger of Morgan Stanley.","David Risinger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I have a couple of questions on the pipeline for Jan. The first is [indiscernible] is discussing recently, very recently, pre-specifying additional analyses for bapineuzumab for Phase III, such as mild patients and maybe trying to pool the data on mild patients from the 2 different trials that they're running in the U.S. and file for approval on that. I'm just curious about whether Lilly is pre-specifying additional groups for the analysis of solanezumab or whether essentially all the weight is on the primary endpoints in the studies. And then my second question is with respect to the ImClone pipeline assets, Jan, if you could please update us on the timing of the key readouts. I'd appreciate it.","Philip Johnson","Okay, great. Jan?","Jan M. Lundberg","Right. If you look at the solanezumab's primary endpoints, it's really about cognition and also activities of daily living. And we want to see positive responses here from both trials on both of these parameters. In relation to types of patients, we have both mild and moderate, and we have apoE types as well. So it will be an opportunity here to discuss with regulators then what are the outcomes based on the data that we get? The ImClone pipeline, as we know, is focused very much on the ramucirumab in Phase III, which has 5 different trials then ongoing in different countertypes which we'll start to readout next year and in the coming years. And we also have necitumumab for squamous, non-small cell lung cancer indication, which also we'll complete their studies most likely next year. But its event-driven so that will be dependent on that. And before these 2 agents, there are a number of other anti-bodies then which are tested in different tumors. And here I think it's still early to say when these will progress further then into late stage development. We need to generate more data in our signal searching.","Travis Coy","Sure. David, this is Travis. A couple of things. For ramucirumab, I believe the current expectation is reflected on clinicaltrials.gov is that both the first of the 2 gastric cancer trials, as well as the hepatocellular trial, would produce results next year, with other indications to follow subsequently. Necitumumab, the other Phase III asset from, ImClone, likely we're in the early '14, I believe, for the data readout on the squamous non-small cell lung cancer trial. Then also keep in mind that we're awaiting word from the FDA on the first-line metastatic colorectal cancer indication for Erbitux as well.","Operator","We'll go to the line of Tim Anderson at Sanford Bernstein.","Tim Anderson - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","On your proprietary basal insulin, if I remember right, you said you need to see differentiation to really take that through full development. And I'm wondering if you can call out where you hope to see differentiation based on early work that you've done. It is something like dosing flexibility or flatter PK\/PD profile, or what exactly? And then on solanezumab, just if I can get an update on timing. You said in the past, it would not make the late July meetings. I think it used to be called ICAD [ph]. What would be the next logical medical meeting after that because it doesn't look like there's much in the second half of the year? ANA is in October, but that's not typically an Alzheimer's meeting. And it kind of begs the question of, is your goal still to present results for the first time at a medical meeting versus top lining them in the press release?","Philip Johnson","Great. Jan?","Jan M. Lundberg","Okay. If we look at our novel basal insulin, we are looking there to differentiate with some clinically meaningful outcome for our diabetes patients. And this could be, for instance, less hypoglycemia versus Lantus. It could be differences in body weight changes versus Lantus and potentially could be even a better glycemic control. We know from our earlier studies that this agent has a very flat profile with very small interindividual variation. So we are very hopeful about the types of differentiation that we can see from this agent, and we will report at the ADA in June our data from both type 1 and type 2 studies comparing with Lantus. The timing for solanezumab communication, et cetera, is as follows. The first EXPEDITION trial has completed. Last patient visit now in April; the second one, we'll do it in June. We will have a quarter 4 communication of the data in detail and plan also to have a high level communication before that on the top line data.","Ilissa Rassner","Tim, this is Ilissa. Just to give an update of the DMC did meet again earlier this month, and they recommended continuing the double-blind and open-label studies without modification.","Derica W. Rice","Okay. The last thing I'd add, in terms of ADA and the information on our novel basal insulin analog, we will have I think 10 different abstracts and presentations at ADA this year, spanning preclinical Phase I and the 2 Phase II trials. And we are anticipating we'll have more details for you in the next week or 2 on having an investor event at ADA, to discuss not only the data for the novel basal insulin analog, but also the data we've presented earlier in May on our hemodynamic study for dulaglutide. So look for the notice on that. We look forward to having you participate in the call or some of you live with us at ADA.","Operator","We'll go to the line of Mark Schoenebaum at ISI Group.","Mark J. Schoenebaum - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I want to ask about something that I think is -- personally I think is Lilly's most important commercial business, which is the insulin business. I haven't heard any questions on this from the analysts. So and a little last year, has looked like you guys have done a good job of stabilizing the share losses to Novo. So I'm kind of wondering, Derica, I'm not sure who to direct the question to, but if you could kind of give us an update and reflect back on 2011 what you did to stabilize that share. And how as analysts and investors, we should be thinking about share in the U.S. and in Europe for the insulin franchise versus Novo? And then the corollary to that is if you could update us on what's going on in Emerging Markets. I know in the Emerging Markets, in the insulin business right now, you trail Novo quite a bit. But in a sense, if that's all room for upside. So maybe you could give us an update on share and how that market overall is growing. And then the second question I had was I think this is the last conference call we're going to have with you guys before the Supreme Court has its way with the health care law. And I was just wondering in general over the short term and over the long term if the mandate is struck down and if the overall law is struck down, what kind of impact do you see to Lilly's short-term business and also the long term? I'd appreciate any comments you have around that.","Philip Johnson","Great. Let's go ahead and have Derica take the insulin, and we'll have Travis, who wants to help. Who followed that business with the team over the last quarter. And then, John, if you'd comment on the Supreme Court ruling. Derica?","Derica W. Rice","In the U.S. if you look at our insulin business, and specifically Humalog, we've had a number of interventions I think that\u2019s improved our performance there, [indiscernible] the president of that unit was here. He\u2019d probably say, one was we obviously have gone back and upped our game in terms of our medical reps and the quality information they're bringing. With that, it's accentuated through: one, the launch of the 3 ml vial in the hospital setting, and that's allowed us to gain much greater traction there. Third, we've been able to really leverage the launch of Tradjenta on our insulin business. So therefore, we're bringing more comprehensive meaningful solutions to the customer and the physician, in this case. And then last but not least, obviously we've also had some impact in contracting. Now what you'll see is that year-to-year that's going to ebb and flow. So last year in 2011, we benefited from some of the contracting work that we have done. And if you look at our Q1 results and you're tracking the shares in Humalog in the U.S., you'll see in the first quarter we've lost some share and this was essentially due to us losing the CBS [ph] contract to Novo. But still the underlying performance has gone quite steady, and we see improvements and including in our key markets outside of U.S. where we continue to gain share as well.","Travis Coy","And Mark, this is Travis. The only thing I'll add to Derica's comment around the Caremark formulary is that there were really 2 parts of that, that impacted our business. One, being the Medicare Part D part, and then the other part being the commercial part. With respect to erosion of share based on loss of that formulary, we do expect that with that as largely behind us, on both of those parts, it is worth noting that the custom plans, which are part of the commercial part, we did not see share of market erosion. So I just wanted to leave that point with you as well.","Ilissa Rassner","In terms of Emerging Markets in diabetes, diabetes is an area of great importance for us in Emerging Markets, and our goal is to regain market leadership in diabetes. This quarter, we saw strong growth in Humalog. In terms of how we perform against Novo, we have approximately a 15% share, and this is something we're going to grow over time, but it will take time. One thing that's of key importance is ACCEPT. We've made significant progress on this front. And it has now put us on equal footing with Novo.","Derica W. Rice","In terms of growth, just to put some numbers around that, if you look at the last sort of trailing 12 months, the latest data we have is of January. But mealtime insulin market in China is growing around 17% and changing. Our growth market was over 60%, 6-0%. John?","John C. Lechleiter","Well, everybody else has commented on diabetes, so I'd better get my 2 cents' worth in. I think you're right, Mark. This is -- we view diabetes as being, figuratively and literally, the heart of our business. And insulin and continued competitiveness in insulin is the key for our success in this therapeutic area. I think looking ahead, what are the levers that we have and what are the things that we think will amount to critical success factors. Certainly, the BI partnership, which is global in reach, gives us not only additional coverage and presence in key markets, but also access to new molecules. We're focused on increasing the competitiveness of our manufacturing process and the competitiveness of the delivery devices that more and more are key determinants of patient choice in terms of people starting on insulin therapy. And of course, innovation. We have a pipeline today in concert with BI that includes the DPP-4, Tradjenta, currently the fastest-growing class, empagliflozin now completing Phase III. We have dulaglutide, our GLP, and of course, 2 insulins. So I think all of this [indiscernible] well for us being able to offer a broad range of products to the diabetologist, to the physician, to really focus on what the patient needs and not just on what we have to offer. With respect to the Supreme Court, obviously, if the law is upheld, we keep on keeping on. Last year, to put this in perspective, we paid about $586 million out of our treasury as a result of the Affordable Care Act. That was partly the fee, partly the increase, the rebate on products sold into Medicaid, and then the additional money needed to help Medicare patients bridge the donut hole. If the law is overturned, obviously, we would not have that sort of short. We would presumably regain what we essentially paid out in 2011 at least going forward. On the other hand, until something comes along that can replace the ACA, I don't think any of us believe there's a \"status quo.\" It will be unclear how we address the very real needs of 50 million people in this country who are uninsured and who, therefore, presumably have less access or no access to products like the ones that Lilly offers.","Operator","We'll go to the line of John Boris at Citi.","John T. Boris - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","First couple are just pipeline related for Jan on solanezumab. Can you give any commentary on the dropouts or dropout rate out of the clinical trials that are currently ongoing? Second question on the pipeline has to do with the BI deal. There certainly is the prospects for attractive combination products. Are you and BI exploring a combination of Tradjenta with impactful flows? And going forward it would seem that the hemoglobin A1C [ph] lowering effect to that combo could potentially be pretty compelling? And then last question, for John, just on the political scene. If we can possibly just get an update there, in particular, on how PDUFA is being shaped. And also do you see potentially there being any risk to higher discounts or rebates on dual eligibles and any additional givebacks on Medicare Part D?","Philip Johnson","John, we'll have Jan start off and maybe Ilissa chime in. And then, we'll in move over to John for the last part of your question.","Jan M. Lundberg","Yes, if you look at the dropout rates for the sola trial, it's a different pattern than what we saw for semagacestat. For semagacestat, there were many more issues with patients dropping out because of side effects. For solanezumab, there is a small dropout, but that has mainly been due to practical reasons with infusion centers, et cetera. So I think we are quite encouraged by this and also by the follow-on trial where 95% of the patients had continued actually with solanezumab infusions. So I think that tells about the safety profile of these agents. I agree that to have both the DPP-4 and the SGL T-2 in the pipeline is great. And we have opportunities which we are pursuing there off combos between these 2 agents.","John C. Lechleiter","John, this is John Leichleiter. I think on PDUFA, we're pleased at this stage with the way in which the PDUFA 5 [ph] has been received on Capitol Hill. Certainly, we've engaged in a lot of dialogue with legislators there. And we believe that we're making good progress towards the passage of that, including the reauthorization of the pediatric extension or pediatric exclusivity provision. With respect to some of the issues that we've wrestled with certainly in the last year in the context of the deficit reduction and other things, the higher rebates, for the duals or other changes to Medicare Part D, I expect these are going to continue to be discussed. I don't expect in light of this being an election year that there's going to be action, one way or the other, but obviously waiting. So the country is wrestling this long-term deficit and the consequences of that to the ground. And I expect we're going to have to continue to stay very attentive to this issue and tuned into this. And to continue to make the case that Medicare Part D is not only working for seniors, it's wildly exceeding anyone's expectation in terms of its effectiveness and its cost.","Philip Johnson","We are nearing the top of the hour, which is our allotted time for the call. Because of technical difficulties, we will continue for a few more minutes.","Operator","That will come from the line of Greg Gilbert at Bank of America.","Gregory B. Gilbert - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","A couple for Jan. First, anything to update as on the timing and design of the evacetrapib studies. Secondly, on your GLP-1, given that you have results in-house, can you comment on your confidence in the safety profile of your drug versus the class? Or in any way that you feel comfortable disclosing the bigger picture confidence there? And I guess lastly, for John, I can't let you off the hook on Washington matters here. Which way is the wind blowing on taxation and repatriation? And when might we see some action on those fronts if ever?","Philip Johnson","Great. Jan?","Jan M. Lundberg","Yes. Let's start with the evacetrapib. As you know, we communicated a very promising data then in the fall. And we have -- during extensive planning then for the Phase III trial, including then interaction with regulators, which we are close to completing. We have also been preparing the CMC material for the trial. We feel very good about the options we have to start this trial before the end of this year as we have communicated. In relation to safety of dulaglutide, Enrica [ph] presented some data last year about this agent. And as we said, we have completed the large hemodynamic study, which was originally a potential Achilles' heel for this agent. And we will now present this data very soon at the American Society of Hypertension meeting, which I think will clarify the situation for this agent. But we are very confident.","John C. Lechleiter","Greg, with respect to your last question, I'm going to turn it over to our tax expert, Mr. Rice.","Derica W. Rice","Obviously, there are discussions and debates that continues. I think given this being an election year, no one anticipates that there's going to be any resolution on the tax front. And likewise, same thing is true in terms of repatriation. I think everyone is gearing towards that. Obviously, there are multiple proposals out there, depending upon what member of Congress you're talking to or the Senate. So this is just a space we're going to have to continue to watch. We continue to engage. From our position, our focus is on, obviously, if we can go to a territorial tax system, we believe that, that will be best for all. And if we can get repatriation relief that would be outstanding. But that's not our #1 priority.","Operator","We'll go to the line of Seamus Fernandez at Leerink.","Seamus Fernandez - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","So just a quick question on the Alimta patent situation. Can you update us on progress, both in Europe and the U.S., with regard to the patent that could potentially extend the life of Alimta to 2021, 2022? And how that might bake into your long-term expectations for the business? And then second question is really on the evolution of the potential insulin portfolio. Can you just give us again not just the thoughts on how the COGS could improve from the development or successful development of both the novel basal insulin and the biosimilar? But how do you envision the market evolving with both of those products potentially available?","Philip Johnson","Ilissa, I think, tackle the Alimta patent question and then I think Derica might want to chime in as well. Ilissa?","Ilissa Rassner","The patent for Alimta that you're referring to covers the administration of folic acid and vitamin B12, prior to treatment of patients with Alimta. In terms of an update, there was a Markman hearing that occurred yesterday. And that case was to determine the meaning of 2 disputed claim terms, vitamin B12 and patient. That hearing happened yesterday. The judge did state that a decision is expected within 45 days. Other than that, the case is still in early stages of fact discovery and a trial date has not been set. Obviously, we're not able to speculate on what the outcome will be, but we're prepared to continue our vigorous defense of this patent. And as you mentioned, it would extend Alimta exclusivity through May 2022 in the U.S. and 2020 in Europe.","John C. Lechleiter","And then the first instance overseas in Europe, Seamus, we had prevailed. That's now in the process of appeal. I don't know that any hearings are scheduled to occur again in that particular proceeding until potentially into next year. Derica, do you want to comment at all on sort of how this might play into our planning going forward, if it's upheld or if it's not upheld?","Derica W. Rice","Seamus, if this is upheld, then this will be upside for us. And clearly, we will reap the benefits of the continuing revenue stream, and obviously, cash flow from that. In regard to your next question in terms of the evolution of our insulin portfolio, we actually are very excited about the breadth of portfolio that we have in the diabetes space, going from our presence now in oral to our presence in GLP to now with the 2 basal insulins that we have and the development of the basal space as well as the mealtime. So we believe on a competitive front, we'd be the only big pharma company that will play in all of the diabetes segments. As it relates to the particular -- the insulin portfolio, in particular and in focusing more on the basals, we believe just looking at the basal space clearly Lantus glargine has become the standard of care there, and we believe it will have a continuing presence there. So we looked at the market dissection. We believe Lantus will retain at least about 1\/3 of the basal market. We believe that biosimilars, including our glargine-like product, will occupy about that second, third. And then we believe there's space for a new innovation in that basal space, and this is where we look to play with our novel basal insulin in that last third.","Philip Johnson","Thanks, Derica. As always, we definitely appreciate your interest in Lilly and your participation in today's call. In particular today, we appreciate your patience as we worked through technical difficulties.

Please go ahead.","Philip Johnson","Good morning and thank you for joining us for Eli Lilly & Company\u2019s Fourth Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. I\u2019m Phil Johnson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Joining me this morning are Derica Rice, our Chief Financial Officer; Dr. Jan Lundberg, President of Lilly Research Laboratories; Sue Mahony, President of our Oncology business and Ilissa Rassner and Travis Coy from the Investor Relations team. John Lechleiter, our Chairman, President and CEO is traveling overseas and is unable to join us today.","During this conference call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors, including those listed on Slide 3 and those outlined in our latest Forms 10-K and 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It is not intended to be promotional and is not sufficient for prescribing decisions.","Since our last earnings call, we had a number of significant events. Here are some of the highlights. On the regulatory front, we had three approvals by the European Commission including Cialis, for once-daily use for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of BPH; Amyvid, is a diagnostic radiopharmaceutical for the PET imaging of beta-amyloid neuritic plaque density in the brains of adult patients with cognitive impairment who are being evaluated for Alzheimer\u2019s Disease and other causes of cognitive impairment; and along with our partner Boehringer Ingelheim, Trajenta for use in combination with insulin in adults with type 2 diabetes.","Erbitux received two approvals. In Japan, we along with our partners Merck Serono, and Bristol-Myers Squibb received approval for Erbitux for the treatment of patients who had neck cancers. And in Canada, along with our partner Bristol-Myers Squibb, we received approval for Erbitux in combination with a chemotherapy regimen as an initial treatment of patients with EGFR-expressing metastatic colorectal cancer.","Turning to clinical moves, the Alzheimer\u2019s disease cooperative study presented additional data from the solanezumab EXPEDITION studies at CTAD. We also announced that we plan to conduct an additional Phase III study of solanezumab in patients with mild Alzheimer's disease.","At the American College of Rheumatology Annual Meeting, we presented Phase II RA data for two of our autoimmune assays, baricitinib, the oral JAK1\/JAK2 inhibitor in partnership with Incyte; and tabalumab, our anti-BAFF monoclonal antibody.","For tabalumab, we also announced the discontinuation of one of the three Phase III RA registration studies due to insufficient efficacy.","Timely, with our partner, Boehringer Ingelheim, we announced top-line results for four Phase III trials of empagliflozin and SGLT-2 inhibitor being studied for the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes. In all four studies, the primary efficacy endpoint was met.","In business development news, Lilly along with our partner Boehringer Ingelheim announced an adjustment to the scope of our diabetes alliance with Lilly reassuming sole worldwide development and commercialization rights to our investigational novel basal insulin analog. And we received notice from Bristol-Myers Squibb to terminate the collaboration for necitumumab in North America and Japan, which will result in Lilly assuming sole worldwide development and commercialization rights.","There were three other noteworthy events since the Q3 earnings call. We reached an agreement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, to settle the issues regarding compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.","As part of our efforts to align global manufacturing with long-term business needs, we announced we will discontinue manufacturing operations in Mexico by mid-2015. And our Board of Directors authorized the initiation of the new 1.5 billion share repurchase program, which we anticipate completing in 2013. In the fourth quarter of 2012, we repurchased $400 million worth of shares under this program and also completed the $490 million remaining in our previously authorized share repurchase program.","Now let\u2019s discuss our financial performance for the quarter and the full year of 2012. As we have done on previous calls, we will focus our comments on the non-GAAP results, which we believe provide insights into the underlying trends in our business. This view excludes certain item such as restructuring charges, asset impairments and other special charges.","On slide seven, you can see that revenue in Q4 2012 was nearly $6 billion which is 1% below Q4 2011. This decrease in revenue was due to the loss of patent exclusivity for Zyprexa in most major markets outside of Japan, nearly entirely offset by growth from several other products, including double-digit growth in the US for Cymbalta, Alimta, and our animal health products, in international markets for Forteo, Humalog and Strattera and in both US and international markets for Effient.","In Q4 2012, excluding Zyprexa outside of Japan, the rest of our worldwide revenue grew 5%. Gross margin as a percent of revenue increased 90 basis points from 78.1% to 79.0%. This increase was driven by the impact of foreign exchange rates on international inventory sold, which increased cost of sales in Q4 2011 but reduced cost of sales in Q4 2012. Excluding these FX effect from both 2011 and 2012, gross margin as a percent of revenue declined by 0.3 percentage points, from 78.8% in Q4 2011 to 78.5% in Q4 2012.","Moving down the income statement, Q4 2012 total operating expense defined as the sum of R&D and SG&A declined 1%. This reflects continued discipline in managing our operating expenses, while investing in our pipeline to drive future growth. Specifically this 1% decline is comprised of a 7% reduction in marketing, selling and administrative expenses, and 8% growth in R&D expenses. The reduction in marketing, selling and administrative expenses was driven by lower marketing expenses and to a lesser extent by lower selling expenses.","The growth in R&D expenses was largely driven by higher late stage clinical trial costs, including a $50 million milestone payment to Incyte based on initiation of RA Phase III program for baricitinib and a $30 million charge related to the decision to stop one of the Phase III trials for tabalumab in rheumatoid arthritis.","Other income and deductions was the net expense of $52 million in Q4 2012, compared to net expense of $27 million in the fourth quarter 2011.","Our tax rate was 22.3%, an increase of 2.4 percentage points from Q4 2011 primarily due to the lapse of R&D tax credit in 2012. Since the American Taxpayer Relief Act was passed in January of this year, the full-year 2012 R&D tax credit we recognized as a discrete tax benefit in Q1 2013.","At the bottom line net income and earnings per share each decreased 2% resulting in non-GAAP EPS of $0.85 for the quarter. For the full year, revenue decreased 7% driven by the loss of patent exclusivity for Zyprexa in most markets outside of Japan. Excluding Zyprexa outside of Japan, the rest of our worldwide revenue grew 6% for the full year.","Operating expenses in 2012 decreased 1%, driven primarily by lower marketing expenses, partially offset by increases in R&D due to late stage clinical trial costs. Finally, net income and EPS each declined 23% driven by lower sales from the Zyprexa patent expiration.","In summary, our full-year 2012 financial results clearly reflect the impact of Zyprexa patent expirations outside of Japan. However, 2012 results also demonstrate continued growth in a number of products and businesses not experiencing patent expiration. Our fourth quarter results show that we\u2019re emerging from the Zyprexa patent expiration period, and with continued growth in the rest of our business along with Prudent Expense Management, we are on track to return to growth in 2013. We remain committed to meet or exceed our minimum financial targets through 2014 and are positioned to return to growth post-2014.","Slide eight shows our reported income statement while slide nine provides a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS. Additional details about our reported earnings are available in today\u2019s earnings press release.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Illisa.","Ilissa Rassner","Thanks, Phil. As we can see on slide 10, the total revenue decline of 1% in Q4 2012 shown in the yellow bar on the middle of the page was driven by a negative volume impact of 3%, and a negative foreign exchange impact of 1%, partially offset by a favorable price impact of 2%.","By geography, you\u2019ll notice that U.S. volume decreased 10% and Europe\u2019s volume decreased 3%. both of these decreases were due to Zyprexa. excluding olanzapine from both 2011 and 2012, volume in the rest of our U.S. business is flat, and was up 3% in Europe.","In Europe, you\u2019ll see a positive 1% impact from price. Normally, price in Europe was negative. The increase in Q4 was driven by new information that led to accrual adjustments related to prior quarters of 2012. Excluding these adjustments, European price would have been down about 2%.","Turning to Japan, we had another quarter of robust volume growth of 16%, driven primarily by Forteo, Alimta, Zyprexa, Strattera, Cialis and Cymbalta. This was partially offset by a negative 10% price impact due to the biannual price decreases, primarily affecting Alimta and Gemzar.","In our ROW Line, China was a significant growth driver in Q4, delivering 22% total growth almost entirely from volume. Elanco Animal Health also delivered robust growth of 19% driven by strong organic growth in both the food and companion animal businesses. Elanco continues to outperform the broader animal health market, and is poised for double-digit income growth during the YZ years and beyond.","Finally, the 17% decrease in collaboration and other revenue was due to the transfer of U.S. exenatide rights to Amylin. Excluding exenatide collaboration and other revenue grew 24% in the quarter.","Slide 11 shows the year-on-year growth of select line items of our non-GAAP income statement, with and without the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates. For both the quarter and the full year, FX contributed positively to EPS growth, despite weaker foreign currencies that had a negative effect on revenue. This was more than offset by the positive effect of FX on international inventory sold, which was through cost of sales. As a result at the bottom line, you can see that Q4 EPS declined 2% including FX, and 6% excluding FX. For the full year, EPS declined 23% including FX and 29% excluding FX.","For your information on slide 12, we've provided the year-on-year growth of select line items our reported income statement with and without the effect of foreign exchange rates.","Slide 13, shows our pipeline as of January 21. Changes since our last earnings call are highlighted with green arrows showing progression, and red arrow showing attrition. You will see that we began Phase III testing of the oral JAK1\/JAK2 inhibitor baricitinib, which we are developing in partnership with Incyte. In addition, we began Phase II testing of the small molecule for depression and a cancer biologics. And we started Phase I testing of four assets, three for diabetes and one for cancer.","We also terminated development of three Phase I molecules. I\u2019d also highlight that we initiated a Phase III trial of our Anti-IL-17 Monoclonal Antibody ixekizumab in psoriatic arthritis. With the addition of baricitinib, we now have 13 assets in Phase III and we continue to believe that our robust pipeline spanning oncology, diabetes, cardiovascular, neuroscience, and autoimmune diseases positions us for growth post 2014.","We had a number of encouraging data readouts in 2012 that reinforce our confidence in the potential of our pipeline. As we discussed in our dial-ins call earlier this month, we expect a lot of pipeline activity in 2013, including our oncology molecule. We are pleased to have Sue Mahony, President of our Oncology business with us this morning to provide an update on the oncology pipeline. Sue?","Sue Mahony","Thanks Ilissa. We are excited about the progress that we made in advancing our late-stage oncology pipeline in 2012, and we expect to continue this progress in 2013, with a number of data disclosures and potential submissions.","I will start with an update on ramucirumab. Last week, at ASCO GI we disclosed the first Phase III data of fully human monoclonal antibody, which is a key late-stage pipeline assets similarly. Ramucirumab selectively targets and blocks the VEGF receptor-2 into changes in blood vessel formation in humans. The data was from the REGARD trial evaluating ramucirumab as a single agent compared to placebo, and best supportive care in the second line treatment setting for patients with metastatic gastric cancer. The trial met its primary endpoint of improved overall survival and also showed prolonged progression free survival.","Currently, there are no agents specifically approved for second-line gastric cancer treatment in the U.S. and Europe. We believe that the overall efficacy and safety data from the REGARD trial demonstrated that ramucirumab has a promising treatment profile in the difficult to treat patient population. We have been meeting with regulators to discuss our filing strategies, and we intend to submit the regulatory approval in the U.S. and Europe in 2013. We also intend to have additional data presented and published from REGARD later this year.","Aside from REGARD, three of the Phase III ramucirumab trials have completed patient enrollment, ROW, the first line metastatic breast cancer trial, RAINBOW, the gastric combo trial unravel our study in second-line non-small cell lung cancer. Completion of patient enrollment for the other two Phase III trials in liver and colorectal cancers is expected to be achieved this year. We also expect topline data from ROWs and RAINBOW later this year.","Moving on to necitumumab, Lilly will be assuming sole worldwide development and commercialization rights from the termination of our agreement in North America and Japan, from our partner Bristol-Myers Squibb. We're fully committed to the development of necitumumab for which a Phase III study in squamous first-line metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, SQUIRE is ongoing, and fully enrolled. We expect to have data readout from the SQUIRE trial later this year or early next year. If the lung cancer trial necitumumab and ramucirumab are positive, we will be positioned off a comprehensive treatment strategy for non-small cell lung cancer patient.","For Alimta, the standard of care the first line of nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer. With necitumumab, the first-line squamous non-small cell lung cancer, and with ramucirumab, the second-line treatment.","Our third Phase III molecule Enzastaurin is being studied as maintenance therapy in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma at high risk of relapse after heart shock induction therapy.","The prognosis for high risk patients through disease recurred is poor and there are no approved treatment in this clinical setting. We expect to have the required number of events in the 12 new trial in the first half of 2013 and plan to submit later this year, if the results are positive.","In addition to the three late stage molecules, we have a robust early and mid-stage pipeline with novel mechanisms of action, tailoring potential and early data in areas of significant unmet need. We believe that Lilly\u2019s large and diverse oncology pipelines, positions us to success in the coming years, and provide the basis for continued future growth.","And now, Derica will summarize key events across our entire corporate portfolio for 2012 and \u201813 and discuss our updated 2013 financial guidance, Derica?","Derica W. Rice","","Thanks Sue. When we rolled out our 2012 guidance, we've provided you with the list of key events for the year. Now we updated that list quarterly so that you can keep track of our progress. As those rated by the green checkmarks on slide 14, you can see that we made significant advances with our pipeline in 2012. Now as Ilissa mentioned, there is a lot to look forward to in 2013 as well.","Specifically as shown on slide 15, we anticipate a number of potential external data disclosures at scientific meetings. These include presentation of detailed data from some of the Phase III trials for dulaglutide and in collaboration with Bullinger Ingelheim for empagliflozin. Both potential treatment for type II diabetes. And presentation of data from the Phase III trial of ramucirumab in first-line breast cancer. Note that the data we expect to receive in 2013 from this trial will be the final progression free survival data and the interim overall survival data.","And finally, presentation of data for the Phase III trial of enzastaurin as maintenance therapy for patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. There are also a number of Phase III trials that may produce data in 2013 although presentation of detailed data at medical meetings would likely occur later. These include the initial Phase III trials of our novel basal insulin analog for both type 1 and type 2 diabetes, the pivotal trials for our new insulin glargine product. The Phase III study of ramucirumab as combination therapy in second-line gastric cancer, the initial trials of edivoxetine as adjunctive therapy for major depressive disorder. Also, we\u2019ll conduct additional analyses of Phase III trials of tabalumab for rheumatoid arthritis.","In total, we\u2019ll have Phase III data read outs or detailed data presentation on 8 of our 13 Phase III assets. in 2013, we could see up to five regulatory filings. these include three diabetes assets, dulaglutide, empagliflozin and our new insulin glargine product and two oncology assets, ramucirumab as monotherapy for second-line gastric cancer as well as enzastaurin for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.","As for other key events to watchful in 2013. We plan to initiate another pivotal trial of solanezumab in patients with mild Alzheimer\u2019s disease. In August, we\u2019ll have the U.S. District Court trial for the Alimta method of use patent and in December, we\u2019ll lose U.S. exclusivity for Cymbalta. We\u2019re excited about 2013 and the opportunities we have to continue to advance our pipeline and to share data that will help investors better judge our growth potential post-2014.","Slide 16 shows the 2013 financial guidance that we discussed in detail on our call on January 4. We have now incorporated the one-time benefit of the 2012 R&D tax credit that will be recorded as a discrete item in Q1 of 2013. You can see that the estimated full-year GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates have been lowered by 1.5 percentage point. We've also raised our GAAP and non-GAAP EPS ranges by $0.07. We now expect full year 2013 earnings per share to be in the range of $4.10 to $4.25 on a GAAP basis or $3.82 to $3.97 cents on a non-GAAP basis. All other line items of our previously issued guidance remain unchanged. If you are looking for additional color commentary on our 2013 guidance please refer to today's press release as well as the investor section at lilly.com, where you will find the slides and audio from our January 4 call.","Slide 17, provides a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS for 2012 and the associated growth rate from these numbers to our 2013 guidance.","To sum up, we made steady progress in 2012 implementing our three strategic priorities; replenishing and advancing our pipeline, driving strong performance on our marketed brands in key growth areas; and increasing productivity, and reducing our cost structure. Our financial results for Q4 2012 and the full year show our progress with China, Japan, Elanco, and several key brands all producing double-digit volume growth for the quarter and the full year. This strong performance combined with our disciplined and managing costs generated $5 billion of operating cash flow, covering capital expenditures of about $900 million and our dividend are roughly $2.2 billion, and enabling us to complete our prior share repurchase program, and to initiate the new $1.5 billion share repurchase program.","Our continued strong operating performance gives us confidence that we will successfully navigate through IV with the capacity to drive future growth. We continue to be on track to meet or exceed our mid-term financial projections. Minimum annual revenue of at least $20 billion, net income of at least $3 billion, and operating cash flow of at least $4 billion.","Looking at the pipeline, we made significant progress over the past 12 months. We advanced 12 molecules into Phase 1, eight molecules into Phase II, two molecules into Phase III and launched Amyvid in the U.S. We now have 13 assets in Phase III and 23 assets in Phase II with a good mix of small molecules and biologics across all basis of our portfolio. We generated a significant amount of data in 2012 and we anticipate data readout or detailed presentations on each of our 13 Phase III assets this year. This is the most robust mid to late stage pipeline in our history, and it positions us to drive growth post 2014. We continue to believe that our innovation strategy is the right one to benefit patients and create value for shareholders. We look forward to providing more update as we continue to execute this strategy.","Now this concludes our prepared remarks and we will take your questions.","Julie, first caller please?","Question-And-Answer Session","","Operator","","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And with that we\u2019ll go to the line of Catherine Arnold with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Catherine J. Arnold \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities","","Thank you very much and good morning. I had a question for Sue; I was wondering, if you could comment on if there is a scenario in the cancer area, where a drug hit PFS and OS and wasn\u2019t approved or didn\u2019t get priority review. And whether if you could just comment on Eli\u2019s data is out what was most surprising to HER as far as total dataset released, thanks?","Sue Mahony","Thank you Catherine. With regards to your first question about whether there\u2019s has been agents in the cancer market, that has overall survival on PFS data without approval of priority review. I am not aware of any molecule in the cancer market that has had overall survival, and PFS data that hasn\u2019t been approved or indeed have priority review.","With regard to your question about the data for REGARD, for Ramucirumab, obviously we were very pleased to see the data, and we were pleased by the reaction that we had from investigators, and thought leaders in prescribing physicians, ASCO GI last week. I think specifically this is the first study to show both an overall survival and progression free survival advantage in a difficult to treat patient population, in a high unmet need. As a single agent and this was a single agent study for Ramucirumab. And in addition to that we saw a safety and side effect profile with again we we\u2019re pleased to see with just 10.5% of patients coming off therapy because of the side effects in the ram arm, 6% in the placebo arm. So I think it is a balance between the efficacy that we saw and the safety that we saw in that trial, that we were presently pleased to see.","Philip Johnson","","Catherine, thanks for the questions. Julie, if we have the next caller please.","Operator","The next question is from Tim Anderson with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Tim Anderson \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC","Thank you. Couple of pipeline questions. Your pipeline charges that you have a CDK4\/6 inhibitors in Phase II that\u2019s similar to the Pfizer compound. I am wondering when we might see that efficacy data from that Phase II trial. And then on solanezumab, just a regulatory update in the ex-U.S. markets, if I understand it correctly that you could potentially file the drug for approval in certain ex-U.S. markets without the need for the additional trial that you described on December 12, and if there is a possibility when what might we hear more from you on this matter?","Derica W. Rice","Okay, great. Tim, thanks for the question. Sue, do you want to answer the question on the CDK4\/6 timing?","Sue Mahony","Sure, yeah.","Derica W. Rice","You have to give update on the \u2013 okay.","Sue Mahony","Yes, you are correct, we do have a CDK4\/6 inhibitor in Phase II study. It\u2019s currently being developed for relapsed and refractory (inaudible). And we expect this trial to conclude in 2014 and we are also planning on future trials with this molecule.","Tim Anderson \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay.","Derica W. Rice","Jan.","Jan M. Lundberg","In relation to our plans with solanezumab outside U.S., we are in preliminary discussions with a number of regulators, but it\u2019s too early to comment it, there could be different actions being taken in different geographies, but the systems are somewhat different compared to the FDA.","Tim Anderson \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","","Great.","Philip Johnson","Tim, thank you for the questions. Julie, can we have our next caller please.","Operator","That comes from Andrew Baum with Citi, please go ahead.","Andrew S. Baum \u2013 Citigroup Inc.","","Yeah. Just one follow-up on the CDK4\\6, the Phase II trial you\u2019ve had ongoing out fragmental has been running for three, four years or so. Is this a function of focus of Lilly or could you just comment on the competitive specificity of both the Asian competitor and Pfizer component?","Derica W. Rice","Okay, Sue?","Sue Mahony","Yeah, we obviously don\u2019t have comparative data both despite (inaudible). I can tell you that we are very excited by our CDK4\\6 inhibitor and as I mentioned we have on going plans to have further studies of this molecule going forward. So you should be seeing more and hearing more about this molecule going forward?","Philip Johnson","Okay, thanks Sue. Julie next caller please.","Operator","","Thank you. And that goes to Tony Butler with Barclays Capital. Please go ahead.","Tony Butler \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","","Thanks very much. Also one for Sue Mahony, Sue I understand that, and then respectful of the comments, with Ramucirumab and the REGARD trial, and filing in the second line monotherapy indication, but I\u2019m curious just simply based on the six week benefit if that\u2019s truly sufficient that you do not need RAINBOW in order to support that filing and you could add RAINBOW or provide that to the FDA in the subsequent time. Thanks very much.","Sue Mahony","Thank your for the question. With regard to the data from the monotherapy study REGARD, just to \u2013 we emphasized why we believe that this is a study that we plan to submit to the authority this year. Again there is no approved agent in the second line setting in gastric cancer, and this is the first non-chemotherapy agent that will have shown both an overall survival and a progression free survival improvement.","Now you mentioned the 1.4 months, we put that into perspective. The patients in the control arm with the medium of 3.8 months and that compared to 5.2 months for the Ramucirumab, with a hazard ratio that shows a reduced risk of death of 22% and this corresponds to increase in medium survival of 37%. Again with a safety profile were 10.5% of patients discontinued therapy due to adverse events in the random arm compared to 6% in the placebo arm and the most frequent grade three or moderate adverse event being hypertension 7.6% grade three in the random arm versus 2.6% grade in the placebo arm with no grade four severe hypertension.","So we believe again with that, the balance of efficacy and safety in this very high unmet need with this no approved therapies, but this is a chart that we believe that we should submit, and plan to submit as quickly as possible.","now obviously we cannot comment on how the regulatory authorities will view this data and we will continue to work with the regulatory authorities to ensure that we have a robust data packages possible to ensure approve this molecule as quickly as possible for patients.","Philip Johnson","Okay. Thank you, Sue. thanks Tony. Julie, next caller please.","Operator","Thank you. Greg Gilbert from Bank of America, please go ahead.","Gregory B. Gilbert \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Sure. A couple of more on ramucirumab 2, you guys have had the data for some time and you\u2019ve been talking to the regulators for some time. so can you share with us what piece of info or conversation guidance that you would actually submit? And secondly, Sue, how quickly could the organization be ready to launch and can you put some context around that organization and how nimble it is, and what would we like to launch a new product in the current configuration? Thanks.","Sue Mahony","All right, yeah. Thank you. We have initiated conversations with regulatory authorities, but I really can\u2019t comment at this point on what those conversations have been or really anticipate or make any predictions about what the regulatory authorities will do with this data. And we made the decision to submit based on what we believe is the robustness of both this data and the stipulating activity that we\u2019ve seen.","With regard to preparation for launch, we have a history of oncology with deep oncology experience at Lilly and our objectives and plan will be to get this agent approved as quickly as possible and we will see to PET to launch accordingly.","Philip Johnson","Greg, thanks for the questions. Julie, next caller please.","Operator","That\u2019s from Seamus Fernandez with Leerink Swann LLC. Please go ahead.","Seamus Fernandez \u2013 Leerink Swann LLC","","Hi, thanks very much for the questions. So quickly, Sue, can you give us an idea of how we should think about the commercial opportunity in the second line of setting for Ramucirumab particularly in gastric cancer, first off. What\u2019s the number of patients that we would expect to see, whether it would be in the US or internationally with gastric cancer for this indication?","And then second question, as it relates to Ramucirumab specifically in the other cancers, what do you think that you are learning about Ramucirumab at this point that\u2019s new and different from Avastin? Is it differentiating itself more on the efficacy in your opinion or the safety or both? Thanks.","Sue Mahony","Okay. With regards to your first question about the opportunity in gastric cancer, if we look globally, gastric cancer is the forth most common cancer in the world with nearly a million patient being diagnosed each year with gastric cancer, and about 700,000 deaths each year. Now it is more prevalent in Asian countries than it is in the Western world. And in the US, the incidence is about 20,000 Americans who we diagnosed with gastric cancer and about 10,000 death. So the larger population is in the Asia world, however again as I mentioned, the unmet need is great and there are no approved medicines in the US and there is no agreed standard of care in the US.","With regards to the second\u2026.","","Seamus Fernandez \u2013 Leerink Swann LLC","What are you learning with the possibility for ram in terms of how it may or may not compare with the last month safety and efficacy.","Sue Mahony","Yeah, Ramucirumab is an anti-angiogenic, but it works very differently to Avatin. Ramucirumab is selective to the VEGF 2 receptor and we see this as being a different mechanism of action. So we will continue to see data going forward. The hypothesis when we developed Ramucirumab would be \u2013 well that selectivity would generate both efficacy, and potentially both efficacy and safety benefit. Obviously we\u2019ll continue to see more data over the next 12 months to 18 months with our trials, but we\u2019re pleased to see the third trial lead out in monotherapy which is different and with the safety profile that we\u2019ve see again looks very promising.","Philip Johnson","Okay, thanks Sue. Thanks Seamus. Julie, next caller please.","Operator","","Thank you. Steve Scala with Cowen, please go ahead.","Steve M. Scala \u2013 Cowen & Co. LLC","Thanks. Two questions. First, on the last call you stated that you are in a process of reviewing glargine biosimiliar data and that it was encouraging relative to comparability. I am wondering if you have any further thoughts on the data and how is this data different than the data Derica referred to on Page 15. So that\u2019s the first question.","Then second question is for Dr. Lundberg, does Lilly believe 18 months is sufficiently long to test the base inhibitor in Phase III and does Lilly believe monomers are inherently toxic or are they devoid of biologic activity. Thank you.","Michael J. Harrington","All right, great. Thanks Steve, I\u2019ll go ahead and answer your first question on glargine before turning it over to Jan. So the data that and Rick, I think mentioned on our last call that Derica also mentioned on this call is essentially the same. There are number of studies to support registration that we\u2019re in the process of concluding or we\u2019ll conclude here in the first part of 2013. That we expect to support a submission later this year. Jan?","Jan M. Lundberg","The duration of Alzheimer trials, it\u2019s the key topic for our future discussions here regarding various agents. Currently solanezumab was tested for 18 months are there we were actually able to see reduction in cognitive decline. So I think that tells that 18 month could be enough providing that we chose the population of mild Alzheimer's disease. The specific PRO-based needs to be determined after we have the full Phase 2 data and discussions that regulates this.","The toxicity of monomers for Ab1-42 is there and sola data suggests that if you influence the free monomers you actually have a beneficial effect on cognition in the Alzheimer\u2019s disease patients.","Philip Johnson","Great. Thanks Jan. Thanks Steve. Julie next caller please.","Operator","","Thank you. Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Jay Olson \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.\t","Hi, this is Jay Olson on behalf of Jami Rubin. Couple of questions, first off on Alimta, could you please update on the status of your method of use patent in Europe, and when we should expect to hear more in that? And secondly, one of your competitors are about to spin-off their animal health business, and if that transaction goes well, would you consider a similar approach with your animal health business? Thank you.","Philip Johnson","Great, thanks Jay. Sue, for the Alimta question, then Derica for the question on animal health.","Sue Mahony","","Sure, the Alimta question was around the method of use. Let me just comment on the fact to remind people that the court affirmed the validity of the compound patent last year, so we have Alimta patent in Europe through to 2017 and sorry \u2013 U.S. through 2017 and Europe through 2015. And with regard to the method of use patent which is the administration of (inaudible) and bitumen B trials. The court hearing will be held in the U.S. here in August. In Europe, the patent or a similar patent was challenged by the European Patent Office and a ruling was issued in Lilly\u2019s favor in the first instant; this is being appealed, but we do not have any update on the timing of that appeal.","Philip Johnson","Great. Derica?","Derica W. Rice","In regards to our animal health business, obviously we know that there is a lot of interest in Pfizer spin out there but in regards to Lilly, we have no intention to divesting of our animal health business. We\u2019ve been quiet pleased with it.","As you heard earlier, in the fourth quarter, our animal health business grew about 18% and for the year, it grew about 21% and this is the business that we actually anticipate will double over this period, we call it YZ. And so we have got great returns from that business and great benefit for Lilly.","We also have received significant synergies between our animal health business as well as with our human pharma business, both in terms of innovation. Most of our human, before testing a human we run our molecules through animal model. And so that provide you a lot of leverage to our animal health. And then in addition to that, we also give leverage through and synergies through our manufacturing and corporate overhead base.","So for now, we are very pleased with our animal health business and we see this being a long main stay in terms of our portfolio mix.","Sue Mahony","Yeah, one thing Jim I would add as well is in the animal health business, in large part due to the entry into and substantial success that we\u2019ve had in the companion animal market, but also due to continuing productivity efforts within our food animal business, we\u2019ve seen a substantial margin expansion over the last few years out of Elanco Animal Health. We have been running with margins on a pre-tax basis of roughly sort of high-teens and that\u2019s now into the mid-20s with the factors that I just mentioned. We are very pleased with the performance that unit has generated and is poised to generate going forward.","Philip Johnson","Julie, next caller please.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll go to Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Christopher Schott \u2013 JPMorgan Chase & Co.","","Great. Thanks very much. Just had two questions, first was on diabetes, I know it\u2019s early. But in this scenario where you have a basal insulin but it\u2019s just biosimilar glargine, how meaningful opportunity is that for Lilly and is that a more instinct product in the emerging markets or the dealt markets.","And the second question was has the failure of Merck\u2019s productive changed, how you\u2019re thinking of CTP in your program there? Thank you.","Derica W. Rice","Okay, great. I think I\u2019ll go ahead Chris, and take your question on diabetes and then maybe have Jan comment on the cardiovascular space. In a scenario where we would just have the biosimiliar if you will, insulin glargine product. We do view that as an opportunity not just for emerging markets but also for developed markets. We do think we\u2019re probably one of the very small number of the companies that\u2019s well positioned to compete effectively in this space, given the current insulin manufacturing infrastructure that we have. The commercial infrastructure that we\u2019ll continue to have, as well as the device presence as well. It\u2019s hard to predict going forward but in large numbers we said that we could certainly see significant continued views of the glargine molecule through this decade, roughly maybe a third of it still being branded Lantus and another third roughly being the other forms or other companies insulin glargine products that which we know were as far long as anyone if not the furthest along in that development path.","So there still would be I think a very substantial market opportunity in both developed as well as developing markets for this kind of a product. Jan?","Jan M. Lundberg","See the key mechanism is very different compared to the recently reported Merck data and with our CETP inhibitor, we can really maximize the elevation of HDL more than 100% and in addition we have a LDL lowering. And genetic data also support that if you have certain mutations of the CETP, you can actually have a protection of cardiovascular risk.","","Philip Johnson","Okay. Thank you Jan. Thanks Chris. Julie, next caller.","Operator","Thank you. David Risinger with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Mr. Risinger?","David Risinger \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Yeah, thanks very much. I have two questions, first with respect to your CETP inhibitor; I was just hoping that you could explain the trial rationale. So Lilly's outcomes trial is 11,000 patients and is shorter in duration than Merck\u2019s, and Merck\u2019s is 30,000 patients. So, just trying to understand the rationale for a much smaller and shorter trial than Merck\u2019s. And then second with respect to the sola publication timing, could you just give us an update on that when that data will be published? Thank you.","Philip Johnson","Okay, thanks Dave for the questions. We\u2019ll have Ilissa comments. Jan, feel free to join if you like. Ilissa?","Ilissa Rassner","Thanks David. For the CETP inhibitor, we believe we've designed an appropriately powered study to test the study hypostasis. One thing you'll notice if you look in ct.gov you'll see that the populations of the two trials are different as are the primary endpoints. And we\u2019re currently in the process of evaluating on the possibility of publishing a paper to talk more about the specifics of the trial.","In regards to solanezumab and the publication strategy, actually it\u2019s the ADCS that will be publishing, so it's really up to their timeline. I think it's possible that you could potentially see something later this year and again it's in their hands and we'll have to see what they come up with.","Philip Johnson","Great. Thanks Dave. Thanks Ilissa. Julie, next caller.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll go Marc Goodman with UBS. Please go ahead.","Marc Goodman \u2013 UBS Investment Bank","Yes, Sue, maybe you can talk about the many oncology drugs in Phase II. can you pick a couple of them and can you talk about what you\u2019re most excited about and why? And then second question, just on the insulin franchise, can you give us a sense of any major changes going on and just trends and things like that, just both in the U.S. and overseas, any managed care contracts and changes that we should be aware of for 2013 in the U.S.? Thanks.","Derica W. Rice","Great, thanks Marc. Sue, and then I\u2019ll take the question on the insulin.","Sue Mahony","Yeah. We have a number of products staying in Phase II into the oncology and patent. If we look across our pipeline, we\u2019ve got a pretty robust and diverse pipeline of those small and large molecules. And I never like to pick some of the babies or preferred in any of these discussions, but as we indicate, what we\u2019ve already mentioned and this is one that we intend to be pretty aggressive going forward on as a company and as a business unit. And we\u2019re also excited by our JAK2 inhibitor and continue to progress that molecule.","c-Met antibody is another one that you should be hearing more about as it\u2019s tedious data. So, there are a large number of them. I\u2019d mention a few back, we should be seeing more data on in the coming months and years and that we continue to look at to aggressively develop those molecules.","Derica W. Rice","Great. Thanks, Sue. So Marc, in terms of trends that are happening in the insulin market, that\u2019s going to start with the U.S. For 2013, we don\u2019t expect significant changes in the payer environment, nothing to the extent that we would have seen these in our favor, as we went into 2011 or in the favor for novel in 2012. You have seen stabilization in terms of share market within the mealtime insulin segment, on the NRx basis, where we basically had the trough in sort of the June-July period of last year, have been creeping backup slightly since then, and on TRx basis, we have pretty much leveled out around that 39.5% from the last three or four months. So I think relatively stable picture in terms of share market, which should mean that in a growing market, we could return to have some volume growth here in the U.S.","Pricing will continue, I think to be pressured from some of the payor actions that we\u2019re taking in 2012. I think you will continue to see that as we head through, in particular the first half of 2013, until that begins to annualize and then with some of the adjustments that were made in some of our accruals, for rebates and discounts, the detriment of our result in Q4 of 2012 actually by the time get to Q4 of 2013, you will have a pretty favorable comparing you could see a much different dynamic on the year-on-year changes.","Only U.S. we have seen pretty stable to slightly increasing market shares. We have continued to be talked about in the past to gain share in China, for example. So I think we are very pleased with the performance in holding our own to slightly increasing share overall outside the U.S.","Julie, next caller please?","Operator","Thank you. Next is Mark Schoenebaum with ISI Group. Please go ahead.","Mark J. Schoenebaum \u2013 ISI Group Inc.","Hey guys, thanks a lot for taking my question. I apologize if I repeat a question, my line dropped few times, if I do just don\u2019t answer it, but maybe apologies for that. But maybe I can ask some oncology stuff. For Ramucirumab in breast cancer, if you are unable to show an overall survival benefit in breast cancer, I think most people understand, you could still file on that, but I think the question becomes, what do you think of the clinically significant improvement in PFS, if no OS benefit is shown. I thin when we look at the vast and experience, we are all trying to figure out, what the FDA might consider to be a clinically significant PFS change without an OS benefit?","And then can you just quickly on necitumumab, without a new disclosure that Bristol, you\u2019re no longer working with Bristol on that program, and if so, are you able to provide any color. Thank you.","Philip Johnson","","Great, thanks Mark. Sue, you want to take the two questions.","Sue Mahony","With regard to the breast cancer study, we should get data on the breast cancer study later this year. And we\u2019re anticipating that we will see both progression free survival and hopefully a trend overall survival as well, we\u2019ll be looking at both of those. We will make a decision to submit based on the overall data. I don\u2019t think there is one point either on PFS or OS or, has the ratio that we will be looking for. We will be looking at the total efficacy and safety of this molecule to make a decision with regard to submission in the likelihood of approval. And we\u2019re no more in that later this year.","With regard to necitumumab, yes this is a new disclosure, BMS have exercised there right to terminate the agreement on the necitumumab. It\u2019s a strategic decision that they\u2019ve made. We remain very committed to necitumumab, in fact we see necitumumab as a key part of our lung cancer strategy with Alimta being those standard of care, and first line nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer with necitumumab being studied in squamous non-small cell lung cancer and ramucirumab being studied in second line lung cancer. So we see this as an important asset for strategically.","Mark J. Schoenebaum \u2013 ISI Group Inc.","Great, thanks.","Philip Johnson","Thanks Mark. Julie, next caller please.","Operator","Thank you. We will go to Michael Tong with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.","Michael K. Tong \u2013 Wells Fargo Advisors LLC","Thanks. Just a follow-up on the CETP outcome study. Do you have any color as to what the base line HDL of the patient that you\u2019ve been bold or are in the ranges of less than 30 or in the mid-40s. And then secondly, Derica, I noticed in Europe pricing has improved a little bit in the fourth quarter. Is that something of a trend that you can call out, or was there something special in that quarter?","Philip Johnson","Thank you, Michael. this is Phil, so on the CETP, I need to follow-up since in the room here we don\u2019t have the specific answer to your question, and then Derica and or Travis you want to comment on the European price that would be great.","Derica W. Rice","Sure, Michael in terms of the EU, you did see that we had showed a 1% price increase in the fourth quarter of 2012 that is not the typical pricing pattern that we would see. We did have some adjustments made through prior accruals in the fourth quarter, if you were to exclude those you would see the usual 1% to 2% price decline, which is more typical what we would see in Europe.","Philip Johnson","","Thanks Derica. Julie, next caller please.","Operator","Thank you. Damien Conover with Morningstar. Please go ahead.","Damien Conover \u2013 Morningstar Research","Great. Good morning thanks for taking the questions. Just two questions, one on Boehringer Ingelheim\u2019s decision to move away from the novel insulin, just want to see if we should look at any sort of red flags being raised with that sort of strategic decision, and kind of your enthusiasm still behind that product. And then secondly, I know it\u2019s still several quarters away, but as we look to the exchange is being set up for 2014 in the U.S. I was wondering, if you could talk about your pricing power for those particular markets. Thanks.","Philip Johnson","All right thanks Damien. With regard to the BI decision to no longer participate in the novel basal insulin analog, this I don\u2019t think you should read any particular red flag, so particularly from a clinical perspective on, we are in the process of running the Phase III trial, and those produced data beginning later this year, we continue to be as we outline the ADA meeting, we had our investor events there, last year in 2012, very interested in this molecule. I think that particular set of data that was discussed ADA, gave people a better feeling for why it is that we were talking about the potential to show not just differences and rates of hyperglycaemia, but also to see a potential different weight profile compared to the current alternative as well as potential tighter control of HbA1c.","I\u2019d also remind you that we saw a pretty significant reduction as well in the utilization of mealtime insulin as well, that could be another benefit from both the patient as well the payor perspective for this molecule. So we remain very excited about this opportunity and look forward to the data that will come from the Phase III trial starting later this year. Derica?","Derica W. Rice","In regards to the U.S. exchange is that, just given that at early stages of development, it\u2019s very difficult to speculate at this time, what the pricing environment will be as a result of those. I think once if and when they come online, and we get more insights, will be more than willing to share that. But at this stage, we\u2019re really not in a position to speculate.","Philip Johnson","Okay. Thanks, Derica. Thanks, Damian. Julie, next caller please.","Operator","Thank you, and we have one final question, a follow-up from Seamus Fernandez with Leerink Swann. Please go ahead.","Seamus Fernandez \u2013 Leerink Swann LLC","Thanks for the follow-up question. Just have a very quick question, maybe this is more for Derica. We\u2019re actually hearing from physicians here and there, some concerns about I would say it\u2019s a follow-up to Damian\u2019s question on exchanges more than anything. but can you just give us your general thoughts on the impact of accountable care organizations, as it relates to potential prescribing going forward, particularly of new molecules that would be priced at a premium? Thanks.","Derica W. Rice","Again, many of those organizations are still under development. If you were to talk to our managed care group in our U.S. business, what they would tell you that one of the changes we are seeing is that innovation has become more important than ever. And your ability or our ability to clinically differentiate our molecules is going to be the biggest determinant of us achieving both formulary access as well as pricing flexibility especially if you\u2019re pursuing or speaking anything similar, to what we\u2019ve experienced previously. In the absence of that, then you\u2019re more likely to experience more commodity like behavior and we\u2019ve seen a little bit of that on the insulin side here recently.","so, when we look at our portfolio of late stage product, those 13 assets that we have in Phase III development, we feel very good about the clinical differentiation that we\u2019ve seen in that data that we\u2019ve shared externally, and what we\u2019ve seen internally, and that\u2019s\u2019 why when we talked about ram here today. The fact that there is no agent currently approved in the U.S. or the EU, no single-agent approved for second-line gastric. So if we\u2019re able to, with that data like that, we feel very good about not only getting through the regulatory hurdle, but also achieving formulary access and refill pricing environment.","Philip Johnson","Julie, has there anyone else joined the queue?","Operator","We do have one more in queue, Greg Gilbert with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Gregory B. Gilbert \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","One last quick one, Derica, what was that change in Europe that led to the revenue tweak in the fourth quarter? I just want to make sure it\u2019s not, something with important read through going forward in Europe? Thanks.","Derica W. Rice","There was nothing in particular other than just of looking at prior period accruals, and having to adjust those along the way based upon new information.","Gregory B. Gilbert \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Thanks.","Philip Johnson","Greg, if you want little more detail on that.

Welcome to the Eli Lilly Q3 2019 Earnings Call. At this time all participant lines are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to the Vice President of Investor Relations. Kevin Hern. Please go ahead.","Kevin Hern","Thank you. Good morning, thanks for joining us for Eli Lilly and Company's Q3 2019 Earnings Call. I'm Kevin Hern, Vice President of Investor Relations. Joining me on today's call are Dave Ricks, Lilly's Chairman and CEO; Josh Smiley, our Chief Financial Officer; Dr.Dan Skovronsky, President of Lilly Research Laboratories; Anne White, President of Lilly Oncology; and Enrique Conterno, President of Lilly Diabetes and Lilly U.S.A; Patrik Jonsson, President of Lilly Bio Medicines; and Mike Mason, incoming President of Lilly Diabetes.","We're also joined by Kim Macko and Mike Czapar of the Investor Relations team. During this conference call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors, including those listed on slide 3, and those outlined in our latest forms 10-K, 10-Q and any 8-K's, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","The information we provide about our products in pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It is not intended to be promotional and is not sufficient for prescribing decisions. As we transition to our prepared remarks, a reminder that our commentary will focus on non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude the financial contribution from Elanco during 2018 and 2019 and present earnings per share as though the full disposition via the exchange offer was complete on January 1, 2018.","Now I'll turn the call over to Dave for a summary of our Q3 results.","Dave Ricks","Thanks, Kevin, Q3 was another strong quarter for Lilly as we continue to deliver robust results and execute on our strategy, which is launching new medicines, advancing our pipeline and driving productivity. Revenue grew 3% this quarter or 4% in constant currency, driven entirely by robust volume growth from our new products and international operations.","Volume contributed 8%, -- 8 percentage points of growth despite sizable headwinds from the loss of exclusivity for Cialis in the U.S. and the withdrawal of Lartruvo. Excluding Cialis and Lartruvo volume growth was an impressive 16%. Our newest medicines continue to be the engine of revenue growth and account for 44% of revenue this quarter.","We made good progress in productivity in Q3 as our non-GAAP operating margin was 28.6%, keeping us on track to meet our 2019 and 2020 operating margin goals; compared to last year's quarter, operating margin was essentially flat, reflecting lower gross margin offset by prudent management of our operating expenses. We achieved milestones on several pipeline assets since our last earnings call, including the FDA approval of [indiscernible] for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults. The European Commission approval to expand Trulicity's label to include results from the rewind cardiovascular outcome study. The presentation of registration Phase 2 data for selpercatinib in non-small cell lung cancer and thyroid cancers and the presentation of overall survival data of Verzenio in metastatic breast cancer -- also made impressive progress with its development program this quarter with the FDA approval of radiographic axial spondyloarthritis or AxSpA along with its submission in Europe.","Submission of our non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis in the U.S. and Europe, which represents our first-in-class opportunity in this indication and positive results from a head-to-head study in psoriasis versus guselkumab in IL-23 antibody. We remain focused on creating long-term value for shareholders as we allocate capital seeking external innovation that will enhance future growth prospects while at the same time we returned nearly $1.2 billion to shareholders this quarter via share repurchase and the dividend.","Moving on to slide 5, you'll see more detail on key events since our last earnings call in July. I would like to highlight today's announcements regarding leadership changes and I want to congratulate and thank my long-time colleague Enrique Conterno for significant contributions to Lilly. Enrique has done an outstanding job leading Lilly Diabetes over the past decade really re-establishing our company as a leader in diabetes care with the broadest and fastest growing portfolio of medicines in the industry. Enrique, Lilly will not be in the strong position it is today without your leadership, your energy, optimism and thirst for excellence will be missed. I would also like to welcome Mike Mason as he assumes leadership for our diabetes business unit. Mike is a 30-year veteran with deep expertise and significant experience in our diabetes business. Mike is a patient focus leader with a track record of delivering results for Lilly and for patients in the U.S. and Canada. Under Mike's leadership, Lilly successfully launched both Jardiance and Trulicity in the U.S., becoming the diabetes market volume leader during his tenure. Since July 2018, Mike has led our Connected Care and insulin commercial and development organizations working to leverage technology to enhance insulin delivery and improve the user experience.","Importantly, he has also led Lilly's efforts in building the most comprehensive suite of insulin affordability solutions in the U.S., including the Lilly Diabetes Solution Center to support people in need of less expensive alternatives for their medicine. Mike, it's great to have you join our senior leadership team.","And now I'll turn the call over to Josh to review our Q3 results and provide an update on financial guidance for 2019.","Josh Smiley","Thanks, Dave and good morning everyone. Slide 6 summarizes our presentation of GAAP results and non-GAAP measures, and slide 7 provides a summary of our GAAP results. Looking at the non-GAAP measures on slide 8, you'll see revenue increased 3% or 4% in constant currency. Gross margin as a percent of revenue declined 60 basis points to 79.6%; excluding the impact of FX on international inventory sold gross margin as a percent of revenue was 78.9%. On this same basis, our gross margin percent declined approximately 140 basis points compared to Q3, 2018 driven by the unfavorable impact of product mix due to Cialis, and the negative impact of price on revenue, partially offset by manufacturing efficiencies. Total operating expense grew 2% this quarter. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses declined 3% as our ongoing cost containment measures and lower litigation charges versus last year were partially offset by increased investment behind recent launches, consistent with our long-term strategy.","R&D expense increased 8% reflecting higher development expenses for late-stage assets including double selpercatinib and tirzepatide. Total operating income increased 3% compared to Q3 2018, our sales growth outpaced expense growth, driving operating income as a percent of revenue to 28.6% for the quarter. As our recent launches continue to drive revenue growth and headwinds from Cialis and Lartruvo both sunset in 2020, we expect additional operating margin expansion and bottom line growth.","We are on track and committed to achieving our full year operating margin guidance of approximately 28% as well as our 2020 target of 31%. Other income and expense was expense of $25 million this quarter compared to expense of $2 million in Q3, 2018 driven by higher expense primarily due to the Loxo acquisition partially offset by investment gains. Our tax rate for the quarter was 11.7%, which is a decrease of 320 basis points compared with the same quarter last year driven primarily by a net discrete tax benefit related to the settlement of certain tax matters. At the bottom line, net income increased 5%, while earnings per share increased 10% due to reduction in shares outstanding from share repurchases.","In summary, in Q3 we again drove volume based revenue growth and made progress on our productivity goals. In addition to continued solid execution third quarter also featured impressive performance outside the U.S. as revenue grew 10% in constant currency driven by 12% volume growth. Examples of our ability to launch with excellence as Emgality and Baqsimi are off to strong starts. The approval of the first medicine in a new class to treat acute migraine, submissions of new indications for our key growth brand in multiple geographies and important clinical data at major medical meetings from our portfolio.","Moving to Slide 9, it outlines these non-GAAP measures for September year-to-date, while slide 10 provides a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS. You will find additional details on these adjustments on slides 24 and 25. Moving to slide 11, let's review the effect of price rate and volume on revenue growth. As mentioned earlier, worldwide revenue grew 4% in constant currency driven by volume growth of 8%, partially offset by price, foreign exchange reduced revenue growth by 1 percentage point this quarter. For the 16th straight quarter we delivered worldwide revenue growth despite major headwinds from patent expirations.","U.S. revenue was flat compared to the third quarter of 2018, volume growth of 5% was led by our newer products Trulicity, Taltz, Emgality, Jardiance, Verzenio, and Basaglar. Excluding Cialis and Lartruvo, volume grew nearly 17%; consistent with our 2019 financial guidance and in line with Q1 and Q2 results, U.S. price declined 5%. This quarter's decline was impacted by approximately 3 percentage points, driven by the net of higher rebates across segments, offset by modest listed price increases and over 2 percentage points from increased funding obligations during the donut hole phase of Medicare plans. We anticipated approximately $200 million of impact for the year and our actual results are consistent with this projection. However, we are seeing the donut hole impact more concentrated in Q2 and Q3 than prior years and expect a smaller impact in Q4.","As our largest product, Trulicity of course had a significant impact on the U.S. portfolios price decline; Trulicity's robust U.S. volume growth of 42% was consistent with first half trend and was partially offset by unfavorable pricing dynamics in the quarter, including disproportionate growth in lower net price segments driven by the access wins we had in 2018 and the increased volume associated with these wins throughout this year, increased funding obligations during the coverage gap in Medicare due to payer consolidation and adjustments to our overall estimates for rebates and discount liabilities across various segments. Combined, these factors had a negative impact on price in the quarter of approximately 20 percentage points. If we exclude these items, Trulicity price declined roughly 5% versus Q3 2018. Well, we don't typically give forward-looking product level guidance and don't intend to change that practice, I do want to provide some perspective on Trulicity over the coming quarters. We expect the Q3 negative factors to moderate substantially going forward as impacts from the donut hole diminished in Q4 and then will be in the base for next year's comparison.","Similarly, as we have driven rapid volume growth in government segments, including the VA and DoD between Q4 of last year and this quarter, we expect these segments going forward grow more in line with overall sales. Finally due to payer consolidation is now fully reflected in the base going forward. Given the absolute size of the Trulicity rebate and discount liability, we will continue to see quarterly adjustments to that liability. But as we have seen historically these are difficult to predict, it can be both positive and negative. So taking these factors into account, we think Trulicity's underlying U.S. net price decline of roughly 5% in Q3 is more representative of what we expect to see in subsequent quarters. We have excellent access for Trulicity across all payer segments and anticipate that continuing in 2021.","Moving to Europe, revenue grew 8% excluding FX driven by 9% volume growth, partially offset by the negative effect of price; volume growth was led by Trulicity, Olumiant, and Taltz. In Japan, revenue growth of 6% excluding FX was driven by volume with Verzenio, Cyramza, Trulicity, Alimta, and Olumiant as key contributors to the growth. We were negatively impacted by purchasing patterns in Q3 in Japan by approximately 4 percentage points, which we expect to largely recover in Q4. Revenue in the rest of the world increased 15% excluding FX, led by 33% growth in China. The same information for our September year-to-date results at the bottom of the slide; as shown on Slide 12, our key growth products were once again the engine of our worldwide volume growth.","These products drove 15.4 percentage points of volume growth this quarter, reinforcing our confidence in achieving our 2020 revenue goals. [Indiscernible] have experienced loss of exclusivity provided a drag of 700 basis points driven primarily by Cialis, as expected, we have seen a rapid erosion of Cialis sales following the entry of generics in the U.S. market at the end of September last year. So we expect that impact to begin to normalize in Q4 of this year.","Slide 13 highlights the contributions of our key growth products. In total, these brands generated over $2.4 billion in revenue this quarter, making up 44% of total revenue, Q3 sales of growth products were impacted by inventory burn in the quarter of approximately -- $70 million with U.S. Trulicity comprising approximately $40 million of that total.","Our diverse commercial portfolio of new medicines continue to drive growth that is well positioned in large and growing therapeutic areas. Within diabetes, Trulicity and Jardiance continue market leadership in the GLP-1 and SGLT2 classes respectively. In immunology, Taltz continues to perform well in psoriasis and new indications in rheumatology present opportunities for additional growth. In pain, Emgality continues its impressive uptake exiting Q3 with a market-leading 46% share of market from new to brand prescriptions in the U.S.","Within oncology, Cyramza growth has accelerated over the past year and we are excited for the newly released overall survival data to drive additional use of Verzenio. Finally, I would like to highlight our newest launch product nasally administered glucagon, which is sold under the trade name Baqsimi. Baqsimi is an important new option for the treatment of severe hypoglycemia and unlike existing rescue therapies does not require reconstitution to administer. This is a significant improvement in user experience and exemplifies the type of innovation we strive to deliver to patients. The commercial uptake in the U.S. has been strong as Baqsimi already has 33% of new to brand prescriptions. We believe this product has the potential to grow the overall glucagon market. Slide 14 shows the year-over-year change in select lines of our income statement; focusing on our non-GAAP results, foreign exchange rates had a net modest negative impact on revenue and a modest positive impact on gross margin, operating expenses, operating income and EPS.","On Slide 15, we provide an update on capital allocation aligned with our strategic priorities, between our business development activities, capital expenditures and internal investment in R&D, we invested over $11 billion in the first 9 months of the year to drive our future growth. Additionally, we have returned nearly $6 billion to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. We continue to prioritize investment in the pipeline through both internal and external sources. Turning to our 2019 financial guidance on slide 16, you will see that we've updated our non-GAAP guidance to reflect an increase in our bottom line results for the year. Specifically, we are updating the range for other income and deductions to $50 million of income to an expense of $100 million reflecting year-to-date gains in our equity portfolio, we are decreasing our tax rate from a range of 13% to 14% to 12% to 13% to reflect the net discrete tax benefit in the third quarter and we are raising our non-GAAP earnings per share range to $5.75 per share to $5.85 per share reflecting those two items as our operating performance expectations remain on track with our prior full-year guidance.","On a reported basis, the tax rate is expected to be in the range of 13% to 14% and earnings per share for 2019 is now expected to be in the range of $8.59 to $8.69 per share. We continue to progress towards our 2019 guidance and remain committed to delivering on our 2020 goals. Now I'll turn the call over to Dan to highlight our progress on R&D.","Dan Skovronsky","Thanks, Josh. Slide 17 shows select pipeline opportunities as of October 22nd, positive movement since our last earnings call includes the previously mentioned FDA approvals for [indiscernible] and FDA approval for new indication for Taltz, the European Commission approval for Trulicity rewind and the submission of Taltz for non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis. The U.S. submission of ultra-rapid Lispro, for type 1 and type 2 diabetes. The U.S. submission of Flortaucipir for imaging agent in Alzheimer's, initiation of Phase III testing for mirikizumab in Crohn's disease, and the initiation of Phase 1 for 2 assets. In addition to the positive milestones, we delivered this quarter, we also announced disappointing results from the Phase III Sequoia trial, pegilodecakin in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. Pegilodecakin plus FOLFOX failed to show benefit in overall survival compared to FOLFOX alone and is difficult to treat a deadly cancer. While this is a disappointing outcome for patients, we continue to move forward with pegilodecakin in lung and renal cancer, which we've always viewed as the key indications.","Moving to Slide 18, since the last earnings call, we made progress on the number of key events; in addition to the previously highlighted approvals and submissions, Cyramza has been submitted for first-line EGFR positive non-small cell lung cancer in the U.S. As Dave mentioned in his opening remarks, the third quarter was an exciting one for our oncology portfolio as we shared promising registrational data for selpercatinib [ph] which showed impressive objective response rates and durability of response data along with low treatment related discontinuation rates across RET fusion positive non-small cell lung cancer, RET-mutant medullary thyroid cancer, and RET fusion positive thyroid cancer.","We're excited about the opportunity for this first-in-class and potentially best in class RET inhibitor to help patients with cancer. These are the kind of results, we were hoping for when we planned the Loxo acquisition and we are extremely pleased with the progress of Loxo since then. We were also pleased to share the results of the Monarch 2 study at ESMO showing [indiscernible] delivered the largest median survival benefit to date in this setting, extending survival by 9.4 months. We also announced that Taltz demonstrated superiority versus in total skin clearance at 12 weeks for people living with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis and met all major secondary endpoints and Olumiant had a positive readout in atopic dermatitis in the third of five studies, which will support its global submissions; it continues to be a busy and productive year for our pipeline.","Moving to Slide 19; last quarter we highlighted select Phase 2 opportunities, this quarter we'd like to highlight select Phase 1 molecules from our portfolio. As we continue to accelerate our internal discovery and development engine, by year-end we expected to have delivered more Phase 1 initiations in a single year than we have in any other year this decade. Importantly, these new Phase 1 entries represent a mix of internal discoveries from our own labs as well as external innovation that we have brought in through business development. We selected several Phase 1 molecule to highlight today.","Let me start with another molecule from the Loxo Oncology acquisition the BTK inhibitor LOXO-305, which is a next-generation non-covalent reversible BTK inhibitor that does not depend on interacting with the cysteine-481 residue. We started dosing patients in a Phase 1 -- 2 study earlier this year in patients with previously treated chronic lymphocytic leukemia, small lymphocytic lymphoma or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The unmet need in this space continues to grow. Since more patients are treated with chronic recurrent BTK inhibitors, more and more patients become resistant or intolerant to therapy; LOXO-305 was built to be potent selective and have well behaved human pharmacology; should these attributes present in the clinic as we hope, LOXO-305 could be an important new therapy for these patients.","As we announced in September. We plan to present data from the trial later this year. It will be a typical early clinical presentation from a dose escalation trial, including safety PK and any efficacy assessments that have been conducted. In neurodegeneration, last quarter we initiated with our collaborator AC Immune a Phase 1 study in healthy volunteers for small molecule tau aggregation inhibitor. While still early in development, we're excited about this program and also about the target aggregated tau, of course aggregated tau along with amyloid plaque comprise the two pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease.","Accordingly, we remain excited about our 2 Phase II programs aimed at disease modification in Alzheimer's disease which is our anti-aggregated tau antibody and now especially tanezumab our entry PG antibody which is also in a Phase II trial designed to test efficacy in a carefully selected population. Both of these programs are now fully enrolled with tanezumab clearing an important interim futility analysis and we look forward to the final readouts for these trials in 2021.","Moving to pain, earlier this year we acquired the rights to a novel small molecule somatostatin receptor type 4 agonist that's currently in Phase 1 as a potential non-opioid treatment for chronic pain. The clinical hypothesis here is that the known analgesic effects of somatostatin are mostly mediated by SSTR4, which is found in the dorsal root ganglia, a selective agonist for SSTR4 could therefore have an analgesic effect without peripheral somatostatin adverse effects. We look forward to the internal readout next year to inform the potential progression of Phase II. Pain is the number one reason people go to physicians and if you look at the opioid crisis, there is still significant unmet medical need. There is more work to do here, and I'm excited we're a leader in this space with a number of interesting mechanisms now being tested in patients by Lilly.","Turning now to immunology; with 3 novel checkpoint agonists in Phase 1 with first-in-class potential BTLA agonist antibody CD200R agonist antibody and our PD-1 agonist antibody. These are all Immune resolution agents; when dampening down immune system with chronic immunosuppression, we're trying to potentially reset the immune system. These checkpoints exploit insights from immuno-oncology, but they work in a different direction as a checkpoint agonist, but the brake is on the immune system. BTLA is a novel checkpoint receptor that negatively regulates activation of BPDC and T cells; [indiscernible] at this pathway has the potential to provide a first-in-class treatment and our BTLA agonist antibody is currently being studied in Phase 1 b and lupus. CD200 is a key immune checkpoint that functions on both innate and adaptive immune system on many cell types involved in autoimmune skin disorders. Our CD200R agonist antibody is in a Phase 1 trial in both healthy volunteers as well as in atopic dermatitis patients.","Finally, we know that treatment of cancers with PD-1 inhibitors leads to a variety of autoimmune conditions; it's hypothesized that a PD-1 agonist with suppress activation expansion of lymphocytes leading to treatment of autoimmune diseases. Our PD-1 agonist antibody is currently in Phase 1. Each of these 3 opportunities represents novel biology, which we are among the first to explore with the potential for each to move into Phase II next year.","We also have an IL-2 conjugate license from Nektar Therapeutics which preferentially stimulates expansion of regulatory T-cells; this potentially first-in-class opportunity is currently being studied in Phase 1b in lupus patients with Phase 1 data in healthy volunteers presented at EULAR earlier this year, we show the IL2 conjugate could achieve robust expansion of additional Phase 1 studies in psoriasis and atopic dermatitis have been posted to ClinicalTrials.gov and are expected to start up before the end of the year. We expect to move to Phase II with this molecule in 2020.","Finally, I'd like to highlight two exciting diabetes programs. With our next generation injectable incretin GIP, GLP, glucagon, tri- agonist or GGG we're testing the hypothesis that adding glucagon to GIP\/GLP will have more metabolic activity and stimulate additional weight loss.","The initial Phase 1 study, to study the safety of a single injection in healthy participants and we're now studying multiple doses including dose titration. We expect this program to enter Phase II by late 2020 or early 2021; just like the hurdle for tirzepatide to enter Phase III was a meaningful improvement over Trulicity, the bar here will be a step change over tirzepatide itself. Additionally, our commitment to oral incretins has continued to increase as we advanced programs through development we seek to improve upon administration or efficacy. Our first oral incretin program which we licensed from Chugai last year is a small molecule non-peptide agonist of GLP-1 that entered Phase 1 earlier this year.","Our initial focus will be on PK with the expectation that it should be meaningfully better than a peptide as well as the PD response, which we should see even in Phase 1, this molecule could enter Phase 2 in early 2021; in addition to this approach, we're also pursuing dual GIP and GLP-1 receptor agonist peptides for oral delivery. These programs, which are designed to give tirzepatide like efficacy with a once-a-day oral peptide administration are also progressing preclinically and should enter Phase 1 next year. We look forward to tracking the progress of these assets over the coming years and we'll share additional pipeline updates on our next earnings call.","Now I'll turn the call back over to Dave for some closing remarks.","Dave Ricks","Thanks, Dan. Before we go to Q&A. Let me briefly sum up the progress we've made in the third quarter. We delivered robust volume growth of 8% driven by our key growth products and an impressive performance outside the U.S. We continue to demonstrate our launch capabilities and have a diverse portfolio of commercial products to drive future growth.","We advanced our productivity agenda controlling operating expenses while investing behind key commercial growth drivers and our late-stage pipeline. In addition, we made important progress toward our margin goals as the operating margin improved 60 basis points versus Q2, 2019 to 28.6%. We made important pipeline progress including the initiation of a new Phase 3 program with mirikizumab in Crohn's disease sharing new registrational data for Olumiant, Taltz, Verzenio, and selpercatinib submitting new indications for Taltz and Cyramza and receiving positive regulatory actions for Trulicity. Finally, we returned nearly $600 million to shareholders via the dividend and completed $600 million of share repurchase as well.","We are proud of our strong business performance and excited about the opportunities ahead for the company. There has never been a more inspiring time to be working on discovering new medicines and patients and healthcare providers are waiting the next wave of innovation. We have grown through the headwinds of Cialis and Lartruvo and we expect our strong business performance to continue driven by our newest products and a relative lack of patent exposure ahead and of course by the work of our scientists who continue to redefine with as possible for patients suffering from serious diseases.","Looking ahead we are focused on a strong finish to 2019 as we prepare for next year. This concludes our prepared remarks and now I'll turn the call over to Kevin to moderate the Q&A session.","Kevin Hern","Thanks, Dave. We'd like to take questions from as many callers as possible, so we ask that you limit your questions to two or to a single question with 2 parts; please provide the instructions for the Q&A session and then we're ready for the first caller.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Chris Schott with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.","Chris Schott","Great, thanks very much for the questions, just -- I guess first broader 2020 pricing questions, you're seeing price erosion with the U.S. portfolio this year; is that a reasonable dynamic to expect in 2020 or we'll see some of these pressures start to ease as we get past the donut hole fill and some of these kind of one-time items with Trulicity that you mentioned. And my second question was just elaborating a little bit more on Trulicity in terms of access and price dynamics in 2020, the pricing commentary in the prepared remarks is very helpful. I guess with the approval though of oral sema, are you seeing a more difficult payer environment here than in the past or any signs that payers are more aggressively managing the GLP-1 category. Thanks very much.","Dave Ricks","Thanks, Chris. We'll go to Josh for the overall 2020 pricing and then to Enrique for your second question more specifically on Trulicity.","Josh Smiley","Thanks, Chris. I think as we look into 2020, just going back to the guidance that we gave in December of last year. So we were planning for sort of low single digit net price erosion across the portfolio for the period of '19 and '20. I think that's what we see right now. We are going to see variability in the quarters as you mentioned, we've got donut hole and other things that are particularly I think acute in Q3 of this year, but I think the net as we look and project into 2020 I think sort of low single digit price decline is probably a fair place to be and that's very consistent with how we thought about 2020 goals and our productivity agenda and otherwise.","Dave Ricks","Thanks Josh, Enrique?","Enrique Conterno","So Chris when it comes to Trulicity coverage, we have unprecedented access. We are right now in the mid '90s from a coverage perspective, which is outstanding and we are projecting that into next year. It is too early for us to be able to say exactly how the discussions of oral sema are going with payers, of course, we'll learn more they basically get further into some of those discussions.","Kevin Hern","Thanks, Enrique and Chris thanks for the question. Next caller, please?","Operator","And the next caller is from Umer Raffat with Evercore. Please go ahead.","Umer Raffat","Hi, thanks so much for taking my question. I don't know how to ask my first one, but I'll ask anyways, given all the renewed interest. My question is on the A4 trial and I know you're using a super high dose of solanezumab tracked over 240 weeks. So my question is this, since this trial was fully enrolled about couple of years ago, what have we learned to date from any interim analysis that have been conducted and I ask because almost every patient in this trial has passed the week 76 follow-up. Thank you for any color on that.","And then secondly on glip and tirzepatide -- broadly. My question is what's the median duration on therapy real world on Trulicity currently and I ask about it relative to the 20-week titration being employed in Phase 3, and I'm also curious, is there any observations to date from blinded basis in the ongoing titration regimen. Thank you very much.","Dave Ricks","Thanks, Umer. We'll go to Dan for the solo question and then Enrique to talk about what we're seeing today with the duration for Trulicity.","Dan Skovronsky","Thanks Umer for your question on solanezumab and A4 trial, of course this is a trial of solanezumab as you pointed out for higher dose and it was tested in the original Phase 3 studies . But what's really interesting about this trial is that we're testing it in asymptomatic elderly individuals who don't have a diagnosis of Alzheimer's, but do have amyloid plaque in their brain. It's a 4-year treatment that's planned and so we will get data on this trial in mid-2022. So we just have to wait patiently for those results to see if silicon have efficacy in this very early population.","Dave Ricks","Thanks, Dan. Enrique?","Enrique Conterno","So, when we look at Trulicity adherence and I think we've said this before, we tend to see better adherence with Trulicity than with other product. One of the things that we measure is refill rates. So, we measure the second refill rate, the fourth refill rate, Trulicity tends to have better adherence than the GLP-1 class, tends to have better adherence than insulin, but also better adherence than orals, which is sometimes difficult to believe but the value proposition is that simplicity; it's is a complicated -- question. When we look at medium duration of therapy, because we do lose so many patients in the first fill and in the second fill across all of the diabetes therapy. Just to give you a sense by the fourth fill, Trulicity is basically in the '60s, what we basically see though is for patients that have stayed after the first year, we tend to lose about a third of those patients every year going forward after that. So that gives you certain sense of what is the adherence of Trulicity as you're thinking about modeling this.","Dave Ricks","Thanks, Enrique, and Umer, thanks for the questions. Next caller, please?","Operator","Next is the line of Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Terence Flynn","Hi, thanks for taking the questions. Maybe two for me. Just I'm wondering your latest thoughts on the ongoing policy discussions in DC [ph] potential outcomes in impact to your business. And then as we think about Emgality for 2020, I know you don't give product level guidance, but you've been focused on the second phase of growth year into the primary care market, any update on the progress there as well as the initial European launch. Thank you.","Kevin Hern","Thanks, Terence. We'll go to Dave for the policy question and then Patrik on Emgality in 2020.","Dave Ricks","Yes, I wish I could provide a clear answer on the probable outcome of the policy debate in Washington, I think it's really unclear other than we probably know that the House bill will probably pass the House completely on partisan lines and then we'll see from there. There are of course a number of initiatives in the various Senate committees that the industry is [indiscernible] and Lilly certainly -- if a version of those came together and passed both chambers; in general that would be I think a modest positive for us. We see important discussion that should happen providing out of pocket cap to seniors is important benefit and any changes that can possibly adapt the donut hole math and other pieces of the benefit, which we're talking about even on this call are helpful for products that are more commonly used for conditions like diabetes, so we track that closely. We're very engaged in this whole discussion, of course probably given the environment in Washington, the most probable thing is there isn't really legislation happening for some time, but -- point to note to investors, where we're promoting changes in particular the Part D benefit and affordability measures that can impact the pocket book at the pharmacy counter without throwing out the baby with the bathwater in wholesale change to the U.S. system, which obviously be hugely damaging to the business model.","Kevin Hern","Thanks, Dave. Patrik [ph]?","Patrik Jonsson","Well, thank you very much. We are very pleased with the overall performance of Emgality and we actually became the leader in NRx in Q3 and we have been that for more than 10 consecutive weeks right now and we are also closing the gap in terms of total Rx. When we look upon the access to Emgality, it is a best-in-class access with more of the 90% today in the U.S. and we are making steady progress in terms of the claims paid and we are today -- the claims being paid. And we are making steady progress in that regard as well. We still believe it's very early days for Emgality. We know that we have population in the U.S. of 6 million eligible for preventive treatment and all the 3 million of those are being treated today and year-to-date, we have approximately 100,000 patients treated with Emgality.","So we see a tremendous opportunity also moving forward, and also the prescriber base in U.S. is still limited, so only 15% of our customers are regularly prescribers of Emgality. So I think that signals very clearly the opportunity we foresee. We are also excited about the opportunity outside of U.S.; migraine is not a U.S. phenomenon. We had thought million patients suffering from migraine in EU and 9 million in Japan and only 2 million of those are treated in EU and 300,000 in Japan, it's still very early days and we have just received the regulatory approval from European Medical Agency and we are in pricing reimbursement discussion on accounted counter basis, but we believe that the opportunity for Emgality is big also outside of the U.S.","Kevin Hern","Thanks, Patrik and Terence thanks for your questions. Next caller, please.","Operator","Next is the line of Geoff Meacham [ph] with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","Good morning, thanks for the question. I just have a couple. Josh on the SG&A side, are there opportunities for more cost savings looking forward beyond what you guys have talked about post the Elanco. So I'm just trying to get a sense for where the 3Q trends can be extrapolated and then Patrik another one on the migraine side. So I know obviously early in the launch, but can you leverage the access you just mentioned with Emgality to help benefit. I'm just trying to get a sense for the commercial synergies looking to 2020 and with the CGRP space being a little bit more crowded, how has the pricing environment been so far. Thank you.","Kevin Hern","All right, thanks, Jeff. So, go to Josh for SG&A and then Patrik on the migraine.","Josh Smiley","Okay, thanks. Jeff, welcome back. On SG&A, yes, I think if you look at what we see in Q3 and what we've been talking about relative to our productivity goals for 2020. We're pretty comfortable with the absolute level of investment we have behind our new launches. If you look at the last few Baqsimi, which I mentioned on the prepared comments and for example, we're putting those into existing infrastructure and we'll get good leverage there. So we'll continue to invest behind our key launches. But I think the absolute level of SG&A with our ongoing productivity efforts to get more out of each of the promotional dollars we spend, we feel pretty comfortable with that, so you should expect modest to flat growth going forward on that line.","Kevin Hern","Thanks, Josh. Patrik?","Patrik Jonsson","Well, thank you very much. We are also very excited with the approval of [indiscernible] and we are waiting for the DA to give overall assessment by January of next year and launching very early in 2020. Overall, we believe there is a significant need also in the acute treatment of migraine. We know that currently 5 million of Americans are being treated for acute migraine, but 35% to 40% of those don't respond or can't tolerate the triptans and approximately 15% of those are contraindicated for triptans, so that's why we believe it's really a tremendous opportunity of the 2 decades to launch a new oral treatment for acute migraine. We see some significant synergies with Emgality both in terms of access and the overall infrastructure and particularly being able to capitalize on the learnings that we have had with the launch of Emgality since the beginning of 2018, where we have rapidly been able to take a leadership position, not just in terms of access, but also in terms of the NRx and closing the gap in TRx.","Kevin Hern","Thanks, Patrik. Jeff. Thanks for the questions. Next caller, please.","Operator","Is the line of Tim Anderson with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Tim Anderson","Thank you. I'd like to come back to 2020 and contracting and diabetes. I know you were asked this earlier, but you didn't give much of an answer, the stock down 5% today on a beat and raise. I think that reflects concerns about whether you can hit your operating margin guidance in 2020. The outlook for diabetes, so specifically on diabetes you're in this window of kind of having an idea of where your coverage is going to be for Trulicity and Jardiance in terms of net live gains or lost and what the price -- so, can you just hopefully give us a little more detail on how we should be thinking about Trulicity specifically and Jardiance as well going into 2020, because there have been changes in the competitive dynamics there.","Second question, just going back to Alzheimer's, it seemed like a couple of years ago, Lilly started to quietly pivot away from thinking that any monotherapy that's anti-amyloid would yield the benefit and you started to really go down this combination route, given what Biogen disclosed yesterday and your ongoing work in this area. Just how are you thinking about monotherapy in the anti-amyloid space and really anything you can offer, your impressions of the news yesterday would be helpful. Thank you.","Kevin Hern","Thanks, Tim. So we'll go to Josh for outlook for 2020 and then to Dan for the question on Alzheimer's.","Josh Smiley","Thanks, Tim. As we said in the opening, I think if you look at Trulicity and strip out the things that we see in Q3 that we say are concentrated in that quarter. We feel good as Enrique mentioned, feel very good about the access that we have now and the access we project into 2020 and as we said, you should think about Trulicity at a modest year-over-year price decline, which is really just a function of modest price increases and we like the price and the value that have in the U.S. today. So we'll do everything we can to preserve that and we feel confident as we head into 2020 that that's a very manageable dynamic.","Kevin Hern","Thanks Josh. Dan?","Dan Skovronsky","Yes. Thanks, Tim For the question. Of course, with respect to the amyloid hypothesis and the Biogen data. I think there was a lot of thinking about this when they announced their utility, that the main question was whether or not there was evidence that if you removed significant amount of -- brain. This could result in a slowing of cognitive decline, so everyone was sort of waiting to see with the very highest doses where there was high level of amyloid removal what would happen. So I think the data we saw yesterday, from that respect is an important indicator on the amyloid hypothesis. We've thought for some time that complete removal of amyloid from the brain could be the goal here, doing it in early in the right patients could be important and that underlined the design of our trial with -- which we said should be able to remove plaque more quickly and more deeply than anything else we've seen. So I think yesterday's news is reason to be a little more optimistic about that theory. And as I said before, we're excited to see the results of that Phase 2 trial; with respect to your question on combination therapy, indeed we do think that combination therapy is an important avenue in Alzheimer's disease. I think we're the first and probably the only company to have tried a combination of two disease modifying therapies, unfortunately we had to stop that, one of the therapies was a base inhibitor, which proven not to be a productive avenue of investigation. But given that we have both tau and amyloid approaches, I think combination in the future is a very rational approach for Alzheimer's.","Kevin Hern","Thanks, Dan. And thanks for your question. Next caller, please?","Operator","Next is Louise Chen with Cantor. Please go ahead.","Louise Chen","Hi, thanks for taking my questions. My first question here is when you first gave your 2020 revenue outlook or your long-term revenue guidance, what did you assume for Skyrizi an oral semaglutide and how have those launches proceeded relative to your expectations there. And then second question is, how do you think the data readouts from ESMO impact your thinking on the commercial opportunity for Verzenio, is there more growth left in the U.S. and how much can your share increase with this positive data. Thank you.","Kevin Hern","Thanks, Louise. We'll go to Dave for the 2020 revenue question and then Verzenio [ph].","Dave Ricks","Louise, thanks for the question. Of course, we set the 2020 guidance in the middle of 2016. So many of the products were facing competition from etcetera today were a twinkle in the eye of the inventors back then and including some of our own launches at that time. We set the guidance because we thought there was a distance between what the people who do your work and the company thought about the long-term prospects, not line by line, but looking at a portfolio of opportunities that existed in front of us, of course, our ability to predict any one competitive situation or product uptake for Lilly is not perfect, but at that time we did project that we would launch 10 medicines by the end of ' 19 in the first five years of that period and that because of the profound nature of those opportunities, we were confident we would find a way to grow the company; at that point, the pharma business 6%, Elanco a bit slower. We've actually raised that to 7% and I think we're closing in on achieving that goal despite the fact that probably how we predicted we get there is at the same way we have. But I think that was the nature of the exercise back then and I think we successfully closed the gap and understanding in terms of what the opportunity for the company to grow was during that time, so we're proud of that achievement. If we look at the competitive threats we face across our big products, of course that are there.","I would just point out as well though that Trulicity volume growth in the U.S. was over 40% in Q3. That's in the face of a year and a half of Ozempic and that Taltz volume growth was substantial as well in the face of the uptake and in both those cases, it's important to understand that there is far more growth opportunity left in the classes we're participating in than share erosion threat to our [indiscernible]. Final comment on all this because I know there's lot of interest in the Q3 pricing dynamics on Taltz and Trulicity most of those effects were determined early in 2018 and are now manifesting themselves in Q3 of '19 whether it'd be the donut hole law change, which affect both of them. The rates we contracted on in the commercial mergers that occurred in the payer space or the contracting in the case of Trulicity and what we knew were lower price segments, but a good volume and of course at the margin are highly productive for us to make sure patients in VA DoD, those segments can reach our products. So just to put a perspective on all that long-winded answer but thanks for the question and maybe we address.","Unidentified Company Representative","Yes, I would be very happy to. So, thanks Louise for the question and quarter-over-quarter Q3 U.S. sales were up 19% since Q2 and Q3 monthly sales look very strong as well. So we do believe that we are seeing growth from the outstanding survival results that we released and we do hope that we all see some growth for the CDK 4\/6 market, although it may be in the single-digit area; for us here at Lilly, this is a relaunch of Verzenio. So the top priority for our team is to ensure that doctors, particularly those in the U.S. are aware of these statistically significant OS data nearly 10 months of survival benefit and we'll work with them to share that benefit the patients can have from Verzenio.","And we do know that oncologists are data driven and we have extremely compelling data and a very strong commercial team that will ensure that we get the word out. So we do hope very much to increase our share of market, obviously not all of the competitors in this space have been able to demonstrate statistically significant results and so we'll make sure that that data is well communicated, particularly we're going to encourage physicians to identify patients that are likely to do worse. So, you probably saw that data that we released at ESMO on where the cancer recurred or when it recurred and those patients do particularly well on Verzenio with some very robust results. Again we see that as a differentiator as well from some of the competition.","And we do know that physicians and patients number one goal is survival and we've been able to deliver now, as I said nearly 10 months of a survival benefit, which is really remarkable in this setting. And I think really a bit of a game changer for this molecule. So we look forward to next year. And then just to comment a little bit outside the U.S. and additional good growth in the US, we're seeing a great portion of our growth come from outside the U.S., particularly in Japan and we just got the updated data that in combination in first-line in combination of aromatase inhibitors, we have a 30% share now and in the second line in combination of 45% share. So really outstanding work by our Japan team and a good growth there.","And then great work in Europe as well with continued uptake, strong patient uptake in UK, France and Germany and many countries now having reimbursement and often running. So, as we look forward to next year with Verzenio and continue to grow based on this we think very significant contribution to this important medicine.","Kevin Hern","Louise, thanks for the questions. Next caller, please.","Operator","Is the line of Navin Jacob with UBS. Please go ahead.","Navin Jacob","Great, thanks for taking the questions. You gave a lot of color on Trulicity and the pricing dynamics there, just on Taltz. I'm wondering if we could get similar sort of color, specifically UNH recently excluded Taltz from its 2020 formulary help us understand how the access looks for 2020 as you go into those discussions. Do you see any pressure there from some of the other newer entrants and second question on Jardiance, you have a couple of trials reading out over the next few years. The drug trials and heart failure; how are you thinking about that opportunity, are those trials meant to bolster the profile of Jardiance in the diabetes market or do you actually view the heart failure opportunities as a individual stand-alone opportunity. And if so, could you help us understand if this could be a blockbuster opportunity by itself and then associated with that wondering if the six-minute function tests are fileable by themselves. Thank you very much.","Kevin Hern","Thanks, Navin. We'll go to Patrik for the question on Taltz and then Enrique for the question about Jardiance.","Patrik Jonsson","Well, thank you very much. Access continues to be our challenge in the field of immunology in the US, but we will continue to ensure that through a combination of Taltz clear access program and contract with payers that we continue to ensure that patients get the access to whenever they need. If we look specifically into 2020, we expect 2020 to be similar to 2019 and incrementally better in some areas, and we know that not all plans -- drug benefits gains of 2020, as we believe we are entering into 2020 we have positive momentum and with Taltz now replacing Cosentyx as a preferred IL-17 we've had core formularies, which is covering more than 14 million lives in the U.S. So in an essence we believe 2020 to be very similar to 2019. But we have some incrementally better areas.","Kevin Hern","Thanks, Patrik, Enrique.","Enrique Conterno","So we do see heart failure for Jardiance as a significant opportunity for us. I think you described it as a blocks status type of potential, and I think that's right; clearly, we do have a lot of opportunity for Jardiance in type 2 diabetes. So heart failure is on top of the opportunity in type 2 diabetes. We do have when it comes to the six minute walk test, we have a read out later this year. You asked whether we believe that data would be fileable with the FDA and we believe that we can get that data on our label. Clearly the outcome studies are also critical for us and they will be coming at the end of next year and then in early 2021, so very significant opportunity for Jardiance and for patients.","Dan Skovronsky","And this is Dan. I could just also add in that we are studying Jardiance in chronic kidney disease and Phase III trial that will read out in 2022. Just another exciting opportunity there.","Kevin Hern","Thank you. Navin, thanks for your questions. And next caller, please.","Operator","The next is Seamus Fernandez with Guggenheim. Please go ahead.","Seamus Fernandez","Thanks very much. So just a couple of quick questions, first for the diabetes market. Enrique can you just help us understand the mix of payers, how that might be changing from a Trulicity perspective in terms of the next incremental script gained. And then similarly, where is Trulicity gaining the most traction incrementally amongst physicians, is it now really the growth driver growing beyond the ENDO market and pushing into the primary care physician portion of the market.","The reason that I ask that is because I think the mix of payers is really important relative to the incremental acquisition cost for each script considering the competition from an oral drug obviously moving and seeking to penetrate the primary care market. The other question is really a kind of bigger picture question on business development. I think Dave, you've said in the past that the focus now that Lilly has launched several successful products in the market today is to really reload the Phase 2 and the Phase 3 pipeline. Can you just give us a sense of where your focus, do you feel like the current Phase 1 pipeline is sufficient to advance there or is the focus more so or equally on areas outside and maybe you can just give us a sense of where you're most excited about the science going forward. Thanks.","Kevin Hern","Thanks, Seamus. We'll go to Enrique first for the question on Trulicity mix of payers and then Dave for your question on business development .","Enrique Conterno","Seamus continues to grow across all payers. So whether it's commercial or Part D, of course as we've highlighted, we had this proportionate growth in the VA and DoD and other types of payers that tend to be lower price. But as we look at the future, we do continue to expect growth for the product across all of the different payers. When it comes to primary care, we do see the class continue to grow across all segments and in particular Trulicity has been growing quite a bit when it comes to reaching more primary-care physicians. So a big part of the growth is just having more primary-care physicians try -- new try a GLP-1 and start using and adopting this important class and because of the simplicity of Trulicity, it is an ideal product for that.","Kevin Hern","Thanks, Enrique. Dave?","Dave Ricks","Yes, thanks for the question on capital allocation in VD. You have a right that we see a significant investment in our own labs, in our own efforts is very important. And we've had good success comment on Phase 1 starts this year as an example, we aggressively want to complement that with outside opportunities really it all phases of development and across all therapeutic areas. Now, of course, our opportunities to add value and find value are not uniform across stages of development or therapeutic areas and so that does skew our work in our effort there. But we are open-minded about all -- we operated in and all phases of development, where we can add value and find value, those are the most exciting and attractive opportunities. Of course, this year we did our largest acquisition ever with Loxo Oncology on the one end, on the other end you saw a nice tuck into our pain portfolio with another, we don't come at this with any particular financial framework, other than finding value and of course valuations and biotech have dropped a little bit lately. So, that always helps the equation.","They've been pretty high over the last 18 months prior to that, so we continue to look at all mechanisms -- in all phases and probably because of the number of opportunities, I've said this before, you will see is active in oncology, that's where a lot of early stage biotech is and earlier because that's where more of the opportunities lie.","Kevin Hern","Thanks, Dave. Seamus, thanks for your questions. Next caller, please.","Operator","Next is the line of David Risinger with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead .","David Risinger","Yes, thanks very much. So I just wanted to go back to the target. So with respect to the 31% operating margin target for 2020 that was reiterated today the street isn't quite there. I don't think I think it's just a tad bit below 31%. What is your sense that the street is over projecting in terms of costs, i.e., where do you think the cost will be lower than what the street is currently assuming. And then with respect to the revenue target that was provided in the second quarter slide, are you still comfortable with that $23.6 billion figure for 2020. Thank you.","Kevin Hern","Thanks, Dave. We will go to Josh for both of those questions.","Josh Smiley","Thanks, Dave. On the targets themselves and margins, I think if you look at how we've progressed since we've established those margins, what you've been seeing multiple hundred basis point improvements per year and this year we were clear in saying that wasn't going to be the case, because of the Cialis overhang that we faced this year. So I think when we look at in 2020 and of course, everybody has got different, different models, I think it's a combination probably of where we see revenue and how we think we can manage cost again as I mentioned earlier on a prior question. We feel good about the overall SG&A investments that we have. So as we lose the overhang from Cialis and Lartruvo, the volume gains that we're seeing in the new product portfolio and the price that we're projecting gets us I think in a much better growth position on the top line with modest growth on operating expense line.","So again we're confident, we've reiterated, as you know we raised this this number a little bit, we reiterated every opportunity we have that we will get there. I think it's probably just a function of both top line and more modest increases in operating expense. But again, that is very much in the context of the competitive dynamics we face and with the large growth opportunities we have long-term, we are going to invest behind those. In terms of the revenue piece, I think the answer again is the same as you look at how the portfolios performing on an underlying basis this year where we're confident in the minimum number that we need to achieve in order to get to the 7% compound annual growth rate target that we've outlined.","Kevin Hern","Thanks, Josh. Dave, thanks for the questions. Next caller, please.","Operator","In the line of Steve Scala with Cowen. Please go ahead.","Steve Scala","Thank you. And Dave for investors who choose to be skeptical this quarter has provided things to point to, so you explained Trulicity and Taltz, but Basaglar and Alimta also fell short. The beat was tax rate driven as was the 2019 guidance raise, Enrique is departing at a not ideal time. So, why should we be confident that the weaknesses are temporary, the tax rate lowering will create a tough compare in 2020 since one-time factors occur once and that Enrique's departure doesn't portend difficulty ahead in diabetes. So that's the first question. And with the stock unusually weak this year and given your confidence in the outlook, why not take this opportunity to be more aggressive with share repurchase. Why isn't this a phenomenal opportunity. Thank you.","Kevin Hern","Thanks, Steve, we'll go to Dave for the first handful of questions and then Josh on the share repurchase.","Dave Ricks","Yes. Great. Steve, thanks for the question. We of course have an answer to all of those things. And honestly, I don't think there has been a more interesting and exciting time to be in this company or more optimistic time and we went through many of those reasons today. We are broad portfolio products that are new in a life cycle with Cialis behind us remembering that Cialis is a 6.0 growth headwind over the last 4 quarters, that's ending now coupled with the one-time price effects, which we went through today, which we really believe are substantially one time either a step-down on the big mergers with our payers or the one-year effect of the donut hole which falls disproportionately on companies like Lilly, who have retail oriented products and then we look ahead in diabetes. I have to be honest, I think the diabetes pipeline, the growth opportunities ahead whether it be with Jardiance or Trulicity [ph] has never been stronger for the company. So I'll let Enrique answer the question on his timing, but I think he is leaving on top and there is another level to get to in Lilly Diabetes that's certainly how I feel I think of course every category we're in, we've talked about, we compete with companies, some of the bigger than ours. Some of them more focused, because we have more opportunities than the average company out there and that doesn't mean that every quarter, every line item we're going to nail our goals.","So I think we're honest with ourselves about that, but we have more than half a dozen products that get scale in a significant way and given our base of pharma revenue, I think that continues to offer a unique situation and then you couple that with margin expansion, which were convicted on as per the prior question and given our placement in the league table there, certainly we have upside on that one as the topline scales. I can't think of a better place to work in this industry, to be honest, we've got a great opportunity ahead. Now on share buyback, I'll let Josh address that, but certainly that has been our thinking. We've done aggressive share buyback this year as we think about sources of cash etcetera that's clearly on our list. And when we have that discussion with the board, I'm sure that will be key topic as we planned capital allocation over the coming years. Enrique you want to touch on your retirement. I think it's probably worth a mention here.","Enrique Conterno","Look I'm sad to be leaving and retiring from Lilly. We're very proud I think of the business that we've build in diabetes as good as I feel about building the business together with all of my colleagues, I feel even stronger about the bright future that diabetes has and Lilly has ahead. Just I think about Trulicity, Jardiance great momentum, leadership brands, but with important catalysts when it comes to Trulicity on rewind and the higher doses and when it comes to Jardiance of course heart failure and CKD on top of the opportunity in type 2 diabetes, and I continue to feel very bullish about what tirzepatide could do on both the efficacy and the tolerability profile. So very exciting time for us in diabetes overall and I couldn't be more excited about the future of Lilly Diabetes.","Josh Smiley","Thank you. Yes, just a couple of points; it's Josh. On share repurchase. As Steve, just to remind everybody, we did $3.5 billion share repurchase in the first half of this year, we did 600 million in the third quarter and as you say, when we see opportunities on the margins to create value, we're going to be opportunistic in share repurchase. Of course, we want to be balanced here as we mentioned in the comment, we want to ensure we've got the capital capacity to invest in the pipeline and business development opportunities when we see them. But, yes, you should expect that when we see outsized movements will to do what we can.","Kevin Hern","Thank you, Josh. Steve, thanks for your questions. Next caller, please.","Operator","The line of Andrew Baum with Citi. Please go ahead.","Andrew Baum","Thank you, couple of questions please. In relation to tau you spoke about access for next year. You didn't talk about pricing net pricing. Perhaps you could talk to that, given it's predominantly a commercial market. I'm assuming the rebating we've seen which looks like 40% is only going to go one way, I note that your 25% higher rebate and your net price on our calculations at least is down 16% year-on-year. So color on where it goes in 2020 will be helpful. And then second, again on net pricing in relation to Trulicity, we estimate that about 25% of Trulicity is Part D, based by volume, I'm obviously coming from point of view of trying to work out the contribution of the additional donut hole impact versus other factors, if you confirm how close we are to where it is, that would be very helpful. Many thanks.","Kevin Hern","Thanks, Andrew. We'll go to Patrik for the question -- Josh cover both.","Josh Smiley","Okay. Thanks, Andrew. On Taltz -- the Taltz pricing dynamics are a little bit different than Trulicity as Patrik mentioned I think earlier as we've talked about in other calls, about a third of our prescriptions now, just given the access challenges we have are not reimbursed or Lilly ends up being the primary payer. So as we get incremental access, you see interesting price moves here. So we're happy to gain access in pay rebates for that volume because we're transitioning patients in some cases from free product to reimbursed product. That being said, there are other cases where the product may not be on formulary, but as we work through PA process and other things, we end up ultimately getting 100% reimbursement.","So I think as you look at that piece, you're going to see it will be a little bit more difficult in Taltz to translate prescriptions to net price. All that being said, I think if you look in the third quarter, the biggest dynamic we saw for Taltz on price was similar to Trulicity and that we saw a prior period adjustment and again this is just estimating the rebate liability and as we looked over the preceding 12 months as we get invoices in we had to make an adjustment there that in total when we look at the sort of in quarter adjustment, it was about 20 points of prices as well, so we don't see that going forward. I think as you look into 2020 as Patrik mentioned we've got some opportunities to gain some incremental access and that will show up at some price concession, but it's more than compensated for and volume. So we see a relatively sort of steady price but lots of things moving around under the water.","I think on Trulicity your estimates are good, about 30% of Trulicity right now is in Medicare Part D. We see that probably as pretty stable going forward and as we mentioned we see that the pricing environment on a contracted basis as being pretty stable as we head into 2020 as well.","Kevin Hern","Thanks, Josh. Andrew, thanks for the questions. Next caller, please.","Operator","The line of Damien Conover [ph] with Morningstar. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, great. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to follow up on the Taltz study that showed encouraging data head to head versus Tremfya at 12 weeks. And it looks like there is a 24-week secondary endpoint coming up and my question is, is there any data points coming up after 24 weeks maybe pushing into 48 weeks and I ask that because of the eclipse data that showed favorable data from Tremfya versus a different IL-17 but really didn't show the strong data until week 48 and I just wondering how you're looking at Taltz position against Tremfya in those sort of longer duration of treatment. And then maybe a follow-up to that is when you position the product for physicians, is the quick response or potentially a longer response more important from your marketing perspective. Thank you.","Kevin Hern","Okay, thanks. Patrik?","Patrik Jonsson","Well, thank you very much. We are extremely excited obvious first superiority to try out of an IL-17 over an IL-23 and we just got the data published a couple of weeks ago. So we are now in the phase of disseminating this data among healthcare providers in the U.S. and the rest of the world. The 12 weeks as you said and we shared or showed the superiority both in terms of onset of action and clearance; of the next data cut will be at the week 24 and that is driven by the fact that we have seen also the IL-23 they peak in terms of efficacy pretty much at that time. If we look into the key attributes, particularly among patients treated psoriasis, its onset of action, its clearance and its durability. And I think this was a third Phase 3 trial that we have to confirm that Taltz is superior both STELARA and now Tremfya in terms of both onset of action and the end clearance, and we have 5 years data confirming the durability of efficacy as well, we really believe that there is a lot of good momentum with Taltz right now.","Dave Ricks","I would just add, you mentioned another IL-17, but we don't see these two IL-17 as similar and it's interesting to note that all our competitors who are doing IL-17 comparisons are choosing Cosentyx and not Taltz. I'm certain today, no one has actually compared any other psoriasis medicine to Taltz and I think that tells you a lot about the powerful efficacy that we deliver with this leading medicine.","Kevin Hern","Thanks, Dave. Damien, thanks for the questions. And we'll go to Dave for the close.","Dave Ricks","Great. Well, we appreciate everyone's participation today and your interest in the company. As I said earlier, we've made meaningful progress thus far in 2019 and we're committed to our revenue and operating margin goals in '19 as well as in '20. While we continue to invest in our innovation-based strategy with a diversified and volume driven revenue growth from one of the freshest portfolios in the industry and complemented by a pipeline full of exciting opportunities, some of which Dan commented on today , we believe Lilly continues to be a compelling investment. Thanks again for dialing in. And please follow up with the IR team if you have questions, we didn't address in today's call.

[Operator Instructions]. And I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Derica Rice. Please go ahead, sir.","Derica Rice","Thank you. Good morning. And thank you for joining us for Eli Lilly and Company's first quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. I'm Derica Rice, Lilly's Chief Financial Officer.","John Lechleiter our Chairman, President and CEO is traveling overseas and is unable to join us today. However, I do have a number of my colleagues with me here in person or dialing in. And they are Dr. Jan Lundberg, our President of Lilly Research Laboratories; Sue Mahony, President of Lilly Oncology; Enrique Conterno, President of Lilly Diabetes; Dave Ricks, President of Lilly Bio-Medicines; Chito Zulueta, President of Emerging Markets; Jeff Simmons, President of Elanco Animal Health; and Elissa Rassner, Brad Roebling and Phil Johnson of Investor Relations team.","During this call we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors including those listed on slide 3 and those outlined in our latest Forms 10-K and 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It is not intended to be promotional and is not sufficient for prescribing decisions.","Now, 2015 is off to a very good start. This quarter we had solid underlying business performance offset by the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar and lingering headwinds from U.S. patent expirations of Cymbalta and Evista. Our continued focus on cost controls drove strong leverage at the bottom line and we saw positive progress with our pipeline spanning regulatory approvals, submissions and Phase III data readouts.","Now, I'll begin today's call by highlighting key events that have occurred since our last quarterly earnings call and there have been quite a lot of them. Starting with commercial milestones, our U.S. colleagues began promotion of CYRAMZA for second-line metastatic non-small cell lung cancer after receiving FDA approval late last year. While in Europe, our colleagues launched CYRAMZA for the treatment of second-line gastric cancer.","In diabetes, following EU approval in Q4, we launched Humalog 200 units [Technical Difficulty] KwikPen, the first 200 units per mil mealtime insulin that is targeted for people who take more than 20 units of rapid-acting mealtime insulin per day. And following FDA approval at the end of January, along with Boehringer Ingelheim, we launched Glyxambi in the U.S. in March. We're excited about the potential of this product, which is the first approved single-fill combination of a DPP 4 inhibitor and an SGLT2 inhibitor.","Turning to regulatory milestones, in addition to FDA approval of Glyxambi, Boehringer Ingelheim received a positive opinion from Europe's CHOP for the single pill combination of Empagliflozin and Metformin for the treatment of patients with Type 2 diabetes. If approved, the product will be marketed under the trade name Synjardy.","In oncology we achieved a number of regulatory milestones for Cyramza. After receiving a priority review, Cyramza was approved in Japan as a treatment for patients with unresectable advanced or recurrent gastric cancer. Given the regulatory timelines for pricing in Access decisions, launch is expected midyear.","We also submitted Cyramza in both the U.S. and the EU for second-line metastatic colorectal cancer. I would note that the FDA's review of this SBLA is moving very quickly. And also in the EU, we submitted Cyramza for second-line non-small cell lung cancer. We're very pleased with the progress we've made in bringing Cyramza to market, having received regulatory approvals in the U.S., the EU and Japan within less than 12 months. As I'll discuss later we're also excited about life cycle opportunities for this brand.","In our bio-medicines business, we submitted ixekizumab to the FDA for review as a treatment for patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. And along with Pfizer, we announced that the FDA removed the partial clinical hold for tanezumab. As a result, we will begin Phase III trials in multiple pain indications before the end of the year. Our decision to proceed with the development of tanezumab triggered a $200 million payment to Pfizer.","On the clinical front, along with Incyte we announced that baricitinib met the primary endpoint of improved ACR20 response compared to placebo in the Phase III RA build study in patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who had an inadequate response to or were intolerant of at least one conventional DMARD.","At the American Academy of Dermatology meeting in March, we presented detailed results from the positive Phase III Uncover One study evaluating ixekizumab in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis. Also for ixekizumab, we issued a topline press release earlier this week announcing positive results from the Phase III Spirit P-1 study evaluating ixekizumab in patients with active psoriatic arthritis who were naive to biologic treatment.","I'm also pleased to announce that we have completed enrollment of the EXPEDITION 3 trial evaluating solanezumab in amyloid positive patients with mild Alzheimer's disease. Given that we completed enrollment ahead of schedule, we now expect last patient visit in October of 2016.","For our CTP inhibitor evacetrapib, we announced that the accelerate Phase III study in people with high-risk vascular disease will be extended by approximately six months. Last patient visit for this study is now expected in July of 2016. And we announced that regulatory submission of our basal insulin peglispro will be delayed in order to generate additional clinical data to further understand and characterize the potential effects, if any, of changes in liver fat observed with [indiscernible] treatment in the Phase III trial.","We're working with regulators to determine specific next steps but we do anticipate the regulatory submission is likely to occur after 2016. And we look forward to presenting detailed Phase III data at this year's ADA meeting.","On the business development front, we announced three deals. The first was an agreement with Hanmi for the development and commercialization of Hanmi's oral BTK inhibitor for the treatment of autoimmune and other diseases. Lilly will have worldwide rights, excluding China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Korea.","The second was a collaboration with Innovent for the development and commercialization in China for three investigational cancer treatments. In addition, Lilly will be responsible for the development and commercialization outside of China for a preclinical immuno-oncology molecule and for up to three preclinical bi-specific immuno-oncology molecules from Innovent.","And the third deal which we announced last week with Bristol-Myers Squibb was for the transfer back to Lilly of Erbitux' commercial rights in North America. These rights were scheduled to revert to Lilly in September 2018 but we expect this deal will accelerate that transition to Q4 this year. In other news, the German Court of Appeals ruled that the vitamin regimen patent for Alimta would not be infringed by a generic competitor that intends to market a dipotassium salt form of pemetrexed in Germany once the compound patent expires in December of 2015. We will seek permission to appeal this ruling to the German Supreme Court.","And finally, we repurchased just over $300 million of stock in Q1 leaving $3.4 billion remaining on our $5 billion plan. In addition, during the first quarter we distributed over $500 million to shareholders via our dividend. We remain committed to providing a robust dividend and to returning excess cash to shareholders via share repurchase.","2014 was a productive year for execution of our innovation-based strategy. Likewise 2015 is off to a strong start with more to come. Now I'll turn the call over to Phil for a discussion of our financial performance for the quarter. Phil?","Phil Johnson","Thanks, Derica. Before I review our Q1 results, it may be helpful to comment on the presentation of our GAAP results and non-GAAP measures. For our GAAP results, remember that we closed the Novartis Animal Health acquisition on January 1. So in interpreting our GAAP results and growth rates versus 2014, please keep in mind that 2014 does not include Novartis Animal Health. While 2015 includes the operating results of this business as well as all the costs associated with the acquisition, including financing costs, integration costs, inventory step-up costs, amortization of intangibles and other miscellaneous adjustments.","For our non-GAAP measures, recall that like our peers, we're now excluding amortization of intangibles from our non-GAAP measures. To provide you a better idea of underlying trends in our business, based on our current reporting practices and business configuration, we've adjusted our non-GAAP measures for 2014 to exclude the expense associated with amortization of intangibles and to include Novartis Animal Health as if we had closed the acquisition on January 1, 2014. This places 2014 on the same basis upon which we're reporting our financials this year.","In addition to aiding your analysis of our non-GAAP measures, you'll see that we posted an Excel file to our Investor Relations website that contains our 2014 non-GAAP measures adjusted to remove intangible amortization and to add Novartis Animal Health.","With that background, let's take a look at our results for the quarter. Slide 8 provides a summary of our GAAP results. As I'll focus my comments on our non-GAAP adjusted measures to provide insights into the underlying trends in our business, please refer to today's earnings press release for a detailed description of the year-on-year changes in our first-quarter reported or GAAP results.","Moving to slide 9, you can see that Q1 revenue was just over $4.6 billion. The decrease of 6% compared to Q1 2014 reflects significant FX headwinds. Excluding FX, our Q1 revenue on a non-GAAP basis was essentially flat.","As we discussed on our guidance call, this year we will still feel the negative effect of the loss of U.S. exclusivity for Cymbalta and Evista. This quarter sales of those two products in the U.S. declined by nearly $200 million. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates and Cymbalta and Evista in the U.S., the rest of our worldwide revenue increased 5% this quarter.","Gross margin as a percent of revenue increased 3.6 percentage points, going from 74.6% to 78.2%. This increase was entirely driven by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates on International inventories sold which increased cost of sales in Q1 last year but decreased cost of sales in Q1 this year. Excluding this FX effect, our gross margin percent declined by 1.1 percentage points, going from 76.4% in last year's quarter to 75.3% this quarter.","Please do take note of the level of our gross margin percent excluding the FX effect on International inventories sold. Again you'll see that this is running at roughly 75%. As we discussed when updating our guidance on our Q4 earnings call, in 2015 we expect a substantial FX benefit that should push our gross margin percent into the 78% range.","However, if FX rates stay at their current levels, that benefit will essentially go away in 2016. So as you construct your estimate of our 2016 gross margin percent, you should be making adjustments off of a 2015 base level of roughly 75%. As in past quarters, you'll find a supplementary slide providing our gross margin percent for the last 10 quarters with and without this FX effect.","Total operating expense, defined as the sum of R&D and SG&A, declined by 7% or nearly $200 million, compared to Q1 of 2014. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses declined 6% while R&D declined 9%. The reduction in marketing, selling and administrative expenses was due primarily to the favorable impact of foreign exchange as well as to ongoing cost-containment efforts.","The reduction in R&D expense was driven primarily by the lower late- stage clinical development costs and, to a lesser extent, the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. As implied by our full-year guidance, we do expect the level of R&D spend to be higher for the remainder of the year as we start Phase III trials for tanezumab, our CGRP monoclonal antibody, olimertumab and additional indications for Cyramza.","Other income and expense was income of $93 million in Q1 2015, compared to income of $36 million in the first quarter of 2014. This increase versus last year was due to a favorable legal judgment and larger net gains on investments. Our tax rate was 22.9%, an increase of 3 percentage points compared to the same quarter last year. This increase is primarily due to a discrete tax benefit realized in Q1 last year.","Also our tax rate in both periods did not include the benefit of certain U.S. tax provisions including the R&D tax credit, as those provisions had lapsed. At the bottom line, net income increased 16% while earnings-per-share increased 18% reflecting the benefit of our share repurchases. Slide 10 provides a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS and you'll find additional details on these adjustments on slide 19.","Now let's take a look at the effect of price rate and volume on revenue. On slide 11, in the yellow box in the middle of the page, you'll see the total revenue decline on a non-GAAP basis that I mentioned earlier of 6%. The significant strengthening of the U.S. dollar against many foreign currencies drove this decline as you see the 6% negative effect from FX that we booked this quarter with a favorable price effect of 3% offset by a volume decline of a similar amount. By geography, you'll notice that U.S. Pharma revenue increased 4% driven by price partially offset by volume. A number of pushes and pulls affected U.S. Pharma revenue growth this quarter.","First, as I mentioned earlier, Cymbalta and Evista declined following their patent expirations. Excluding Cymbalta and Evista the rest of our U.S. Pharma revenue increased 18% with over 7 percentage points coming from volume. Also recall that on our Q4 earnings call we mentioned that an extension of shipping days through the end of December 2014 resulted in lower wholesale inventory build in Q4 of 2014 than in Q4 of 2013.","As expected, this led to less wholesale inventory burn in Q1 this year than in Q1 last year, benefiting this year's growth rate. So when adjusted for wholesale buying, as well as Cymbalta and Evista, our U.S. Pharma revenue grew 14% this quarter with 3 percentage points coming from volume. Moving to our International operations in Australia, Canada and Europe, or ACE, you'll see a negative 13% rate impact was the primary driver of the overall 16% decline in revenue. While on a constant currency or performance basis ACE revenue decreased 3%, driven primarily by the initial effects of a loss of exclusivity for Cymbalta.","In Japan, Pharma revenue decreased 23% with half of the decline coming from the weaker yen. On a performance basis, our Japanese Pharma revenue decreased 11%. You may recall that we experienced substantial wholesaler buying in Q1 2014 in advance of an increase in the local consumption tax. Adjusting for the increased buying we saw last year, our Pharma revenue grew about 9% on a performance basis driven by volume.","Turning to Emerging Markets, we saw mid-single-digit performance growth driven by volume growth of 7%. As a result of the significant negative effect of FX, our reported Emerging Markets revenue declined 4% versus last year. Our Pharma revenue in China grew 6% with nearly all of that growth coming from volume.","On a non-GAAP basis, which adjusts 2014 as if we'd completed the Novartis Animal Health acquisition on January 1 last year, Elanco Animal Health revenue declined 4%. Excluding the negative effect of FX; Elanco revenue increased 2%. This performance increase was affected by competition in the U.S. for companion animal products.","Moving to slide 12, you'll see the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates on our Q1 2015 results. Given the significant and swift strengthening of the U.S. dollar, this is one of those quarters where FX has the opposite effect on the topline as it does on the bottom line. This quarter FX was a top line headwind, reducing revenue in U.S. dollars by 6 percentage points.","In terms of cost of goods sold, however, FX provided a substantial benefit which led to FX providing a tailwind or benefit for operating income and EPS. Excluding FX, you can see that our non-GAAP EPS in the first quarter grew 7%, while including FX non-GAAP EPS grew 18%.","Slide 13 shows our pipeline as of April 17. Changes since our last earnings call are highlighted with green arrows showing progression, red arrows showing attrition and stars showing molecules added through business development. You'll see that ixekizumab has moved into the regulatory review column following regulatory submission in the U.S.","Following our agreement with Tosano to develop their proprietary formulation of parathyroid hormone 1 to 34 using a microneedle patch system, you'll see that asset showing up in Phase II. And in Phase I you'll see two assets have been added through business development activities, an ultrarapid acting insulin through our deal with Adosha and a BTK inhibitor initially being studied in immunologic diseases through our deal with Hanmi.","In addition we began Phase I testing of a small molecule for diabetes and another for Parkinson's disease. And we terminated development of a Phase I small molecule for cardiovascular disease. You'll also see that we've moved Blosozumab from Phase II to Phase I. Our efforts to identify a commercially attractive formulation have been unsuccessful and we've decided not to move Blosozumab into Phase III development for osteoporosis at this time. We'll evaluate our strategy for the Blosozumab development program to determine next steps.","Now let me turn the call back over to Derica.","Derica Rice","Thanks, Phil. I'll recap progress we've made in our key events for 2015 and then review our 2015 financial guidance. Turning to slide 14, you may recall that when we showed this slide on our Q4 earnings call in late January, we had already achieved two events, presentation of data for ramucirumab in second-line metastatic colorectal cancer and completion of the acquisition of Novartis Animal Health.","Since that time, we've achieved a number of additional milestones. We begin our second wave of Phase III trials for Cyramza, initiating a pivotal trial in first line gastric cancer. In terms of the additional lifecycle investments in Cyramza, you'll also see that we've specified that the Phase III lung cancer trial will be in the first-line setting in patients with the EGFR mutation positive.","And we've added two new Phase III trial starts to our list of 2015 events. One is second-line bladder cancer and the other in second-line liver cancer in patients with elevated baseline alpha-beta protein levels. This is the population where we saw a pronounced overall survival benefit in the Phase III reach trial.","You'll also see that we've added a key event for our CGRP monoclonal antibody. In the coming weeks we expect to start a Phase III trial in patients with episodic cluster headaches.","Moving to the next Section, as mentioned earlier, we issued a second positive Phase III topline press release for baricitinib in rheumatoid arthritis. And earlier this week we issued a topline press release outlining positive results from a Phase III trial of ixekizumab in psoriatic arthritis. Also for ixekizumab, but in moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, we presented detailed results of the Phase III Uncover One trial at the AAD meeting in March.","In the regulatory submissions category, you'll see the green check marks for the ramucirumab and ixekizumab submissions I mentioned earlier, as well as the red checkmark for the delay in submission for basal insulin peglispro. While in the regulatory actions section, you'll see the green checkmarks for the approvals received in Japan for Cyramza in gastric cancer and Glyxambi here in the U.S.","Finally, we've reflected the progress made with tanezumab, lifting of the partial clinical hold paving the way to resume Phase III trials, as well as the negative Appeals Court ruling on Alimta in Germany.","2015 represents another year for execution of our innovation-based strategy and we're pleased with our progress so far and are excited for what lies ahead. While we know not all of the remaining events are likely to be positive, we're increasingly confident that a significant majority will break our way and solidify our near- to medium-term growth prospects.","Now turning to our 2015 financial guidance, I first point out that our substantial EPS beat in the quarter relative to consensus came from two line items. Lower R&D expenses and higher other income. In both cases, we believe these represent differences in timing between our expectations and consensus, not differences in expectations for the full year.","In terms of our non-GAAP guidance for 2015, at a high level, we're reconfirming our full-year guidance, both the individual line items and the EPS range. To provide some more color, we have seen further strengthening of the U.S. dollar since our call in late January and this is causing further FX headwinds at the top and bottom lines. However, the underlying performance of our business is offsetting this additional downside.","Specifically on FX, when compared to our late January outlook, we expect the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar to trim an additional $150 million to $175 million from revenue and another $0.05 to $0.06 from EPS. For the full year, we now expect FX to reduce revenue growth by about 7.5% or about 1.4 billion to $1.5 billion.","In terms of EPS, we now forecast a negative FX effect of about $0.13. Comprised of an operational FX hit of about $0.60 offset by benefit to cost of sales of nearly $0.50. As we discussed, should FX rates remain at current levels, this cost of sales benefit in 2015 would essentially go away in 2016. You'll want to consider this as you model our gross margin percent and EPS for 2016.","For our GAAP guidance, you will see that we've incorporated changes related to our decision to proceed with the development of tanezumab and the deals we signed with Hanmi, Innovent and Bristol-Myers Squibb. Finally, keep in mind that our 2015 GAAP guidance is based on our current estimate for how we'll account for the Novartis Animal Health acquisition and the Erbitux deal and could change based upon revised estimates and final accounting treatment.","In summary, while our first-quarter revenue reflects the impact of foreign exchange headwinds and the lingering effect of U.S. patent expirations for Cymbalta and Evista, Lilly remains on track to return to growth in 2015, driven by excellent progress in our innovation-based strategy. We had solid underlying business performance and our continued focus on cost controls drove strong leverage at the bottom line. Recent new product launches, along with the growing success of our late stage pipeline, reinforce our confidence in our future.","Since our last earnings announcement, we've seen one FDA approval and two FDA submissions, in addition to approvals and submissions in Europe and Japan. We've also seen a continuing series of positive data readouts for our late stage assets. We're pleased with the performance of recently launched products as well as growth at several established products. Excluding the hit from unfavorable exchange rates and lower U.S. sales of Cymbalta and Evista, the rest of our worldwide revenue increased 5% this quarter. We've started 2015 in a position of strength and our continued cost containment efforts allow us to build on our innovation-based strategy through both internal and external investments.","As we transition from a period of unprecedented patent expirations to an era of growth, we're seeing tangible results from our innovation-based strategy and we're increasingly optimistic about the opportunity we have to bring innovative new medicines to patients and create value for shareholders. As we discussed in January, throughout the balance of this decade, we aim to drive revenue growth and expand margins. You'll see us sharpen our focus on areas where we're best positioned to compete and win and find ways to increase productivity and do the work of pharmaceutical R&D better.","This concludes our prepared remarks. Now I'll turn the call over to Phil to moderate the Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. We will go to the line of Mark Schoenebaum of Evercore ISI.","Salim Syed","This is Salim in for Mark. Thanks so much for all the color on the call. It's really helpful. Two questions, one on Glyxambi. Can you give us your thoughts, where are the patients going to come from? Do you expect cannibalization of your new products or are these going to be new patients to the Lilly franchise? And then Cyramza, if you could provide, please, a breakout on gastric versus lung sales? Thanks.","Jan Lundberg","Obviously, Enrique, first question for you on Glyxambi and then over to you, Sue, for the Cyramza question. Enrique?","Enrique Conterno","On Glyxambi, clearly we're looking at the benefit that this product could provide for patients that are not achieving good control on metformin. So we see this as a very attractive options for many of those patients. And that's basically what our clinical results also say. So we're excited. We're the very early stages of our launch. We launched in late March, so we're, at this time basically introducing this product to healthcare providers.","Sue Mahony","Sure. And with Cyramza, the vast majority of the sales that we're seeing is in gastric cancer impacting the U.S. where we launched last year. We're seeing use with the majority of the sales coming from use in combination with taxitaxil [ph] as we expected.","We did see in Q1, though, a proportion of sales coming from the lung launch. It's early days yet on lung. But what we're seeing uptake there and the feedback so far is positive from physicians in the use of Cyramza in lung cancer indications. And clearly in Europe, we just launched, beginning of this year, in Europe and where we're seeing access, for example, in countries like Germany, again early days, but the uptake in the gastric indication there is positive.","Enrique Conterno","Yes. Just I did not answer the question on what impact would Glyxambi have on both Trajenta and Jardiance. We're not really thinking about the cannibalization aspects when introducing this product. We think this product is a very unique product. And, if anything, we believe that this product is actually going to strengthen both Trajenta and Jardiance as it becomes - as it basically gains acceptance in the marketplace.","Operator","We will go to the line of Tim Anderson with Bernstein.","Tim Anderson","Love to get your updated perspective on solanezumab and the Alzheimer's opportunities in light of the biogen data. Mechanistically, of course, both products target A-beta. They do it in reasonably different ways. Yesterday Roche, who had two monoclonals, suggested that they may push forward with a plaque-targeting version of their drug versus the other product that hits multiple forms of A-beta.","Your product targets soluble A-beta, yet you also have in development a plaque-specific monoclonal. So given the totality of their data, what's your latest thinking here? What has the best chance of success, a drug that targets soluble or deposited plaque? And then another question, if last patient visit is October 2016, does it mean that we would only learn of results downstream of that or would we possibly learn of a topline ahead of that last patient visit?","Jan Lundberg","Dave, if you'd like to take a shot at the two questions? Jan, do feel free to chime in as well, particularly on the first portion of Tim's question if you'd like. Dave?","Enrique Conterno","Obviously, [Technical Difficulty] interest in Alzheimer's disease. And as you know, for a long time we've believed in solanezumab's mechanism clearing the [indiscernible] data. We're starting to have a - conclude enrollments in Expedition 3 and now we're on the clock for last patients achieve 18 months of therapy. In the past we've communicated there was a chance we may - we had allowed for an interim risk but, as I've said before, that feature of the program was only valuable in the case of a slow enrollment rate.","Again at this point we haven't made a definitive decision. I would continue to guide people to focus on the end of the study as when we'll be learning about the effects of solanezumab. So to your question, that would be after the October 16 last patient visit.","As you rightly point out we also have specific interest in a Phase I program in that area. We're also excited about that mechanism. Recognizing that the mechanisms may, in fact, be complementary in some sense, either sequentially or combined together, that specific antibodies to date, the ones that we had published data on, also have a safety side effect profile that's, to our eye, quite different from solanezumab from the patient inherence perspective, et cetera, that may have an impact.","So we'll have to let both of these mechanisms play out. And we're excited about both of them and I think with Alzheimer's, it is truly unique moment here as we've seen these modifying effects from multiple different programs.","Jan Lundberg","Let me just add that I think it's very likely that these mechanisms are complementary. And clearly solanezumab has also shown preferable safety profile, particularly in relation to ARIA, either on the brain edema dilemma that you see with this plaque-specific antibodies, at least then from competitors. So I think we now need to wait and see what happens with it in these bigger trials.","Phil Johnson","Tim, just a little more color on your question about hearing results downstream from that October 2016 date. As we've been through this a number of times, as you may recall, that after last patient visit, there is time that needs to transpire for the database to actually be locked, cleaned and validated and then for us to run tables and figures and so typically, topline press releases have been after last patient visit by multiple months. So you should expect to see a topline press release downstream certainly of that October 2016 last patient visit date.","Operator","We will go next to the line of Gregg Gilbert with Deutsche Bank.","Gregg Gilbert","I was hoping you could provide a little more color on some of the softness in the quarter for Alimta and Animal Health. You mentioned some competitive pressures there. Could you expand a bit? And then on the pipeline, Jan, on the CGRP product, are you still pursuing chronic and episodic headache as well? And when might we see data on those products? And then lastly on the glucagon receptor antagonist, can you frame for us what you're trying to accomplish there and where it might fit in to the broader spectrum of treatments? Thanks.","Jan Lundberg","Sue, if you can comment on the Alimta performance in the quarter. Jeff, obviously, for Animal Health, with CGRP actually having transitioned to Dave's organization, I think from a planning perspective, Dave, why don't you take a first crack at talking about our development plans for CGRP. And then Enrique and Jan, if you want to fill in for the glucagon receptor antagonist, that would be great. Sue, we'll start with you?","Sue Mahony","Sure. Alimta performance was mainly impacted by FX worldwide. We had a 1% volume decline with a 7% rate and a 1% price. If we look at it by geography, we actually increased in the U.S. by 3% and that was mainly driven by price.","In Europe, we had a 2% volume increase and that was offset mainly by FX with also some price impact in ENB. We also had a volume increase, again offset half by price and half by rate. In Japan we had the same impact that was mentioned earlier with regards to the buy-in that we saw last year on the consumption tax increase. So we did have a volume decrease versus last year's quarter. But also a rate impact in Japan.","Jeff Simmons","On companimals, real quick like, we've seen and really expected these headwinds with increased competition really coming in a couple areas, two new competitive entries as well as a reentry in the marketplace. We're two drivers, I would add an additional one, which has really been some distraction from the integration. We've really used a rapid pace with the integration of both companies and from this being the first and second quarter, critical to the companimal business, this also had an impact.","I will note, though, on the integration, it's going better than expected. We're three months in and I do believe that both Novartis and Lohmann will be enablers to our medium- and long-term growth in the companimal segment, as well as globally. We've relaunched, as well, Interceptor.","Three weeks after the closing the Management teams have both been combined. We've got a Management team that includes some Novartis executives and I believe we've now got the majority of the global sales force in place. So again we're finding far more positives than negatives at this stage with the Novartis integration. It will be an enabler for growth and as we've previously communicated, the savings level of $200 million will be our minimum expectation.","Phil Johnson","Dave, on CGRP development plans?","Dave Ricks","Yes. So I think your question was whether our clients were chronic or episodic headache? Remembering there's actually two types of headaches we're looking at here. What we've been talking about today is the addition to the pipeline advancement chart of moving CGRP into Phase III here in the coming months for a condition called cluster headache and we'll be studying that in both the chronic and the episodic forms. This is an orphan-type indication that we're moving into.","We're also continuing the development in episodic [Technical Difficulty]. Lilly is not planning to study chronic migraine at this time and we've had impressive results from our Phase II program in episodic migraine. We'll be seeking to replicate these results in Phase III and right now we have a Phase IIb program going on to further define the dose for that larger migraine program.","Phil Johnson","And then Enrique or Jan on the GRA?","Enrique Conterno","Maybe I'll start and then Jan can help here. But clearly our glucagon receptor antagonist is right now in Phase II. What we basically have seen is rapid reductions in Humalog A1c. We saw it increase high posts or weight gain. The way we're thinking about this product is this product has to offer a benefit vis-a-vis a number of oral options that are available today and that in the future will be available in generic form.","So we're thinking that this product could be an attractive option in the early segment for patients that have impaired renal function where beta cell health might not be great. We don't see lots of options for these types of patients and GRA could be an attractive option there. Jan?","Jan Lundberg","Just complement there, the metabolism of this agent is independent of renal function. So therefore, it's suitable with patients then that have some compromise in their renal function.","Operator","And that will come from the line of Tony Butler of Guggenheim Partners.","Tony Butler","Number one, Jan, if you could comment on restarts for tanezumab. Would the focus again be NOA or osteoarthritis? Number two, what actually led to the decision to delay the evacetrapib look? Was it just simply the DSMB making some judgments about event rates?","And then finally, again, back to Alzheimer's, I think there's data supporting combination, maybe it's totally in animals, but combinations of A-beta antibody in the base inhibitor. And just trying to understand how you think about, really from a cost standpoint and also from a mechanistic standpoint, think about combinations versus solanezumab versus one or the other antibodies alone as we progress over time? So something beyond 2016. Thanks very much.","Phil Johnson","Dave, actually, I think I'll ask you to take a crack at these since these assets are currently sitting with your business unit. Jan, obviously feel free to supplement his response if you think it's appropriate. Dave?","Dave Ricks","Good. As it relates to tanezumab, yes, we're pleased to be able to now move off of clinical hold and do plan to proceed into Phase III as soon as later this year with Pfizer. There will actually be three indications that will be pursued. Osteoarthritis, as you mentioned, Tony, we'll also be looking at chronic low back pain and then chronic pain associated with cancer. And that program is similar to what had been previously studied and then stopped at Phase III.","On evacetrapib, as we mentioned earlier in the quarter, the extension of time is really not related to the evacetrapib study accelerate. It was a set of recommendations made by our academic advisors and accepted by the company based on information coming from other major long-term cardiovascular event studies where it has been noted that in mediate or recent ACS patients that the impact of lipid managements is a bit delayed in these patients. And we wanted to make sure we fully accounted for this new information in sizing the trial, thus the six-month extension into middle of 2016.","Maybe just briefly on Alzheimer's and Jan perhaps can elaborate on the Lilly-generated combination data, but we have no doubt that this disease when we find and have approved these modifiers will be requiring multiple mechanisms to fully arrest its impacts. And we do think mechanisms such as plaque-targeted antibodies, such as base inhibitors and soluble A-beta antibodies and maybe even TAL-based therapies could be combined in all kinds of forms to achieve optimal results.","Of course the science in this space is evolving rapidly and, frankly, pretty new. We don't have human data in combinations that I'm aware of. So that's a whole field that would need to be explored, hopefully after a positive solanezumab study in late 2016.","Enrique Conterno","Let me just add a comment about tanezumab, the [indiscernible] growth factor, which I feel is highly exciting based on that the chronic-pain area is really needing a new agent. And if you consider the current dilemmas and problems that are with opioids in relation to addiction tolerance or even death due to abuse and so on and NSAIDS has a number of gastrointestinal side effects and there is an increased cardiovascular risk. So I think the opportunity for a new chronic-pain agent is a major one.","In relation to the Alzheimer's combos, it's quite intriguing to think about different mechanisms again. Then if you have existing plaque, they need to be cleared and most likely by some microglial activation. And we have our N3pG plaque-specific antibody that can do that. And then you need to prevent further buildup of plaques with A-beta and that can be achieved either by a base inhibitor, or potentially by solanezumab binding them, the free AB tests. We're looking forward to making not only the preclinical experiments in a further solid way but also to test this in the clinic. But first we need to have good data with these different agents before we can combine them.","Operator","We will go to the line of Jami Rubin of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Jay Olson","Jay Olson in for Jami Rubin. On Alimta, can you help us understand, when should we expect to get news on the appeal of the German and UK court decisions regarding the Alimta method-of-use patent? And then do you expect the approval of PD1 antibodies for use in lung cancer to impact the sales of Alimta? And then just on Trulicity, any details, if you could provide, on how the launch is progressing? Thank you.","Phil Johnson","Sue, the first two for you and then we'll go over to Enrique for the last question on Trulicity.","Sue Mahony","Jay, with regards to the Alimta patent, in the German court, as you know, ruled in our favor last year on the infringement case. In March, that was appealed and the appeal ruled against Alimta. And so basically has ruled that the vitamin regimen patent would not be infringed by generic competitor if they intend to market post the loss of the compound patent the end of December of this year and we will seek permission to appeal this decision to the German Supreme Court.","We anticipate that the appeal hearing will happen, though, after the compound patent has expired in Germany. In the UK, the High Court ruled against Lilly in the first instance in May of last year. We have appealed this ruling. The appeal was heard in March of this year. We have yet to hear the outcome of that appeal. And as a reminder, that case covered the UK but also France, Italy and Spain. So we're waiting to hear what the outcome of that appeal would be.","Regarding your question on the PD1 inhibitors, on Alimta, the main use of Alimta and where we promote Alimta because we believe that's where we see the best benefit for patients is in the first-line setting and in the maintenance setting. As you are aware, the Optivo launch and the data that we're seeing in some later lines of therapy, so we do not see an impact in the near future on Alimta. Clearly there are other studies ongoing in the first-line setting. We'll need to see what those readouts are over the coming years.","Additionally we do believe that combinations are going to be important going forward. And so we have a collaboration with Merck to look at combining Keytruda and Alimta in the first-line non-squamous setting, so clearly we need to see the data from all those trials over the coming months and years.","Enrique Conterno","So far, I think the launch of Trulicity is going well. Let me comment first on the GLP-1 market, because we had shared that we felt that Trulicity could be an important catalyst for the overall growth in that class. And long-term for us, this is critical as we think about the prospects for this product.","A year ago when we looked at Q1 of 2014, this class was growing 6% when we look at TRX growth. This year, this class is growing 10 percentage points higher, so the growth is at 16%. And importantly, the growth is still accelerating as we look at new prescriptions. So it is an important start, because we do believe that Trulicity will be a major player in this class, but we want to make sure that this class is as relevant as it basically could be.","To give some details on our penetration within the class itself, Trulicity today has an 11% new to patient, neutral brand share. This is comparable to BYDUREON at 23 and Victoza at 51. We're pleased with what we see, importantly because we have to put into context that in Q1 what we've shared is that access discussions are going well. And just to provide some color in Q1, we had a 65% availability in commercial and no availability in part D.","Commercial is about 75% of the overall market, so clearly, what this basically means for Trulicity, that we had access to about 50% of the market, so we need to look at 11% new to run of course, in that context. What we have shared is that we feel good about our access in commercial. We continue to advance those numbers so we're closer to 70% now. And in part D, we had shared in the past that we were expecting access most likely starting 2016.","We're pleased to report that we have already some limited access in part D and we believe that access will continue to increase through Q2 and Q3. So we're getting access faster than we had expected and this I think response to the value that the payers see in this particular product.","Operator","We will go next to the line of John Boris with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.","John Boris","Just back to a question for Enrique on Trulicity while you're still on it. With that kind of growth, 16% growth, can you talk about how the launch of the Primary Care is going? What percent of the business or prescriptions that are generated are being generated by endos versus Primary Care?","And then you'll approach about six months post-launch, about midyear, with that kind of growth in the market, one would think a good dose of direct-to-consumer advertising might be useful in driving uptake of a product? So just commentary around that?","Second question has to do with the Alimta ruling in the UK on the appellate decision. Just your thoughts around timing of that? Is that something you're expecting to happen in the second quarter? And then I noticed in your slide deck you do have outcomes coming on U.S. and Japan. Can you remind us what's going on there? And then lastly on Alzheimer's disease and TAL, you made some acquisitions of some diagnostics in 2013 on TAL. Neurofibrillary tangles are a little bit different. When might we potentially see some assets targeting the TAL area coming of your pipeline? Thanks.","Phil Johnson","Enrique, we'll start with you for the Trulicity questions. And Sue, if you want to comment on Alimta and Jan for the TAL?","Enrique Conterno","Sure. So providing a little more detail when we look at both endos and Primary Care, endos, which represent slightly under 30% of the overall GLP-1 market, our new to patient share, is 18%. So clearly this reflects the fact that we launched in that to endos earlier. In Primary Care, our share is still in the high single digits when it comes to new to patient share, but it's increasing fast.","So we feel good in terms of where we're today. I think it's important to note that in Primary Care, we basically really have about two and a half months, basically, since we launched, so it's still very early but we're seeing week-to-week progression when it comes to our new to patient share. And clearly, the continued improved access, I think, is going to play very well for us.","In terms of our plans, as we seek to build this brand, one comment, but clearly we're not ruling out direct to consumer or any of those investment. Clearly there is a lot of direct-to-consumer investments in the U.S. right now and that's something that we look very closely for all of our brands.","Sue Mahony","With regard to the Alimta hearing or the Alimta patent, the UK decision will clearly depend on the timing from the court, but we do anticipate we'll hear sometime later this year on that. In Japan, the JPO hearing was heard in February. And again, we're expecting to get a determinant on that case again sometime later this year.","In the U.S., as you're aware, the District Court has ruled in Lilly's favor on validity. The case has gone back to the court regarding infringement. That case is now being heard on May 28 of this year.","Jan Lundberg","First, the TAL imaging agent is making intriguing progress and seems to differ in relation to what you can achieve compared to the amyloid imaging. The TAL imaging seems to correlate quite well to symptom decline in and progression then of Alzheimer's disease. It also has a regional distribution in the brain that also seems to correlate with symptoms and there is a great interest in the overall academic and pharmaceutical community for this particular agent.","We're also testing whether the TAL imaging could potentially be a surrogate marker then for Alzheimer's disease progression and how you can influence that with pharmaceuticals. And there will be a subgroup in EXPEDITION 3 then for solanezumab that will have the TAL tracer before and after treatment.","In relation to TAL therapeutics, we're very interested to see if we can inhibit the spread of TAL mis-folded protein in the brain which seems to happen in the prion-like fashion. And we have a monoclonal antibody in preclinical development that, if everything goes well, we should have that in Phase I next year.","Operator","And we will go next to the line of Chris Schott with JPMorgan.","Wendy Lin","This is Wendy Lin on for Chris. Just a couple. How are you thinking about what insights you've learned from the recent DPP4 adcom panel and any impact it might have on the DPP 4 class? And can you talk about your relative confidence in Jardiance with regard to the CV outcome study and the possibility that the study could show a net benefit to patients? And then in ontology, in light of the Pfizer I brands approval and the early stoppage of their second-line study, can you update us on your program? Thanks.","Phil Johnson","Sure. Thanks for the questions, Wendy. Enrique, obviously to you for the DPP4 adcom question and our CV outcomes trial for Jardiance. And then Sue, for the [indiscernible] update?","Enrique Conterno","Well, on DPP4, as I think we all have seen or heard the discussion at the advisory committee. Clearly there was a lot to focus on both CV safety but also all-cause mortality endpoints. It is difficult for me to speculate any action that the FDA may take. I think what I can basically say as far as Trajenta is concerned and we have to keep in mind that these numbers are very low, so we cannot have any type of conclusive interpretation from this data, but when we look at our randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials and when we look at the data for Trajenta, in both cases when it comes to CV mortality and when it comes to all-cause mortality, our house of ratios were below 1.","So we have no signals that would indicate that linagliptin would cause - would have an issue when it comes to either all-cause mortality or CV death. When it comes to the data for dose-specific DPP4, as I think you have to ask the respective companies. As far as Jardiance is concerned, we're very excited to be able to get to see the results from our outcome trial. At this stage, I've characterized our chances as decent, but we have to wait and see. So we will be basically having a chance to look at these results over the summer and we expect to basically publish topline results when we have this data available.","Sue Mahony","Regarding abemacyclic, we're very excited by this molecule and we believe that the latest news [indiscernible] validates the CDK46 class. And we believe that we could have a best-in-class molecule here with single -gent activity, continuous dosing and also our molecule crosses the blood-brain barrier. We're moving quickly on our trials.","We have our two Phase III trials ongoing and enrolling, one which is our Phase II trial ongoing, as well as our Kraz [ph] lung study, so we're moving quickly. Our plan is to enroll these trials as quickly as possible so we can get data out hopefully over the next year or so on these trials. Also we have started a breast cancer study for women with brain mets.","That will be - because we know that abemacyclic crosses the blood- brain barrier, we believe that that could be a good opportunity for this molecule. So we're excited and we look forward to sharing more data with you.","Operator","And we will go to the line of Seamus Fernandez with Leerink. Please go ahead.","Seamus Fernandez","So maybe you could just update us on some key data sets through the balance of this year and maybe if you could focus a little bit more on the data sets for Phase II that could actually have products entering into Phase III, that would be very helpful.","As a second question, this may be for the CV team, but maybe you could talk to us a little bit about the target event rate in that study? And just update us on what your expectations are for the baseline LDL? And when you talk about that, could you confirm that the baseline LDL is on a maximized statin background?","And then lastly, can you just help us better understand, in the evolving pricing environment, what do you think are the thresholds of benefit that are going to be necessary for you to show to really achieve an appropriate payment scheme for the anti-NGF therapy? Thanks a lot.","Phil Johnson","Dave, I think probably the second question, the third, are up your alley. I would say, Seamus - this is Phil - we have not yet published the design paper for the accelerate trial of evacetrapib. I think we were close to doing that last year, but when the improvement data came out, as Dave mentioned earlier, we wanted to make sure that we could fully analyze that and take into consideration how that might impact, if at all, the trial design for accelerate.","As you've now seen, that has impacted, resulted in an additional six-month extension of the study to accrue additional events and additional late events. So, Dave, if you could maybe start off talking about the stuff that you can, target event rates, baseline LDL and if it was on a mac statin background and then talk a bit about the pricing environment as you see it for the anti-NGF. And then we'll come back to your first question, Seamus, on, in particular, Phase II data could read out this and more broadly data readouts that you should have on your radar screen for the balance of 2015. Dave?","Dave Ricks","As it relates to the target event rates and specifics about the population in the accelerate program, I know we've said this before, but we're anticipating publishing a design paper for accelerate which will include those details. So until that is published, it's probably not appropriate to comment further.","I will only generally say that accelerate is a study designed to study secondary prevention in high-risk vascular disease and as a result, we're expecting a decent event rate in this population. And, in fact, that's what we're observing having enrolled it. The details of that, again, we'll be publishing in the forthcoming Journal.","As relates to NGF and tanezumab in the pricing scheme, we're not going to be able to go into the detail on that here, but I think Jan touched on this earlier, that we see chronic-pain management different from acute-pain management. Chronic-pain management is a very significant unmet need, particularly in the United States. The patients that will be targeted with tanezumab will be patients who have exhausted other pain- management options.","And other more significant interventions, the likely next step in their disease course and we think in this space, there's creation both for pharmaceutical but in the health system itself, not to mention the side effect and addiction issues for the current therapies [Technical Difficulty] program, pretty substantial at that size in this - we think there's clearly a place, a place where - can be reimbursed in chronic pain management.","No, I wrote down the questions here, but question on baseline LDL, the baseline LDL is, just to confirm, in accelerate [Technical Difficulty] publish that number, but patients enroll on the maximum tolerated dose of the stat.","Phil Johnson","Thanks, Dave. Seamus, let me start with some of the trial readouts that you should be expecting and\/or detailed data presentations that we think you'd have on your radar screen. And then Jan, Sue, Enrique, or Dave if there are other Phase II readouts that you want to highlight, please do so.","So as Derica mentioned at the ADA meeting this year, we would expect to have detailed data from a large number of the Phase III trials for our basal insulin peglispro. We also hope in the middle part of this year in the summer to have the first detailed Phase III data disclosures for both ixekizumab and for baricitinib, respectively in psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis. Recall, as well, Enrique mentioned the CD outcomes trial for Jardiance that we expect around the middle part of the year and then the solanezumab extension data from the two-year data we would expect to be presented at the medical meeting this year as well.","If you think about some of the additional top lines or yet to read out probably the main one or ones that I would highlight for you would be the latter part of the when we expect to have data from the remaining two of the four main pivotal trials for baricitinib in rheumatoid arthritis.","We've also talked about moving over a 2 Mab or 3G-3 into Phase III trials in soft tissue sarcoma and would hope, at an upcoming medical meeting, to have some of the detailed data presented to allow you to see our reason for optimism with that drug. Clearly ASCO would be a great venue for us to do that.","With that let me turn it over to Jan or the other business unit presidents if there is additional readouts that you'd like to highlight. I think I've hit them all, but..","Sue Mahony","I think you have.","Operator","We'll move on the line of Emil Devan with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Ari Jahja","This is Ari Jahja on behalf of Emil Devan. Thanks for taking the questions. I have a few here first on the Animal Health business. Can you talk about the pricing environment for food and companion Animal Health products and outlook longer term? And then secondly on baricitinib, we've now seen some initial Phase IIb data from [indiscernible] competing [indiscernible]. How do you see baricitinib's profile stacking up now against competitors? And when should we expect to see additional detailed data from the program? Thank you.","Phil Johnson","Jeff, if you'd like to handle the first question on Animal Health pricing and then, Dave, back across the pond to you for baricitinib?","Jeff Simmons","The pricing environment overall remains stable in Animal Health. We saw last year, as you know 4%, increase in our business. Industry averages have been between 2% and 3% and I believe that we've got different economic conditions across geographies and species, but a pretty stable market, so I would see it in the range of this industry average of between 2% and 3%.","Dave Ricks","So baricitinib, we're right in the middle of Phase III readouts. As Phil mentioned previously, the first two studies we have toplined already. And you should expect to see some of that data presented at EBAR coming up in the middle of the year. This would be the beacon and build studies.","Additionally we have an early RA study and then a first line biologic comparative study which is fully powered noninferiority against agumenubab Both of those studies, what we've said is in the second half of this year, will be topline in those. So exciting year for baricitinib and then sort shortly following all that we'll be submitting to FDA and other and other global regulators.","In terms of how we compare our results to others, of course it's not appropriate to make direct - there are no direct comparison studies between topacitnin and baricitinib or the recent Galapagos data, but I think we've said all along, we'd like the Jack 1-2 signaling pathway, particularly in RA and we feel like baricitinib has the chance to be the best in class product, if you think of this as one whole class. And so far we're pleased with the results from the studies we have read out.","Operator","We will go to the line of Kathy Miner of Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.","Kathy Miner","Just two topics. First on ixekizumab, can you comment - I think on clinicaltrials.gov, it shows that the trials for ankylosing spondylitis was withdrawn. Can you comment whether you're still pursuing that indication? And also recently, we've seen some topline data from one of your competitors which had some very strong PASI 100 scores. Is that something mechanistically there's differences between these products? Or how can we look at that?","And second question is just on guidance for 2015. I appreciate you've had a very strong first quarter and there were some timing issues and also you've highlighted very clearly the currency impacts going forward. But can you tell us whether Lilly has ever changed annual guidance in the first quarter historically? Thank you.","Phil Johnson","Dave, if you could comment on the ixekizumab questions. And, Derica, Derica we've got one finally for you on financials. If you want to talk about the guidance? Dave?","Dave Ricks","Sure. Thank you for the question on ixekizumab. To clarify, the ankylosing spondylitis study that was withdrawn was originally designed to be a supportive study for exposure through the PSA program, as we were several years ago and as we're midstream on the additional indication work for ixekizumab, we changed the strategy and that supportive evidence wasn't required anymore under the approach.","So what we have with ixekizumab now is a complete set of studies in moderate to severe plaque psoriasis and cover 1-2-3 studies. I'm not sure which competitor you're referring to on the PASI 100 scores, but we're pretty impressed with our PASI 100 scores, which, as you know, at the high end have achieved up to 41%. And I think that's as good as I've seen, but interested in - of course, if you have other insights on that.","And [indiscernible] class, we do have differences. [indiscernible] which is now launched from Novartis in IL 17 A, antibody to the protein, so are we, whereas others have taken different approaches, notably the antigen approach which is a receptor antibody. So it would be not unexpected to have slightly different types of clinical results and safety profiles as a result of those differences.","In terms of other things around ixekizumab, we recently toplined our first psoriatic arthritis study and we have another psoriatic arthritis study ongoing. And as it relates to an aspect, your original question, we remain interested in this indication and we think turning to IL 17 is a logical step and could advance care for this very debilitating condition.","Derica Rice","As for our guidance this year, historically, yes, we have; it has happened. I would say it's not common. But we do look at it each and every quarter to see if there's anything meaningful enough to cause us to move our estimates. As I stated earlier in my opening remarks, we're off to a very good start to the year.","Despite the FX headwinds, we're driving volume growth in those areas we had anticipated, at least versus our internal expectations. And that coupled with the good cost-containment efforts really is driving our strong bottom-line performance. And as importantly, we do expect to return to growth for the year this year in 2015. So we're very encouraged by our start to the year and we'll keep you updated as we progress through the remaining months.","Operator","And we will go to the line of back to David Risinger of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, sir.","David Risinger","Sorry about that earlier. So I have three questions. First, with respect to the two-year extension Sola data that's forthcoming, could you just please provide a framework for us for what data set we should be expecting? How you might carve out the mild patients? Any caveats that you would highlight before we see the data?","Second, with respect to glargine, could you remind us your timing for launch in Europe and in the U.S.? And then on the Erbitux deal, Derica, maybe you could just explain some of the income statement mechanics we should be thinking about for late this year? And then the accretion from that deal in 2016? Thanks very much.","Phil Johnson","Dave Ricks, if you could talk about the two-year extension, how people should be thinking about that? Both the general framework of what they might be expecting to see in the data or what we'd like to be seeing in the data? We'll be carving out mild patients and any caveats to be provided. Enrique, over to you for the timing for launch for glargine, both U.S. and EU. And then, Derica, if you want to comment on the Erbitux mechanics. If not, I can chime in as well. So Dave, over to you first.","Dave Ricks","We said previously we'd be hoping to disclose that data middle of this year. The two-year extension from EXPEDITION 1 and 2, we have disclosed at CCAD November 14 some of the earlier data and just on limitations just a few comments. Of course this is open label data. It's a progressive and significant disease burden on the patients. So you never get 100% completing all the way through and probably most importantly, patients in EXPEDITION 1 and 2 were not deselected for lack of amyloidosis. And so we still have a mixed-cause dementia in the study which, of course, we've corrected in EXPEDITION 3.","That said, I think there is two primary effects, one we would hope to see, to answer the question did you see disease modification in the controlled phase of EXPEDITION 1 and 2? And we will be focused on the mild patients. You'll see that broken out. One is that there's no catch-up, meaning that if you start later, you can get to the same point.","I think one definition of disease modification is that it's a daily progression and therefore starting earlier is better. But I think then you'd also hope to see that the later-started patients would also follow a parallel curve of decay to those who are on the drug the whole time, so there is a drug effect. And, in a sense, one could say we didn't just get lucky with randomization in the first set of studies. So those are two comments and color to frame what we'll see in July.","Enrique Conterno","Sure. So when it comes to glargine, we're anticipating launching in Europe late in the summer of this year. And in the U.S., as you are aware, we're subject to a 30-month stay. We do have a trial happening later this year in the month of September. Assuming, of course, that we have a favorable resolution of that trial prior to the 30-month stay, we would be launching earlier. But the 30-month stay basically takes us into Q3 of 2016.","Derica Rice","Dave, on Erbitux, it might be helpful to review really quickly the current accounting. So essentially when you look at things like our investor workbook we post on the website and look at the detailed product revenue tab, you'll see that there are two different lines. One is for the net revenue that we book, which is essentially 39% of the revenue that actually is sold, for example, by Bristol, offset by some of the third-party royalty obligations that exist.","And then you'll see a second line, which is the sale of bulk product to Bristol for which we've booked the cost of sales in our cost of sales as well. That sales number for the API that we produced and the cost of sales are not largely different numbers.","As you think about going forward, once we transition the product back to Lilly from Bristol, we will sell to end customers and book the full sales. We will have no longer any kind of bulk sales out to them, so the full cost of bulk will hit our cost of sales and we'll also have the finished cost of sales through third parties that Bristol currently would show on their income statement.","We'll also have additional selling, marketing and R&D expenses related to ongoing supportive brand. And then on a GAAP basis, we would also have amortization of intangible. And I'm not sure exactly which line that hits. I think it's likely going to be hitting our cost of sales line for our reported or GAAP results.","There are likely to be some other accounting-related effects that could happen essentially as we're monitoring over time and truing up the asset that has been created as well as the liability that has been created as part of the, essentially, business combination type accounting that was applied for this particular business development deal. But the major effects, I believe, are the ones I just outlined for you.","We would expect it to be accretive starting in 2016. I'm not in a position at this point in time to quantify how much. I would underscore that the basis for the deal really is value as the long-term owners for the asset [indiscernible] originally scheduled to come back to us in late 2018. We believe we're best-positioned to be the stewards of it up until that time and overall this should allow us to drive better value for the company for the life of the assets.","David Risinger","So the benefits of it coming back to you - in think you said late 2018, basically, are shifting forward to 2016?","Derica Rice","That's correct, but there is a different set of economics that will govern those two periods. Since Bristol had a larger economic right through the end or near the end of 2018, we'll have different economics between now and September of 2018. After September of 2018, both currently under the existing agreement as well as under the revised agreement once it's implemented, we have full North American rights with no trailing obligations to Bristol.","Operator","We do have a follow-up from the line of John Boris with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.","John Boris","Just on evacetrapib, just has to do mechanistically and also in your clinical plan, you're capturing high vis data. Can you maybe address the HDL elevation component and whether you're going for a slowing of the progression or reversal of the regression or reversal of the accumulation of plaque in the arteries? And then any animal model data that potentially substantiates what you're doing on the ivis side? Crestor [ph] is one of the few molecules that have been able to get - slow up the progression in their label from using [Technical Difficulty], but just your commentary on that would be helpful.","Phil Johnson","Dave, if you want to answer? And obviously, Jan, you're probably well-positioned to provide some comments as well. Dave?","Dave Ricks","Sure. And, Jan, please jump in. Of course, all along we've been saying with this program we've powered it based on the LDL impacts and what you're expecting around 30%. However, we also believe that at very high levels of HDL, reduction can impact cardiovascular risk.","And of note, at the recent cardiovascular meeting in San Diego in March, Dan Raider's lab presented some interesting data regarding cholesterol eflux with evacetrapib, which demonstrated a very substantial degree of eflux out of the plaque to the macrophage back to the liver of cholesterol.","And this is the mechanistic underpinning for believing in the type of HDL raising we're providing being additive to that cardiovascular event reduction. Off-line we can refer you to that paper, John. Jan, do you have anything else to add?","Jan Lundberg","No.","Phil Johnson","And then one follow-up then for Dave's question. My counterpart over at Bristol-Myers Squibb, John Elicher, would probably want me to point out that there will be, during this period on Erbitux, from Q4 this year through late 2018, a payment that we will be making to Bristol-Myers Squibb. I believe subsequently they'll be disclosing the amount of that payment with their SEC filing and that payment for us would show up in cost of sales.","Operator","We have no further questions in queue.","Phil Johnson","Excellent. Thank you. Derica, if you'd like to close the call?","Derica Rice","Thanks, Phil. We appreciate your participation in today's earnings call and your interest in Eli Lilly and Company. Please note that we'll host a call from ADA on Sunday evening, June 7, to provide an update on our diabetes business. And do keep an eye out for conference calls later this summer to discuss Phase III data for both ixekizumab and baricitinib.","Finally, if you have questions we did not address during today's call, please contact our IR team and they'll be happy to help.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I'd now like to turn the conference over to our host, Dr. John Lechleiter. Please go ahead.","John C. Lechleiter - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, everybody, and thanks for joining us for Eli Lilly and Company's fourth quarter 2015 earnings call. I'm John Lechleiter, Lilly's Chairman, President, and CEO. Joining me here on the call today are: Derica Rice, our Chief Financial Officer; Dr. Jan Lundberg, President of Lilly Research Laboratories; Sue Mahony, President of Lilly Oncology; Enrique Conterno, President of Lilly Diabetes; Dave Ricks, President of Lilly Bio-Medicines; Chito Zulueta, President of Emerging Markets; Jeff Simmons, President of Elanco Animal Health; and Ilissa Rassner, Brad Robling, and Phil Johnson of Lilly's IR team.","During this conference call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors, including those listed on slide 3 and those outlined in our latest Forms 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC. The information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It's not intended to be promotional and is not sufficient for prescribing decisions.","So let me begin by recapping key events since our last earnings call in October. On the commercial front, we have received approval for and launched Portrazza in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin in the United States for first-line squamous non-small-cell lung cancer.","On the regulatory front, just last week, along with Incyte, we announced FDA submission of once-daily baricitinib for the treatment of moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis. We also submitted baricitinib to the European Medicines Agency for the same indication.","Along with Boehringer Ingelheim, we received final U.S. approval for our insulin glargine product, Basaglar, with launch set for December 15 this year. We also submitted an 80-unit Basaglar pen for FDA review.","We announced that FDA accepted the filing of data from EMPA-REG OUTCOME, the Jardiance cardiovascular outcomes trial. The data were also submitted to European regulators. As you may recall, Jardiance is the only diabetes medicine to have demonstrated a significant reduction in both cardiovascular risk and cardiovascular death in a dedicated outcomes trial. And finally, we submitted the fixed-dose combination tablet containing empagliflozin and linagliptin to European regulators.","We also received FDA approval for the Humulin Regular U-500 KwikPen.","We received European Commission approval following positive CHMP [Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use] recommendations for Cyramza for both second-line non-small-cell lung cancer and second-line metastatic colorectal cancer. And Europe's CHMP issued a positive recommendation for approval of Portrazza in first-line EGFR-expressing squamous non-small-cell lung cancer.","On the clinical front, we had a number of notable developments. Along with Boehringer Ingelheim, we presented additional data from the EMPA-REG OUTCOME study. At the American Society of Nephrology, initial renal outcomes data were presented that showed empagliflozin, when used in addition to standard of care, significantly improved renal outcomes compared to standard of care alone. And we expect more comprehensive renal results to be published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal this year.","And at the American Heart Association, further data related to the reduction of heart failure and cardiovascular death were presented. And earlier this week, European Heart Journal published comprehensive heart failure results. At the World Diabetes Congress, we presented data from the AWARD-8 study showing that treatment with Trulicity plus a sulfonylurea produced greater reductions in HbA1c than treatment with a sulfonylurea alone.","Along with Incyte, we presented data at the ACR [American College of Rheumatology] meeting from the baricitinib Phase 3 rheumatoid arthritis program, including data from the RA-BEGIN study that showed baricitinib was superior to methotrexate in improving multiple measures of the signs and symptoms of RA in treatment-naive patients, and data from the RA-BEAM study that showed baricitinib was superior to adalimumab in improving multiple measures of the signs and symptoms of RA in patients who had an inadequate response to methotrexate.","At the ACR annual meeting, we presented data from the Phase 3 SPIRIT-P1 ixekizumab study showing that patients with active psoriatic arthritis treated with ixekizumab for 24 weeks achieved significant improvements in signs and symptoms of their disease when compared to placebo. They also experienced significantly less progression of radiographic structural joint damage, reduced disability when performing certain physical functions, and improved skin clearance of plaque psoriasis. Finally, we terminated the development of basal insulin peglispro.","On the business development front, we extended our agreement with Merck to evaluate Alimta in combination with Keytruda in a Phase 3 study in first-line non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer. We also announced a collaboration with Merck to evaluate our CDK-4 and CDK-6 inhibitor, abemaciclib, in combination with Keytruda in multiple tumor types. And we announced an agreement with Roche Diagnostics related to Roche's ongoing development of a commercially scalable cerebralspinal fluid assay for amyloid-beta 1-42.","In other news, we announced an expansion of our R&D facilities here in Indianapolis. We also announced that we will close our Animal Health manufacturing facility in Sligo, Ireland. Manufacturing operations and commercialization activity will conclude this quarter, with full closure targeted by year-end. As a result of this decision, the company will recognize a charge in the first quarter of approximately $100 million. In addition, we decided to exit ownership of our Animal Health manufacturing site in Dundee, Scotland.","In the fourth quarter we repurchased roughly $250 million of stock, leaving $2.95 billion remaining on our $5 billion plan. In addition, during the fourth quarter we distributed over $500 million to shareholders via our dividend. And in December we announced a 2% increase in the dividend for 2016. We remain committed to providing a robust dividend and to returning excess cash to shareholders via share repurchase.","Now I'll turn the call over to Phil for a discussion of our financial performance for the quarter. Phil?","Philip L. Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.","Thanks, John.","Before I discuss our Q4 results, it may be helpful to review key features of our presentation of GAAP results and non-GAAP measures. When interpreting our GAAP results and the growth rates versus 2014, keep in mind that 2014 does not include Novartis Animal Health, while 2015 includes the operating results of this business as well as all the costs associated with the acquisition.","For our non-GAAP measures, we now exclude amortization of intangibles. And to provide you a better idea of underlying trends in our business, we've adjusted our non-GAAP measures for 2014 to exclude the expense associated with amortization of intangibles and to include Novartis Animal Health as if we had closed the acquisition on January 1, 2014. This places 2014 on the same basis upon which we are reporting our financials this year.","Now let's look at our results for the quarter. Slide 9 provides a summary of our GAAP results. I'll focus my comments on our non-GAAP adjusted measures to provide insights into the underlying trends in our business. So please refer to today's earnings release for a detailed description of the year-on-year changes in our fourth quarter reported results.","Moving to slide 10, you can see that Q4 2015 revenue was relatively flat compared to Q4 of 2014 at just under $5.4 billion. FX continued to provide a significant top line headwind. Excluding FX, our Q4 revenue increased 5% on a non-GAAP basis, driven by higher volume for Trulicity, Cyramza, Humalog, and Trajenta, the takeback of North American rights for Erbitux, and U.S. prices.","Gross margin as a percent of revenue increased 1 percentage point to 77.3%. This increase was driven by productivity improvements from our diabetes manufacturing technical agenda, efficiencies in other manufacturing processes, and increased prices in the U.S. This quarter the gross margin percent was not affected by changes in foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold, as the benefit realized in this year's Q4 was very similar to that realized in Q4 last year. Excluding this FX effect, our gross margin percent increased by 1 percentage point, going from 74.7% in last year's quarter to 75.7% this quarter. As on prior calls, you'll find a supplementary slide providing our gross margin percent for the last 10 quarters with and without this FX effect.","Total operating expense, defined as the sum of R&D and SG&A, increased 5% compared to Q4 of 2014. Breaking this into its component parts, marketing, selling and administrative expenses declined 3%, while research and development expenses increased 19%. The reduction in marketing, selling and administrative expenses was due to the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates and continued expense control, partially offset by expenses to support recent product launches. The increase in R&D expense was driven primarily by charges associated with the termination of evacetrapib and basal insulin peglispro and by higher late-stage clinical development costs. Excluding the termination charges, R&D expense increased 8%.","Other income and expense was income of $45 million this quarter. This represents an improvement of $33 million compared to Q4 2014, primarily due to lower net interest expense. Our tax rate was 13.5%, a decrease of 2.9 percentage points compared to the same quarter last year. This decrease is primarily due to a discrete tax benefit recognized this quarter. Also, our tax rate in both periods included the full-year benefit of the extension of certain U.S. tax provisions, including the R&D tax credit.","At the bottom line, net income decreased 6% and earnings per share decreased 5%. As I'll discuss in a few moments, net income and EPS actually increased when excluding the effect of FX. And R&D termination charges mentioned earlier were also a headwind.","Slide 11 contains non-GAAP adjusted information for the full year. At a high level, you'll see that full-year revenue decreased 4%, as did operating expenses, and the gross margin percent grew substantially, leading to a double-digit EPS growth. As with the quarter, FX was a big factor on a number of line items. In a few moments I'll cover our full-year results on a performance basis excluding the effect of foreign exchange.","Slide 12 provides a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS, and you'll find additional details on these adjustments on slides 24 and 25.","Now let's take a look at the effect of price, rate, and volume on Q4 revenue growth. On slide 13 in the yellow box at the bottom of the page, you'll see the flat non-GAAP revenue I mentioned earlier. The significant strengthening of the U.S. dollar against many foreign currencies drove this decline, as you see the 6% negative effect from FX this quarter. On a performance basis, our worldwide revenue grew 5% this quarter, with price growth of 3 percentage points and volume growth of 2 percentage points.","By geography, you'll note that U.S. pharma revenue increased 14%, driven by price and to a lesser extent volume. Humalog, Trulicity, Cialis, Cyramza, and Strattera all made substantial contributions to U.S. pharma revenue growth. Having completed the takeback of North American rights for Erbitux on October 1, we also benefited from booking a full quarter's end sales of Erbitux.","The decline in EuCan revenue of 17% was primarily driven by the negative effect of foreign exchange, while on a constant currency or performance basis, EuCan revenue decreased 6%. This decrease was driven by a substantial reduction in European Cymbalta sales resulting from the loss of data-package exclusivity late in 2014. Excluding European Cymbalta, EuCan sales increased about 3.5% in constant currency terms.","In Japan, pharma revenue increased 8% in total, driven by mid-teens volume growth, while on a constant currency or performance basis, Japan revenue increased 16%. This performance growth is attributable to a number of products, chief among them Cyramza and Cymbalta.","Turning to emerging markets, we saw revenue decline 12%, driven entirely by the negative effect of FX. On a performance basis, emerging markets revenue increased 1%, or 4% when adjusting for the Brazil Humulin tender that we had in 2014 but not in 2015. Also this quarter, our pharma revenue in China increased 2%, with a volume increase of 5%, partially offset by FX.","On a non-GAAP basis, again, which adjusts 2014 as if we had completed the Novartis Animal Health acquisition on January 1 of that year, Elanco Animal Health revenue declined 11%. Excluding the negative effect of foreign exchange, Elanco revenue decreased 5%. This performance decrease was primarily driven by OUS products.","Turning to slide 14, you can see that FX trimmed full-year non-GAAP revenue growth by 7 percentage points, or nearly $1.5 billion. Excluding FX, worldwide revenue grew 4%, primarily driven by volume, with significant contributions from the U.S. and Japan.","Moving to slide 15, you'll see the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates on our Q4 and full-year 2015 results. As mentioned earlier, this quarter FX was a top line headwind, reducing revenue in U.S. dollars by over five percentage points. Excluding FX, revenue grew nearly 5.5% on a non-GAAP basis.","In performance terms, we saw slightly slower growth in cost of sales, resulting in somewhat faster growth in gross margin.","Unlike prior quarters this year, operating expenses grew a bit faster than revenue on a performance basis this quarter. Much of the OpEx increase is due to the R&D charges for the termination of evacetrapib and basal insulin peglispro. Excluding these charges, on a performance basis, non-GAAP OpEx grew about 4%, or roughly 125 basis points slower than revenue.","Excluding FX, operating income declined 2%, while slightly higher other income and a slightly lower tax rate led to non-GAAP EPS increasing 5%.","Turning to the full year, we delivered strong leverage on an operating basis. Excluding the negative effect of foreign exchange, revenue grew 4% on a non-GAAP basis, while our operating expenses were flat, and EPS increased 14%. These are outstanding results.","And with that, now let me turn the call over to Derica.","Derica W. Rice - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Global Services","Thanks, Phil.","Moving on to our pipeline update, slide 16 shows our pipeline as of January 25. Changes since our last earnings call are highlighted, with green arrows showing progression and red arrows showing movement out of the portfolio.","In terms of advancement, you'll see that necitumumab was approved by the U.S. FDA for first-line squamous non-small-cell lung cancer. Baricitinib was submitted in both the U.S. and Europe for RA, and we advanced two biologics and one small molecule into Phase 2, and three biologics began Phase 1 testing.","Since our last update, we also terminated development of basal insulin peglispro. And two Phase 2 molecules exited our portfolio, one for termination and one for out-licensing.","You may also have noticed that we provided the mechanism of action for a number of our Phase 1 assets to give you better visibility into where we are focusing our early-stage development work. The positive pipeline progress we've had over the past few years has brought a number of significant opportunities for lifecycle investments in new indications and line extensions. Going forward, we'll be including a slide like slide 17 in today's presentation that details select new indications and line extensions, or NILEX, including movement and attrition as we do for our NME pipeline. We hope this provides you and the investment community with greater visibility into the future potential of our pipeline investments.","As on prior calls, I'll recap the progress we've made on the key events we projected for 2015, briefly discuss the key events you should monitor during 2016, and then review our 2016 financial guidance.","Turning to slide 18, we're pleased with the positive progress we've made on the key events we laid out for 2015. This progress is represented by the large number of green checkmarks you see. In yellow boxes we've highlighted key events that have occurred since our last earnings call. We've already discussed many of these earlier in this call. So let me draw your attention to olaratumab, for which we've initiated our FDA rolling submission. We expect to complete the submission during the first half of the year.","Now reflecting on 2015, it was a landmark year for our innovation efforts. Among the year's achievements, I'd highlight: the reduction in CV risk, CV death, and all-cause mortality shown by Jardiance in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME study; baricitinib showing superiority to Humira and to methotrexate on many measures of the signs and symptoms of RA; and both olaratumab and abemaciclib receiving Breakthrough Therapy designation from the FDA.","Slide 19 lists key events to watch for in 2016, and we'll update this list on each of our quarterly calls to help you monitor our progress. Since I discussed this list in detail on our January 5 call, I won't go through each item again today. However, I do want to draw your attention to those key events that occurred in the past few weeks. Specifically, we began Phase 3 testing of our CGRP monoclonal antibody for migraine prevention, and we submitted baricitinib for rheumatoid arthritis in both the U.S. and Europe. In the coming months, we look forward to submitting baricitinib also to the Japanese regulators.","We are very pleased with the data generated in the baricitinib Phase 3 RA program. We believe baricitinib, if approved, could be best-in-class medicine and could help improve outcomes for patients living with RA.","Now turning to our 2016 financial guidance, we are reconfirming the non-GAAP guidance we provided just a few weeks ago on January 5. We are, however, updating our GAAP guidance to reflect the decision to close our Animal Health manufacturing facility in Sligo, Ireland. Consequently, our GAAP tax rate guidance has been raised by 50 basis points to roughly 21%, and our GAAP EPS guidance range has been lowered to a range of $2.83 to $2.93.","In summary, 2015 was a strong year, both for our underlying financial performance and for continued positive movement of our pipeline. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding FX, we drove revenue growth of 4%, with growing contributions from recently launched products. On this same basis, our focus on improving productivity resulted in flat operating expenses compared to 2014, which drove 14% EPS growth.","We have strong momentum behind our innovation-based strategy. Continued execution of this strategy should position us to drive revenue growth and expand margins throughout the balance of this decade and make major contributions to medical progress.","In 2015, we've made steady progress against our strategic objectives, driving revenue growth, expanding margins, sustaining the flow of innovation, and deploying capital to create value.","As reflected in our 2016 financial guidance and the key events on tap for the year, we expect to make continued progress against each of these goals this year as well. We entered this post-patent period in a position of strength, with launches underway and important science being done in our labs. And we are very optimistic about the opportunity before us to improve patient lives and create value for shareholders.","Now this concludes our prepared remarks. I'll now turn the call over to Phil to moderate our Q&A session. Okay, Phil.","Philip L. Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.","Thank you, Derica. And based on feedback we received on the last couple of calls, those of you who are in the Q&A queue, if you could, please limit your questions to two or a single two-part question. And we'll rapidly go through as quickly as we can the questions and hopefully exhaust the queue during the Q&A time.","So with that, Val, if you can, please provide the instructions to the callers for the Q&A session, and then we can go to the first caller, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We have a question from the line of Tim Anderson with Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Timothy Minton Anderson - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you, a couple of pipeline questions. On abemaciclib, on slide 19 you mention the Phase 2 single-arm readout underneath this category of Phase 3 readouts on the slide. I think that's the MONARCH 1 trial, Phase 2 single-arm, not likely to be a registration trial. But can you tell us how important those findings are in your opinion towards informing the future outlook for that product and how we should think about those results?","And then second question on your BACE inhibitor for Alzheimer's, still on track to make a go decision in Q2? And would it be safe to assume that a go decision is more likely than a no-go decision, or is it really still very much up in the air?","Philip L. Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.","Great. Tim, thank you for the questions and thanks for limiting them to two. I appreciate that. So, Sue, if you'd like to take the question on abemaciclib, and then, Dave, on the BACE inhibitor, please. Sue?","Susan Mahony - Senior Vice President & President, Lilly Oncology","Yes, Tim, thanks for the question. With regards to the MONARCH 1 trial, which as you say is the single-arm, single-agent abemaciclib study, we should get the data on that mid this year, final data with some interim data earlier. As you know, we've also got the two Phase 3 studies, the MONARCH 2 and MONARCH 3 as well that are in combinations, and we should get that data next year with potential interims this year. We do believe that the single-agent data is an important part. It's not the whole, of course. We'll be interested in seeing all of the data in breast as well as our lung trial, which is ongoing. But this is specifically looking at abemaciclib as a single-agent. We've seen robust single-agent activity in our early-phase data, our Phase 1 data that we presented previously. And clearly, if we replicate that, we think that this could differentiate this product from an efficacy perspective. So we're excited to see the data, and we would hope that we would be able to present that data at a scientific meeting this year.","Philip L. Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.","Great. Thanks, Sue. Dave?","David A. Ricks - President-Bio Medicines & Senior Vice President","Yes, Tim. On the BACE inhibitor, I think it would be just pure speculation to guess on what the outcome of the interim safety readout is. Again, we're blinded to those events, and safety is a difficult thing to predict. This class has had some issues, although some molecules go forward, so we're hopeful. But one thing I can assure you is we will have an announcement in Q2. I think we have enough patients enrolled in the study, and we're looking for exposures to get to that trigger to expand to a Phase 3 for the AMARANTH study.","Philip L. Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.","Thank you, Dave, and then just one thing, Tim, to keep in mind. During 2015 we did get two different of our oncology drugs granted Breakthrough designation. One of those is olaratumab. The other, in fact, was abemaciclib, and that was based on the Phase 1b study that was largely monotherapy study. So again, the Phase 3 program should serve as the basis for registration. And if we do get very strong results in the Phase 2 study, as we said before, we absolutely would discuss those with the regulators and believe they would be interested in seeing those data. Val, if we can, go to the next caller, please.","Operator","Thank you. We have a question from the line of Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. I'm going to make this two questions. On Jardiance sales, which I believe also included Glyxambi, sales were $15 million this quarter, actually I think a step down from the previous quarter, $60 million for the year. I'm just surprised that we haven't seen \u2013 certainly I would have expected to see some sequential improvement just given all the positive publicity. And while I understand that the label does not yet include the data from EMPA-REG, I'm just wondering what you guys are seeing out there. Are physicians looking at EMPA-REG as a class effect? Could it be that the SGLT-2 is facing class action lawsuits related to side effects? If you could, just talk about what's going on there because I'm surprised that we haven't seen a bigger pickup.","And then just secondly, in terms of the label that you expect to get from the FDA, what are the scenarios that you see? What is a base case scenario? What is the best case scenario? And what do you think we need to see to drive numbers to reach consensus numbers by 2020? Thanks very much.","Philip L. Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.","Great. Thank you, Jami. Enrique, those are right up your alley.","Enrique A. Conterno - Senior Vice President & President, Lilly Diabetes","Very good. So, Jami, you are absolutely right. Our U.S. Jardiance revenue is not consistent with the sequential TRx growth that we're basically observing for the overall franchise, with just basically 30%. I had mentioned that before we disclosed the top line results for EMPA-REG OUTCOME. The franchise was capturing about 15% of the new patients in the SGLT-2 class. Right now, that is the franchise. As we look at the latest weeks, it's capturing over 26% of the new patients. The reason of the lack of consistency, we had a one-time adjustment due to changes in assumptions when it comes to the accrual for the inventory that we have in the channel. Without that accrual, you would have seen revenue growth or sequential revenue growth consistent with the TRx growth.","Now as it relates to when do we expect the new label, clearly we have now shared that the FDA has designated this to be a standard review, which basically means that we would be launching in the second half of this year. I'm not in a position to speculate in terms of what the label would read like. But we clearly are bullish on our data, the consistency and the strength of the data. And we do believe that this is going to have, when the FDA takes action, this will have a very significant impact on the overall trend of Jardiance and the class in general.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And just can I ask a follow-up? What are you hearing from physicians in terms of interpreting this data as a class effect or applying just to Jardiance? And is this class action lawsuit something we need to be paying attention to? We've seen these class action lawsuits having impacts on other categories of drugs. So I'm just curious about that. Thanks.","Enrique A. Conterno - Senior Vice President & President, Lilly Diabetes","We are not promoting the new label, so it's difficult to say what the reaction from the broad physician population would be. But we do conduct some targeted market research. And it is pretty clear to us I think based on the research that we basically have that about half of the physicians believe that this has been proved to be a class effect. Let's keep in mind, there's no evidence of that. And half believe that this might be a Jardiance type of effect. So I think the jury is clearly out for the other products, but we do have the evidence for Jardiance. And we think that is going make a huge difference when we basically have the label.","We are seeing actually strength in the overall class. So I would say that probably the biggest event that we saw impacting the overall growth of the class was some of the warnings when it comes to diabetes ketoacidosis. So we saw stabilization somewhere in September \u2013 October when the EMPA-REG OUTCOME data came out. And now we're basically seeing class growth. So I do not believe in any way that \u2013 my bullishness in the overall growth of the class continues to be very, very high.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you very much.","Philip L. Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.","One real quick comment. So in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME study as well, the incidence of diabetic ketoacidosis was very low and was actually consistent across the arms as well, so I think another data point to add to the discussion for that particular potential side effect. Val, if we can go to the next caller, please.","Operator","Thank you. We have a question from the line of Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Christopher Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great, thanks for the questions, just two here. First, maybe a question for John, just updated thoughts on the M&A landscape. I guess specifically, do you see this market volatility as creating some opportunities for Lilly to get more aggressive and look at some assets? And just what's the focus when we think about business development?","My second question was on the BACE inhibitors. And just elaborate a little bit more about how you think about the tradeoff of I guess time to market versus the level of BACE inhibition and dosing when you look at prioritizing the Astra BACE versus the internal low-dose BACE that you have as well. Thanks very much.","Philip L. Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.","Great, Chris. Thank you for the questions. John, you for the M&A. And then, Dave, do you want to take the BACE question, please? John?","John C. Lechleiter - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Chris, I think the current volatility and generally lower valuations in the biotech sector doesn't change our basic strategy. We continue to look for small to midsized opportunities that complement the therapeutic areas that we're already in that we know well, so I don't think that has changed. We're certainly not interested in any large-scale M&A.","At the same time, there's no question that valuations are more attractive today. There are some different dynamics going on. As you know, biotech is not biotech. There's big biotech. There's medium size, and there's nascent or smaller. And so we're looking across that whole spectrum. And if opportunity presents itself based on attractive valuation and what we think would represent good value for the company, we have the wherewithal to move on that.","Philip L. Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.","Great. Dave, on the BACE?","David A. Ricks - President-Bio Medicines & Senior Vice President","Yeah, so I think your question is how are we thinking about the two programs and decision-making. I think you were there on December 8, Chris, and we spoke about the theoretical differences in the projects. We do know that the AZ BACE and the Lilly BACE that's in the clinic have different chemistry. We really like this target because it's rare to find a genetic validation like this in any disease, let alone Alzheimer's, which has so much unmet need. And so we're investing in two different ways to get there.","At the end of the day, the decision-making, though, is going to have to be based on empirical data, because the theoretical differences need to play out in man. So we're collecting those data. A part of that is the AMARANTH Phase 2 program we're running now and the Phase 1 effort on our own BACE. And we'll have to see the data before we make a final determination.","Philip L. Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.","Great, thank you, Dave. Val, next caller, please.","Operator","And we have a question from the line of Tony Butler with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.","Charles Anthony Butler - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Yes, thanks very much, two questions again on Jardiance. J&J made comments about changes in the ADA guidelines to include the class. And I know you've spoken in the past about changes in guidelines as I guess it relates to medical treatment guidelines overall. So I wondered if you could separate the two and how meaningful one may be over the other.","And then separately on the nephrology data that we will get more readouts later, is that package included in the CV outcomes data set, or would it be potentially something that is added after regulatory action on the CV outcomes data set for EMPA-REG? Thanks very much.","Philip L. Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.","Great, Tony. Thanks for the questions. Enrique, so the two questions will be on the ADA guidelines, are there guidelines for Jardiance, and the second one is if the nephrology data that we alluded to that was presented in 2015 was part of the submission of the EMPA-REG OUTCOME data.","Enrique A. Conterno - Senior Vice President & President, Lilly Diabetes","So let me start with your second question first. Clearly as part of our submission, we really focused on the CV outcomes. We will be disclosing the outcomes that we saw when it comes to renal outcomes in the very near future. There is a publication that we're targeting. We think that the results are also very impressive, so we look forward for the possibilities that that may give us when it comes to the future.","As far as guidelines, and I really cannot comment on other companies' statements. But what I can basically say is that we today do not see any significant changes in the treatment guidelines for Type 2 diabetes coming from any of the major societies or associations, whether it's ADA or EASD. Clearly, the AACE [American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists] issued new guidelines, but they really did not fully incorporate the EMPA-REG OUTCOME data as they were looking at those guidelines \u2013 and this package of those \u2013 some of those guidelines in early January. I am pretty confident that the different societies will have a thorough review of the different treatment guidelines. And I expect, as I have mentioned before, that that will happen once we basically have a label change in the U.S. market or in Europe.","Philip L. Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.","Thanks, Enrique. Val, next caller, please.","Operator","And we have a question from the line of Steve Scala with Cowen. Please go ahead.","Stephen M. Scala - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you. I have two questions. First, Novartis said yesterday that when comparing Cosentyx to ixekizumab, ixekizumab has higher rates of immunogenicity, more injection site reactions, and only one or two indications upon approval versus their three. I'm just wondering what Lilly's rebuttal to Novartis would be.","And then secondly, Novartis also said yesterday that its Phase 3 study of ribociclib is quite likely to stop early based on modeling the company has done versus palbociclib. I imagine Lilly has done similar modeling. So I'm wondering, is Lilly willing to say that there's a good chance that MONARCH 1 stops in the first half of this year when you take the interim look? Thank you.","Philip L. Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.","Steve, thanks for the questions. Dave, if you'll take the first one, please, on some of the Novartis comments around Cosentyx and ixekizumab; and then, Sue, on the ribociclib question.","David A. Ricks - President-Bio Medicines & Senior Vice President","Sure. As you know, we're in the final stages of regulatory review on ixekizumab and preparing for launch later this year. I'm not surprised to hear what they said on their call, Steve, but I think we can only say for certain that the third one might be true. Clearly, we will launch with psoriasis first. And we're pursuing psoriatic arthritis, as was mentioned on this call, as well as ankylosing spondylitis. Those indications will come later.","That said, I think there's really no direct comparisons between the molecules on immunogenicity. And if you study this issue, you'd learn that the assay cut points, which are proprietary to each molecule, there's really no standard for setting those. So there's no basis to compare products within a class or even outside the classes on immunogenicity. I think the most important thing is at the end of the long-term studies, how many patients develop neutralizing antibodies to the medicine. And in the case of ixekizumab, that number is around 1% after one year, which is very low relative to other immuno-therapies for conditions like psoriasis.","As it relates to injection site reactions, you have a similar comparison problem. There were reported injection site reactions. It was one of the most frequent issues in our studies, but they were mostly mild, they were transient, and we have good data that shows after the second and third injection those rates drop significantly. It's important to note that ixekizumab also has far fewer injections than Cosentyx in an annual dosing regimen, so fewer opportunities to get that kind of reaction. So we're confident about our posture as we go to market. We feel good about our data, and the primary basis for that statement is the efficacy we see with ixekizumab, which we see as breakthrough and best in class.","Philip L. Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.","Thanks, Dave. Sue?","Susan Mahony - Senior Vice President & President, Lilly Oncology","Yeah, with regard to abemaciclib, we will see the data on MONARCH 1 by mid this year, the final data, with interim data earlier. Again, that is the single-agent data. That, as we mentioned earlier, is the data that we got Breakthrough Therapy on. And depending on what that data looks like, we will go to regulatory authorities. The other two studies are the combination studies, and I think they're more comparable. We will have \u2013 or we plan to have final data on those studies next year, but we do have interims. They're high-bar interims. And clearly depending on what we see there, we'll take action accordingly.","I think it's key to note, as we see things, single-agent activity is important. We have not seen that kind of robust single-agent activity with other CDK 4\/6 inhibitors. We believe that is due to the relative contribution between the activity against CDK 4 and CDK 6. The other thing is the continuous dosing. These are cell cycle inhibitors, and so you would hope that you would be able to continuously dose these. And we have seen that we are able to continuously dose this agent. So again, that's where we will see \u2013 we believe could potentially differentiate this from the other two CDK 4\/6 inhibitors going forward.","Philip L. Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.","Great. Thank you, Sue. Val, next caller, please.","Operator","Thank you. We have a question from the line of Mark Schoenebaum with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I was just wondering. if Donald Trump is elected, would that impact your long-term margin guidance, Derica? That's not a serious question. But I've enjoyed John's comments about biotech valuations. And Chris already got your thoughts on that, John, but I've also enjoyed following your comments over time on the drug pricing debate. I think on the last call, you said that the industry was preparing to begin to defend itself, and I'd just be curious to know if that effort has happened yet and how you see this playing out. What do you think will actually happen over the next call it two to four years, if anything?","And then more of a housekeeping question; on Forteo, I'd love to know what your longer-term outlook on Forteo is given the dynamics in that market, assuming Amgen's sclerostin antibody launches in a year or so and the Radius's PTH-based analog launches. Should we be thinking about this as a declining asset, or are you confident you can hang on to it? And is this still an area of strategic interest for Lilly, or is this something that's more secondary? Thank you.","Philip L. Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.","Great, Mark. Thanks for the questions. So, John, on to you about the industry's actions on the pricing front and how you see this playing out in the next few years. And then, Dave, if you'd like to take the question on Forteo, please. John?","John C. Lechleiter - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay, Mark. Thanks for your question. I think yes, M&A from within our major trade organizations, so this would be pharma and bio, there have been, certainly since the last time we discussed this, I think a number of initiatives aimed at putting prices in perspective and then also providing the kind of information that policymakers and key advocacy groups need to have, we believe, to make sure that this debate remains balanced, and that this industry, which we all hope in the future can provide cures for things like Alzheimer's, cancer, and other diseases, remains strong and viable in this country.","I think that when you look at it from that aspect, the old saying goes, facts are stubborn things. I think when you look at the comparison year that in many cases is being used as ammunition in this debate, 2014, as all of you know, was a breakout year in terms of pricing, driven by the launch of the hep C drugs, which in some cases cure up to 90% of the people that take those medicines, and the warehousing and in other words the inventory of patients waiting to receive those medicines. If you go back and look at 2009 to 2013, these are not Lilly's numbers. This data is from CMS, that the overall price of drugs, retail and non-retail, the price increases in that period lagged significantly overall healthcare inflation. We felt the pain, obviously, by the fact that we lost patents on four of our biggest products during that period. CMS projections out to 2024 show that, based on everything we know and everything they can see, that the rate of increase in drug prices is going to fall roughly within the same line as the rate of increases in overall healthcare. So yes, I think that's one side of the equation.","The second side of the equation is the consumer aspect. It's great to talk facts and figures with policymakers. But if they're hearing from consumers that they got walloped with a huge copay or that they're not able to access medicines they need, obviously we're sympathetic and empathetic to that and tuned into that with various patient assistance programs, copay assistance, et cetera, but also I think a continuing push to ensure that everybody in this country has access to quality insurance. Medicines, after all, help prevent disease in many cases or treat disease and avoid higher downstream costs. This is well documented. I think we've got to keep that in perspective as well.","In terms of what we can expect after the election, anybody that thinks they can predict the nomination, much less the election right now, I'd love to talk to them. But I think this is going to continue to be an issue or it's going continue to be on the radar screen because of demographics. And to some extent, as people get older, they're going to be more and more reliant on our medicines. I think we've got to continue to demonstrate that there's value in the medicines we bring. Yes, they can be expensive, but disease is a lot more expensive, and emphasize the fact that low-cost generics, which account for over four out of five prescriptions today, represent ultimately the legacy of these investment efforts on our part and provide the American consumer with tremendous value. So I think you can assume the industry is going to continue to maintain an active dialogue with each of the candidates and to work across party lines to make sure that the views that ultimately translate into policy \u2013 and that's what we've really got be focused on \u2013 remain balanced and factual over time.","So I don't think there's \u2013 while I think we are and should be concerned about the rhetoric, I think the facts of the underlying story remain very strong. And I think in surveys of consumers that we've done, I think the interest is just as keen in what we can do to prevent or slow down the progression of diseases like Alzheimer's, how we gain more incremental \u2013 incrementally take more steps in treating and curing cancer. And even with diabetes, what can we do there to go from in essence slowing down the progression of the disease today to perhaps someday abating the complications altogether? Clearly, we're working on all of those things, and I think that's what people expect us \u2013 the research-based industry to do. And we've got to distinguish the research-based industry from other aspects of this price debate.","Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI","Thanks, John.","Philip L. Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.","Dave?","David A. Ricks - President-Bio Medicines & Senior Vice President","Sure. Mark, thanks for the question on Forteo, not one we always get here, but Forteo has been a great product for the company. We launched it more than 13 years ago. We're still growing this product really in every geography in the world. Notably in Asia now, we're in double-digit growth in both emerging markets and Japan, and in performance terms 5% last quarter.","As we look ahead, I would say three things. First, this is a disease that has tremendous under-treatment. So today in the U.S., if you have a fracture, an osteoporotic fracture, less than one in ten women receive an anabolic therapy, which is really a problem. So there's a lot of room for new voices and new mechanisms to improve treatment for severe osteoporosis.","I think sclerostins as a target is a great target. We have our own asset in the space, although moved back to Phase 1 as we look for an acceptable commercial formulation. Risk\/benefit has to be borne out in the larger trials, and we'll look forward to seeing that from the competitive program. But I think there's room for more than one mechanism to build bone in people who suffer from severe osteoporosis, and frankly the patients probably need choices.","That all said, as we think about our midterm, Mark, it's important to note that, as I'm sure you've already researched, the IP on Forteo in the U.S. and in other major markets really begins to expire at the end of this decade. So although we would expect continued good performance through the end of the decade, around 2019 \u2013 2020 we would expect to see some form of biosimilar or generic competition, depending on the geography we're talking about.","Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI","Thank you.","Philip L. Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.","You're welcome. Val, could we have the next caller, please?","Operator","Thank you. We have a question from Andrew Baum with Citi. Please go ahead.","Andrew S. Baum - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","Thank you, a couple of questions, please. So first to Sue, you indicated that you would like to discuss if positive the Phase 2 abemaciclib data. What confuses me is how the FDA could grant accelerated approval given this trial excludes patients who have had prior exposure to palbo [palbociclib]. Perhaps you can help me understand that.","And then second for Enrique, a trial of Jardiance in non-diabetic heart failure patients, should we expect Lilly to initiate such a trial this year? And when is the earliest you could expect that data within that indication? Thank you.","Philip L. Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.","Great, Andrew. Thanks for the questions. First, Sue, if you would, and then we'll go to Enrique for the Jardiance question.","Susan Mahony - Senior Vice President & President, Lilly Oncology","Yes. Clearly, we first we need to get the data, and then we need to decide whether we go to the FDA with regards to that data. As usual, the trial was agreed with the FDA previously. And although we have seen an uptake on palbo, not all patients are getting palbo. And a lot of these patients are actually pretreated with several different agents. I think it's five to seven or five-plus. So I think it's important that it's a specific group of patients where there really is a high unmet need. And if we see good data in that patient group, we feel good that not only would it show single-agent activity and we confirm the Phase 1 data where we saw robust single-agent activity, but it also would meet a very important need for these patients.","Philip L. Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.","Great. Thanks, Sue. Enrique?","Enrique A. Conterno - Senior Vice President & President, Lilly Diabetes","Clearly, the data for empagliflozin when it comes to heart failure from the EMPA-REG OUTCOME study was very impressive. There's not much that I can share now other than just to say that you can imagine that we are actively exploring and thinking about this very important opportunity for the brand.","Philip L. Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.","Great. Thank you, Enrique. Val, could we have the next caller, please?","Operator","We have a question from the line of Gregg Gilbert with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. First on CGRP, can you give us some more color on the trial design and the patient population and timeline? And then can you also provide some more detail on what you will explore with the Keytruda and abema [abemaciclib] program? And if you can't give us specifics, can you at least talk about where the scientific rationale is most compelling and when we might get some tangible evidence that you're barking up the right tree or not with that combination? Thanks.","Philip L. Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.","Great, Gregg. Thanks for the questions. Dave, do you want to talk about CGRP? Jan, feel free to chime in if you'd like as well. And then we'll have maybe Sue take a shot at the second question on the Keytruda-abemaciclib trial.","David A. Ricks - President-Bio Medicines & Senior Vice President","Great. Thanks, Gregg. We've initiated now the Phase 3 program for the acute and the chronic migraine \u2013 episodic and chronic migraine patients. This is really not two diseases; it's one disease. There's a cut point in the way these get classified in terms of frequency of headache. I think that's similar to what other people are doing.","It's important you note we actually are carrying two doses into the Phase 3 program because we think optimizing efficacy and dosing convenience in a preventative setting like this will be critical. We like our chances in doing that but want to make sure we have the optimal dose frequency and concentration to get the maximal efficacy. Those studies are enrolling now, and we expect data before the end of 2017. These are not long studies to study this condition.","The only other reminder I'd throw out there is we do also have a cluster headache program, which is both episodic and chronic cluster, and that is also enrolling. We do expect data in the chronic cluster setting this year, as was indicated by Derica on the key events slide. And that will be the first Phase 3 information we have on CGRP.","Philip L. Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.","Great. Thanks, Dave. Anything you wanted to add, Jan?","Jan M. Lundberg - Executive Vice President, Science and Technology","No.","Philip L. Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.","Okay. Sue?","Susan Mahony - Senior Vice President & President, Lilly Oncology","As you know, we are doing a number of studies looking at combinations across our internal pipeline of marketed products with immuno-oncology agents. We believe that combination therapies are going to be important, specifically in three areas, in cell signaling, in the micro environment, and also in I-O.","If we're looking at the abema study, that's Phase 1 data. Clearly, we're looking at early safety data and potentially efficacy, but mainly early safety data, with looking at the I-O agents for immune clearing of cells. And abema induces senescence, whether the combination of those would have a beneficial effect.","Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","(57:33)?","Susan Mahony - Senior Vice President & President, Lilly Oncology","It's across tumors.","Philip L. Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.","And we had the press release that went out last year in December that Dave had talked about. It would be likely to progress to Phase 2; that that would be in patients with metastatic breast cancer or non-small-cell lung cancer. In terms of timing, enrollment begins early 2016. So certainly, I don't think you'd be expecting to see data this year. That would be into the future, and we'll have a better feel for that as we see how enrollment accrues in the trial.","Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks.","Philip L. Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.","Sure. Val, next caller, please.","Operator","We have a question from the line of Marc Goodman with UBS. Please go ahead.","Marc Goodman - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning. First, can you give us any more color on the three products that achieved the Phase 2 milestones? And then second, just two products, one, Alimta weakness and Humalog strength in the quarter. Can you give us some color on that? Thanks.","Philip L. Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.","Great, Marc. Thanks for the questions. Jan, if you'd like to talk through the Phase 2 entrants, and then Sue to talk about Alimta in the U.S., and Enrique, Humalog, please. Jan?","Jan M. Lundberg - Executive Vice President, Science and Technology","Okay. So let us start with the IL-23 monoclonal antibody for ulcerative colitis. The whole area of IL-17\/IL-23 pathways clearly has strong interest for Lilly with our ixekizumab data in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. And we believe that IL-23 specifically then could be very useful in inflammatory bowel disease based on human genetic data and also some competitor molecule data that are emerging. So we see these as very complementary to our IL-17 activities.","The BMP-6 antibody in anemia is a new target. Actually, the name is bone morphogenetic protein 6. And it's really an evolving area in our strategy to look at how can we influence and treat diabetic complications, and in this particular case then the anemia in patients with diabetic kidney disease in the advanced stage. This anemia is iron restricted and hepcidin related, and it's very common in dialysis patients. And the goal here is to potentially replace or reduce the need then for erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, which you know have some concerns with CV side effects. We have seen some promising data in Phase 1 on the iron sequestration and are now looking then for effects on hemoglobin. The third one is an oral agent, and that is p70S6\/AKT, which is tested in some cancer indications, a cell-signaling inhibitor.","Philip L. Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.","Great, thank you. Sue, on Alimta in the U.S.?","Susan Mahony - Senior Vice President & President, Lilly Oncology","Yes, we did see some competitive pressure on Alimta in Q4. As we mentioned before, Alimta is standard of care in the non-squamous setting. And with the new agents that are launching, particularly in the second-line setting, clearly we've got two immuno-oncology agents now. We've got Cyramza. We've also got the EGFR third-generation TKIs. And we are seeing significant competitive activity in the second-line setting. And we do have \u2013 and we're seeing therefore an impact on Alimta in that setting and also in some of the later lines where we're not promoting.","Our focus continues to be to secure Alimta's first-line use and continuation maintenance use. That's where we'll continue to focus our efforts. We also believe that we've got actually a very nice offering to thoracic physicians across the thoracic portfolio now in the first-line setting. In the non-squamous we've got Alimta. In the squamous we've now got Portrazza with our launch just now, just recently, and of course with Cyramza across the second-line in both histologies. So our focus with our dedicated sales force now in the U.S. focused on thoracic will be to ensure that we continue to establish and secure Alimta's use in the first-line of continuation agents.","Philip L. Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.","Great. Thanks, Sue. Enrique, on Humalog in the U.S.?","Enrique A. Conterno - Senior Vice President & President, Lilly Diabetes","Yes, so we are very pleased with the performance of Humalog on a global basis. The product grew 15% in local currency in Q4. I think this is remarkable given all of the new launches that we basically have ongoing, so we are very pleased. We are gaining share in most key geographies. A key driver for that is the launch of our Humalog U-200 KwikPen, which is basically adding growth to this important brand for us.","When we look specifically at the U.S., which grew 20% for the quarter, we have to keep in mind that we had a negative adjustment in Q4 of last year, so this is an easier comparison. That adjustment was about 10 points. So if we were to take that out, I think \u2013 or maybe a better way of saying it, it's probably better to look at the entire year as a better reflection of the overall growth for the product in the U.S. market.","Philip L. Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.","And that would have been about 9% growth for the full year. Val, if we can go to the next caller, please?","Operator","Thank you. We have a question from the line of Seamus Fernandez with Leerink. Please go ahead.","Seamus Fernandez - Leerink Partners LLC","Thanks very much, just a couple of quick questions for Sue. Sue, can you just give us a reference point for what would be a potential comparator to the abemaciclib MONARCH 1 study data? So as I look at it, maybe eribulin might fit into that mix, but I think it will be helpful to know what the baseline performance of other agents is in this patient population.","And then separately, can you just update us on timing for your TGF antibody and when perhaps we might see data for that combination? We're starting to hear a little bit of interest building for that program. Thanks.","Susan Mahony - Senior Vice President & President, Lilly Oncology","Yeah, sure. With regards to \u2013 let me take the second one first. With regards to the TGF beta, we have a number of studies ongoing in Phase 2 as well as combination studies with I-O agents, and we should be seeing data on those probably this year and next year.","With regards to abemaciclib, again, from a single-agent activity, if you want to look at a comparator, you probably should be looking around eribulin. I think the key thing around that as well is to look at the other single-agent activity across the other CDKs.","Philip L. Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.","Thank you, Sue. Val, if we can go to the next caller, please.","Operator","Yeah. We have a question from Colin Bristow with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Colin N. Bristow - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, good morning and thanks for taking the questions. So a couple of quick ones. On baricitinib, when do you expect to make and communicate the Phase 3 progression decisions for the diabetic nephropathy indication? And what's your current thinking on the potential there?","And then a follow-up on ixekizumab, with the upcoming potential approval, can you comment on where you are in terms of launch preparations and give us some color on your expectations for launch performance in 2016? Thanks.","Philip L. Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.","Thanks for the questions. Dave?","David A. Ricks - President-Bio Medicines & Senior Vice President","Sure, yes. As you know, we have a number of interesting Phase 2 initiatives to explore future indications for baricitinib. I would say there's a high priority for the company to work through those and make lifecycle decisions this year on baricitinib. Diabetic nephropathy is one of them. The data look strong, as presented last year at the American Diabetes Association, but I would point out two things that I think are things weighing on our minds.","One is the way in which these studies are conducted under the current regulatory guidance is not the simplest path to market. The studies can be long. Patient selection can be difficult, and recruitment rates historically in the industry are very low for these studies, or slow, I should say. And we need to then balance what looks like strong clinical data against other opportunities we have right now with the molecule in psoriasis. We have data in \u2013 we're studying in atopic dermatitis. We're looking at several other more immunology indications, so to be determined. I would expect, Colin, through the year, we'll exit the year with lots of clarity on the path to Phase 3 for baricitinib NILEX or line extensions.","Ixekizumab, I think we're in great shape. We're anticipating approval in the world's major markets, Japan, U.S., and Europe, in this calendar year. We are prepared to rapidly or immediately after approval commercialize the product. We think we've got a great value proposition for payers. We've got a compelling efficacy for patients, and the KOLs I talked to are highly interested in the class and in ixekizumab. And we see actually the class leader doing extremely well I think relative to our expectations. I think it bodes very well for ixekizumab.","Philip L. Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.","Great. Thank you, Dave.","Colin N. Bristow - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Philip L. Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.","Thanks, Colin. Val, if we can have the next caller, please?","Operator","We have a question from the line of David Risinger with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yes, thanks very much. I have two questions. First, with respect to biosimilar Lantus, could you just discuss the pricing and the adoption ramp that you expect ex-U.S.? Basically, how aggressively are you competing with that to enhance your diabetes franchise commercially?","And then second, with respect to the sclerostin, could you please discuss the bone-building risks in the skull that some experts have highlighted as risks to watch and your views on them? Thank you.","Philip L. Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.","Great, Dave. Thank you for the questions. So, Enrique, if you could handle the question for ex-U.S. biosimilar Lantus. And then, Jan, if you'd like to talk about the sclerostin risk that was mentioned. Enrique?","Enrique A. Conterno - Senior Vice President & President, Lilly Diabetes","Sure. So we don't share our future expectations for our products or forecasts, but we do know what some of the pricing is in the different markets. They're public, at least the listed prices. In general, we see our biosimilar, Basaglar, our biosimilar for Lantus, Basaglar, is 10% to 20% below Lantus. It's difficult to say because there are sometimes rebates that are given that are not public, what the exact price difference might be. But what I can share is that we're pleased with our performance. Each country has its own dynamics. And we basically need to see how this all is going to unfold. We expect this is going to be an important product for us and clearly complements our overall diabetes portfolio.","Philip L. Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.","Great. Thank you, Enrique. Jan?","Jan M. Lundberg - Executive Vice President, Science and Technology","Yeah. Well, as you know, sclerostin is actually a target that has some human validation. And yes, there is a very large and heavy skull that people have then if they have a sclerostin mutation then from start of life. In the treatment setting, clearly the ambitions are to treat the patients that haven't really had these genetic defects. So the likelihood of similar issues I think are clearly much smaller. And you have to watch though for potential changes in foramina carrying then important nerves and arteries and so on to the head, and also potentially middle ear bones which could potentially change hearing. But what we have seen in our studies with our sclerostin antibody has not involved changes then in skull bones and so on that has had any clinical impact. Clearly, we need more long-term data to see is there a risk or not.","Philip L. Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.","Great. Thank you, Jan. Val, next caller, please.","David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Philip L. Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.","You're very welcome, David.","Operator","Thank you. We have a question from the line of Vamil Divan with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Vamil K. Divan - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Great, thanks so much. Maybe if I could just touch on two areas that haven't really come up in the Q&A yet. One is emerging markets and the other one Animal Health. So emerging markets, just curious for your updated thoughts there. You had 1% constant currency growth, I believe, this quarter. Just how do you see the potential for the markets overall? And has your desire or your intention to invest in these markets changed in any way given some of the volatility we've seen over the last several months?","And on Animal Health, I think it was a 5% decline at constant currency this quarter, just maybe a little more color. You mentioned I think it was more on the ex-U.S. products, but maybe a little more color on what exactly drove that. And are you still comfortable with the guidance you provided back in December of seeing greater organic growth as we move through this year and getting above the industry growth levels starting next year? Thanks.","Philip L. Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.","Great, Vamil. Thank you for the questions. Chito, to you for the emerging markets question. And then, Jeff, we'll have you obviously talk about the Animal Health dynamics. Chito?","Alfonso G. Zulueta - Senior Vice President & President-Emerging Markets","Sure. First on the economies for the emerging markets, there aren't many, as everybody knows, bright spots starting last year, except perhaps from Mexico given its proximity to the U.S. And as the economies go, so does the healthcare sector in many of the markets. So we've had a very, very tough year even on a constant exchange rate for many of our markets, and I think we see that for the next 18 months.","Clearly, the one that has had significant decline over the previous years has been China. The prognosis is we will continue to see about a 4% to 5% market growth in China, which is what we had in 2015, and that'll continue perhaps in 2016. Now that growth could be worse depending on how the Chinese government really implements their whole pricing policies that have been pretty strong and pretty robust in terms of trying to drive prices primarily for off-patent products.","And so for us, it's critical that we focus on brands that have significant growth opportunities. I think there was a question earlier on Forteo. We see Forteo, we're very bullish about Forteo in emerging markets. We grew mid-teens in 2015. We expect to accelerate that growth further. China grew 60% on Forteo. So we're very bullish, and I think there's tremendous opportunity for growth in Forteo for our business. And so we continue to invest heavily in that brand.","Humalog grew 15% last year for us in the emerging markets. We expect to accelerate that growth really across the emerging markets. And then of course, you've got the rest of the diabetes portfolio. Trajenta, Jardiance should do very well as well.","Now we are pressured clearly with the products that have lost exclusivity, and we've had a number of those patent losses in our key markets, primarily Alimta, and then recently the rest of our neuroscience portfolio. So for us, the key is to focus on our growth brands. We need to make sure we are efficient with the resources that we've had and drive our growth agenda and using digital channels and other channels to drive better efficiencies and be more effective in the use of our resources.","Philip L. Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.","Great. Thanks, Chito. Jeff?","Jeffrey N. Simmons - Senior Vice President and President, Elanco Animal Health","Yes. Vamil, relative to the Animal Health business, yes, the majority of the decline came from international markets. It also was isolated to companion animals, very consistent with our last few quarters. We've seen this from increased competition with new entries in the companion animal parasiticide market as well as some distractions as we're still integrating in a couple key European markets. So those were the key drivers. I would note, though, that our U.S. companion animal business grew in the quarter. This was due to launch of a couple key new innovations, Osurnia for otitis in dogs as well as Interceptor Plus for heartworm.","So as we look at returning to growth, we've said clearly in Boston at our investor conference in December, we do anticipate to return to growth in 2016 before the impact of FX. We do see some of the continuation of these trends from 2015 in the first half of 2016, and we'll return to growth at industry levels in the second half. I would note that when including the impact of FX, which will be more significant to Elanco, we anticipate 2016 revenues will be roughly flat versus 2015.","I think key drivers that I want to note that will return us to growth and give us a lot of confidence in our long-term future is the successful launch of new innovations. As we noted, we have seven significant innovations that will launch this year and into 2017. We're starting to see the impact of those already, with three approvals and launches already. And then I think the other is our key growth engines, areas such as key emerging geographies, companion animal therapeutics, vaccines, enzymes, et cetera. So those will be the drivers to our launch.","And then I think lastly, I'll just say that our excitement on the Novartis deal continues. We do see at a minimum the $300 million, not $200 million, but we changed our guidance there to $300 million of savings. And we saw this with our margins in Q4 go up to 19% from starting the year at 15%. And we see that moving to low to mid-20% EBIT by the end of 2016. So this gives us a lot of confidence about the strategic elements of Novartis that are really playing out in the market.","Philip L. Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.","Great. Thanks, Jeff. Thanks, Vamil. Val, if we can, go to the next caller, please.","Operator","Thank you. We have a question from Alex Arfaei with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Alex Arfaei - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Good morning, folks. Thank you for taking the questions. First on the recent arrangement with Roche Diagnostics for the commercial beta amyloid test in Alzheimer's disease, I'm curious about the timing. What led you to form this partnership now?","And the second question is on Cyramza. It was below expectations, particularly in the U.S. I'm wondering if that's a function of PD-1 competition in lung cancer. Or is something going on in gastric cancer? Thank you.","Philip L. Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.","Alex, thanks for the questions. Jan and Dave, if you'd like to respond to the Roche deal that was announced and timing for that and our interest in that; and then Sue, the Cyramza question, please.","David A. Ricks - President-Bio Medicines & Senior Vice President","Sure. I'll start on the Roche. Jan, you can jump in. Yesterday we announced a collaboration with Roche Diagnostics, which allows the two of us to see a way for that technology to get to the marketplace. This is a methodology that runs on the Roche standard diagnostic kit, which is pretty well established around the world to measure a beta in CSF of patients in a standardized way.","As we outlined at our Alzheimer's day on December 8, if we move to the mode of saying if sola [solanezumab] is successful, we do see a number of challenges in early adoption and in treatment of patients. One of them will be the detection of amyloid positivity. And although PET scanning is available in some countries, it's not widely available in others. And so in order to enable patients to have easy and the most convenient access to detect whether they have amyloid positivity, this is one step of many we're taking or have taken to expand access to detection of amyloid positivity, which is key to sola uptake, assuming success. There's nothing new we know about sola. This is just part of our market prep, which we need to do to get a running start should that be successful.","Philip L. Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.","Great. Thanks, Dave. Sue?","Susan Mahony - Senior Vice President & President, Lilly Oncology","So with regards to Cyramza, we had a really good uptake in lung when we launched last year. We have seen some flattening over the last few months, and that is based on the competitive set that we talked about previously. Of course, our course in lung is to continue to identify the patients that we see can benefit from the Cyramza-docetaxel combination. The feedback that we get from physicians is still very positive when they use Cyramza. And clearly, we need to make sure that we break through the noise in the second-line market with all the competition that's there.","With gastric, we continue to have an opportunity. Clearly, gastric is a smaller market in the U.S. than lung. We continue to have an opportunity to bring usage from later lines of therapy into the second-line setting and to ensure that the combination data with paclitaxel is well known by the physicians who treat gastric cancer. And what we are finding is that because gastric cancer is not as prevalent as lung cancer, often doctors don't see as many patients, and we need to make sure that we continue to go back. We see that we have an opportunity to continue to grow there. And with colorectal, although that's not a key focus for us in the U.S., that is actually exceeding our expectations with regards to the uptake.","We are also launching across the globe with Europe. We're in the second wave of launching in gastric cancer now that we got access and reimbursement. We also just got approval for lung and colorectal cancer in Europe, so we'll be launching those this year. And we launched mid-last year, at the end of June in Japan the gastric cancer indication. And that launch is going exceedingly well, and we are very pleased with both the feedback and the uptake that we're seeing in Japan.","Philip L. Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.","Great. Thank you, Sue. Thanks, Alex, for the questions. Val, if we can, go to the next caller please.","Operator","Thank you. We have a question from Richard Purkiss with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Richard J. Purkiss - Piper Jaffray Ltd.","Thanks. I had a question for Enrique. If you could, just speak to the overall level of discounting in the U.S. diabetes space going into 2016.","And then a strategic question for John. Would you change your view on separating Elanco from Lilly if the EXPEDITION-3 study reads out positively? I guess I'm just thinking that there might be different investment return opportunities at that point between Elanco and Lilly's pharma business. Thanks.","Philip L. Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.","Richard, thank you for the questions. Enrique, for you the question on diabetes discount as we're heading into 2016, and, John, for the Elanco question. Enrique?","Enrique A. Conterno - Senior Vice President & President, Lilly Diabetes","Yes, first, I think the best way to frame this is we really try to ensure that we have appropriate access for our products in the different formularies. The strength in our portfolio, the strength of our brands is really helping us because our payers do want to include products that are basically becoming more relevant for customers that have good outcomes. And we do have a portfolio of brands that I think is very strong and, in fact, is gaining share across every class, across every region, so a very strong performance. That allows us to basically have maybe a bit more leverage than in the past when it comes to thinking about the type of discount that we basically provide. I cannot talk about the specific discounts. But what I can basically say is that we see our pricing basically stable to slightly up in most product categories.","Philip L. Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.","Great. Thanks, Enrique. John?","John C. Lechleiter - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Richard, I can't speculate on a hypothetical situation like the one you raised. I think you can assume that we're working hard across our entire Alzheimer's portfolio with sola in the lead. We're eagerly anticipating that data in the fourth quarter. And I think this year we'll really complete the lion's share of the integration of Novartis Animal Health within Elanco. Getting Elanco back to growth, getting us position to take full advantage of our number three global player size is going be our top priority.","Philip L. Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.","Great. Thanks, John. Thanks, Richard. Val, next caller please?","Operator","Thank you. We have a question from Geoff Meacham with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I've got one on sola. So Biogen mentioned yesterday some Phase 3 enrollment challenges with the number of centers with PET scans and identifying prodromal patients. So obviously, you know the first step is to have a positive Phase 3 for EXPEDITION. But what commercial investments do you think really need be made to accelerate patient identification to help build the market for more active therapies in Alzheimer's?","And then a second question on baricitinib, clearly you guys are \u2013 the BEAM study is part of the NDA. But down the road, how do you guys look at the value of running another head-to-head study to make a stronger claim? Thank you.","Philip L. Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.","Great, Geoff. Thank you for the questions. Dave, those are both yours.","David A. Ricks - President-Bio Medicines & Senior Vice President","Okay, great. On solanezumab, as we were speaking about earlier with the diagnostic test, there's no doubt that Alzheimer's is a prevalent condition with horrible outcomes, and we need disease-modifying agents. But again, as we pointed out in our December talk, the market isn't set up to really treat en masse people with disease-modifying therapies. One barrier you're pointing out here, which is available PET scanning. Now I think Lilly is in a bit of a unique position here, and I think we've demonstrated that pretty clearly in the Phase 3 enrollment world. We feel we're best in class in the ability to identify patients, put them through PET scanning centers, and get them in our studies. EXPEDITION-3 is the most recent example. We enrolled 2,000 people in 20 months. But enrollment in a study is small by comparison to getting market acceptance of a drug. So we're working hard on that issue.","A reminder, Amyvid, which is the leading mode of detection for amyloid, is a Lilly asset approved in Europe and the U.S. We have the only tau PET detecting technique in the clinic. That could also have some utility. And we need to look at the tau sub-study in the sola program. So we have those assets and I think could invest in a way that would look at the whole rather than the parts. That puts Lilly in a unique strategic position.","But I do want to continue to emphasize. I think there are structural barriers to rapid adoption of the technology, payer systems, even the ability to infuse and have patients treated consistently. We're working all those thing prudently because we don't have the EXPEDITION-3 outcomes yet, but working to put ourselves in a position to maximize the opportunity should it present itself at the end of this year.","And then on bari [baricitinib], I think your question is would we or are we planning to replicate the BEAM study head to head against adalimumab. At this point we have not announced such plans. Of course, we're always looking at our options, but I think the first step now is to get some regulatory feedback on likely label claims from the program we just submitted, and we don't know how strong or weak that is right now. And I think any decision like the one you're suggesting, we would want to be informed by the regulatory process. So we can tackle that one maybe later this year or early next year.","Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Got you, okay. Thank you.","Philip L. Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.","I also believe, Geoff, that some of the criticism \u2013 we had taken this into account as we designed the program for baricitinib on some other trials, particularly when they were comparing to Humira, is that they were not run on background methotrexate. We did run this study with Humira on background methotrexate to give it its best shot of performing well. We think it performed as expected, and we're very pleased with the robust result. We saw baricitinib routinely providing better relief for the signs and symptoms of RA. So we believe this is a very robust finding.","Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you.","Philip L. Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.","Val, can we go to the next caller, please?","Operator","Yes, our last question will come from the line of Damien Conover with Morningstar. Please go ahead.","Damien Conover - Morningstar Research","Thanks for taking the question. I know we're coming up at the end of the call here, so I'll make it pretty quick. I just wanted to ask a question regarding one of the more likely U.S. pricing reform debates coming up with dual-eligibles. I know in the past you talked about the impact being similar to potentially the Affordable Care Act reform. But I was wondering if you could characterize Lilly's maybe extra exposure given the insulin franchise, where pricing is particularly different in the Medicaid versus Medicare patient populations.","And then I guess a bigger question regarding the pharma's defense against what might be a more likely potential reform coming up over the next couple years. Thank you.","Philip L. Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.","Damien, thanks for the questions. John, would you like to take those?","John C. Lechleiter - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think what I can say I think in terms of exposure, we're significantly less exposed than we were when we had the big neuroscience psychiatric medical business here. I'm talking about Cymbalta and Zyprexa. Clearly, we have some exposure, not nearly what it was, but I think the number you're talking about in terms of the aggregate impact to my knowledge is still correct in terms of approximating the impact to the industry of the fee and the other measures that's a part of the Affordable Care Act of 2010. And so I think you can assume that on our policy agenda this is at the top of the list. And we believe that it's bad policy and ultimately for the people affected would be bad medicine. And we continue to build arguments and to maintain \u2013 attempt to maintain support for this not to happen.","Philip L. Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.","Great. Thanks, John. That does take us to the end of the call. We do appreciate all of you listening in or listening to the replay. Your interest in Eli Lilly & Company is very much appreciated.","2015 was an outstanding year for the company both in terms of the strong financial performance as well as substantial pipeline movement and progress that we registered during the year. We believe 2016 is shaping up to be an exciting year and an important one for implementation of our innovation-based strategy. We look forward to keeping you appraised of our progress over the course of the year, and we hope you have a great day.","Operator","Thank you.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I'd now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. David Ricks. Please go ahead.","David A. Ricks - Eli Lilly & Co.","Thank you and good morning. Thank you for joining us for Eli Lilly & Company's Q3 2018 Earnings Call. I'm Dave Ricks, Lilly's Chairman and CEO. Joining me on today's call are Josh Smiley, our Chief Financial Officer; Dr. Dan Skovronsky, the President of Lilly Research Labs and our Chief Scientific Officer; Enrique Conterno, the President of Lilly Diabetes and Lilly U.S.A.; Christi Shaw, the President of Lilly Bio Medicines; and Anne White, who is joining us for the first time as our new President of Lilly Oncology.","We're also joined by Kristina Wright, Mike Suppar (1:09), Kevin Hern, and Phil Johnson of the IR team. Please note that Jeff Simmons is not on the call today, as Elanco is now having their own quarterly earnings calls, including their first call earlier this morning. Substantive questions regarding their business performance and outlook should be directed to Elanco's Investor Relations team.","During this call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors, including those listed on slide 3 and those outlined in our latest forms 10-K and 10-Q filed at the SEC. Information we provide about our products and our pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It is not intended to be promotional. And it is not sufficient for prescribing decisions.","We continued our strong performance in 2018 with a third quarter revenue growth of 7% and non-GAAP operating income of 29% and non-GAAP EPS growth of 32%. New pharmaceutical products, which now represent 35% of human Pharma revenue in the quarter, continue to be the driver of our worldwide growth, led by Trulicity, Taltz, and Verzenio.","New products continue to drive strong volume-based growth, highlighted by the 14% Pharma volume growth and the 30% U.S. diabetes volume growth. We continue to expand our margins this quarter. Excluding the effect of FX on international inventory sold, non-GAAP gross margin as a percent of revenue increased by nearly 110 basis points over Q3 2017. And non-GAAP operating income as a percent of revenue increased by over 380 basis points to 28.1%.","We made significant progress with the pipeline this quarter, including the approval and launch of Emgality in the U.S., a positive CHMP opinion for Emgality in Europe, the submission of lasmiditan in the U.S., as well as positive Phase 3 readouts for Ultra Rapid Lispro in Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes patients, and a positive Phase 2 readout for GIP\/GLP, which is now called tirzepatide, in Type 2 diabetes.","And we announced yesterday that Trulicity demonstrated superiority in the reduction of major adverse cardiovascular events across a broad range of people with Type 2 diabetes in the precedent setting REWIND trial. These results are important for the millions of people with Type 2 diabetes who face a higher risk for CV disease.","We will submit these data to regulatory authorities and plan to present the detailed data at ADA in 2019. These extensive data, along with Trulicity's proven powerful efficacy, simply delivered, further validate Trulicity as a well-established option for people with diabetes.","In terms of capital deployment, Elanco Animal Health became a publicly-traded company via a well-received initial public offering. Through the IPO and the associated debt offering, Elanco raised over $4 billion in capital, the vast majority of which was provided to Lilly as partial consideration for the Animal Health business that Lilly transferred to Elanco in connection with the IPO.","We announced several business development transactions, including a licensing agreement which Chugai Pharmaceuticals for an oral GLP-1 agonist; a licensing and research collaboration with Dicerna Pharmaceuticals, utilizing their RNAi technology platform; a collaboration with NextCure Inc., focused on discovery and development of novel immuno-oncology cancer therapies; and we purchased a priority review voucher.","We returned nearly $600 million via the dividend. And we repurchased $1 billion of stock.","Moving on to slides 5 and 6, you'll see more detail on key events since our July earnings call.","Now I'll turn the call over to Josh to review our Q3 results and to provide an update on our financial guidance for 2018.","Joshua L. Smiley - Eli Lilly & Co.","Thanks, Dave, and good morning. Slide 7 summarizes our presentation of GAAP results and non-GAAP measures, while slide 8 provides a summary of our GAAP results. I'll focus my comments on our non-GAAP adjusted measures to provide insights into the underlying trends in our business. So please refer to today's earnings press release for a detailed description of the year-on-year changes in our third quarter GAAP results.","Looking at the non-GAAP measures on slide 9, you'll see the revenue increase of 7% that Dave mentioned earlier. Gross margin as a percent of revenue increased to 76.7%. Excluding the effect of foreign exchange rates on international inventory sold, gross margins as a percent of revenue increased nearly 110 basis points, primarily driven by manufacturing efficiencies and, to a lesser extent, the favorable impact of product mix, partially offset by the negative impact of price on our revenue.","Total operating expense increased roughly 1%, with marketing, selling and administrative expense increasing 2%, while R&D expense remained relatively flat. Total operating expense as a percent of revenue compared to Q3 2017 declined 275 basis points to 48.8%, benefiting from previously announced actions taken to reduce the company's cost structure.","Operating income increased 29% compared to Q3 2017, which put our operating margin at 27.9% for the quarter. And as Dave mentioned earlier, excluding the effect of FX on international inventory sold, our operating income was 28.1% of revenues, an improvement of over 380 basis points versus last year's quarter.","Other income and expense was expense of $15.4 million this quarter, compared to income of $49.9 million in last year's quarter. Our tax rate was 15.1%, a decrease of 380 basis points compared with the same quarter last year, driven primarily by the impact of U.S. tax reform.","At the bottom line, net income increased 29%, while earnings per share increased slightly faster at 32%, due to a reduction in shares outstanding from share repurchases.","We achieved this significant earnings growth by delivering high single digit revenue growth, while carefully managing our operating expenses, significantly improving profitability again this quarter.","Slide 10 details these same non-GAAP measures for September year to date, while slide 11 provides a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS. You will find additional details on these adjustments on slides 23 and 24.","Moving to slide 12. Let's take a look at the effect of price rate and volume on revenue growth. This quarter, foreign exchange had a modest effect on revenue. Our worldwide revenue growth on a performance basis was 8%, driven by a 12% increase in volume, partially offset by price. Q3 represented the seventh straight quarter our human Pharma business delivered volume growth in each major geography.","U.S. Pharma revenue increased 11%, driven by impressive volume growth of 17%, led by Trulicity, Basaglar, Taltz and Verzenio, partially offset by price.","As Dave mentioned earlier, our U.S. diabetes business delivered 30% volume growth yet again this quarter. This performance affirms our volume based growth strategy is critical as we grow through an evolving U.S. pricing environment.","You will see U.S. price declined 6% this quarter. Nearly 3 points of the U.S. price decline was driven by new access and corresponding volume for Basaglar in Medicare Part D, which we didn't have in last year's quarter. We also have approximately 2 points of decline associated with increases to our patient affordability and access programs for Taltz and Humalog, which also drove increased volumes. The remaining point of decline is the net effect of changes to estimates in rebates and discounts across segments, partially offset by the impact of price increases we took late last year and early this year.","Moving to Europe, Pharma revenue grew 1%, driven by volume, largely offset by price. This volume growth was achieved despite the loss of exclusivity for Cialis. Excluding the impact of the Cialis LOE, volume grew over 15%. This robust volume growth was led by Olumiant, Trulicity, Taltz, Lartruvo, and Jardiance.","In Japan, Pharma revenue decreased 2%, with volume growth more than offset by price from the impact of the biannual price cuts, which took effect in Q1. Volume growth was driven by new products, namely Trulicity, Olumiant, Taltz, and Jardiance, with a significant contribution also coming from Cymbalta.","Our Pharma revenue in the rest of the world increased 15% on a performance basis this quarter, led by volume growth from new products, namely Trulicity, Cyramza, Jardiance, Lartruvo, Taltz, and Basaglar, as well as strong volume growth from Humalog.","Turning to Animal Health. Total worldwide revenue grew 6% on a performance basis this quarter, driven by higher prices and higher volume. Higher sales of Companion Animal Disease Prevention, Ruminants and Swine, and Companion Animal Therapeutics products were partially offset by lower sales of products that are being exited, including the products which Lilly has retained control of after the Elanco IPO.","Slide 13 outlines this same information for our September year-to-date results.","Now let's take a look at the drivers of our 12% worldwide volume growth on slide 14. In total, our new products, including Trulicity, Taltz, Basaglar, Verzenio, Olumiant, Jardiance, Lartruvo, and Cyramza were the engine of our worldwide volume growth. You can see that these products drove 13.8 percentage points of volume growth this quarter. This robust Pharma volume growth represented our strongest quarterly volume performance this decade.","The loss of exclusivity for Strattera, Effient, Zyprexa, Axiron, Evista, and Cymbalta provided a drag of 110 basis points, while Cialis accounted for 190 basis points of volume decline. At the end of September, generic versions of Cialis entered the U.S. market, which is expected to result in rapid erosion of sales. When excluding LOEs and Cialis, the rest of our products had volume growth of approximately 19%.","Slide 15 provides a view of our new product updates. In total, these brands generated nearly $1.9 billion in revenue this quarter, representing 31% of our total worldwide revenue and 35% of our human Pharmaceutical revenue.","With the launch of Emgality and the submission of lasmiditan, we look forward to adding a fourth leg to our new product growth story, joining recent launches in diabetes, oncology, and immunology, and demonstrating that Lilly is also building an innovative pain franchise.","Moving to slide 16. Continuing with our non-GAAP explanations, this quarter, the effective FX had a relatively minimal impact on our income statement with a small negative impact on revenue and a small positive impact on earnings.","Turning to our 2018 financial guidance on slide 17, you will see that we've updated our non-GAAP guidance to reflect our continued strong operational performance. We're narrowing the range for revenue to $24.3 billion to $24.5 billion; narrowing the range for SG&A expense to $6.3 billion to $6.5 billion; decreasing our tax rate from 17% to 16%, due primarily to recently issued guidance on elements of U.S. tax reform; and we're raising and narrowing our non-GAAP earnings per share range to $5.55 to $5.60. At the midpoint of the range, this represents an increase of 30% over 2017.","I would note that this revised EPS range assumes a $0.02 to $0.03 negative impact from backing out the noncontrolling interest portion of Elanco profits in the fourth quarter, which had not been included in the prior guidance.","Our updated guidance implies fourth quarter non-GAAP EPS of between $1.33 and $1.38, which exceeds current consensus. However, it is lower than our third quarter EPS due to the entry of generic competition for Cialis in the U.S. in late September; higher fourth quarter R&D expenses to support additional late stage investment, including mirikizumab, Olumiant, and Taltz NILEX, as well as pegilodecakin and GIP\/GLP; and launch investments for Emgality; and finally the minority interest attributed to Elanco that I mentioned earlier.","On a reported basis, earnings per share for 2018 is now expected to be in the range of $3.13 to $3.18 (sic) [$3.04 to $3.09] (14:22).","In total, we expect strong full year performance led by volume gains in our new products, which allows for targeted investments in our long-term portfolio and positions us well to achieve our 2020 financial objectives. This robust performance, along with the capital raised from the Elanco transaction, provides strong cash flow, which we are deploying thoughtfully across our capital allocation priorities.","As we move forward in line with our strategy, we will continue to prioritize funding our existing marketed products, new launches, lifecycle opportunities, and in replenishing our pipeline. In addition, we continue to leverage business development to upgrade our pipeline and future growth prospects, as you saw with several recent announcements of business development deals.","Finally, we'll return excess cash to shareholders via increases to the dividend and share buybacks.","Now I will turn the call back over to Dave to review the pipeline and key future events.","David A. Ricks - Eli Lilly & Co.","Thanks, Josh. So Slide 18 shows select pipeline opportunities as of October 30. In my summary of the quarter at the beginning of the call, I mentioned the positive movements for Emgality and lasmiditan. Additional movements since our last earnings call includes, the start of a Phase 3 study for Olumiant in lupus; and the start of a Phase 2\/3 adaptive study for Olumiant in alopecia areata; the attrition of Cyramza's second line bladder cancer indication from Phase 3; and the attrition of the N3pG plus BACE combo arm from the ongoing Phase 2. Please note, we are still studying N3pG as a monotherapy in Phase 2.","On slide 19, we provide an update on expected key events for 2018. In addition to the pipeline movement and regulatory actions I have already noted, you will see that we've added a new line to reflect our expectation to submit Taltz for axial spondyloarthritis to regulatory authorities by the end of the year. In addition, the FDA has granted breakthrough designation to Emgality for the cluster headache indication. And you'll see that we've added a new line to reflect our plans to submit this indication by year end.","Under regulatory action, you will see the approval of Verzenios in Europe and Verzenio in Japan and the approval of fruquintinib in China under the trade name Elunate.","Under regulatory submissions, you'll see the submission of a new indication for Cyramza in Europe and Japan for second line liver cancer.","In the Phase 3 data presentations and publications section, we reflect the presentations at EASD of the EASE 2 and 3 studies in type I diabetes for empagliflozin, as well as the CARMELINA CV outcome study for Tradjenta in collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim. In addition to the presentations at ACR of the COAST-V and COAST-W axial spondyloarthritis studies for ixekizumab.","And in Phase 3 top line data disclosure section, in addition to the Phase 3 readouts for Trulicity and Ultra Rapid Lispro, which I mentioned earlier, we also had a positive Phase 3 readout for flortaucipir, our tau imaging agent. This was another productive quarter, contributing to continued pipeline advancement in 2018.","Before we go to the Q&A section, let me briefly sum up the progress we made this quarter. In Q3, we continued our strong operating performance in 2018, delivering 7% revenue growth and 12% volume growth, driven by our newest products. As Josh stated earlier, our Pharma volume growth was the strongest this decade. We continue to realize significant efficiencies in our cost structure, leading to operating margin expansion of over 380 basis points, excluding the impact of foreign exchange on international inventory sold.","We have made excellent progress in our pipeline this quarter as well: The approval and launch of Emgality for migraine patients in the U.S., this is our 10th new product launch since 2014; the FDA submission of lasmiditan for acute migraine; positive Phase 3 data for Ultra Rapid Lispro; the presentation of exciting Phase 2 data for tirzepatide in type II diabetes; and just yesterday's news that Trulicity demonstrated superiority in the reduction of major adverse cardiovascular events across a broad range of people with type II diabetes in the precedent setting REWIND trial.","We also returned $1.6 billion to shareholders via dividend and share repurchases. We completed the Elanco IPO and bolstered our early phase pipeline with the addition of an oral GLP-1, while completing several other business development deals.","This concludes our prepared remarks. And now I'll turn the call over to Phil to moderate the Q&A session.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Great. Thank you, Dave. As in prior calls, we would like to take as many questions as possible during the Q&A session, so we do ask that you limit your questions to two or a single question with two parts. Also, given some scheduling issues on our side and the fact that in recent calls we have not exhausted the full 90 minutes we had scheduled, we do intend to conclude today's call at 10:15.","So with that, Lola, if you could provide the instructions for the Q&A session. And then we're ready for the first caller.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. And first we'll go to the line of Chris Schott with JPMorgan.","Chris Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks so much for the questions. My first one was on REWIND results. I think you referred to them as precedent setting. I know you're sharing the full data next summer. But any additional color you can provide, as we try to think about those results in context of prior GLP-1 CV outcome studies? As we get kind of this balance of healthier patients versus longer follow-up in that study.","My second question, you touched a little bit on the prepared remarks. But the diabetes portfolio in 3Q, I think we had a few progs coming in a bit below expectations after some very strong first half results. Can you just talk about any color in terms of, was there any kind of one-time issues to speak about, Humalog or Basaglar, that affected this quarter's results? Thanks so much.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Great. Thank you for the questions, Chris. Enrique, those are both for you.","Enrique A. Conterno - Eli Lilly & Co.","Very good. REWIND is indeed a precedent setting trial. It included the majority of patients without \u2013 with Type 2 diabetes, but without cardiovascular disease. It also had the longest median follow-up, over five years, and a low A1C baseline of 7.3.","I think what we can share at this stage is really what's on the press release. We will not be sharing more information on REWIND until our intended detailed presentation at ADA next year. We do intend to submit in 2019 for a new indication.","Related to Humalog and Basaglar on the overall diabetes portfolio, first, I think we're very pleased with the overall volume growth when it comes to the diabetes portfolio.","Clearly when it comes to Humalog, we did see a 14% price decline vis-a-vis Q3 of 2017. Just to provide maybe a little more color on this, we are seeing in a favorable segment mix about 8 points of that 14. Patient affordability is impacted in the insulin portfolio. That's another 4 points. And then we had a unfavorable property (22:24) adjustment as a comparator to last year's quarter.","Maybe to provide and try to be a little more instructed, yes, we do see a lot of volatility with Humalog. It is better to look at this product on a year-to-date basis. And when we look at it on a year-to-date basis, I think the trend that we basically see is mid-single digit erosion on price.","The dynamics on Basaglar are slightly different, in that Basaglar did not have any access in Part D, and that's access that we first gained this year. So when we look at the compare, we are comparing on a segment that is highly rebated. And that basically has an impact on price.","Now when we look at Q2 of 2018 versus Q3 of 2018 for Basaglar, there is some price erosion but not the same magnitude that you see year on year.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Great. Enrique, thank you for the answers. Lola, if we can go to the next caller, please.","Operator","Certainly. And next, we'll go to the line of Tim Anderson with Wolfe Research.","Timothy Minton Anderson - Wolfe Research, LLC","Thank you very much. A couple of questions. 2019, can you talk about tailwinds and headwinds? I know you won't be giving official guidance until December, but hoping there are at least some trends both on the revenue and spending side that you can maybe call out ahead of that official guidance. So for example, obviously Cialis is \u2013 will be LOE. If I think about R&D spend, you're going to be starting eight Phase 3 trials on your GIP\/GLP-1 program. So any color on 2019 would be appreciated.","And then a second question on insulin category. So at some point, FDA may deem biosimilar insulins as interchangeable and substitutable with brand. Do you think this is more likely than not to occur? And could that be something that happens as soon as 2019? And if not 2019, then when?","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Great. Tim, good to hear your voice again. Welcome back. Josh, if you would answer the first question on the 2019 tailwinds and headwinds. And then, Enrique, the question Tim had on interchangeability for insulins. Josh?","Joshua L. Smiley - Eli Lilly & Co.","Yes. Thanks, Tim. And you started to answer the question. I think the main tailwinds \u2013 or the headwind that we'll see is the Cialis overhang in 2019, as we will experience the main erosion here in the fourth quarter in the U.S. So that certainly will be a headwind as we head in 2019.","That being said, we're seeing great growth in the 10 new medicines we've launch since 2014. So we'd expect that the volume from those products to more than compensate for many of the tailwinds we've said we will see. So we will see a difficult compare.","The other thing that we've talked about in terms of a headwind on the top line will be the change in the donut hole provision in Medicare Part D, the move from 50% to 70%. As Enrique mentioned, we've got Basaglar in our diabetes products, are in that segment strongly. So we'll see a little bit of a headwind there. But I think we're really pleased with the volume growth that we saw this quarter and expect that the main components of that will continue into 2019.","On the R&D side, we do have a very robust set of Phase 3 opportunities ahead of us. You mentioned tirzepatide, which will be starting in mid-2019. In a broad sense we've got mirikizumab that we moved into Phase 3. As you know, those trials are expensive, so we'll have a cost there. And then we'll see data on our ARMO asset, the IL-10, in 2019. And we'd expect that, given positive data there, to continue to push that program. So we'll make targeted investments in R&D and should expect to see some growth there.","I think we've been pretty clear on the SG&A line that a big component of our operating margin expansion will be to redirect the investments and resources that we have in products like Cialis and Forteo and others to our new launch opportunities we'll have. Certainly, we'll spend competitively to launch products like Emgality next year. But we'd look to manage that total base at a pretty flat level.","All in all, we are excited about the prospects for midterm, 2019 and 2020. We're well on track we think to meet our 2020 midterm objectives, which are 5% compound annual, minimum 5% compound annual sales growth between 2015 and 2020 and operating margin minimum of 30%. So we feel good about where we are there.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Great. Thank you, Josh. Enrique?","Enrique A. Conterno - Eli Lilly & Co.","When it comes to insulin interchangeability at the pharmacy level, we do not believe this is imminent. At best, it's likely a few years away. And it will require the appropriate studies for the FDA to provide such a designation.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Great. Thank you, Enrique. Lola, next caller, please?","Operator","Certainly. Next will go to line of Jason Gerberry with Bank of America. Mr. Gerberry? Shall we move on?","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Yes, if you could. And then maybe put Jason into the next slot if he's able to reconnect? Thank you.","Operator","Certainly. And next we'll go to the line of Andrew Baum with Citi.","Andrew S. Baum - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","Thank you. Couple of questions for Enrique, please. Could you talk to the barriers prohibiting broader Jardiance usage? Whether it's education? Reimbursement copay?","And then related to that, could you outline the Tier 2 formulary status within Medicare for Jardiance especially? And in particular, whether a second brand at a net price rather than the current list price may be helpful in increasing penetration by reducing the burden on the patients and preparing ground for a world of net pricing, which seems to be potentially upon us? Many thanks.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Okay. Andrew, thank you for the questions. If I got them, first, Enrique, would be barriers that you see to Jardiance usage and ways to maybe change that, Tier 2 formulary status and Medicare, and the opportunity for a second brand to potentially address some of the issues that patients face in that book of business.","Enrique A. Conterno - Eli Lilly & Co.","Yeah. I'm going to try to answer that question, Andrew, just by maybe a bit of color on how we see Jardiance, because I do see there are some barriers. But I see a number of dynamics that are very positive when I look at the overall class and Jardiance in particular.","First, clearly one of the things that we look at is, how is the overall class evolving and developing? And the class right now is growing in single digits, high single digits. But more importantly, we are seeing new patient starts \u2013 the growth in new patient starts accelerate. We now see that in the 14%, 15% range. It reminds me a bit of the reacceleration of the GLP-1 class back when Trulicity was launched.","Importantly, there are new guidelines that have been published by both ADA and EASD. We think those guidelines are a significant improvement. And that's going to be very helpful. That's an important tailwind.","And finally, we have improved access for Jardiance. As you know, we were excluded from one of the major accounts. We are back as of January 1. And that's going to be a very important access for Jardiance. When it comes to coverage, now starting in January of 2019 is in the 90s. So that's an excellent foundation for us to capitalize on.","And an additional point, which I emphasized in the GLP-1 class, but it's relevant for now, SGLT2s, is that we have basically additional data from competitors that are confirming the benefits when it comes to CV of the class. And importantly, investments from those competitors. Jardiance is in the best opportunity to capitalize on that.","So I see an evolution. And there are a lot of signs and dynamics to be hopeful about the acceleration of the overall growth and the ability for Jardiance to capitalize on that.","You asked about Medicare, and whether we would be launching a second brand with Jardiance. Honestly, that's not where I see the issue for Jardiance when it comes to the use of it.","Clearly, we always assess all opportunities for our brands. But we are much more focused about \u2013 and I think as you implied on your question \u2013 continuing to educate health care professionals to ensure that they understand the full benefit that Jardiance can offer patients. And these new guidelines are going to be extremely helpful to do that.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Great. Thank you, Enrique. Lola, if we can go to the next caller, please?","Operator","Certainly. And next we'll go to the line of Jason Gerberry with Bank of America.","Jason M. Gerberry - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Can you guys hear me?","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","We certainly can. Yes.","Jason M. Gerberry - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Sorry about that. Yeah, first question is just on Taltz. Can you talk about the outlook going into the next few years with a new competitor launching? And do you believe that as these market position with HUMIRA, which has been the leading product in some of these markets, do you think that confers any advantage as it pertains to access relative to the already on market interleukin agents?","And then my second question. With oral GLP-1, can you talk a little bit about what you hope to accomplish here, especially with the great data on GIP\/GLP? And as we think about Novo's [Novo Nordisk's] oral sema [semaglutide], there are obviously some challenges with that product in terms of dosing. So can you talk about sort of what you're looking for in terms of go, no-go profile?","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Great, Jason. Thank you for the questions. So, Christi, if you'll take question on the Taltz outlook going forward. And then over to you, Dan, for our goals for the oral GLP-1 program.","Christi Shaw - Eli Lilly & Co.","Sure. So we're very excited with Taltz. I mean you probably saw that our year-over-year volume growth was significant. And specifically, our TRx grew 80% year over year. And over the quarter, continuing to grow the same.","And we're just starting with Taltz. I mean we have a great position in the dermatology office. We just launched this year in the rheumatology office with psoriatic arthritis, which that launch is going well. And just coming off of the American College of Rheumatology, we also demonstrated our data in ankylosing spondylitis, which we will submit before the end of the year, as Dave said. So as we're looking and winning in dermatology, we're beefing up in rheumatology as well.","And to your point about access. Right now, our access is about the same as COSENTYX, a little bit less due to the Optum [OptumRx] change in the beginning of the year. But with that, as you can see, the growth of Taltz \u2013 it hasn't prevented us from getting patients who need Taltz on Taltz.","And we see that continuing in the future. Because in this marketplace, unfortunately, patients cycle through many different therapies. And what we're seeing from customers is that they would like a variety of therapies and different mechanisms to choose from.","So you look at the entire portfolio that we have of newer agents coming out and IL-17 and IL-23, our JAK inhibitor, we're looking to be able to provide a broad portfolio to those customers, those patients, and broaden our access to payers with the advent of the newer agents.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Great. Thanks, Christi, Dan?","Daniel M. Skovronsky - Eli Lilly & Co.","Yeah, thank you for the question on our partnership with Chugai on this oral GLP-1 receptor agonist. This is still a pre-Phase 1 molecule, but moving quickly towards human trials.","An important comment there is that this is a non-peptidic agonist. So this is \u2013 you should think of this very differently from an oral peptide. This is a small molecule approach.","As such, we expect it to have in humans \u2013 and this is what we'll be testing \u2013 a much higher bioavailability than you would see for any kind of oral peptide approach.","What does that mean for patients? We hope that will translate into a better experience, certainly in terms of how and when this molecule will be dosed for the people on the trials, and ultimately, in practice. But also that should translate into improved outcomes. So it's still very early, but we're excited about the potential here. And look forward to getting some human data.","Jason M. Gerberry - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thank you.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Thank you, Dan. Lola, next caller, please?","Operator","Certainly. And next we'll go to the line of Geoff Meacham with Barclays.","Olivia Brayer - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, guys. This is Olivia Brayer on for Geoff. Thanks for taking the question. Just two from me. First question is on your dual-receptor agonist. Can you provide us with any updates on that Phase 3 trial? We noticed yesterday that the SURPASS 4 was posted to ct.gov.","So can you point to what steps you've taken to improve that overall tolerability in that Phase 3? Just curious how the design was influenced by the recently completed titration study that you previously talked about? And of course, the Phase 2 that we saw last month. And any expectations there on enrollment timelines?","And then second question is just another on REWIND. Just curious on what your view is on the incremental opportunity here. Any thoughts on how it might change the treatment paradigm? And what the impact on the overall GLP-1 class might be? Thanks so much.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Great. Thank you for the questions. So, Enrique, maybe we'll have you attack those. So the first one on GIP\/GLP or tirzepatide, things that are being done for Phase 3 with titration, things we would have learned in our Phase 2 program, and then any comments on enrollment timing. And then how you see REWIND playing out going forward with the GLP-1 market.","Enrique A. Conterno - Eli Lilly & Co.","Yeah. So as we've shared as part of tirzepatide's Phase 3 program, we are planning to study three maintenance doses at 5, 10 and 15 mg.","I think what we've learned is that we should titrate in smaller increments and over time. As we've shared, we have a titration study that we intend to share the details next year. But clearly we've learned a lot from the study in terms of what are the optimal titration schedules.","We are planning aggressively when it comes to starting this trial and starting enrollment. So you'll be hearing more when it comes to our trial for Type 2 diabetes soon.","As far as REWIND, I don't want to speculate on the particular indication that we will get. But clearly, this is important for the class in that it confirms what other GLP-1s have shown when it comes to seeing benefit.","And, I'm sorry, I cannot resist, but I heard Novo Nordisk's call. And they also mentioned that GLP-1s were not all the same, and I think we agree with them.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Thank you, Enrique. So, Lola, if we can go to the next caller?","Operator","Yes. And next we'll go to the line of Steve Scala with Cowen.","Steve Scala - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you. I have a couple questions. You mentioned the U.S. price hit from gaining access for Basaglar, Taltz, and Humalog. But was there a one-time volume gain from this reflected in the 17% U.S. volume increase? So that's the first question.","The second question is to go back to the questions on REWIND. Is REWIND precedent setting because of the population studied? Or is it precedent setting because you have avoided the less than optimal outcomes of Novo's leader in SUSTAIN 6? Or perhaps both?","I mean precedent setting is a big statement. So in the absence of any color, I guess we have to assume you hit all three components of the primary endpoint, which is something Novo was not able to accomplish. Thank you.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Great, Steve. Thank you for the questions. So, Josh, if you'll take the comment on U.S. price, if there was also offsets there in the volumes that we're gaining. And then, Enrique, on what we mean by precedent setting for REWIND.","Joshua L. Smiley - Eli Lilly & Co.","Thanks, Steve. Yes, if you look at volume for the third quarter in the U.S., it grew at 17%, which Dave and I both mentioned was the most significant volume growth we've seen this decade.","And that Basaglar absolutely contributed to that growth. So the access that we got in Medicare Part D is contributing to the 17% growth, as are the other elements that we mentioned around patient access and all of the new launches. So it is a positive offset there. And you can see in total, even with that negative-6% growth, the U.S. business grew at 11% overall.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Great. Thanks, Josh.","Joshua L. Smiley - Eli Lilly & Co.","Yeah.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Enrique?","Enrique A. Conterno - Eli Lilly & Co.","As I mentioned when I first discussed REWIND as part of the first question, it is precedent setting because it includes some areas of patients without cardiovascular disease. It has the longest median follow-up and a low A1C baseline. We'll be sharing the detailed results at the ADA next year.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Great. Thank you, Enrique. Lola, next caller?","Operator","Next we'll go to the line of Umer Raffat with Evercore.","Umer Raffat - Evercore Group LLC","Hi. Thanks so much for taking my questions. First, maybe on the oncology side, I noticed for your IL-10 you have decent monotherapy activity in the renal cell setting. But the randomized trials you're running are in lung and pancreatic. So I just wanted to get the thought process there. Is that a consideration? And also your confidence on those open-label lung trials that are coming out in the first half 2019.","Second, on NGF it seems like the placebo adjusted efficacy definitely faded into the latest readout. And my question is, do you look at this current placebo adjusted efficacy from this latest trial as being clinically meaningful? And also just your thoughts on the joint replacements on that trial. Thank you.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Great, Umer. Thank you for the questions. So, Dan, we'll go to you for those on the development strategy for the IL-10. And then also what we think about the efficacy results and any safety findings from the initial trial that's readout for our NGF.","Daniel M. Skovronsky - Eli Lilly & Co.","Yeah, thanks, Umer, for those good questions. So starting with the pegilodecakin at IL-10. As you point out, the randomized trial that's ongoing at Phase 3 is in pancreas. We're excited about that and look forward to seeing data there in combination with FOLFOX.","The two Phase 2 studies that you mentioned are randomized trials in non-small cell lung cancer. The first one is in the first line setting in PD-L1 high patients. And the second one is in the second line setting in the PD-L1 low setting, both in combination with I\/O.","We're absolutely excited to see data from those trials starting next year, which will inform our progress in that opportunity.","As for RCC, you're right that we had the monotherapy activity there in that early Phase 1 study, which was exciting, and part of the basis of the back years, that this molecule is active in the monotherapy setting.","I think in terms of that indication and other indications, we're still working through what our plan is. Some of that will depend on data that we get in these next couple of trials, as well as the data that we already have. We hope to be able to share more with you about our plans for full development of that molecule at our December R&D day.","With respect to tanezumab, I think you had a question there on both the efficacy and the safety with respect to total joint replacements. On the efficacy, it's hard to make cross-trial comparisons. Of course, this is a different population, that's a more treatment resistant, more severe population than in those prior studies.","Still, on balance, the efficacy looks quite comparable to what we would expect. Maybe some small differences in the placebo group from trial to trial. But this is a small trial. And we look forward to the full results coming.","But all in all, I would say the efficacy data are where we expect them to be. And we're really, I think, excited as we said before about the potential of this molecule from an efficacy perspective. The question of course is, can we adequately discharge the safety risk?","So the total joint replacement, there was an imbalance in this small study. We don't fully understand what drove that imbalance. I think there were a number of factors that we noticed about the imbalance in total joint replacements. One was that most of these events occurred in the follow-up period, rather than the on-treatment period. Another observation is that these events were generally in the patients who were most severe at enrollment. It was in their index joints, and it was not \u2013 in general, in most cases, it was not associated with any adverse event or any finding in the joint adjudication.","So we'll keep our eye on that. And of course, the big readout for us with our partners, Pfizer, will be next year, when we get that large 56-week study.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Great. Thank you, Dan. Lola, if we can go to the next caller.","Operator","Certainly. And next it's Alex Arfaei with BMO Capital.","Alex Arfaei - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Great. Thank you. And congratulations on a positive REWIND readout. First on REWIND, Enrique, June 2019 seems like a long time to wait for the results. You mentioned you plan to file the indication in 2019. So when should we expect to see a new Trulicity label?","Then I have a couple of questions on Verzenio, please. The market seems to have slowed down more than we expected. Just wondering if you could give us your thoughts there? You're gaining share, which is great, but what's going on with the overall market?","And we noticed you moved up the timeline for the adjuvant study by one year on clinicaltrials.gov. Just wondering if you changed anything about the trial? Or is it just your expectations about, based on the powering of the study or expected benefits? Thank you very much.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Great. Thank you for the questions, Alex. So timing for a potential label update on REWIND, Enrique, for you. And then, Anne, if you'd to handle what we're seeing for market growth with the CDK4\/6 class and the change in timing on clinicaltrials.gov for the adjuvant study. Enrique?","Enrique A. Conterno - Eli Lilly & Co.","Well, clearly, we are planning to pursue an indication under a submission in 2019 and a standard review. We will be looking at a label update in 2020. Of course, we are working as fast as we can to try to expedite that as much as possible. And we'll be working with the regulatory authorities. Unfortunately, we won't be able to share the REWIND data prior to ADA.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Great. Thank you, Enrique. Anne?","Anne E. White - Eli Lilly & Co.","Great. Well, thanks for the question on Verzenio. And, yes, we have seen some slowing in the growth of the CDK4\/6 market, as others in the class have commented. However, we do still see potential growth, as more physicians trial this class and particularly as they trial Verzenio. So as you mentioned, our NBRx rate is in the high teens. And we continue to be pleased with its growth.","And we are encouraged by a couple of specific factors. So first, as we continue to drive trial with Verzenio in the U.S., what we're seeing is that when physicians trial Verzenio, they have a really good experience. And they're likely to prescribe it again, so becoming adopters.","And what seems to particularly resonate with physicians is the fact that patients with certain concerning clinical characteristics, that indicate a poorer prognosis, do well on Verzenio. So these are patients with liver metastases, a high tumor grade, visceral disease, or cancer that's not confined to the bone. And so we'll be publishing that additional data shortly.","We're also very enthusiastic about the fact that we've received approval in Japan and Europe. So we see those markets as significant growth drivers.","And then third, related your question around adjuvant, we do see potential future opportunity in the broader breast cancer market, following readouts in the HER2 positive population, our OS readout from the MONARCH 2 study. And then very importantly, the work, as you said, in adjuvant breast cancer.","On adjuvant specifically, what we're seeing is that study is enrolling very well. It's more than 60% enrolled. So we're quite encouraged by that timeline. So we do expect results in 2021. And we really look forward to that market, because as you know, adjuvant is really twice the size of the metastatic breast cancer market. So a significant growth opportunity for Lilly in the future.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Great. Thank you, Anne. Lola, if we can go to the next caller.","Operator","Certainly. Next will be David Risinger with Morgan Stanley. Mr. Risinger?","David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah. Sorry. I was on mute. Can you hear me now?","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","We can. Yes, Dave.","David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. So Lilly's volume growth has been and is set to continue to be very strong. But could you please comment on three quick questions on pricing? First, the list price outlook for 2019 that you have in your planning assumptions? Second, your exposure to a step up in the donut hole fill in 2019? And third, your exposure to growth in co-pay accumulators in 2019? Thanks very much.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Great, Dave. Thank you for the questions. Josh, if you'd like to answer those questions on expectations moving forward on price?","Joshua L. Smiley - Eli Lilly & Co.","So, Dave, we'll do our guidance for 2019 in December, and we'll provide our pricing assumptions then. I can tell you for 2018 for the guidance that we gave, we're not assuming any additional price increases this year.","In terms of exposure to the change in the donut hole provision, we've said before that when we look across our portfolio, it's about $200 million of incremental impact in 2019.","And then on the co-pay accumulators piece, of course these impact the specialty drugs, particularly Taltz and Forteo for now. And we're \u2013 at least for where we are right now, we're comfortable that there is not a significant exposure here.","David A. Ricks - Eli Lilly & Co.","Just maybe a follow on comment on that. I've seen notes from analysts as well as other industry commentators that, roughly in specialty segments, these are single-digit impacts in terms of patients actually exposed to the out-of-pocket costs of co-pay accumulators, net of industry actions and payer actions. And that's not really different for us with Taltz, which is the major product affected. So it's an issue, but it's not a huge driver of the overall picture.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Great. Thank you.","David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you, guys.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Thanks, Dave. Lola, if we can go to the next caller?","Operator","Certainly. And it will be Vamil Divan with Credit Suisse.","Vamil K. Divan - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi. Great. Thanks for taking my questions. So one just on Olumiant. Looks like still pretty good European uptake, but sort of limited uptake in the first few months on the market in the U.S. So maybe you can just talk about sort of access and sort of initial position interest in that product.","And then the other one, I just \u2013 maybe a little bit of a different product we don't talk much about is Lartruvo. Obviously, still one of your newer medications. But I think it's asked about a little less. And I'm just trying to get a better sense of that market. I mean the growth is still there in the U.S. but slowing a little bit. And I'm just trying to get a better sense of how penetrated you think that product is into that market. And maybe a little bit more on the longer-term potential for that one to keep growing. Thanks so much.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Great, Vamil. Thank you for the questions. So, Christi, if you'd like to talk about what we're seeing in terms of uptake access and physician experience here in the U.S. And then, Anne, over to you for what we're seeing with Lartruvo and the market opportunity there.","Christi Shaw - Eli Lilly & Co.","Sure. So thank you for the question, Vamil. In terms of Olumiant, I will start with the EU as you suggested, or outside the U.S. The growth of Olumiant in volume in Europe in the last two quarters has actually been the fastest growing in volume for Lilly as a whole. And in Japan, we just were lifted in September on the two-week prescription. So we're seeing significant uptake now that that restriction is off.","And in the U.S., we're getting a lot of usage. In terms of the uptake, we are giving samples in the office to physicians, so you won't see that on the uptake. But more importantly, what we're hearing from physicians is that their patients are having really positive feedback on our speed of onset. Just like we saw in Europe and the other 50 countries where we've launched, the efficacy continues to deliver. And really helping patients with the early onset of symptom relief, so they get back to the productive days of their life. which is significant.","And as the physicians see those patients come back, it truly is changing. And then helps them obviously feel more comfortable in prescribing as well.","And Olumiant is really key for us. It's not just in the U.S. RA, but we continue to evolve the indications for Olumiant. We have three Phase 3 studies, obviously, that we're recruiting for in atopic dermatitis, in lupus, and a Phase 2\/3 adaptive study in alopecia areata. So as those readouts come out as well, we'll be looking for significant uptake of Olumiant in helping a lot of patients with high unmet need.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Great. Thank you, Christi. Anne?","Anne E. White - Eli Lilly & Co.","Yes. So we are pleased with the uptake on Lartruvo, and it has been steadily increasing since launch. So as you saw the year to dates, we've had a 54% increase over last year and just a 41% increase in this quarter.","And Lartruvo is the market leader now in the U.S. in first-line metastatic soft tissue sarcoma. It has about a 20% market share.","And then we were excited see that it's now the market leader in the dox-eligible [doxorubicin-eligible] patients, passing [ph] dox focilfide (53:45) this year at a 36% share of market. And as you know well, Vamil, it's the only medicine in four decades that actually helps patient live longer when compared to dox alone.","So we're also encouraged by the fact that we're seeing thought leaders fairly routinely refer to it as the standard of care. And growth in our top accounts, particularly, is very strong. In fact, 97% of the top 100 institutions have now posted sales since launch of Lartruvo.","We are still seeing launch in Europe and still gaining access. So we still think there's potential for growth obviously in that market.","Our major focus really is on driving awareness in the community and in the centers of excellence, where a lot of these key treatment decisions are made. So we do still see quite a bit of potential for growth at Lartruvo, though I will acknowledge it's an orphan disease population. And so at one point we will see penetration. But we don't see that yet. We still see a good potential growth and are pleased on how we're doing.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Great. Thank you, Anne. Lola, if we can go to the next caller, please?","Operator","Yes. It will be Louise Chen with Cantor Fitzgerald.","Louise Chen - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Hi. Thanks for taking my two questions. So my first question is on REWIND. Has this met your internal expectation for relative risk reduction? And have you historically talked about what kind of incremental sales opportunity it could mean for you?","And then secondly, on the injectable CGRPs, how do you see this market landscape playing out with three approved products and more to come on the injectable and oral side? And do you think it will grow the entire market or take share from existing products? Thank you.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Great. Louise, thank you for the questions. So, Enrique, another question on REWIND for you. And then, Christi, on the CGRP question, please.","Enrique A. Conterno - Eli Lilly & Co.","On the expectations, of course. This is a positive trial. Trulicity is showing superiority in a broad range of patients with Type 2 diabetes.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Great. Thank you. Christi?","Christi Shaw - Eli Lilly & Co.","Yes. So we are extremely excited about the migraine marketplace. I mean you're seeing, as we've been discussing over the last year, the high unmet need with now tens of thousands of patients already being prescribed a preventive now.","And I don't think I've talked to you since we actually received our label. So we're really happy with the label we received in terms of our differentiation. We have the 50%, 75%, and 100% migraine-free data that we're able to promote. Also our positive outcome for functional measures, which is unique for Emgality, is in the label.","And we just presented data at the American Headache Society that Emgality works fast. Our induction dose, so patients can actually get the medication quickly, and they get it in the doctor's office where they teach them how to do the autoinjector. They do it themselves. And then they go and take it once a month then on.","Lastly, the other differentiation is we got the breakthrough therapy designation in cluster. And we're very excited about that for patients who have had no treatment \u2013 no approved treatment \u2013 in that suicide headache population.","So as we look at the marketplace, we see it continuing to grow. We like our chances in terms of being able to compete. And with the competitive agents and oral agents coming out next year, those right now are in a different class that will compete with lasmiditan and not the preventive therapies initially.","So with the entire franchise we have in migraine of both preventative and acute, we think we're a leader. And we know we're a leader in pain and migraine and will continue to prove it out over time.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Great. Thank you, Christi. Lola, if we can go to the next caller?","Operator","And next we'll go the line of Seamus Fernandez with Guggenheim Securities.","Seamus Fernandez - Guggenheim Securities","Thanks very much for the question. So just a couple. Can you help us understand a little bit the opportunity for Emgality in cluster headache specifically? Is this a large new patient population that we should be thinking about? Or is it more an indication that will firm up and differentiate your market position?","And then second, Enrique, can you talk more about the international growth opportunity for the GLP-1 class overall? When I look at the class, we're looking at about a third of sales relative to the U.S. And frankly, when we look at other large classes, the opportunity seems to be like it would be quite a bit greater. And I just would love to know what you see as the opportunity internationally? Or perhaps what the holdbacks are? Thanks so much.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Great. Seamus, thank you for the questions, and welcome back to you as well. Good to hear your voice on the line. Christi, if you'll take the question on the opportunity for cluster for Emgality. And then, Enrique, for the international growth opportunity for the GLP-1 class.","Christi Shaw - Eli Lilly & Co.","Thank you, Seamus, for the question. As I said earlier, we are so excited to help these patients with cluster. And although the number of patients who have cluster is obviously significantly less than the general moderate to severe migraine population, it is such a high unmet need that we're privileged to provide that for patients.","And the second part of your question, I think it's good for that. But it's also obviously confirming again the efficacy of Emgality. As I stated before, Emgality is the only one who actually demonstrated efficacy in 100% of \u2013 being able to relieve 100% of migraines in any given month. And that efficacy, now coupled with cluster, which is significant and no one has ever showed efficacy, that halo effect across Emgality in migraine we expect will be a benefit.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Great. Thank you, Christi. Enrique?","Enrique A. Conterno - Eli Lilly & Co.","So there is a significant opportunity, just like in the U.S., outside of the U.S. for the GLP-1 class. The GLP-1 class is growing in the mid-20s outside of the U.S. in most markets, so very healthy growth.","Something unique when we look at the international markets is the size of the basal insulin market, which, as we know, represents a significant opportunity, as we see GLP-1s being the injectables of choice, first injectables prior to basal insulin. So a very significant opportunity, but we see that playing out over time.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Thank you, Enrique. Appreciate it. If we can go to the next caller, please, Lola?","Operator","Certainly. It'll be Steve Scala with Cowen.","Steve Scala - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you. A couple questions. Regarding dropping the N3pG-plus BACE in Alzheimer's disease, the early data was great. So what was the reason for dropping the product?","And it was mentioned that monotherapy continues. But I thought the monotherapy was discontinued earlier this year. Or has the monotherapy restarted? So that's the first question.","Second question is on Jardiance. Why are you not filing for type 1 diabetes as an insulin adjunct in 2018, given the positive data? I think that had been the expectation that you would file this year. Thank you.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Great, Steve. Thank you for the questions. Dan, if you'd like to answer where we are with the N3pG and BACE combo, and N3pG more broadly. And then, Enrique, if you'd like to take the type 1 filing question. Dan?","Daniel M. Skovronsky - Eli Lilly & Co.","Yeah, thanks, Steve. Sorry for the confusion there. So on the N3pG BACE, we've dropped the BACE arm of this trial, so N3pG does continue.","The decision to drop BACE was based on a couple factors. One was what we've seen across the field with various BACE inhibitors, where these drugs don't have a benefit. And they actually cause some increased rate of cognitive worsening.","With our particular BACE inhibitor, we did see some increases in psychiatric adverse events that gave us some pause, as well as changes on imaging, increased rate of brain shrinkage. So that was the basis for the decision to discontinue BACE, despite as you said great preclinical data, showing a combination of BACE inhibition and N3pG to be beneficial in mice.","N3pG, however, which is our plaque-clearing antibody, which really shows, I think, deep and rapid clearance of amyloid plaque from the brain, continues on in this Phase 2 study. This is designed to demonstrate evidence of efficacy. And we're really excited about that.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Great. Thank you, Dan. Enrique?","Enrique A. Conterno - Eli Lilly & Co.","Yes. On Jardiance and type 1, clearly, as part of the EASE studies, we showed that Jardiance as an adjunct to insulin in patient with type 1 can have additional level of glycemic control. And we saw this across all doses that we basically studied. At this point in time, we are working with BI [Boehringer Ingelheim] on the regulatory next steps. And we hope to be able to share more shortly.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Thank you, Enrique. Lola, next caller, please?","Operator","And at this time, there's no one in queue.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Fantastic. Dave, then if you'd like to go ahead and conclude the call with some final remarks.","David A. Ricks - Eli Lilly & Co.","Great. Thanks, Phil. Well, we appreciate your participation in today's earnings call and your interest in Eli Lilly & Company.","Our strong execution through the first nine months of 2018 highlights the continued progress towards and the increasing confidence in the delivery of our revenue and profitability goals for 2020. We have seen continued pipeline progression, including our 10th new product launch since 2014; compellingly stage opportunities for tirzepatide, mirikizumab and pegilodecakin; and superiority of Trulicity in the ambitious REWIND CV outcome study.","This progress underscores the opportunities for growth beyond 2020. We look forward to providing a more detailed update on our pipeline during our December 19 Investor Meeting.","Thanks again for dialing in. Please follow up with our IR team if you have questions we have not addressed on the call. Hope everyone has a great day.","Operator","And, ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and using AT&T Executive Teleconference.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. And later we will conduct a questions-and-answer session with instructions being given at that time. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, today\u2019s conference is being recorded.","I\u2019d now like to turn the conference over to our host, Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Phil Johnson. Please go ahead, sir.","Phil Johnson","Thank you. Good morning and thank you for joining us for Eli Lilly & Company's fourth quarter 2013 earnings conference call. I\u2019m Phil Johnson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Joining me on today\u2019s call are John Lechleiter, our Chairman, President, and CEO; Derica Rice, our Chief Financial Officer, Dr. Jan Lundberg, our President of Lilly Research Laboratories and Ilissa Rassner and Travis Coy of the Investor Relations team.","I would like to call out that this is Travis\u2019s last earnings call with us. Before he transitions to the financial leadership role of our oncology business, we\u2019d like to thank him for his efforts in furthering our work with investors in Wall Street over the last two years. Thanks Travis.","Now during this conference call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors, including those listed on Slide three and those outlined in our latest forms 10-K and 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It is not intended to be promotional and is not sufficient for prescribing decisions.","Let me begin today\u2019s call by highlighting a few of that that have occurred since last quarter\u2019s call. In clinical news, at the ASCO GI meeting earlier this month, a detailed data was presented for RAINBOW. The second positive Phase 3 ramucirumab trial which will increase overall survival in patients with advanced gastric cancer. We were pleased with how these data were received by the medical community and we look forward to submitting the data to regulators later this year.","We were disappointed that the Phase 3 studies for edivoxetine, which has been studied as an adjunctive therapy for patients with major depressive disorder did not achieve their primary endpoints. On the regulatory front, Q4 caps off a busy year as we completed three more submissions and received a label expansion.","We submitted our new insulin glargine product in collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim for regulatory authorities in both the United States and Japan. We also submitted a marketing authorization application for insulin lispro U-200 to the European Medicines Agency. And we received approval to update the U.S. Cialis label to include the use of once daily Cialis 5 milligrams with finasteride to improve urinary symptoms in patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia.","In business development, we entered into collaboration agreement with Pfizer to jointly develop and commercialize tanezumab, for the potential treatment of osteoarthritis pain, chronic low back pain, and cancer pain. And earlier this month, we announced the acquisition of CGRP antibody in Phase 2 for migraine prevention from Arteaus Therapeutics.","We are very excited about the clinical data underpinning this decision and look forward to publishing them in a leading medical journal. We also enter the final year of what we\u2019ve called \u201cYears YZ\u201d with the loss of U.S exclusivity for Cymbalta, in December. Cymbalta generated more than $5 billion in worldwide sales last year, making it one of the most commercially successful neuroscience brands in our industries history and one of only 20 brands including Zyprexa to exceed $5 billion in sales in a single year.","While we had not originally intended to pursue an authorized generic for Cymbalta, we did recently enter into an AG agreement with Prasco to provide a limited quantity of duloxetine. This will have a minimal positive impact on our 2014 revenue.","Finally, during Q4, we executed share repurchases totaling $500 million under our recently authorized $5 billion share repurchase program. For the full year, we distributed nearly $4 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.","Now let\u2019s discuss our financial performance for the quarter and the full year 2013. I will provide comments about our GAAP results and then discuss a few non-GAAP measures, to provide some additional insight into the underlying trends in our business.","On Slide 6, you can see that revenue in Q4, 2013 was nearly $6 billion or 2% below Q4, 2012. We are pleased with the double-digit growth for Humalog, Cialis, Forteo, Strattera and Evista and the Tradjenta revenue more than doubled. The strong revenue performance nearly offset lower U.S Cymbalta sales.","Excluding Cymbalta in the U.S the rest of our worldwide revenue grew nearly 9%. Gross margin as a percent of revenue decreased 2.9 percentage points driven by the loss of Cymbalta\u2019s U.S exclusivity and by the impact of foreign exchange rates on international inventory sold, partially offset by higher prices.","This quarter foreign exchange rates on international inventory sold have a negative impact on our gross margin. However, in Q4, 2012, foreign exchange rates on international inventory sold provided a benefit to our gross margin. Excluding this FX effect from both 2012 and 2013, gross margin as a percent of revenue declined from 78.5% to 77.0% or 1.5 percentage points. As in past quarters, we\u2019ve included a supplementary slide providing our gross margin percent for the last 10 quarters with and without this FX effect.","Non-GAAP measures are shown on Slide 7. Total operating expense defined as the sum of R&D and SG&A was flat versus Q4, 2012. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses were down 1%, while R&D was up 1%. The reduction in marketing, selling and administrative expenses was due to the restructuring of a U.S commercial organization that occurred in mid 2013, lower marketing expenses for Cymbalta in the U.S and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates partially offset by increased marketing spend on other products. The growth in R&D expenses was driven by both research and clinical development activity partially offset by lower milestone payments.","As mentioned on our 2014 guidance call, we expect a late stage clinical trial cost to decline substantially this year. Other income and expense was net income of $9 million in Q4, 2013 compared to a net expense of $52 million in the fourth quarter 2012. This difference is primarily due to milestone payments totaling $40 million received from Boehringer Ingelheim for the submissions of our insulin glargine product in the United States and Japan.","Our tax rate was 20.5%, a decrease of 1.8 percentage points compared to the same quarter last year, primarily due to the lapse of the R&D tax credit in 2012. At the bottom line, net income declined 16%. The smaller decrease in earnings per share of 13% reflects the benefit of share repurchases. Ilissa?","Ilissa Rassner","Thanks, Phil. Let me highlight a few full year results shown on Slide 8. Revenue increased 2% driven by growth of Humalog, Tradjenta, Alimta, Forteo, Cymbalta, Strattera and Humulin.","Total operating expenses in 2013 decreased 1% driven by lower selling and marketing expenses, partially offset by a 5% increase in R&D expenses. Finally, net income increased 19% and EPS increased 22%.","The dynamics in our full year results reflect the execution of our strategy for managing one of the industries most challenging theories of patent expiration. Driving strong performance in our growth areas and in our marketed brands that retain patent protection, while increasing productivity across our business to fund R&D necessary to fuel our future growth.","Our fourth quarter results remind us that 2014 is the most financially challenging year in this YZ period. We are prepared for this challenge and our position to return to growth and expand margins in 2015 and beyond. Slide 9 provides a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS. Additional details about our reported earnings are available in today\u2019s earnings press release.","Moving to Slide 10, you can see the total revenue decline of 2% in Q4, 2013 shown in the yellow box on the middle of the page, was driven by a negative volume impact of 5% and a negative foreign exchange impact of 2% partially offset by a favorable price impact of 4%.","By geography you will notice that U.S volume decreased 17%. This is due to the loss of exclusivity for Cymbalta. Excluding Cymbalta, U.S pharma volume increased more than 5%. In Australia, Canada and Europe or ACE, you will see a negative 5% price impact. This quarter\u2019s price decline in ACE was slightly higher than prior quarters since we\u2019re no longer recognizing amortization of the upfront payment by Daiichi Sankyo for Evista rights.","Favorable adjustments in a number of countries in Q4, 2012 also led to a negative year-on-year comparison. Excluding these items, the price decline in ACE is consistent with prior quarters' declines.","In Japan, we had another quarter of very strong volume growth, up 17% driven primarily by Evista, Forteo, Tradjenta, Strattera, Zyprexa and Cymbalta. That strong volume growth was again offset by the weakening of the yen. We expect this robust growth to continue in 2014 as many of these products have several years of exclusivity remaining.","Turning to emerging markets, we are pleased with the revenue growth of 7% in the face of a 4% negative impact from foreign exchange. Volume growth was a robust 13% driven by strong performance in many countries in Latin and South America, the Middle East and Africa. China volume grew 7%.","Elanco Animal Health delivered revenue growth of 4%. Excluding FX, Elanco grew 6% in performance terms. This performance growth was driven by higher prices for both food and companion animal products as well as by volume growth for food animal products. This was partially offset by a volume decline for companion animal products. Overall, we continued to be pleased with Elanco performance and our well positioned to continue to outperform the industry.","Slide 11 shows the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates on our 2013 results. For both Q4 and full year 2013, FX had a negative effect on revenue growth. In terms of cost of goods sold, we saw a smaller benefit from the FX effect on international inventory sold in 2013 versus 2012. As a result, foreign exchange had a substantial negative effect on growth and operating income and earnings per share.","Now, let me turn the call over to Derica.","Derica Rice","Thanks, Ilissa. Slide 12 shows our pipeline as of January 23. Changes since our last earnings call are highlighted with green arrows showing progression and red arrows showing attrition. You notice that we've removed liprotamase from the pipeline. Given our corporate investment priorities, Lilly will not be pursuing further development of this molecule.","We began Phase 2 testing of the tau imaging agent that is being developed by our Avid radiopharmaceutical subsidiary. We started Phase 1 testing for five assets and as Phil mentioned earlier, we added Tanezumab to our Phase 3 portfolio to a collaboration with Pfizer. Finally, we terminated Phase 3 development of Edivoxetine and discontinued development of three Phase 2 assets and one Phase 1 asset.","With the number of encouraging data readouts in 2013, eight assets in Phase 3, four assets under regulatory review and more submission as possible this year, we're confident in our ability to return to growth post 2014. I would also like to point out that last month, we completed enrollment and accelerate the Phase 3 trial evaluating evacetrapib in patients with established atherosclerosis at high risk for experiencing a cardiovascular event.","We successfully expedited this trial enrolling 12,000 patients in just over 12 months. As a result, we have accelerated the last patient visit for this study to January of 2016. This is a great achievement by our evacetrapib team and we believe this speaks to the significant unmet patient need.","Based on lowering of LDL alone, we believe it is possible to achieve the primary endpoint with significant statistical power. We're also encouraged by the pharmacokinetic profile of evacetrapib as we've observed no clinically meaningful blood levels of the drug at four to six weeks after discontinuation. We continue to be optimistic about the potential for this molecule to reduce CV events in the patient population being steady.","Also, just last week results were published in the New England Journal of Medicine from the EXPEDITION and EXPEDITION 2 studies evaluating Solanezumab in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. You may recall that in a pre-specified secondary analysis of patients with mild Alzheimer's disease pooled across both studies, we saw a 34% reduction in cognitive decline as measured by ADAS-Cog14 and we saw an 18% reduction in functional decline as measured by ADCS-IADL.","We're now conducting a study called EXPEDITION 3 targeted to specifically a patient that we believe are most likely to benefit from treatment with Solanezumab. Patients with mild Alzheimer's disease will test positive for the presence of amyloid pathology. In August of last year the first patients were dosed in this study and we continue to target study completion by the end of 2016. Currently, there are no treatments for Alzheimer's that impact the underlying disease and we remain encouraged by the Solanezumab data.","While we understand investor interest will be focused on near-term launches and our diabetes and oncology businesses, with mid-term launch opportunities coming from our autoimmune portfolio, we do not want you to lose sight of these important opportunities for potential first-in-class medicines later this decade.","Next, let me provide a recap of how key events played out in 2013, remind you of our key events for 2014 and quickly review our 2014 financial guidance. Now as has become customary when we roll out our full year financial guidance, we provide you a list of key events for the year. And we update this list quarterly so you can track our progress.","As illustrated by the green checkmarks on Slide 13, you can see that we made significant advances in our pipeline in 2013. We had positive data readouts for five Phase 3 assets and completed regulatory submissions for four, while continuing to expect the necitumumab submission to be completed by the end of this year.","We initiated the Phase 3 study for Solanezumab in patients with mild Alzheimer's disease. We defended Alimta method-of-use patent in a district court in Indianapolis, and as Phil mentioned we've entered the final year of Years YZ with the expiration of Cymbalta's U.S. patent.","2013 was a very productive year and we expect 2014 to be another busy year with significant pipeline activity and the potential for multiple product launches. While I will not go through each item on Slide 14, we're excited about the opportunities we have to continue to advance our pipeline and the shared data that will not only help investors better judge our growth potential, but also convey why we view this year as a new beginning in the next phase of Lilly's rich history.","We have the potential to initiate Phase 3 studies for two assets; our CDK4\/6 inhibitor for cancer and our anti-sclerostin antibody for osteoporosis. With respect to Phase 3 data, we expect internal data readout leading to top line press releases or external detailed data disclosures for six of the eight Phase 3 assets and for all four of the assets that are in the regulatory review. We also expect regulatory action for each of those four assets.","With respect to Alimta method-of-use patent, we anticipate a ruling in the first half of this year. Now as a reminder, regardless of the district court decision, we would expect one or more appeals to be made to the court of appeals for the federal circuit before litigation is resolved. And finally, we will lose patent protection for Evista in the U.S. in March and data package exclusivity for Cymbalta will expire in Europe in the second half of this year, although we do not expect generic duloxetine to enter the European market until 2015.","Now moving on to our financial guidance for 2014, we are reconfirming the 2014 guidance that was issued earlier this month. If you are looking for additional color commentary on our 2014 guidance, please refer to today's press release as well as the Investor section of lilly.com where you'll find the slides and audio from our January 7 guidance call.","Slide 16 provides a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS for 2013 and the associated growth rates from these numbers to our 2014 guidance. In summary, we're pleased with the progress we made in 2013 implementing our three strategic priorities. One, replenishing and advancing our pipeline; two, driving strong performance of our marketed brands in key growth areas and three, increasing productivity and reducing our cost structure.","Our 2013 financial results was strong. Eight of our products exceeded $1 billion in annual sales. Japan and China delivered double-digit volume growth and Elanco continued to exceed overall industry growth. As Phil stated earlier in the call, excluding Cymbalta in the U.S., our world-wide revenue grew a robust 9% in Q4. This strong performance combined with our discipline in managing costs generated nearly $6 billion of operating cash flow, covering capital expenditures of $1 billion our dividend of $2.1 billion and $1.7 billion of share repurchases.","As we turn to this year we anticipate a number of clinical trial readouts, data presentations and regulatory submissions. Most important we also expect to launch multiple products with more to follow in the coming years allowing Lilly to return to growth and expand margins post 2014.","So as I said on our guidance call earlier this month, far from seeing 2014 as the low point in our journey through one of the industries' most challenging patent cliffs, we see this year as an inflection point leading to our bright future. We continue to believe that our innovation strategy is the right one to benefit patients and create value for our shareholders. We look forward to providing more updates as we continue to execute this strategy.","This concludes our prepared remarks and now we\u2019ll take your questions. Operator, the first caller please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) We\u2019ll go to the line of Steve Scala with Cowen. Please go ahead.","Steve Scala - Cowen & Co.","Well, thank you. I have three questions. First, the R&D as a percent of sales in Q4 is the highest it's been in at least a decade and higher than the YZ guidance and 2014 guidance. So what were the particular dynamics around this spend in Q4. Secondly, assuming that Sanofi does sue Lilly in the next few days over the filing of the insulin glargine biosimilar; do you believe that they will enjoy the full 30 months or does Lilly believe a quicker resolution can be gained? And then lastly your comment about the blood levels of either cetrapib four to six weeks after a discontinuation, I guess was meant to contrast it with anacetrapib\u2019s very long half-life, other than some theoretical concern about long half-life\u2019s. What specifically should we be concerned with anacetrapib? Thank you.","Phil Johnson","Steve thanks for the question. So for the R&D percent we\u2019ll have, Derica provide a comment there. I\u2019ll then comment on the Sanofi question, maybe let Jan comment for the anacetrapib accumulation comment from the call text. Derica.","Derica Rice","Sure. Hi, Steve, good morning. Hey, when we look at our Q4 spend, we are very pleased with how we came in. As it relates to R&D that spend was driven by additional investments in our research as well as some clinical development. And we did have the opportunity to make some incremental investments in the fourth quarter both in R&D as well as in SGA and some of that was also in preparation for the upcoming launches that we anticipate later this year in 2014.","Phil Johnson","And then Steve, this is Phil, for your question on Sanofi and whether should they sue us; they would enjoy the full benefit of the 30 months, for the 30 month stay. At this point it's premature to speculate on how that may play out. We have as its required notified Sanofi of our acceptance of our filing with the FDA, and that\u2019s where things stand as of today. So there maybe more developments in the future, but it will be premature to comment at this time. Jan?","Jan Lundberg","Regarding the half-life\u2019s, we see this more as a general comment here that most medicines on the market today be category as small molecules usually have a short half-life which is actually what you want, should there be any unforeseen side effects and always when you do large Phase 3 clinical trials, that this isn\u2019t unknown until you have all the data. So, I think you should see this just as a very unusual situation that you have a small molecular agent with this very long half-life that anacetrapib has and it remains to be seen. Now then if there are any side effects, what is the consequences?","Phil Johnson","Thank you, Jan. Akhili, next caller please.","Operator","We\u2019ll go to the line of Mark Schoenebaum with ISI Group.","Mark Schoenebaum - ISI Group","Hi, its Mark can you hear me? Sorry about that.","Phil Johnson","Yes, we can.","Mark Schoenebaum - ISI Group","Okay, sorry about that. Hey, I just wanted to ask a quick question on Ramucirumab. The second line lung cancer trial that\u2019s ongoing. Our understanding is that a lot of those patients are Avastin na\u00efve in that trial. Is that something that you could help us, you could confirm or deny possibly. And then what is the hypothesis that Ram may have a better risk benefit in the squamous population than Avastin. And then finally on AWARD-6, is non-purity enough to maximize the potential of that product. And most importantly, congratulations to Phil and Derica on your recognition (indiscernible).","Phil Johnson","Thanks Mark. We aren\u2019t quite in a level of being inducting to the hall of fame yet, but thanks for the shout. Hey, for the Ramucirumab question, second-line lung, Travis do you want to pick a shot at that. And then Travis or Jan if you want to comment maybe on the hypothesis of why Ramucirumab may or may not be better than Avastin in the squamous population, and then I'll handle the question that you have Mark, on the non-inferiority already for (indiscernible).","Travis Coy","So Mark for REVEL which is our second-line lung cancer trial with Ramucirumab plus paclitaxel. I think you asked, and I am going to make sure I get this right, that a lot of the patients and Avastin na\u00efve, so you\u2019re getting to the point where we have allowed for some patients to be treated with Avastin, I would classify that as a small number that patients that will be treated with Avastin in the first line.","Mark Schoenebaum - ISI Group","Great. And any commentary on the hypothesis of why we maybe better in squamous relative to Avastin; Jan any thoughts on the two molecules?","Jan Lundberg","Clearly we need to see the final data. And I can just refer to as we have said before that, Ram and Avastin had different mechanism of action, and Ram there not only interferes in a way then with the receptor activation, but it also internalizes the receptor whilst then Avastin is only blocking one of the younger genesis mediators, but in the end we need to see the data.","Phil Johnson","Yeah, and as we talked about in the past we\u2019ve been very pleased that we say mono-therapy efficacy in advanced gastro cancer, and then obviously reinforced with the combination efficacy that we saw in that similar setting. But again until we have the data from the other tumor types, if I would be pre mature to comment whether the differences that Jan articulated will lead to either tolerability, safety or efficacy differences. And we have no direct head-to-head as well as a reminder. For the non-inferiority for the AWARD-6 trial, this is a trial that is set up with the intent of showing non-inferiority. We have received a number of investor questions, analysis questions over the last month or so around whether we\u2019re attempting to show non-inferiority or whether we\u2019re really hoping in attempting to show superiority. And it is to show non-inferiority versus the highest dose in a forced titration trial of Victoza. There had been two other competitive molecules that have run similar trials and have failed to show non-inferiority. We would definitely look at showing non-inferiority with a high dose of Victoza as being a win in achieving our goals toward that study. If we do achieve non-inferiority we certainly will test for superiority, but it would not be our expectation that that would be a high likelihood at current given the profiles of the two molecules as we know them.","Jan Lundberg","I think the other, this is Jan, likewise I think the other thing is just the presentation of the product to launch weekly format. The straight forward nature of the injection and the injection device which many of our investors were able to see for themselves when we had our meeting here in October, so I think having solid non-inferiority data across the whole broad spectrum of comparators coupled with the product itself I think should give us a light there.","Phil Johnson","And one of the main reasons for doing the study Mark was essentially from a pricing reimbursement and access perspective. You might do your own research on price levels, but essentially you got a price level in the marketplace sort of base price level defined by BYDUREON, Byetta and the 1.2 milligram dose of Victoza, which means that the 1.8 actually carries a 50% premium to that. So showing non-inferiority with that particular dose we believe would place us in a good stat as we have those discussions with payers downstream.","Mark Schoenebaum - ISI Group","Thank you.","Phil Johnson","You\u2019re welcome. Akhili, next caller please?","Operator","We\u2019ll go to the line of Chris Schott with JPMorgan.","Chris Schott - JPMorgan","Great, thanks very much. Two questions, the first is on the CDK 4\/6 program. Can you just talk a little bit more about the timelines in breast cancer here? I guess specifically once you start the Phase 3, how quickly do you think you can enroll and see outcomes from your study. And while we\u2019re talking about that, can you just also elaborate a little more of the impact you think in early Pfizer filing an approval, if that happened it would have on the competitive dynamics in this space. The second question I had was on diabetes. We\u2019re seeing some of these national formularies moving to a single covered product in any given category not just tier 2 or 3 but a single product. Can you give us, what percent of market in your view is impacted by those national formularies? And once a provider selects a preferred product, how difficult is it going to be or would it be to displace that product once someone is down to the effort of actually moving over in a particular account et cetera, I should understand competitive dynamics going forward as this trend plays through? Thanks very much.","Phil Johnson","Thanks Chris, so the CDK 4\/6, you want to go ahead and start us off Travis.","Travis Coy","Yes. So Chris, unfortunately I can\u2019t directly answer your question because we have not yet announced which tumors we'll be pursuing for Phase 3 development, but do hope to \u2013 as I mentioned on the guidance call in early January, do hope to get you further data from both lung and breast from our kind of Phase 1b\/cohort expansions that we performed as part of that trial in the first half of this year as well as announced which tumors we do intend to take forward in Phase 3 in the first half of this year.","John Lechleiter","Then on the diabetes questions that you had, Chris, so I don't think we have a percent of covered lives that would be our national formulary, for example, or somewhat like ESI but it is only a portion of their business, for example. I guess maybe a better way to answer your question would be to point that these more highly controlled formularies are a minority of the business in the U.S. I think the best evidence for that is that you can look into the last two, three years as you've seen some of these larger plans switch to sole source for one of the two insulin, you've seen shares moderate maybe by a couple of percentage points in the overall market share for the mealtime insulin. So again, these are a sizable swing but it's not like you're having the majority of the market moving at any one point in time. In terms of switching, there certainly are difficulties in switching so I think payors from our experience don't do this lightly and I think it'd be unlikely over time to be switching every two or three years from one product to another. We continue to think that having multiple products available in the class is in the best interest of patients and actually we think long-term probably in the best interest of payors as well, so they can continue to have a competitive dynamic and not have a significant amount of inconvenience for patients but they're trying to get into their plans as they make these kinds of decisions. So we'll continue to as we have in the past argue for dual access on the various products that we are involved in selling and where that's possible, that's great. If not, then we'll have to make the decisions that we need to make, have our products available to patients here in the U.S. market.","Phil Johnson","Akhili, next caller please.","Operator","That will come from the line of Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs","Thank you. John, this is a question for you. You guys have been kind of quiet on the M&A front. We've seen tremendous amounts of M&A across other sectors in healthcare and I'm just wondering if you can comment on your appetite for M&A? Lilly has been in a rumor recently to be interested in an oncology company, but just talk about the importance of M&A to achieving your goals and what specific areas you'd be interested in? And at the same time, in your discussion about business development maybe if you can throw in there your views on Elanco and how you see that business going forward, if you would consider as some of your competitors have done spinning that business out? Thanks.","John Lechleiter","Okay. Thanks Jami for the question. On the pharma side we continue to have no appetite for large scale M&A in the pharma business. If we were to undertake smaller kind of acquisitions, I think the best way to think about that is they would have to complement or strengthen areas of focus \u2013 our therapeutic areas of focus or provide us with additional coverage or leverage in key geographies. With respect to Elanco, I think we've said that we intend to be buyers and not sellers in the Animal Health space. We've done more or less one or two acquisitions, smaller acquisitions every year for the past five or six years. We've growth this business nicely over this period through a combination actually of inorganic moves and organic growth. We're going to be \u2013 continue to be interested in M&A in the Animal Health area that helps us increase our coverage in the area of vaccines and also provide us with a greater presence in some of the key emerging markets. I will say obviously we completed our largest M&A in our history, about five years ago and based on the data that we've seen for ramucirumab and necitumumab, that seems to be playing out quite well. And I'm also pleased that as we begin to exit this YZ period, we do so with a very strong balance sheet.","Phil Johnson","Thanks, John. Akhili, next caller please.","Operator","We'll go to the line of Gregg Gilbert with Bank of America.","Gregg Gilbert - Bank of America","I have a few. Thanks John for that very clear description of M&A. If we are to think \u2013 for John Lechleiter, if we were to think a 2014 as a year of (indiscernible) which hopefully sets you up for some nice growth for several years based on sort of singles and doubles as the Street sees them, do you think there's any other key shareholder value drivers that investors don't fully appreciate that perhaps are clear in your mind? My other question is on the ram. I know you're ready to launch ram in gastric as quickly after it happens, but do you think the system's ready to provide access for docs to use the product in a broader patient population as is probably the case in your market research? And then AWARD-6, what's the most granular timing you can offer? Phil, I'm sure some folks will ask it after the call. Thanks.","Phil Johnson","Sure. So, John do you want to start out with the first question, maybe Travis answer the question on ramucirumab and I'll take the AWARD-6 timing question.","John Lechleiter","Gregg, I think first of all while we intended to get back on a growth trajectory through the launch of new products, I think that the fourth quarter was 9% underlying growth in those products not affected by essentially other than Cymbalta U.S. situation. I think if all goes well for solid growth from this basket of currently marketed products that we have, that's going to be important to sort of underpin our launches in the years ahead. We continue to do very well in Japan. I think our volume growth in Japan for the year was 13%. We're now squarely in that top 20 in Japan. We continue to on an annual basis to more or less lead that market in growth across all of our major competitors; global pharma and the local Japanese company. In China, despite a slowdown, we saw 12% revenue growth in China for the year. I continue to believe that emerging markets represented good investment. Keep in mind, emerging markets are a relatively smaller piece of Lilly's than they are many other companies. I mean typically our larger competitors have about 20% of revenue in emerging markets. I think we're closer to about 12%. I look at that as a key opportunity for growth. We have a great business in Latin America. For example, we're expanding our presence in other countries where traditionally we've not have a presence there. So I think that's another area of interest. We talked about Elanco already. We're very bullish on Elanco's prospects. We see good positive synergies between Elanco and Lilly and yet we believe Elanco has the operating independence that it needs to compete with competitors that are reshaping themselves. I think in terms of value creation, so we're launching a cancer drug hopefully this year and two drugs in type 2 diabetes. Those are launching the infrastructures that are well built out and so we've called that out to investors but I think that's important to keep in mind. The other piece was just the work we've done on infrastructure. I mean this is a different company today than the company of the last decade. We've had to prepare for this very, very difficult period and we've made some choices. We haven't wasted the crisis, as the old saying goes. We're more agile, we're leaner. I think we're better operators today and I believe that will pay off in terms of success to these launches that lie up ahead of us.","Phil Johnson","Thanks, John. Travis?","Travis Coy","Thanks, Gregg. With respect to your question on ramucirumab, obviously we're very pleased that we now have two positives Phase 3 trials for gastric cancer. Look forward to receiving the regulatory action for the regard submission in the U.S. Q2 of this year and then look forward to submitting the RAINBOW data to the U.S. in the first half of this year. Outside of gastric cancer, clearly we're looking forward to getting the data from the three ongoing trials that we have and second-line lung, second-line liver and second-line metastatic colorectal cancer. We'll look to use that data and obviously take that data on board and expand that potentially into further development opportunities for ram. So we're very pleased with the prospects we have with ramucirumab and look forward to giving those three data points on lung, liver and colorectal later this year.","Phil Johnson","Gregg, the strength of the data will likely also dictate not only physicians' interest in prescribing but also kind of access and the speed of access that we might be able to achieve. For AWARD-6 timing, we would look to press release, the top line results of this study. Although this is not sort of a pivotal study for our registrations, submissions to regulators, we recognize that this trial was of high interest to the investment community so we do intend to have a top line press release of whatever the outcome is and we would expect from a timing perspective that that would be a release we'll be issuing here in the first quarter of the year and hopefully have a chance, if the timing lines up, to present that data at a medical meeting in the middle part of the year.","Akhili, next caller please.","Operator","We will go to the line of David Risinger with Morgan Stanley.","David Risinger - Morgan Stanley","Yes, thanks very much. I have a couple of questions please. First, maybe Derica, you could just talk about any wholesaler inventory changes of note in the fourth quarter and how you finish the year? And then second, with respect to Alimta in the EU, could you please discuss what we should expect from the appellate court of patent decision in terms of timing in \u201914 and maybe you can just frame it for us and I\u2019m forgetting exactly which countries this decision will apply to, but if you could discuss that, and I think that covers it. Thank you.","Phil Johnson","Great Dave. Thank you very much. Derica, on the wholesaler inventory?","Derica Rice","Hi, Dave. Good morning. On the whole -- we did have in the U.S some wholesaler inventory build. One other phenomenon we did see also is that while that was building at the wholesaler level, we believe that there was a depletion of inventory at the retail level. So long-term we believe this year, it will work itself out and we\u2019re not concerned about that goal as we think about our 2014 outlook.","Phil Johnson","Great. And then our Alimta in the EU, Dave, real quick summary of a landscape there, so there is one action you didn\u2019t act -- ask about specifically, but I do want to comment on which is the European Patent Office where the patent itself had been challenged. You may recall that the initial hearing judgment went in Lilly\u2019s favor and that has now been appealed to the Board of Interferences within the European Patent Office. We still have no date for that hearing. Separately from the proceedings in the European Patent Office, there are two countries that have ongoing legal proceeding. The first is Germany where I believe there is a trial that could come as early as March of this year and then U.K. which is in April. In the future, I can tell it will be a single European Patent Court to hear and decide cases, more broadly across the European Union. That's not the case right now, so the cases that will be heard in Germany and U.K. would explicitly apply to those markets in other countries based on those rulings we have to make their own determination.","David Risinger - Morgan Stanley","Yes, just one quick follow-up. Can you just give us a framework for what percentage of the ex-U.S Alimta sales come from the EU?","Phil Johnson","Sure. I will see if we can grab that here relatively quickly from -- the secret book (indiscernible) that you guys have this detail just, if you have not been following this little bi quietly, but in the October call, Q3 call, you may have seen that we expanded the disclosures for product sales, breaking out international sales by the ACE region, which is Australia, Canada, Europe, Japan and emerging markets to respond to some request that we had to provide much more clarity around product sales and particular for Japan and emerging markets. Hopefully you find that as interest. I\u2019m looking actually at the public book now rather than the secret book. So in the fourth quarter our international total Alimta sales were about $394 million. About $235 million of that Dave came from the ACE region. The vast majority of which would have been coming from Europe itself. And we had about another $90 million roughly coming from Japan and almost $70 million from the emerging markets.","David Risinger - Morgan Stanley","Got it. Thanks so much.","Phil Johnson","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","We will go next to the line of Tim Anderson with Sanford Bernstein.","Tim Anderson - Sanford Bernstein","Thank you. Couple of questions. One, necitumumab how confident are you that the drug is approvable in lung, now that you have positive results in hand, at your top line last fall and what\u2019s the development program from here? We\u2019ve seen that with positive lung results, you would be pushing into broader development, but I haven\u2019t heard you yet articulate what\u2019s next? Are you going to hold off during anything until you see whether the drug gets approved in lung? And second question on your two insulins, novel basal and insulin glargine, wondering if you can characterize what you think the bigger commercial opportunity would be with either of those drugs, when you look at over say the next five years?","Phil Johnson","Great, Tim. Thanks for the question. So, in terms of the confidence in necitumumab being approvable and also thoughts on the development plan from here, maybe we will start with Travis and Jan, if you have any thoughts you would like to add and then I will comment on the comment you had on the opportunity with the two basal insulins.","Travis Coy","Yes, Tim this is Travis. I would say we are pleased with the top line results of improving overall survival in front line squamous non-small cell lung cancer. Clearly squamous non-small cell lung cancer has been one of those more difficult -- I'll call it more difficult diseases to treat, say vis-\u00e0-vis non-squam. At this time, we\u2019re pleased with the risk benefit profile we have and look forward to getting those more detailed data in front of you at ASCO. With respect to next steps, cylinder evaluation as to what next steps may look like for necitumumab development. So hopefully we\u2019ll have more details to share later on that this year.","Phil Johnson","And then Tim, in terms of the two insulin, so with the insulin glargine product, we see ourselves very well positioned as one of the few companies that\u2019s well positioned to have success with this kind of opportunity given the expertise we have in the space, the ongoing commitment to developing devices over time, strong relationships that we have with physicians. We believe this is a very important opportunity for us to really begin to establish a foothold in the Basal Insulin segment which we\u2019ve really not been participating in up until this point. The commercial opportunity for the Novel Basal Insulin could be very substantial, but it really will depend upon that clinical profile that we see in the Phase 3 trials. There were some very encouraging signs that we saw in Phase 2 as we share with you at ABA and in subsequent meeting with the profiles that we saw for reduction in HbA1c, the weight profile, reduction in all time insulin usage relative to the current standard of care, Basal Insulin which is these are confirmed at multiple, these are confirmed in the Phase 3 trials couldn\u2019t be that probably to have a very substantial opportunity. We have also been very clear that if this product does not differentiate substantially from Lantus, if I\u2019m more likely then not, that it would not be launched and not be a viable product and therefore our efforts we focus really on the insulin glargine product solely. So, again until we see the data it's very difficult to know. We do have trials for the Novel Basal Insulin that began to wrap up late last year with one of them, a number of them then over Q1, Q2 and Q3 of this year we would hope to have enough of those trials in house probably by the middle part of the year, will be able to issue a top line press release updating all of you on the progress to date with those trials. So, encouraged and anxious for those outcomes. Stay tuned for a top line later this year. Akhili, next caller please?","Operator","We\u2019ll go to the line of John Boris with SunTrust Robinson. Please go ahead.","John Boris - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thanks for taking the questions and congratulations on the results. Just on Ramucirumab and your filing in Japan, is it possible just to get an update on the timing of any additional work that needs to go on there and the timing for the filing. And then secondly a question for Jan, just on the CDK 4\/6, there\u2019s a lot of preclinical data out there, but what are the main features your advantages and benefits of your CDK relative to the other compounds when you evaluate them and consider taking -- when you consider evaluating to take it into Phase 3 development? Thanks.","Phil Johnson","Thanks, John. Travis, do you want to start?","Travis Coy","Yeah, thanks, John. So we do have a bit of an update versus the guidance call that we provide -- guidance call provided earlier on the Japanese filing for Ramucirumab which is again is to remind folks it's based on the rainbow data where we had about a third of the patients were from Asian countries. So, we look to be able to file that submission by the end of this year.","Phil Johnson","Jan?","Jan Lundberg","Okay, so regarding CDK 4\/6 as you know this is a very exciting area and but what we have seen on our compound and in the initial clinical trials that shows a single agent activity which wasn\u2019t really I think what Pfizer emphasized for their molecules. So here we see a potential efficacy benefit. Further more we can do continuous dosing without interruption based on our safety profile. And there the Pfizer molecule had issues and has to have intermittent dosing and we believe that potentially to have a continuous coverage can gain efficacy.","Phil Johnson","Thank you, Jan.","John Boris - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thanks.","Phil Johnson","You\u2019re welcome John. Akhili, next caller please?","Operator","We\u2019ll go to the line of Vamil Divan with Credit Suisse.","Vamil Divan - Credit Suisse","Yes, thanks for taking the question. Just two that I have; one on Ixekizumab, I appreciate the update you guys gave there on the trial. Just wondering if there\u2019s any interim reason you could point us to and the timing of when those might occur now just that might lead to the trial or data earlier than the, I guess, 2016 timeframe you mentioned. And the other one just on the autoimmune side, (indiscernible) you had today in terms of biosimilar [ph], just a status of how that the Phase 2b study is going there. And if you could also talk about how you are looking at making a decision there to moving into Phase 3, does it separate from waiting to see the data exceed or is there some \u2013 are you going to look to see how those fair against each other just given Lilly's [ph] partnered obviously with (indiscernible)? Thanks.","Phil Johnson","Okay. Jan would you like to take the Ixekizumab question and Jan and Travis comment on the autoimmune please.","Jan Lundberg","Yes. There is room for an interim analysis on the Ixekizumab which we don't want really to comment on with the exact timing of. If you refer to the ongoing Phase 2 trials, was that the psoriasis indication then where we have data which we are currently evaluating and I think we will communicate the first four but in due course.","Travis Coy","(Indiscernible) we actually do look to disclose that psoriasis data in the first half of this year.","Phil Johnson","Akhili, our next caller please.","Operator","We'll go to the line of Marc Goodman with UBS.","Marc Goodman - UBS","Yes, good morning. You talked a little bit about the emerging markets. Can you talk about some of the countries where you are making investments? And second, China seems to have slowed in the fourth quarter but it did well throughout the year, so I'm just curious is there anything, is there any trend going on, was there something that happened in the fourth quarter specifically? And if so, has it carried over into January? And then when you answered the question about the biosimilar for Lantus before, I wasn't sure whether \u2013 did you confirm that you've actually filed a Paragraph 4 and notified the branded company? And then third just on diabetes, how do you see this market playing out with respect to the SGL-2s and the DPP-4s and are you hearing anything behind-the-scenes on how (indiscernible) is doing and if the SGL-2 is moving in front of DPP-4 as far as therapy? Thanks.","Phil Johnson","Thanks, Marc. We'll have Derica answer the first question about emerging markets, where we're investing and what we're seeing in terms of the growth in the fourth quarter and then I'll take your diabetes questions.","Derica Rice","Sure. Marc, in terms of the emerging markets, as John indicated earlier, clearly China is a key beachhead at least for Lilly within the grouping of emerging markets, but other markets such as Brazil, Mexico, Korea, Russia, Turkey as well as India are key footprints for us as we think about leveraging some of the key therapeutic areas that are doing well in those markets today which are diabetes and oncology, which is obviously a quarter of what we do. So we continue to see emerging markets as a strong opportunity for us. In regards to your particular question around China itself, overall we have seen the China market growth slowing, okay, so that is a factor that we're picking up, but it's still very robust when you compare it relative to the rest of the world. So, we don't see backing off investment and our focus in that market. Another factor that we believe is affecting the growth in that market at least in 2013 was the anticorruption scandal that was going on there and it was really affecting primarily the multinational big pharma companies there. Hopefully that will begin to subside as we were closing our 2013 and we're not anticipating any significant re-impact in that in 2014.","Phil Johnson","Then Marc on your question for [Technical Difficulty] actually quite pleased to see the kind of uptake that (indiscernible) has experienced in the U.S. marketplace in particular. There was a lot of discussion prior to the approval and launch of that product that many observers were thinking this product class was not going to have a significant adoption by physicians. So I think we're pleased as observers who could be coming relatively soon with one of our own and also potentially the first to have a combination product of a DPP-4 with a SGLT2 but there seems to be pretty good acceptance for this mechanism and the efficacy, tolerability, safety profile that at least the (indiscernible) carries. So we're looking forward to coming into the marketplace ourselves as well. The DPP-4 market growth has slowed, in part due to the uptake of canagliflozin. We do expect long-term with the underlying demographics and market dynamics, we'll continue to see robust growth in both of these areas of the oral diabetes class; so looking forward to participating in both these classes going forward.","Akhili, next caller please.","Operator","We'll go to the line of Alex Arfaei with BMO Capital Markets.","Alex Arfaei - BMO Capital Markets","Good morning. Thank you for taking the question. Following up on the SGLT2, are there any updates on the manufacturing issues you discussed on your last call? And when can you expect a resolution? And also you don't have the ample Phase 3 trials listed as external readout. I'm wondering if that's for competitive reasons or whether it's up to your partner. Thank you.","Phil Johnson","Great. So I'll take you questions. Alex, this is Phil. May take the second one first. We actually had many of those trials presented at ADA last year and that was sort of the big coming-out party, if you will, for the data from that Phase 3 program. Not all of the trials were presented there. So as we go through 2014, I'm sure we'll additional data presentations. But again, the bulk of that data wasn't presented at ADA last year. In terms of the timing on the manufacturing issues, the re-inspection, the BI [ph] we'll be having pursuant to their warning letter, there are no updates at this point in time. As we mentioned on the guidance call, there is re-inspections scheduled for the first quarter and also coming up in the not-too-distant future have the potential action date for the submission that we have from PEG lispro [ph]. So we'll keep you guys appraised as the situation evolves, but there are no updates from earlier this month.","Akhili, next caller please.","Operator","We'll go to the line of Seamus Fernandez with Leerink. Please go ahead.","Seamus Fernandez - Leerink Swann","Thanks very much. So I have a few questions. First, regarding PEG lispro, do you have any new data either from Phase 3 or other ongoing studies in-house? And if so, do these data provide any greater comfort around the liver safety of PEG lispro? Second on necitumumab, did the SQUIRE study include any pre-specified biomarker evaluations? And if so, could you just disclose what these pre-specified analyses were? Third, on CDK4\/6, can you remind us the specific expansion cohorts that will see more data on this year and maybe remind us the percent of lung cancer patients that have K-Ras mutant status? And then the last question is finally can you just update us on your plans for your TGF-beta in liver cancer given some of the promising data that you presented at ASCO-GI I believe? Thanks.","Phil Johnson","Okay. We were furiously writing everything here, so let's see if we got all these. So, let me start out with the PEG lispro question. As I mentioned earlier we have begun to have the first trial essentially wrap-up in that program. We won't provide a running commentary as a single trial comes out as we've done, for example with the dulaglutide trials where we waited until we had AWARDs 1, 3 and 5 before issuing a top line press release. We'll be doing the same thing with the studies for the Basel insulin PEG lispro. And then Squire, this was out of pre-specified biomarkers. I don't know, Travis, if you're able to find anything in our \u2013 we need to get back to you, Seamus, on the pre-specified biomarker question. I think there were some there but we don't have the details with us. So we'll follow-up on that one. The CDK 4\/6, the expansion cohorts, do you want to comment what those were, Travis?","Travis Coy","Yes. Those will be \u2013 we did expansion cohorts for a few tumors coming out of that Phase 1b. Most prominently were breast and lung, but I believe there were a couple of others, melanoma and potentially one other that I need to follow-up on, Seamus.","Phil Johnson","And there was a question on percent of K-Ras mutant, and Seamus were you asking about that with regard to colorectal or with regard to lung or what was your \u2013 I missed the tumor type you were asking about?","Seamus Fernandez - Leerink Swann","More with regard to lung.","Phil Johnson","Okay. We may need to follow-up on that, because I don't think we got that date with us. John, do you have anything on that one?","John Lechleiter","No. I think I can just say that we have included the K-Ras mutant as one potential interesting area.","Phil Johnson","And then the TGF-beta data presented as part of the recent medical meeting was definitely very encouraging. The team is working through, so what the next steps are for development of that molecule. And I think probably later this year that we can hopefully have an update for you on those plans.","Seamus Fernandez - Leerink Swann","Okay, great. Thank you.","Phil Johnson","Thanks, Seamus. Akhili, next caller please?","Operator","We will go to line of Jeff Holford with Jefferies.","Jeff Holford - Jefferies & Company","Hi. Thanks for taking my call. Just two questions around diabetes. First, if you could just -- a bit more color on the pricing you\u2019ve put through any recent pricing increases across the insulin portfolio as well as just a cumulative last 12 months price increases you had across the portfolio. Also just another question around the insulin glargine product. I think I\u2019m correct in saying you don\u2019t -- you have a device that\u2019s sort of public on notable use that is suitable for administrating a basal insulin in terms of the number of units that\u2019s required. We are unable to detect any patent application for such a device. So maybe if you could just talk about that a little bit where you sort of think you\u2019re and what\u2019s your long-term game plan with devices for the insulin glargine? Thank you.","Phil Johnson","Okay. So for the price increase piece you have, I don\u2019t think we have that with us. You can follow on Jeff after the call on the recent price increases. There were a couple of different price increases over the course of 2013. I think the last one in December, but we can follow-up you with the specific numbers for those. For the presentations we\u2019d use for commercialization of the insulin glargine product, we\u2019ve not been specific on our plans other than the state that we\u2019re definitely looking at multiple options. We also believe that we\u2019d be in a position to commercialize that products upon expiration of the Lantus compound patent in early 2015.","Jeff Holford - Jefferies & Company","Thank you.","Phil Johnson","You\u2019re welcome. Akhili, next caller please?","Operator","There are no further questions in queue from the phone.","Phil Johnson","All right, great. Well, thank you very much for your attention on today\u2019s call. We appreciate your interest in Eli Lilly & Company. Going forward, we will continue to do what we did today and on our guidance call, which has to exhaust the questions in the queue. Hopefully you will find that helpful to get your questions answered in a timely manner. We look forward to interacting with you at upcoming meetings, conferences, and keep you appraised of our progress which hopefully will be considerable this year in advancing the pipeline and beginning to launch new products to position ourselves for growth coming out of 2014.

At this time, all the participant lines are in a listen-only mode. There will be an opportunity for your questions, and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's call is being recorded.","I'll turn the conference now to Mr. Kevin Hern, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Kevin Hern","Good morning. Thank you for joining us for Eli Lilly and Company's Q4 2018 earnings call. I'm Kevin Hern, Vice President of Investor Relations. Joining me on today's call are Dave Ricks, Lilly's Chairman and CEO; Josh Smiley, our Chief Financial Officer; Dr. Dan Skovronsky, President of Lilly Research Laboratories; Christi Shaw, President of Lilly Bio-Medicines; Anne White, President of Lilly Oncology; and Enrique Conterno, President of Lilly Diabetes and Lilly USA. We're also joined by Kim Macko and Mike Czapar of the Investor Relations team.","During this conference call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors, including those listed on slide three and those outlined in our latest forms 10-K and 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It is not intended to be promotional, and is not sufficient for prescribing decisions.","I will now turn the call over to Dave for a summary of our progress in Q4.","Dave Ricks","Thanks, Kevin. We continued our strong performance in 2018 with a fourth quarter revenue growth of 5%, non-GAAP operating income growth of 15%, and non-GAAP EPS growth of 17%. Newer pharmaceutical products, which represented 38% of human pharma revenue in the quarter, continue to be the driver of our worldwide revenue growth, led by Trulicity, Taltz, Basaglar, Verzenio, and Jardiance. Highlights of our strong volume-based growth include 31% U.S. diabetes volume growth, and 11% total pharma volume growth. This was achieved despite the significant headwind from the loss of exclusivity of Cialis in the U.S.","We continue to see our year-over-year expansion in operating margins. Excluding the effect of FX on international inventory sold, Q4 non-GAAP operating income as a percent of revenue increased by over 165 basis points while investing in new product launches. We made significant progress with the pipeline, including the approval of Emgality for the prophylaxis of migraine, in Europe. The submission of Emgality for the prevention and treatment of cluster headache in the U.S., results from a phase 3 study of tanezumab in patients with moderate-to-severe osteoarthritis pain, and the results of two phase 3 studies of baricitinib in atopic dermatitis.","We also provided an update or announced the confirmatory Phase 3 study of Lartruvo in combination with doxorubicin for advanced or metastatic soft tissue sarcoma. This study did not meet the primary endpoint of overall survival, and there was no difference in survival between the study arms. We are now working with global regulators to determine the next steps for Lartruvo, and will present the announced data in an upcoming medical conference.","In terms of capital deployment, we continue to utilize our strong operating cash flow to access value-creating external innovation that will enhance our future growth prospects. We announced the definitive agreement to acquire Loxo Oncology, a biopharmaceutical focused on the development and commercialization of highly selective medicines for patients with genomically-defined cancers, which would add multiple first-in-class medicines to the Lilly portfolio and expand our oncology presence into precision medicines. We also announced several other business development transactions, including an agreement with AC Immune to develop small molecule tau inhibitors for Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases.","We announced an agreement with Hydra Biosciences to acquire all assets related to their preclinical TRPA1 antagonist program, currently being studied for the treatment of chronic pain, and an agreement with Aduro Biotech to develop novel immunotherapies for autoimmune and other inflammatory diseases. In addition, we returned over $600 million via the dividend, and announced a 15% dividend increase for 2019. We also repurchased $1.1 billion of stock.","I'd also like to provide an update on our plans for completing the full separation of Elanco. As we stated during our December investment community meeting, operationally we are ready to affect the full separation. Today, we are providing a timeline for the separation as well as the method we'll use to dispose of our remaining 293 million Elanco shares. Specifically, we plan to launch an exchange offer to Lilly shareholders in the first-half of this year to exchange our remaining Elanco shares for Lilly shares. The exact timing of our decision to launch this exchange offer will depend on market conditions, but the launch of the tender could occur as early as the coming days.","We're pleased with the market reception of the Elanco IPO, and with Elanco's performance as a publically traded company. Jeff and his team are well prepared to take the next step, and Elanco employees are excited about their future. We're proud of what we've accomplished together, and we share their enthusiasm for Elanco's future. Moving to slides five and six, you'll see more detail on the key events since our November earnings call.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Josh to review the Q4 results, and to provide an update on our financial guidance for 2019.","Josh Smiley","Thanks, Dave. Slide seven summarizes our presentation of GAAP results and non-GAAP measures, while slide eight provides a summary of our GAAP results. I'll focus my comments on our non-GAAP adjusted measures to provide insights into the underlying trends in our business, so please refer to today's earnings press release for a detailed description of the year-on-year changes in our fourth quarter GAAP results.","So, looking at non-GAAP measures on slide nine, you'll see the revenue increase of 5% that Dave mentioned earlier. Gross margin as a percent of revenue increased 50 basis points to 76.6%. Excluding the effect of foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold, gross margin as a percent of revenue declined about 25 basis points.","Total operating expense increased 1%, with marketing, selling, and administrative expense increasing 3% driven primarily by increased expenses to support our newer product launches, including the U.S. launch of Emgality, while R&D expense declined 2%. Total operating expense as a percent of revenue compared to Q4 2017 declined by over 190 basis points, benefiting from previously announced actions taken to reduce the company's cost structure, partially offset by investments in new launches and our newest late-phase pipeline entries.","Operating income increased 15% compared to Q4 2017, which put our operating margin at 25.1% for the quarter. And our operating margin excluding the effect of FX on the international inventory sold was 24.8% of revenue, an improvement of over 165 basis points versus last year's quarter. Other income and expense was expense of $4.8 million for this quarter, compared to income of $111.9 million in last year's quarter, driven by approximately $100 million less in gains on investments. This reduction was due primarily to a large gain on the sale of an equity investment in last year's quarter, and to a lesser extent mark-to-market reductions in strategic partnership or VC investments in public biotech companies in this year's quarter.","Our tax rate was 15.8%, a decrease of 440 basis points compared with the same quarter last year, driven primarily by the impact of U.S. tax reform. So, at the bottom line, net income increased 13%, while earnings per share increased faster, at 17%, due to a reduction in shares outstanding from share repurchases. Earnings per share also included a reduction of approximately $0.02 per share to reflect the non-controlling interest in Elanco. Consistent with our performance throughout the year, we achieved significant earnings growth this quarter by delivering mid single-digit revenue growth while carefully managing our operating expenses, leading to meaningful improvement in profitability versus last year.","Slide 10 details these same non-GAAP measures for the full-year, where you can see the full-year impact of our strong top line growth and margin expansion as revenue grew 7% while operating expenses declined by 1%, which led to a 30% growth in non-GAAP EPS. Excluding the impact of FX on inventory sold, operating income as a percent of revenue for the full-year was 28.4%, an increase of 470 basis points compared to 2017.","Moving to slide 11 provides a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS. And you'll find additional details on these adjustments on slides 25 and 26.","Moving to slide 12, let's take a look at the effect of price, rate, and volume on revenue growth. This quarter, foreign exchange reduced growth by one percentage point. On a performance basis, worldwide revenue grew 6% driven by an 11% increase in volume partially offset by price. Q4 represented the second straight quarter our human pharma business delivered double-digit volume growth. U.S. pharma revenue increased 6%. Like last quarter, strong volume growth, which was 12%, led by Trulicity, Taltz, Basaglar, and Verzenio was partially offset by price. Excluding Cialis, volume grew nearly 21% in the U.S. highlighted by U.S. diabetes products delivering over 31% volume growth. While the U.S. pricing environment continues to evolve, our sustained success is driven by the execution of our volume-based growth strategy.","U.S. price declined 6%, which was similar to Q3. Approximately three points of the U.S. price decline was driven by changes to estimates of rebates and discounts, and disproportionate volume growth in certain government segments for Trulicity. Roughly one point of the decline was driven by new access and corresponding volume for Basaglar Medicare Part D, which we didn't have in last year's quarter. We also had approximately two points of decline associated with increases in patient affordability and access programs for Taltz and Humalog, which also drove increased volumes. Looking forward to 2019, we remain comfortable with our projection of mid single-digit declines in U.S. price more than offset by increased volumes.","Moving to Europe, pharma revenue grew 3% driven by volume, largely offset by the negative effect of price and foreign exchange. This volume growth was achieved despite the loss of exclusivity for Cialis. Excluding Cialis, volume grew over 16%. This robust volume growth was led by Olumiant, Trulicity, and Taltz. In Japan, pharma revenue was up 1%, with 9% volume growth largely offset by a drag of 8% from the impact of the biannual pricing cuts which too affect in Q1. Volume growth was driven by newer products led by Trulicity, Jardiance, and Olumiant, with a significant contribution also coming from Cymbalta. Our pharma revenue in the rest of the world increased 10% on a performance basis this quarter, led by volume growth from our diabetes portfolio, namely Humalog, Trulicity, and Jardiance in collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim.","Turning to Animal Health, worldwide revenue grew 6% on a performance basis this quarter, driven by higher volume, higher sales of companion animal disease prevention and future protein and health products was partially offset by lower sales of products that are being exited and to a lesser extent declines in products for ruminants and swine, and companion animal therapeutics. Slide 13 outlines the same information for our full-year results.","Now let's take a look at the drivers of our 11% worldwide volume growth on slide 14. Once again, our newer products with the engine of our worldwide volume growth, these products grew 13.7 percentage points of volume growth this quarter, nearly identical to their contribution in Q3. Brands that have experienced loss of exclusivity provided a drag of 450 basis points, driven almost entirely by Cialis. You may recall the generic versions of Cialis entered the U.S. market at the end of September last year and as expected, we've seen a rapid erosion of sales. When excluding LOEs, the rest of our products posted Q4 volume growth of over 18%.","Slide 15 provides a view of our newer product uptake. In total, these brands generated over $2.1 billion in revenue this quarter, representing 38% of our human pharmaceutical revenue. Our newer product growth demonstrates the successful execution of our commercial strategy. We're particularly excited about the launch of Emgality in the U.S. for the preventative treatment of migraine. While still early the NBRx share gains we've experienced to-date have been impressive. Combined with best-in-class U.S. payer access, we anticipate Emgality will be a meaningful growth driver going forward, demonstrating the promising future for our pain franchise.","Moving to slide 16 and continuing with our non-GAAP explanations, this quarter the effective FX had a relatively minimal impact on our income statement with a small negative impact on revenue and a small positive impact on operating income and EPS.","Turning to our 2019 financial guidance on slide 17, you will see that we've updated our non-GAAP guidance to reflect an approximate $0.34 impact of the anticipated Loxo Oncology acquisition, which we assume closes this quarter. Additionally, approximately $0.17 negative impact of Lartruvo Phase 3 announced study results was offset by positive trends in our core business performance and an improved tax rate versus what we projected in December. This updated non-GAAP guidance by line item includes a decrease of $200 million on the top line, driven by the impact of Lartruvo, partially offset by the inclusion of Vitrakvi, and an improved sales outlook across other products based on Q4 momentum, an increase of $200 million for R&D expense due to the addition of the Loxo Oncology pipeline, and a decrease of $100 million for other income and expense to a range of between $175 million and $325 million of expense, which is driven by higher net interest expense due to the Loxo Oncology acquisition.","As we stated during our Investor Call for the acquisition, the incremental interest expense reflects only a portion of the financing, as our 2019 guidance in December had already contemplated business development financing needs for roughly half the size of the transaction. A decrease in our effective tax rate from 16% to 15% driven by adjustments for U.S. tax reform, and this resulted in a decrease in our non-GAAP earnings per share range to $5.55 cents per share to $5.65 per share. I would note that the revised guidance continues to include a reduction of approximately $0.08 per share to reflect the non-controlling interest portion of Elanco profits for the full-year. The average of 2019 non-GAAP earnings per share estimates for analysts, who have updated their model since the Loxo Oncology and Lartruvo announcement is $5.55, and for those who haven't updated since our December meeting, the average estimates for those is $5.94.","Touching briefly on our updated GAAP guidance, the 50 basis point increase in the effective tax rate is due to certain Loxo Oncology acquisition and integration expenses not being deductible for tax purposes. In addition, GAAP earnings per share for 2019 is now expected to be in the range of $4.57 per share to $4.67 per share. I'd note that currently the Euro is slightly weaker and the Yen and Renminbi are slightly stronger to what we assumed in our guidance in December, but in total, FX impacts are modest. We will monitor FX movements and incorporate changes as appropriate in our quarterly updates.","Moving to slide 18, the numbers here should be helpful as you think about our business on a go-forward basis post the separation of Elanco. Our pharma-only expectations for 2019 first shared with you at our December Investment Community Meeting reflects mid-single digit revenue growth, relatively flat marketing, selling and administrative expenses, R&D growth to accommodate the Loxo Oncology acquisition and other Phase 3 investments, and operating income as a percent of revenue at approximately 28% or 27.5%, excluding the effect of FX on international inventories sold. We will provide an EPS range once we've executed the Elanco exchange offer and know the number of Lilly shares retired.","Although our updated full company EPS guidance is lower than our December guidance due to the Loxo Oncology acquisition, we still expect strong full-year performance led by volume gains and our newer products. We remain committed to our innovation-based strategy and are making substantial investments in 2019 to bring forward our next generation of new products. And I'd also note that despite the incremental costs associated with the Loxo Oncology pipeline and unexpected Lartruvo impact, we're committed to and confident in achieving our 2020 sales and operating margin goals.","As we move forward, we will continue to prioritize funding for existing marketed products, new launches, and lifecycle opportunities in addition to replenishing our pipeline. We will also continue to leverage business development to upgrade our pipeline and future growth prospects, and finally, we'll return excess cash to shareholders via increases to the dividend and share buybacks.","Now I'll turn the call back over to Dave to review the pipeline and key future events.","Dave Ricks","Thanks, Josh. Slide 19 shows select pipeline opportunities as of February 1, in addition to the pending addition of Loxo assets movement since our last earnings calls include the U.S. submission of Emgality for episodic cluster headache, the start of Phase 3 for teriparatide and Type 2 diabetes, the start of Phase 2 for a once-weekly basal insulin, and automated insulin delivery system, which is part of our connected care efforts that Dan highlighted at our December Investment Community Meeting, and a new indication for Verzenio in prostate cancer, the initiation of Phase 1 testing for eight biologic entities across our therapeutic areas, and the attrition of three early-stage molecules.","On slide 20, we provide a final tally on the key events we expected for 2018. As we reviewed in detail at our December Investment Community Meeting, 2018 was a strong year for progress in our pipeline, and in execution of our innovation-based strategy. And while we experience the setback on Lartruvo in January, we enter 2019 with great momentum.","Slide 21 shows the early progress we've made on key events, and we're monitoring for 2019. These include the initiation of a Phase 3 study of empagliflozin in a chronic kidney disease, results from a Phase 3 study of tanezumab in osteoarthritis pain, results from two Phase 3 studies for baricitinib atopic dermatitis, and the previously-announced and discussed Lartruvo study.","Now, let me briefly some of the progress we've made in the past 12 months and our priorities moving forward. In 2018, we delivered strong volume-based revenue growth of 7% driven entirely by our new products, which accounted in the calendar year for 34% of pharma revenue. We continued our strong operating performance, and our margin expansion of over 470 basis points, excluding the impact of foreign exchange on international inventories sold. We've seen excellent progress in our pipeline with our internal and external innovation investments yielding multiple approvals, submissions, and positive Phase 3 readouts, along with several significant first-in-class additions to our late-stage pipeline.","We completed a review of the strategic alternatives for Elanco. Through a well-received initial public offering, Elanco Animal Health became a publicly-traded company. Elanco raised over $4 billion through the IPO and debt offering. The vast majority of which was provided to Lilly as consideration for the businesses Lilly transferred to Elanco in connection with the IPO. We also returned approximately $6.5 billion to shareholders via the dividend and share repurchase, announced the pending acquisition of Loxo Oncology, and bolstered our early phase pipeline and preclinical platforms with numerous business development deals. Moving into 2019, we remain focused on launching with excellence and continuing to replenish our pipeline.","Before moving to Q&A, I'd like to take a moment to comment on the latest news regarding potential U.S. Healthcare System Reform. The proposed rule that would eliminate the Safe Harbor protections for rebates within the Medicare and Managed Medicaid segments will represent meaningful change to the system. While it's still a proposal, we see this as potentially accomplishing the following. First, this could be a win for patients, lowering their out-of-pocket costs at the pharmacy counter with the greatest benefit realized by patients taking more highly rebated products, such as insulin.","Second, for innovative products and companies the rule will shift the focus to demonstrating the value of our medicines and partnering with health insurers and systems to improve quality, outcomes, and lowering overall medical costs. Patients should directly benefit from price reductions and concessions in federal and commercial plans. Unfortunately, as you know, this rarely occurs today. Finally, this change could remove an artificial barrier to competition, creating space for innovation that addresses unmet needs for patients.","We continue to support making medicines more affordable and accessible to patients. Too often the sick are subsidizing the well in our current system. And this appears to be a positive tool to address this issue. We are for improvements to the U.S. healthcare system like this which appropriately balance patient affordability, market-based principles, and reward innovation. While I know you likely have many questions on this, I'm sure we'll continue to talk about this as more details emerge about the rule. This concludes our prepared remarks.","And now, I'd like to turn the call back over the Kevin to moderate the Q&A session.","Kevin Hern","Thanks, Dave. We'd like to take questions from as many callers as possible, so we ask that you limit your questions to two or to a single question with two parts.","John, please provide the instructions for the Q&A session, and then we're ready for the first caller.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. [Operator Instructions] First, we'll go to the line of Seamus Fernandez with Guggenheim. Please go ahead.","Seamus Fernandez","Thanks very much for the question. So, just really quickly two -- both on pipeline products, can you guys give us a quick sense of the expectations for how tanezumab, a REMS program might be implemented, and what that might look like in terms of its impact on the launch of that product. And then the second question is, just relative to the data that we got recently, or at least the headline announcement for atopic dermatitis with baricitinib, can you just give us a general sense of how you see those data competing in the market versus the existing product Dupixent? Thanks so much.","Kevin Hern","Okay, thanks, Seamus. We'll go with Dan for the expectations for the tanezumab REMS program. Christi, if you want to weigh in on the potential commercial impact. And then to Christi for bari -- atopic dermatitis.","Dan Skovronsky","Yes, thanks for the question on tanezumab. On course we're excited to, along with our partner Pfizer, announce the data on the latest Phase 3 trial. We still don't have the full data package, of course, on this molecule on OA. As we said before, though, we're very confident in the efficacy. We continue to see that replicate. And that's encouraging, the risk obviously we've been looking at is rapidly progressive osteoarthritis, RPOA. And the data that we continue to get, I think, is a very encouraging picture. This molecule, I think if you take the context of the vast unmet medical need for chronic pain and the deficiencies with the existing therapies that are available, including opioids and NSAIDs, I think really this offers a compelling benefit.","So, we have to wait and see what the next trials read out, particularly the long-term safety study. But if we can continue with the pattern of results that we've seen so far, I think we have great reason to be encouraged. With respect to your specific question about post-approval REMS and things like that; I would just say it's premature to discuss that. Let's get the full data package and then move forward with the FDA.","Christi Shaw","And to what Dan's talking about, if you look at the commercial opportunity, the number of patients that are suffering from osteoarthritis is 27 million. And if you just look at the patients that are similar to what we enrolled in the study, 11 million of those patients are very similar, which has been on at least three different classes of analgesics. They have been -- it's been over six years, they change medications multiple times, so the unmet need even in the most severe market is extremely high. So, as we look at the safety and REMS, et cetera, that high unmet need and the opportunity is still huge in most severe patients.","Turning to atopic dermatitis, yes, we reported out positive results in terms of our atopic dermatitis meeting our primary endpoints. Recall, this is two of five studies, so we have three more readouts this year. That combination of studies will then support a global package. Just to give you a little bit about the atopic dermatitis market, as you may or may not know, 54 million patients suffer from atopic dermatitis, 18 million of those moderate to severe. And if you talk to thought leaders, whether it's one-on-one or from the podium, they see this market like the psoriasis market was 15 years ago, and to be able to come to market with the very first oral is our goal, as these patients suffer and need new therapies.","Kevin Hern","Thanks, Christi. John, next caller?","Operator","And that will be from the line of Steve Scala with Cowen. Please go ahead.","Steve Scala","Thank you. I have two questions. Were the baricitinib trials in atopic dermatitis only positive in the four milligram arm or was statistical significance achieved on the one and two milligram cohorts as well? And then the second question is the impact on 2019 P&L of the Lartruvo failure was not small. I appreciate there were reasons for this. But as we look to critical 2019 readouts, what can you tell us about their contribution to guidance. I am specifically thinking about the LOXO-292 LIBRETTO trial, the tanezumab safety trial, Trulicity AWARD-11, and Verzenio MONARCH plus trial. Thank you.","Kevin Hern","Christi, we'll have you answer the question on baricitinib, and then go to Josh for the guidance question. Thanks, Steve.","Christi Shaw","Yes, so as you look at the trial, it included three doses, one milligram, two milligram, and four milligram. One milligram did not meet the primary endpoints, but two milligram and four milligram did meet the primary endpoints. As you look at the pain and the global assessment scores, the three primary endpoints, four milligrams did meet all of those. And two milligrams met two of the three. So, as we look at those we know in the atopic dermatitis the four milligrams is an effective dose and will be something that as we look at the total package we'll be submitting to FDA for approval.","Josh Smiley","Hi, Steve, it's Josh. On the guidance, I'd first say that for all of the R&D pipeline, as you mentioned, our R&D range funds and contemplates success in those categories. Obviously, with the Loxo addition, 292 is the primary driver of the $200 million R&D expansion in our line item guidance. In terms of the top line, we look at all the opportunities and potential sales impacts and probabilize those, so they're contemplated in our range. Although I would say most of the things that you mentioned really will have more of an impact in 2020 to the extent that they're positive. As I mentioned in the upfront comments, even with the impact of Lartruvo coming out, we're confident in achieving our sales goal for 2020, which would be the 7% compound annual growth rate for the pharma business between 2015 and 2020.","To achieve that based on the guidance we're giving for 2019 that assumes a minimum growth of about 6%. And that's not dependant on any individual product launch or R&D readout at this point. We're confident with the number of launches that we're in the midst of now and the clinical data that are still accruing, we're confident that we can hit that number in 2020.","Kevin Hern","Thank you. John, next caller?","Operator","We'll go to Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Chris Schott","Great. Thanks very much for the questions. My first one was on your expectation for mid single-digit decline in U.S. price. I was just wondering can you give us some more granularity like you did in the 4Q about the drivers of that assumption. I guess I'm really trying to get here is, should we be thinking about a similar dynamic, like we saw in the 4Q where it's channel mix and patient affordability initiatives that are the primary drivers of price decline, or this is more about greater rebates and contracting pressures driving that erosion?","My second question was just about the operating margin targets as we think out to the 2020 on pharma. I think you're looking at about a 200 basis point impact versus prior guidance on pharma for '19. So, can you just elaborate some of the dynamics as we think out to 2020, and what we should be thinking about for the pharma business there? Thank you.","Kevin Hern","Great. Thank you, Chris. We'll go to Josh for both those questions.","Josh Smiley","Yes, Chris, first on the price decline for 2020 -- I mean for 2019. So, one thing that we have that is new in 2019 is the Medicare donut hole expansion, the move from 50% to 70%, and that's got about a $200 million impact or close to two points of the mid single-digit decline will have. So that's a new item in 2019. Otherwise, we are seeing generally the same thing. We're seeing an increase in our patient affordability efforts. These are around Humalog; they're around new launches like Trulicity and Emgality. We're very confident that those kinds of impacts are positive in the long-run they lead to volume gains; over time we're seeing that certainly in Taltz right now. So, we do expect a few points of drag there.","And then I think the rest is mostly going to be either mix or small unit declines but nothing that -- they're all sort of related to maintaining or improving access. We obviously are always looking at diabetes as a big segment, and one that faces a lot of competition, but we're very happy with the access that we have going into 2019, and I don't think you'll see any big new headwinds from a pricing perspective.","As it relates to the operating margin targets for 2020, yes, I think if you look at where -- or the guidance we have for 2019, I think sort is about -- probably about 27% at the midpoint ranges. Remember our guidance for 2020 now is to, when you take out Elanco, is to get to 31%. Elanco, when we take it out, gives us about a point or so of benefit. So, well yes, we're looking at about 300 basis points improvement versus our midpoint range this year to 2020. We think that's very achievable. If you look at in 2018, we improved operating margin by about 450 basis points. We got there through mid to high single digits top line growth and relatively flat expenses.","As I mentioned, we would, to achieve our minimum revenue growth, we'd need about 6% growth in 2020, which we feel good about. So, mid single-digit top line growth with good control on the expenses gives us I think a very good -- just mathematically gets us there. So we're comfortable with the ability to achieve that minimum.","Kevin Hern","Thank you. John, next caller.","Operator","And that'll be Jason Gerberry with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi. Good morning everyone. This is Chi [ph] on for Jason. Thanks for taking our questions. I have one on pricing and one on Emgality. First one, can you just give a little bit color on how you think about the impact of [indiscernible] exclusive contracting, specifically on products with high gross-to-net [indiscernible]. Just curious, does the company see an end to exclusive contracting [indiscernible] take them broadly away or does that [indiscernible] win the exclusive contract? Second, on Emgality, curious to know how you think about the [indiscernible] for the progression of Emgality over 2019, is Lilly focused on primary care, so [indiscernible] might be lagging competitors in this space given [indiscernible] are early adopters? And if you can quickly comment on the Emgality paid prescription [indiscernible] right now, that would be great. Thank you.","Kevin Hern","Okay, thank you. We'll go to Enrique for the question on Part D rebates, and then Christi for Emgality.","Enrique Conterno","Yes, I'm not sure that I understood the full question, but at this point in time I think as we look at the status quo, we basically see the continued trend when it comes to exclusive contracting. As we all know, mealtime insulin is already contracted that way. And we basically trends where most payers are trying to restrict utilization, maybe have fewer products and extract rebates on concessions clearly, right now there's some uncertainty when it comes to the new proposed rule. And we really need to see how that is going to play out. I won't be able to speculate at this time.","Christi Shaw","Yes, and on Emgality, we're so excited with the number of patients that are being helped by the CGRP agents. We expect probably six million patients to be eligible. If you look at Emgality specifically in your questions, we launched in October, obviously so we just have a couple of months of data. But right now what we're seeing is similar, that our paid prescriptions are at about 50%. The marketplace splits up, that about a third of the prescriptions come from primary care, a third come from neurologists, and a third come from midlevel. So this very much will be an expansion into primary care beyond the neurologists as well. So specifically looking at Emgality's performance, we ended the year, even though we launched late at a 20% NBRx. And we're currently looking at 26% already in January.","So, as you look at these launches, we just launched our direct-to-consumer TV ad campaign this week. We know that Lilly has very strong consumer activation relative to our competitors. We know that we have a drug that has not just demonstrated 50% improvement, but 75% and a 100% reduction in monthly headaches that our competitors don't have, as well as quality of life. And we have the unique platform and device that Trulicity uses that we know over a million patients really like. So, we're very bullish on both the market and on Emgality's ability to compete.","Kevin Hern","Thanks, Christi. John, next caller please?","Operator","That will be Louise Chen with Cantor. Please go ahead.","Louise Chen","Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. My first question here is how long do you think it will take for Trulicity sales to benefit from your Rewind presentation at ADA, and what type of uptick you think we should see after that? And then secondly, on the market opportunity for lasmiditan, just curious how you think about it now in light of the injectable CGRPs being approved and the potential for oral CGRPs to come to the market? Thank you.","Kevin Hern","Thank you. So, Enrique will take Trulicity, and then Christi will handle the question on lasmiditan.","Enrique Conterno","Clearly Trulicity is on a present outstanding run right now and benefiting from a huge growth of the GLP-1 market. If anything, we are seeing the GLP-1 market accelerate from already very high levels, growing at nearly 30% on a year-on-year basis. And importantly, in those markets Trulicity has continued to perform well, and we've been able to gain share, in fact over five share points since the launch of Ozempic. Now, as we look at Rewind, clearly we see that this as a critical trial and dataset that's going to benefit patients. The big impact is when we basically start promotion of this important data. And I think it basically solidifies, I think, the bright future that Trulicity already had. We expect that impact, of course, some time in the 2020 once we get the FDA action on the new label.","Christi Shaw","Yes, and then on lasmiditan and how it will play in the marketplace, where we will have some regulatory action this year. So, we're looking forward to that. If you look at the marketplace, kind of how we look at is with the 36 million patients who suffer from migraine there's about 16 million of those that are diagnosed, and 6 million that suffer from acute migraines and are taking therapy. And that is overlapping only somewhat with the prevention market. So, as you look at prevention CGRPs versus acute use, there's obviously a huge need for both distinctly. And CGRPs also obviously don't clear a 100% of all patients of their migraine. So we see the use obviously may overlap there. And we think lasmi [ph] has a really great positioning versus the oral CGRPs. If you're taking a preventative CGRP you may want to look at the different mechanism if you have to add to that. And then if we look at the acute marketplace, so many patients have fallen out of the market because of lack of efficacy or they cant tolerate the safety, so lasmiditan will be a great option for them.","Kevin Hern","Thank you. John, next caller, please.","Operator","That will be from Alex Arfaei with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Alex Arfaei","Great. Good morning and thank you. Verzenio was notably below our expectations. You mentioned buying patterns in the U.S. impacted this. Could you please quantify the inventory impact and your latest long-term expectations for this product given the apparent slowdown in the CDK4\/6 market? And just a follow-up, a bigger picture question on your operating margin. I'm just trying to look past 2020 here. Historically you've invested more on internal innovation as opposed to external innovation, and with that higher R&D your operating margin was relatively lower to your peers. Now that you seem to have a more balanced approach with increased contribution from acquisitions, as your top line grows in the mid single digits is it reasonable to expect that Lilly can get to mid 30s operating margin? Thank you.","Kevin Hern","Okay, thank you. We'll go to Anne for the question on Verzenio, and then Dave will take the question on operating margin post 2020.","Anne White","Thanks, Alex, for the question. So, we saw about $4 million in inventory impact in 2018. And as you mentioned, we are seeing flattening in the CDK4\/6 market as penetration has occurred. With Verzenio our focus is clearly on execution, to drive new Verzenio -- new trial of Verzenio and increasing our share of market. On a positive note, we're encouraged that we're seeing a high conversion rates with over 50% of physicians who trial Verzenio moving on to write additional prescriptions. We're also really looking forward to the launches outside the U.S. So we've launched in Japan, and in several countries in Europe, and the uptake has been strong as well, in particular what we're seeing is good uptake in patients with a poor prognosis. And so that will be patients with visceral disease or liver metastases who are also driving execution in there. So we have a hope for continued growth for Verzenio as we really focus on a strong year of execution across the globe.","Dave Ricks","Yes, and as it relates to sort of margins and long-term R&D strategy, it's a good question. I know there's a lot of appetite for us to nail down some long-term target number. We're not going to do that, because I think really at the core of this is a question, \"What are our opportunities,\" which we don't have full visibility to be on 2020, but let me just tell you how we think about this.","We see a period ahead of prolonged revenue growth for the company, because we have a relatively new line-up of products that should continue to grow. We're adding to that even this year, and next with additional launches. We do see ourselves balancing R&D spending both in balance sheet, M&A as well as partnerships, and continue to expand it, I would say, toward the top of the industry on internal income statement-based R&D, because we see good opportunities today, but that is not a fixed line item, it's based on what we see in front of us and the opportunity to create value for shareholders and patients with innovation.","I would expect long-term to continue to see as we grow top line, a better gross margins and better SG&A as a percent of sales, so those will be helpful long-term to that to continue an expansion, R&D will be more a function of our choice making on growth drivers for the future. And it's hard to speculate on which direction that would go. We would hope actually to be able to spend more because that would mean the science is promising and we see opportunities to grow the value of the company and improve therapies for patients.","Kevin Hern","Thanks, Dave. John, next caller, please?","Operator","We'll go to Geoff Meacham with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Geoff Meacham","Good morning, guys. Thanks for the question. I just had a few, Enrique, you saw some good sequential trends for Jardiance in 3Q as well as 4Q, so the question is what do you attribute that to and should the demand backdrop continue into 2019? I know most investors were initially expecting more of an inflection after [indiscernible], it hasn't happened yet, but I received signs of that happening now. And then, just bigger picture for Josh on the back of the Loxo deal, obviously you guys have broadened -- even more broaden your oncology presence, so from maybe a capacity or from a priority standpoint, where do you see BD fitting in, is there a therapeutic category that you feel like you maybe need a little bit more help them? Thank you.","Kevin Hern","Enrique?","Enrique Conterno","Very good. As we look at 2019, I'm particularly bullish when it comes to Jardiance, because we have a number of inflection points that I think are playing us strong tailwinds for the success of the product. As you know, we have new updated ADA and EASD guidelines I think that place emphasis on SGLT2s, but in particular, preference for Jardiance within that class. Clearly, we have the re-inclusion of Jardiance and the CVS formularies, and that's pretty significant in that. Now, Jardiance has basically 90-plus access across commercial, and part of the -- it is likely that we are seeing as we look at some of the data, when we look at market data, it is likely that we are seeing some spillover effect of that re-inclusion even beyond some of the formulary itself. Jardiance now, it's basically running around in the low to mid-60s, when it comes to NBRx share, and we're actually seeing the SGLT2 class accelerator now basically showing growth in double-digits. I think all of that I think is very encouraging.","And finally, given the profile that we basically have the increased investment in terms of our competitors, we see that also as beneficial to the product. So very bullish in terms of how I see these overall class accelerating, and more importantly, Jardiance basically capitalizing as the share leader.","Josh Smiley","Hi, Geoff. Thanks for the question. I think as it relates to business development capacity and interest, first, I'd go back to Dave's earlier comments about how we think about the future, we see a period of good growth in front of us, and that good sales growth and operating income growth translates to strong cash flow generation. So I think in terms of capacity, we feel like we've got very good capacity going forward. So really from a business development perspective we're going to be mostly constrained by the opportunities that we see. We're not particularly tilted towards one therapeutic area. It's really the therapeutic areas that we're invested in today when we see good assets where we like the science can enhance the portfolio and can create value for shareholders with the acquisition.","We'll pursue those and we'll pursue them aggressively. I think just given where investment and the progression of opportunities and sciences, you'd have to expect that we will continue to be looking in oncology and immunology are two areas where there's just a lot of opportunity, but all of our therapeutic areas are open for us and when we can find the best assets, really, we've got the balance sheet and cash flow capacity to act.","Kevin Hern","Thank you. John, next caller, please?","Operator","That will be David Risinger with Morgan Stanley. Please, go ahead.","David Risinger","Yes, thanks very much. First, could you please discuss the forthcoming Loxo 292 readouts to watch and if possible it would be helpful if you could characterize what percentage of patients could be candidates in each tumor type. Second with respect to Novo's oral semaglutide, I think, the expectation is that it will be priced lower as an oral, could you discuss potential implications for the GLP1 market including Trulicity? And then I just have one little nit question, which is for Tradjenta, the CAROLINA study versus sulfonylurea completed six months ago in August, when should we expect the top line, thank you?","Kevin Hern","Okay, thank you. We'll go to Anne for Loxo and then Enrique will take the final two questions.","Anne White","Yes, so for Loxo 292, you can expect to see an additional readout at a scientific meeting in the second half of 2019, so we'll be looking forward to that. The study, the LIBRETTO is enrolling very well. It has over 300 patients in it now. And so there will be robust data reported at the end of this year. Importantly, as we saw -- as some of the data that was reported last year at some of the various meetings such as World Long [ph], we saw response rates between 60% and 80% depending on the tumor type and then seeing patients stay on therapy 90% or higher, staying on that therapy. So we remain very excited and encouraged by the 292 data. We think it's transformative for patients with RET fusions or mutation. And so you will continue to hear more from that.","On the actual incidence rates, what we know as far as conversations with thought leaders and also Vivian literature is that with RET fusions in lung cancer it happens in about 2% to 3% of lung cancers and so as you know that's a substantial market and so that's one of the largest growth opportunities that could be over 3,000 patients in the U.S. In papillary RET fusions it's about 10% to 20%, a smaller population, but again a very strong response rate in those patients. And then in a tumor such as medullary thyroid which has activating RET point mutations, that actually happens to about 60% of those patients that they see that RET mutation.","And so again that could be an additional 500 patients in the U.S. alone. And then you start to include the global numbers. So while the incidence rates are not high, the response rates are really remarkable and so we do believe that we'll see strong penetration, and also a long durability of response, so again, very excited about looking forward to those readouts.","Enrique Conterno","Very good. David, thank you for the question on oral sema. There is a question for Novo Nordisk. Unfortunately I'm unable to really speculate on how they're going to price the product and some of the implications. As far as Tradjenta and CAROLINA, we expect to release the top results this quarter, the top line results.","Kevin Hern","Thank you, Enrique. Next caller, please?","Operator","We'll go to Vamil Divan of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Vamil Divan","Hi, great, thanks for taking my questions. So first on Olumiant just following up on the other questions, I know the four milligram dose may be coming, but at least for now the two milligram dose in the U.S., how should we think about the uptake potential, I guess, say for this year, maybe early next year, pretty limited sales in the fourth quarter at least just trying to get a view on the dynamics there.","And for Emgality, appreciate some of the comments you made there around the dynamic, but just curious how you're seeing the discount, you know, the net pricing evolve for that market with three players in this space. Looks like you guys have done pretty well in terms of gaining access based on the announcement, but any longer-term insights would be helpful, thanks.","Christi Shaw","Sure. Thanks, Vamil for the question. So I guess, I'll take both of those\u2026","Kevin Hern","Sure.","Christi Shaw","-- I'm sorry, Kevin, I kind of just fitted in there in front of you, so on Olumiant what we see across the globe is really strong uptake, especially with our clinical experience that the patients are having fast pain relief and what we see with the two versus the four is very similar from an efficacy standpoint. The AACR 20, it's about 1% less on the two versus the four milligram and AACR 70, it's about 4% less. So in the U.S. those physicians who have tried it and the patients' feedback has been extremely positive. Obviously, in the U.S., our indication places us post TNS.","At a 60% discount to the market leader, our access hasn't been an issue and we think this will be a continued growth product in that smaller market that we're playing in right now. We obviously continue to look at the four milligram across multiple indications as I talked about earlier with atopic dermatitis, lupus. Obviously, the discussion is ongoing in Rheumatoid Arthritis et cetera so. We're still very confident in that dose and the benefit risk profile of that. As I move on to Emgality then thanks for asking about the discounting and the net pricing, because I forgot to mention we are very excited to know that starting February 1st, we will have best-in-class access in 2019 versus the other CGRPs.","We are on all three major PBMs. There has been only one regional player, small regional player that has not put us -- that has disadvantaged us to get a CGRP. So we have wide-open access and relative to our competitors, better access. I can't really comment on the discounting piece. I can tell, you know, what we're seeing as the market plays out is the sampling happens in the physician's office. We started right away in the physician office sampling, and in retail. So what you see in our NBRx rates is actually no samples in there -- pure play, only the co-pay piece of it. And what you see with the market dynamics as well, getting a lot of questions on is the market flat. We think the market continues to grow, huge opportunity, up to six million patients. A with the market dynamics of our competitors changing from specialty mail order into retail has kind of made that market chart look a little bit flat versus what we actually think the underlying demand is.","Kevin Hern","Thanks, Christi. Next caller please?","Operator","We'll go to Andrew Baum with Citi. Please go ahead.","Vineeth Agrawal","Hi, this is Vineeth Agrawal for Andrew Baum at Citi. Two questions, please. First one is while the HHS net pricing proposal might reduce near-term political pressure and drug price affordability, how concerned are you that it will ultimately spill into the much more profitable commercial plans with material negative pricing implications for you? Secondly, do you think a second NDC brand strategy for Medicare formularies is commercially viable or does it materially increase risk of fraud at independent pharmacies? Thank you.","Kevin Hern","So we'll go to Dave for the initial question on the pricing pressure and what we're seeing in the government and then the potential spillover to the managed care. And then we might need to come back for clarification on the second question.","Dave Ricks","Yes, I'm not sure I got all the details of your question. But I guess, I'll just caveat this answer by saying it's difficult to speculate right now, of course, it seems like nearly every week, we see some new proposed regulatory rule or introduction of some idea on the Hill as it relates U.S. drug pricing. I'll give you our long-term outlook, which is as an innovative-based company, we're of course very excited about the underlying science in this industry, and what it can do. The products we've been speaking about today are good examples of that. And I think an innovation-based strategy is the way to overcome whatever the pricing pressures are out there.","So we like where we sit. We're in a period of strong growth and we've got innovation flowing now as well as recently launched that gives us strong base going forward. We'll adapt to whatever rules come out and how they get finalized. No doubt, I would say it's fair to say the administration is focused on both government formularies as well as spillover into commercial markets. We think it's fine. It's probably difficult to run two systems side-by-side and their top priority is actually our top priority, which is lowering out-of-pocket costs for patients at the pharmacy counter. So things like in the new rebate rule, this ability to pass through savings [indiscernible] even as early as this year into Part D plan, participants, that's a great idea. And I think that's highly consistent with the policy positions we've taken before. We'll have to see how the dynamics evolve, but Lilly has got a very strong capacity and capability in managed markets and in working with fair customers. That will serve us well as we navigate this period of change and you know, I'm confident based on innovation we'll emerge successful.","Kevin Hern","Could you please repeat the second question and -- so we can try to answer that for you? We didn't pick it up in the room.","Vineeth Agrawal","So, do you think the second NDC brand strategy for the Medicare formularies is commercially viable or does it materially increase the risk of fraud at independent pharmacies in the sense that the pharmacies dispense the lower-priced drug, but bill for the higher-priced drugs?","Enrique Conterno","Maybe I'll try to provide an answer to that question. This is Enrique. We do review all options available to us including potentially having a second brand. There are a number of reasons where a second brand could be viable and it really depends on the specific situation for the product. So that's something that we always study very carefully. But I'm not prepared to comment on that at this time.","Kevin Hern","Thank you. Next caller, please?","Operator","We'll go to Umer Raffat with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Umer Raffat","Hi, sorry. Thanks so much for taking my question. First, I noticed in some of the deal documents that came out on the Loxo deal, there was the sale estimate from Loxo management of sub $40 million for 2020, can you comment on that and maybe just give us a little more specific metrics on what extent of testing is already happening, and how you see that changing let's say by year end 2019? Thank you very much.","Kevin Hern","Okay, thanks. We'll have Anne take those questions.","Anne White","Going forward, sales forecast, we don't comment on those specifically and so we won't comment on that -- the details of forecasted sales. This is obviously the launch year for -- if I track the info, I think it's too soon to comment. I believe, Bayer would say that the things are off to a good start, but again we'll have to see the full-year performance before we can comment on future performance.","As far as the testing, so it's -- importantly, what we're seeing in both track and then in RET is obviously, in lung cancer we're seeing uptake of testing go rapidly. And our belief is that when we have good medicines testing tends to follow pretty rapidly. And so it's important for us to accelerate bringing these many lessons forward and then driving that testing quickly. Key though you're noting is success in these spaces is getting testing to be widespread. So our focus is not just on launching these drugs, but also partnering with pathologists in diagnostic laboratories and making sure that this testing is routine and available. We are seeing early adoption at the academic central cancer centers, and so we expect the delta of the scale getting particularly NGS testing to be more routine. And again, we're seeing it even increase in thyroid. So while it's fairly routine in lung, again, with the knowledge out there that there are opportunities in thyroid, we're seeing that testing go forward. And I do believe that advances in testing will also bring the costs down. So that's also what we see as key.","So, in our launch strategy, it's very much about the partnership at the laboratories, the pathologists to make sure that they understand the value of testing and I know that Bayer and Loxo agree with this as well. So we believe that good medicines will drive change in practice. And so we definitely are bringing forward good medicines. We look forward to helping change the face of medicine, particularly in precision medicine, which is a very high value driver with the fact that with these very strong response rates, the efficiency of the healthcare system is significant; small numbers of patients, high response rate. So very efficient use of health care dollars, so we believe we can change that dynamic pretty rapidly.","Kevin Hern","Thank you, Anne. Next caller, please?","Operator","And we'll go to Steve Scala with Cowen. Please go ahead.","Steve Scala","Thank you. Christi, may I clarify your comment on the baricitinib atopic dermatitis data, there is only one primary endpoint in the trial, that's Investigator global assessment, is that the one that the two milligram missed? Secondly, MONARCH Her and MONARCH plus are not listed in the key 2019 event, but both were expected, can you clarify? And then lastly for Enrique, I hate to split hairs, but on the Q3 call you referred to REWIND as paradigm changing on several occasions. You did not say that today, what has changed in the last three months? Thank you.","Kevin Hern","Thanks, Steve. We'll go to Christi for the first one on bari, then Anne for the MONARCH readout, and then Enrique finally to close out on REWIND. Christi.","Christi Shaw","Yes. So on the data primary endpoint, and then we had multiple secondary endpoints, and we're going to be sharing that data at a future scientific meeting, especially as we gain more knowledge with the next three studies that we'll readout this year. There were multiple -- we had -- global assessment is the primary endpoint, then we had multiple secondary endpoints to that, actually eight of them. And so, as we know the four-milligram met all of the primary endpoints as I said, the two-milligram missed on some of the secondary endpoints. So I appreciate you allowing me to clarify that answer.","Kevin Hern","Anne?","Anne White","Yes, on the MONARCH Her study, we do expect the readouts to be in the first-half of this year. It is a Phase 2 study, so that's [indiscernible] we wouldn't know necessarily on those listings, but we do look forward to that readout and look forward to the next stages of that, so, whether we move forward to a Phase 3 study depending on the verboseness of the data. So you'll see that readout in the first-half of this year.","Kevin Hern","Thank you. Enrique?","Enrique Conterno","My enthusiasm for REWIND and Trulicity have not changed at all, if anything, we are even more bullish today than we were maybe a couple of months back.","Steve Scala","Thank you.","Kevin Hern","Next caller please?","Operator","And Mr. Hern, there are no further questions in queue.","Kevin Hern","Okay, great. Thank you. We will go to Dave for the close.","Dave Ricks","Great. Thank you, Kevin, and we appreciate your participation in today's earnings call and your interest in the company. We demonstrated again in 2018 clear progress toward our revenue and profitability goals for 2020. The company is executing well. We continue to advance our innovation-based strategy through progressing internally discovered medicines augmented with business development transactions, highlighted by our recently-announced acquisition of Loxo Oncology.

In Q2 we generated worldwide revenue growth of 8%, driven by volume growth in our human pharmaceutical business, once again led by our new products. We also continue to expand our margins. Excluding the effect of FX on international inventories sold, gross margin as a percent of revenue increased by over 90 basis points and total operating expenses as a percent of revenue declined by over 390 basis points to 50.8%.","We continue to make progress with our pipeline. Highlights include the Japan approval for Olumiant for rheumatoid arthritis. The FDA granted priority review to abemaciclib in advanced breast cancer and Fast Track status to tanezumab for chronic OA and low back pain. We presented detailed data from our Phase 3 studies of galcanezumab for migraine prevention, and for abemaciclib we presented detailed data from our Phase 3 MONARCH 2 study and announced initiation of a pivotal study in the adjuvant setting that has now begun.","In terms of capital deployment, just yesterday we announced an alliance with Nektar Therapeutics to develop and commercialize NKTR-358, a novel immunological therapy for the potential treatment of a number of autoimmune and other chronic inflammatory conditions. We announced a collaboration with KeyBioscience on a potential new class of treatments for metabolic disorders which closed earlier this month. And we returned over $700 million to our shareholders through share repurchases and our dividend.","In other news, we received an important ruling from the UK Supreme Court upholding our Alimta method of use patents in four major European countries and we also reached a settlement with generic companies that will provide exclusivity for Cialis until at least September 2018. Our continued progress in 2017 keeps us on track to achieve our midterm goals for each of our strategic objectives. Slides 5 and 6 contain more details on this these events as well as other events of note that occurred since our April earnings call.","I'd highlight that earlier this morning we issued a press release to provide an update on our meeting with the FDA to discuss the baricitinib complete response letter. The FDA has indicated that an additional clinical study is necessary for resubmission in order to further characterize the benefit-risk across doses in light of an observed imbalance in thromboembolic events that occurred during the placebo-controlled period of the RA clinical program. We disagree with the FDA's conclusions and believe the comprehensive clinical data demonstrate there is a positive benefit-risk profile that supports baricitinib's approval as a new treatment option for people suffering from RA in the United States.","In the European Union where baricitinib 2 milligrams and 4 milligrams have been approved since February of 2017, the CHMP recently agreed to update the label with a precaution for patients who have risk factors for DBT and PE. In Japan where baricitinib was also recently approved, the label includes a similar precaution. Along with Incyte, we are evaluating options for resubmitting, including further discussions with the FDA or conducting an additional clinical study. The time to resubmission will depend on which option we pursue but is expected to be a minimum of 18 months. We are disappointed that resubmission will be delayed, but we are committed to bringing baricitinib to people with RA here in the US. We're also committed to a robust life cycle plan for baricitinib as we see great potential in a number of other indications.","Moving to our financial results, slide 7 summarizes our presentation of GAAP results and non-GAAP measures, while slide 8 provides a summary of our GAAP results. I'll focus my comments on our non-GAAP adjusted measures to provide insights into the underlying trends in our business. So please refer to today's earnings press release for a detailed description of the year-on-year changes in our second quarter GAAP results.","Looking at the non-GAAP measures on slide 9, you can see revenue increase of 8% that I mentioned earlier. Gross margin as a percent of revenue increased to 76.7%. This increase was driven by higher realized prices and manufacturing efficiencies, partially offset by the negative effect of product mix and higher expenses to support new pharmaceutical products.","Total operating expense was flat to Q2 2016, with marketing, selling and administrative expenses increasing 5% and R&D expenses decreasing 6%. The increase in marketing, selling, and administrative expenses was driven by higher spending to support new products, partially offset by lower spending on later life cycle products. The decrease in R&D expenses was driven by a milestone payment in last year's quarter. Excluding this milestone payment, R&D expenses increased less than 2%.","Other income and expense was a $4 million expense this quarter, compared to income of $21 million in last year's quarter. Our tax rate was 21.7%, a decrease of 70 basis points compared with the same quarter last year. At the bottom line, net income increased 30%, and earnings per share increased 29%. We achieved this significant earnings growth by delivering high single-digit volume-based revenue growth while improving our gross margin percent and significantly reducing our OpEx ratio, creating positive leverage. Slide 10 details the same non-GAAP measures for June year-to-date, while slide 11 provides a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS. You'll find additional details on these adjustments on slides 35 and 36.","Moving to slide 12, let's take a look at the effects of price, rate, and volume on revenue growth. Effective foreign exchange was minimal this quarter. Excluding the slight headwind from FX our worldwide revenue growth on a performance basis was 9%, and was driven by volume, followed by price. It's worth noting that in our human pharma business each major geography drove volume growth this quarter. By geography, you'll notice that the U.S. pharmaceutical business increased 19%, driven by both price and volume. Price growth was primarily driven by our late life cycle products, Cialis and Forteo while Trulicity was the main driver of U.S. volume growth with meaningful contributions also coming from Taltz, Basaglar, Jardiance and Lartruvo. Excluding FX, European pharma revenue growth was 4% driven entirely by volume, despite significant headwinds on Alimta. Excluding Alimta, the rest of our European pharma revenue grew 10% on a performance basis led by Trulicity. In Japan, despite a large negative impact from the entry of generic Zyprexa last June, pharma revenue increased 2%. Excluding Zyprexa, the rest of our Japan pharma revenue grew 16% in Q2, led by Cyramza, Cymbalta and Trulicity.","Our pharma revenue in the rest of the world increased 3% on a performance basis this quarter. Patent expirations for Cymbalta for several countries, including Canada, negatively affected RoW revenue growth. Excluding Cymbalta, rest of world pharma revenue increased 7% in performance terms, led by Humalog, Trulicity and Humulin.","Turning to animal health, excluding the impact of FX, worldwide revenue decreased 8% driven by volume as price had a minimal impact. Food animal product revenue declined by 13% while companion animal product revenue increased 1%. Animal health revenue benefited from the addition of BI's U.S. vaccine business, but revenue growth was negatively affected by buying patterns ahead of an SAP cutover that increased revenue in Q2 of last year by $40 million.","On a performance basis, excluding the BI vaccine acquisition and adjusting for last year's purchasing patterns, our animal health revenue decreased 13%, with similar declines in both food and companion animals. The food animal decline was primarily driven by market access pressure as well as by competitive pressures in cattle and swine. The companion animal decline was primarily driven by competitive pressures in the parasiticides market. Slide 13 outlines the same information for our June year-to-date results.","As we've done in recent quarters, let's now take a look at the drivers of our worldwide volume growth on slide 14. In total, our new products comprised of Trulicity, Cyramza, Jardiance, Taltz, Basaglar, Lartruvo, Portrazza and Olumiant were the engines of our worldwide volume growth. You can see these products drove 10.7 percentage points of volume growth. Lower Cialis volume provided a headwind of 120 basis points, primarily due to lower volume in the U.S. as a result of a decline in the overall ED market as well as increased use of off-label generic sildenafil, while lower animal health volume provided a headwind of 140 basis points. And the loss of exclusivity for Zyprexa, Cymbalta, Evista, Strattera and Axiron provided a drag of 280 basis points.","Slide 15 provides a view of our new product uptake. In total, these brands generated over $1 billion in revenue this quarter, with nearly half of that by Trulicity. These products represented 18% of our total worldwide revenue in Q2, up from 15% just last quarter.","Moving to slide 16, you'll see the changes in foreign exchange rates had a small effect on our Q2 2017 results. Growth in non-GAAP EPS was 29% including the effect of FX and 32% in constant currency terms.","With that perspective on our Q2 financial results, I'll turn it over to Sue and Levi for an update on our oncology strategy.","Susan Mahony - Eli Lilly & Co.","Thank you, Dave. As I mentioned during last quarter's earnings call Q&A, in the first half of this year we took a fresh look at our oncology R&D strategy. Having joined Lilly at the beginning of the year from Dana-Farber and Harvard, Levi played a key role in this review, providing a valuable new perspective, and we're pleased to have this opportunity today to share a summary of the output of our review. I'll start with an overview of the oncology trends that we felt we needed to address, and then I'll describe our R&D strategy at a high level and then I'll turn it over to Levi to delve into more detail.","As we all know, despite many exciting advances, there remains significant unmet need in oncology, and many companies are pursuing this opportunity and the field is becoming intensely competitive. And with the financial pressures payers are facing, the pace of (14:16) innovation has increased. We recognize that we must provide drugs that deliver larger increases in survival than we've traditionally seen in the past, and we are adapting our approach to respond to these trends in order to deliver breakthrough innovation to patients.","Moving to slide 19, our strategy has two pillars. The first is to build upon our key therapeutics that are already on the market or are nearing the market and that have the potential to be foundational agents. The second is to pursue new standard-of-care changing agents that clear a very high bar, and in a moment Levi will outline how we'll assess such potential.","On the second pillar, I would like to highlight that we intend to pursue breakthrough molecules across a variety of mechanisms, including, but not limited to, immuno-oncology. Key to our efforts will be leveraging advances in scientific understanding to identify targets with a strong biological rationale, and we will focus on targets that attack human dependencies or overcome resistance, enriching the target population to drive a larger benefit. Let me say a few words on the first pillar of our strategy, because we have a solid base on which to build.","In addition to Alimta and Erbitux, we have Cyramza, which is approved in three different tumor types and has become a standard-of-care in the treatment of gastric cancer with particularly some adoption in Japan. We hope to expand the use of Cyramza in gastric cancer (15:49) setting and to second line urothelial cancer, and we have Phase 3 trials that will read out this year and next to potentially expand Cyramza's indication into liver and first line idioform mutant (16:00) lung cancers. In addition, we've seen promising early data on the combination of Cyramza with pembrolizumab in lung cancer, which represents an interesting area for additional study.","Lartruvo is a monochromal antibody that inhibits platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha. Added to doxorubicin, Lartruvo is the first medicine in more than four decades shown to help patients with soft tissue sarcoma live longer when compared to doxorubicin alone, by 11.8 months, an 80% improvement. We hope to extend the use of Lartruvo across additional lines of therapy for sarcoma, and in addition, we are studying Lartruvo in other cancer types.","And lastly, abemaciclib is a selective inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases CDK-4 and CDK-6. Abemaciclib was purposely developed to be given on a continuous dosing schedule to induce tumor shrinkage. We are encouraged by the single agent activity we've seen in heavily pretreated patients across multiple tumor types, and I'm pleased to have received priority review here in the US for our NDA submission of the MONARCH 1 and MONARCH 2 data in metastatic ER-positive HER2-negative breast cancer, the latter being in combination with fulvestrant.","We also look forward to presenting interim results from the MONARCH 3 study of abemaciclib in combination with aromatase inhibitors as initial treatment in endocrine-sensitive breast cancer patients at ESMO in September. We continue to believe that abemaciclib could represent a potential best-in-class CDK-4 and 6 inhibitor based on the totality of the data, including magnitude and depth of response as well as progression-free survival and that it will become an important new treatment option for patients with breast cancer. We aim to establish a broad presence for abemaciclib in estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer, not only in HER2-negative but also in HER2-positive disease. And as Dave mentioned earlier, we recently announced initiation of a study in the adjuvant setting, which we see as a significant opportunity.","Based on the biology of CDK-4, Ras-dependent tumors are also a priority, including our ongoing trial in KRAS mutation-positive non-small cell lung cancer. Finally, we see multiple opportunities to combine abemaciclib with novel molecules to enhance efficacy and address resistant mechanisms. These assets, along with Alimta and Erbitux, represent a strong base from which to grow our oncology business.","Now I'll turn it over to Levi.","Levi Garraway - Eli Lilly & Co.","Thanks, Sue. First, let me emphasize how remarkable the opportunity is in oncology these days, and it's particularly exciting here at Lilly Oncology R&D. Our team has the track record, the capabilities and the passion to make a difference for cancer patients, and I'm confident we'll do so.","Earlier, Sue pointed out that the competitive intensity in oncology requires that we raise the bar for clinical impact and innovation. I'll start by describing how we'll set that bar high in order to compete and win in this exciting field.","Sue mentioned the term foundational agent. As shown on the left side of slide 21, we think of foundational agents as having certain important characteristics. Principally, they inhibit a key dependency within the tumor. That is, a target or pathway essential to the viability of the malignant cells themselves or their ability to fend off the immune system. Ideally, we can enrich for such dependencies using genetic or molecular biomarkers, but we must have strong evidence that the target is essential for the biology of the cancer cells.","At the same time, we recognize that changing the standard-of-care in oncology usually requires combinations. Such foundational regimens should be similarly rooted in biology, leading to rational combinations that drive meaningful clinical benefit in multiple malignancies.","From a practical perspective, it becomes essential to employ rigorous and standardized criteria to determine whether a drug candidate could be a future foundational agent. To accomplish this, we've developed a set of criteria that we can apply across the board to assets already in clinical development, assets we want to advance into the clinic and those we may want to bring in from the outside.","First, we must have a clear hypothesis. What is the dependency we're attacking? And how do we know this dependency is operant? Second, we need a clear path to enrich the relevant cancer patient population based on genetic or molecular criteria. This patient enrichment doesn't have to be perfect, but we need one or more biomarkers that tell us we're likely oversampling for patients in whom the dependency is operant during clinical development. The biomarker discovery process really starts in the preclinical stages well before we even begin testing the regimen in patients.","Third, we must optimize the treatment early in development. How do we know we've hit the target hard enough? Can we obtain serial biopsies to look at pharmacodynamics and assess the extent of target engagement or inhibition? How do we engineer a dosing regimen that minimizes off-target toxicities?","The fourth and fifth criteria address key clinical and commercial hurdles we have to clear. Is it looking like we're headed for an incremental or a substantial clinical effect? If it's the former, we either need a better patient enrichment strategy to drive a larger effect size, or we should stop developing.","And finally, we always need to ask ourselves, do we have an opportunity to win? Do we have a path to gain reasonable market share? This is where being first-in-class or best-in-class comes into play.","Given the environmental trend Sue mentioned, we expect that fewer assets will clear the high bar set through this decision framework. However, we should be in a position to drive those assets that do clear the bar more aggressively. We simply can't afford to spread ourselves so thin that we lack the speed and focus required to accelerate potential breakthrough agents and regimens that do meet these criteria.","Now, we've applied this decision framework to our current portfolio, and as we did so it became clear to us that there were a number of molecules that have the potential, depending on the clinical data, of course, to achieve the high bar we have set for standard-of-care changing foundational assets.","You can see on slide 22 that in addition to abemaciclib, which is under priority review at the FDA, we have identified six early to mid-stage assets that potentially meet the decision criteria that I just outlined. These are the assets where we're now focusing the vast majority of our internal R&D dollars.","These include agents targeting CHK1, ERK 1\/2, the TGF-beta receptor and TIM-3. I'll say more about these in a moment. You can see that we've also included our PD-L1 inhibitor and PI3-Kinase\/mTOR inhibitor which we intend to use primarily in combinations that boost other marketed or promising portfolio assets.","Together, these assets have the potential to be foundational agents or to anchor foundational regimens.","We currently have three assets where we're awaiting data from ongoing trials before deciding if they will move into our priority internal pipeline, external partnership or out of our portfolio altogether.","For example, merestinib is a multi-kinase inhibitor currently in a registrational Phase 2 study, together with Cyramza in biliary tract cancer. If this trial meets its primary endpoint, it will become a priority asset for future life cycle development, potentially across multiple indications. If not, we may pursue external partnerships to develop merestinib.","The CSF-1 antibody is in exploratory clinical studies where the magnitude of efficacy will similarly dictate the path forward. For our Ang2 antibody we are currently evaluating potential patient enrichment strategies that could guide its development. Thus, we expect clarifying data to emerge for each of these assets over the next several months.","Finally you'll see a number of assets where we've already engaged or will be seeking external partners to advance clinical development. In some cases, such as the CBC 7 inhibitor, Aurora kinase inhibitor and a novel CHK1 inhibitor, these assets are currently owned by third parties and Lilly retains rights to bring them back in-house if key milestones are met. In most other cases we remain excited about the quality of our compounds, but believe that the optimal development paths will be best implemented in partnership with external entities that have specific or niche biological expertise.","In the case of galunisertib, which inhibits the TGF-beta receptor, we have two ongoing studies in combination with immune checkpoint blockade (25:14). The result of these studies will inform the development of our entire TGF-beta platform, which remains a priority focus.","By prioritizing our assets in this way, we are giving ourselves flexibility to bet more aggressively on portfolio assets with the highest foundational potential while de-risking others externally and importantly making room to bring external innovation into our oncology portfolio, and we'll talk more about that later.","Now I'll highlight three of our priority internal assets briefly to illustrate why we are focusing in this way. First, we have a highly selective ERK 1\/2 inhibitor in Phase 1 studies. ERK is a key oncogenic driver in many cancers, including a large proportion of Ras mutant cancers, nearly all BRAF mutant cancers and mini tumors driven by receptor tyrosine kinase aberrations. The upper left panel shows that the preclinical activity of our ERK inhibitor correlates strongly with alteration in the Ras pathway. The lower left panel show that combinations of our ERK inhibitor with abemaciclib yields superior anti-tumor effects in KRAS mutant xenograph studies, including tumor regression. This molecule is currently in the fourth dose cohort of the ongoing Phase 1 trial and we're encouraged by the early safety and PK\/PD data. Within the next year we expect to both achieve our maximum tolerated dose and begin a series of combination studies with abemaciclib and other assets. These studies will be conducted in tumor types where an ERK dependency is pertinent such as KRAS mutant colorectal cancer, pancreas cancer, advanced lung cancer and others.","Next is prexasertib, a potent small molecule inhibitor of the CHK1 kinase. CHK1 has emerged as an interesting target in cancers with DNA repair defects or a so-called replicated stress in effect. Prexasertib is a first-in-class agent and the left panel shows that we have seen objective responses with prexasertib monotherapy in both platinum-sensitive and platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. We have a molecular enrichment plan in place to explore monotherapy use in ovarian cancer and we see possibilities for prexasertib in other tumors as well. We look forward to continued development of prexasertib in ovarian and other cancer types.","Moving to our TIM-3 monoclonal antibody that just recently entered the clinic, TIM-3 is a PD1-like immune checkpoint. It resides on the surface of T cells and tends to be activated at later cell of a factor T cell function than PD1 in what are often called exhausted T cells. Targeting TIM-3 may therefore help overcome resistance to PD1 therapies and may also enhance PD1 activity when used in combination. Our approach is to take our TIM-3 antibody, which we believe may have a distinct inhibitory mechanism, and expedite its clinical evaluation. This antibody will be developed as a combination with our PD-L1 antibody in patients whose cancers are no longer responsive to existing checkpoint-based immunotherapy regimens.","Now, TIM-3 is just one of several IO assets in our pipeline. For example, we intend to speed development of two bispecific monoclonal antibodies designed against IO targets. The promise of bispecifics is that you not only inhibit two targets present on distinct cell types within a single therapy, but you can also use the arms of the antibody to bring those two different cell types together \u2013 for example, a tumor cell and a cytotoxic T cell \u2013 and that potentially drives greater efficacy.","Together with our other preclinical IO assets and an active business development agenda, which Sue will now say more about, we believe that these R&D efforts will position us well to bring new value to patients in this exciting arena.","Susan Mahony - Eli Lilly & Co.","Thank you, Levi. In addition to the opportunities in our pipeline and our strong research capability, we will actively look to the external market to help us bring the best innovation to patients. Over the last few years we've undertaken a number of clinical partnerships and preclinical collaborations to build on our IO capability. Moving forward, you will see us being more aggressive on the business development front, especially regarding early phase and pre-clinical assets. Specifically we will actively pursue assets that can combine rationally with our existing products, serve as new potential foundational agents and enable new IO breakthroughs. The good news is that there is a lot of external innovation in oncology and we intend to be much more active in this space to ensure we have a competitive pipeline going forward.","So to conclude, we already have a solid base to build upon with Alimta hopefully enjoying exclusivity in the US after 2022 and in Europe and Japan after 2021. And with Erbitux, Cyramza, Lartruvo and soon abemaciclib is approved. By rigorously employing the framework that Levi described earlier, we'll focus on innovation that can deliver meaningful improvements in survival with a balance toward first-in-class and best-in-class assets. We'll maintain a competitive pipeline by accessing more external innovation, particularly at earlier stages of clinical development. We'll focus only on assets that meet the high bar that we've described and move quickly to capitalize on promising early data. And finally, we'll invest more heavily behind the bets we do make to drive robust life cycle plans that maximize the value that patients and investors can derive from our innovation.","So again, we have a strong base to build from, but we need to and we will make changes to be more competitive and to deliver innovation that is highly valued by patients and physicians. This is a time of unprecedented growth and opportunity in oncology and it's an exciting time to be at Lilly where we have an opportunity to make major impacts on the lives of patients that suffer from the most deadly cancers.","Levi and I will be happy to answer any questions that you may have during the Q&A session. But now I'll turn the call over to Derica for a review of our overall corporate pipeline, progress on our potential key events and an update on our financial guidance for 2017.","Derica W. Rice - Eli Lilly & Co.","Thanks, Sue. Slide 28 shows our NME pipeline as of July 21. Similar to what Levi showed you for the oncology NME pipeline and similar to what we've been doing for our NILEX pipeline, this shows select NMEs, highlighting those on which we think investors should focus. Should you need or want it, our IR team can provide you a list of the additional clinical stage assets in our portfolio that aren't shown in this view of select assets.","Positive movement since our last earnings call includes the US submission of abemaciclib for advanced breast cancer based on both MONARCH 1 and MONARCH 2, the movement of an endocrine mimetic for diabetes into Phase 2 and initiation of Phase 1 for a molecule to treat cancer, diabetes and Alzheimer's disease, the addition of two assets from our recent collaboration with KeyBioscience and termination of development of a Phase 1 asset. Our select NILEX pipeline as shown on slide 29 reflects the initiation of the abemaciclib adjuvant breast cancer study.","Now, turning to slide 30, you can see the considerable progress we've made on the key events we projected for 2017. Dave already mentioned most of the key events that have occurred since our last earnings call so I'll simply comment on two changes. First, we now expect to begin the Phase 3 study for baricitinib and psoriatic arthritis next year. Second, we've added a line in the Phase 3 internal readout section for the final analysis of the RAINFALL study for ramucirumab in the first line gastric cancer as we now expect that event before the end of the year.","Turning to our 2017 financial guidance on slide 31, you'll see that we've raised the range for revenue by $200 million primarily due to the uptake trends we're seeing for our new pharmaceutical products that offset headwinds in our animal health business.","Moving to the gross margin percent, we have reduced our guidance by a percentage point due to the effect of foreign exchange movement. On R&D expense, we've increased the range by $100 million with the major drivers being the CoLucid acquisition and our decision to start the abemaciclib adjuvant trial which we've gotten up and running in record time.","We've decreased our GAAP tax rate and EPS primarily to reflect the Nektar deal. Finally, we've increased our non-GAAP EPS range by a nickel to $4.10 to $4.20 per share, and we've reduced our estimate for full year capital expenditures by $100 million to reflect updated project timing.","Before we go to the Q&A session, let me briefly sum up. We've had another strong quarter. Led by a new product, worldwide revenue grew 8%. By making disciplined investments in our business, we've leveraged that top line growth into 29% non-GAAP EPS growth, or 32% growth when excluding FX.","While we're disappointed with the delay of baricitinib here in the U.S., we continue to have strong momentum behind our innovation-based strategy. Since our last earnings call, we received approval for Olumiant in Japan, we've received priority review for abemaciclib, and we've bolstered our pipeline with the KeyBioscience deal. We also completed an important strategic review of oncology and are confident that execution of this more focused strategy will position us to make significant contributions in this important therapeutic area.","Going forward, our management team will remain focused on launching new products with excellence, reloading our late-stage pipeline, driving increased productivity to expand our operating margins, and investing in our core drivers of our business: talent, scientific capability, and technology platforms to ensure our future growth prospects.","This concludes our prepared remarks. Now I'll turn the call over to Phil to moderate the Q&A session. Phil?","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Great. Thank you, Derica. We would like to take as many questions as possible from the callers on the line, so we do ask that you limit your questions to two or to one two-part question. John, if you can please provide the instructions for the Q&A session, and then we're ready for the first caller.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. [Operation Instructions] First we'll go to the line of Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Chris Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks very much for the questions. Just two here. First coming on baricitinib, can you just elaborate a little bit more on what a trial addressing DBT and PE would look like here? It seems like it ought to be a very, very large or very long-term study given the low event rate. So along those lines, should we think about something significantly longer than 18 months delay if you have to run a study with baricitinib?","Second question for me is on diabetes. Any initial look or commentary on the 2018 kind of access or pricing as we go through this contracting season? I guess, should we think about any major changes to your access or price? I know you're not going to give 2018 guidance, but just kind of directionally, how should we think about the portfolios heading into next year? Thanks very much.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Great. Thank you, Chris, for the questions. So Christi, we'll go to you for the first question on baricitinib, and then over to you, Enrique, for the question on 2018 access for diabetes products. Christi?","Christi Shaw - Eli Lilly & Co.","Thank you very much for the question. As you probably saw in the press release this morning, we remain very disappointed, especially for the many rheumatoid arthritis patients in the United States who don't have access to bari in spite of its access in other countries and regions.","In terms of the clinical trial and how long that will take, we know that in exploring all of our options, the minimum amount for resubmission will be 18 months. We don't yet have clarity with the FDA. That will be discussions we have with them, exactly what kind of trial will help define better the benefit-risk profile of baricitinib. But we are committed to a path forward working with the FDA on that.","And I'll summarize by saying in the end, all of these patients who are living with rheumatoid arthritis in spite of all of the great treatments that are available continue to suffer, and Americans deserve access to this treatment and we will continue to pursue not only rheumatoid arthritis but other indications with bari.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Okay. Thank you, Christi. Enrique?","Enrique A. Conterno - Eli Lilly & Co.","Chris, so we do have, as you're aware, good access when we look across our brands, and we have a strong performance which helps our competitive position as we look at 2018. The negotiations at this stage are not finalized. It would be premature for me to comment.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Yeah. And Chris, we do typically allow the payers to actually make their announcements before we would comment on changes. I don't think we'll begin to hear any of those until August, September timeframe, likely.","John, if we can go to the next caller, please?","Operator","And we'll go to Seamus Fernandez with Leerink. Please go ahead.","Seamus Fernandez - Leerink Partners LLC","Thanks very much for the questions. So, just a couple here. In terms of the situation with baricitinib, you do mention other opportunities and indications. I think about a year ago at your Analyst Day you mentioned expectation for your atopic dermatitis study to wrap up with baricitinib. We haven't seen those data yet. Just wondering when we might see those data? And if that is one of the indications that you're interested in pursuing? Just as a follow-up to that, given the DBT PE dynamics, can you just help us understand if RA patients are uniquely at higher risk of DBT and PE such that FDA would be a little more balanced when considering other indications? And then just a final question, as we look at sort of the opportunity for leverage, I know this question continues to get asked of Dave on a repeated basis, but as we continue to look at the leverage opportunity in the operating expense line, just wanted to get a better sense of if this is still viewed as a purely sales-driven opportunity or if you can work to control costs. And just wanted to say thanks, Derica, for all of your efforts over the years. It's been a real pleasure.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Great, Seamus. Thank you for the questions. Chris, we'll go to you for the first two on baricitinib. Derica, if you want to comment on the third one? Obviously, Dave, feel free to chime in. Christi?","Christi Shaw - Eli Lilly & Co.","Sure. Thank you for the question, Seamus. We are pursuing other indications and continue our studies in atopic dermatitis as well as lupus, and we're also going to begin the psoriatic arthritis trial next year. In specific terms of atopic dermatitis, the Phase 2 data you will see presented at a scientific forum before the end of the year.","And then in terms of DBT and PE, yeah, there was one placebo-controlled trial in the RA study that showed an imbalance of DBT versus placebo. The overall rate, if you look at the multiple Phase 3 trial, in 3,000 patients, the overall rate of DBT on patients treated with baricitinib was the same as what is published in patients on the overall background rate in rheumatoid arthritis in general.","So hopefully that answers your question and gives you a rationale as to why we disagree with the FDA, and why we feel very positive about pursuing other indications with baricitinib and continuing to find a path forward in RA with the FDA.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Thanks, Christi. Derica?","Derica W. Rice - Eli Lilly & Co.","Thanks for your question, Seamus, and for your comment. In regards to our margin goals, as we stated, 50% was the goal for 2018. We think we'll go beyond that as we think about the remainder of the decade and beyond. In regards to how we get there, it's both. It is attributed to us driving a strong revenue growth profile that you've seen here for the first six months of the year \u2013 8% in Q2 alone. But it also is contingent on us continuing to drive a very deliberate productivity and cost containment agenda inside Lilly.","So when you look at our margin, if you look at just gross margin, you see the over 90 basis points of improvement, that was a combination of prices but also manufacturing efficiencies, and we saw that in Q1. And if you look at our OpEx, we improved our OpEx ratio by over 390 basis points alone in just the Q2.","So you will continue to see us executing on both profiles, launching with excellence, but then, yes, also driving a very deliberate cost containment and productivity agenda inside Lilly going forward.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","And Seamus, just to put a little bit of numbers on your prior question. To our knowledge the published rates of DBT and PE for patients with RA do range from approximately 0.3 to 0.8 per 100 patient years, and the rate reported for all RA patients receiving baricitinib during our development program was 0.46 per 100 patient years.","John, if we can go to the next caller, please?","Operator","And that will be John Boris with SunTrust. Please go ahead.","John T. Boris - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thanks for taking the questions, and congrats on the results. So, question for Dave on the pricing front. Obviously, there continues to be some bantering that continues on the pricing front, but the industry has done a relatively good job to shift that to discussing, certainly high coinsurance, high deductibles. It seems as though Lilly does give up a significant portion as a pass-through on rebates. How can the industry help to shed additional light on that 50%, I think, that Lilly gives back in terms of rebates to give that back to customers for coinsurance, dependency in plans? Is there any thought about how you can do that through contracting with PBMs going forward to get better control over where that's going?","The second question just for Levi, really appreciate the internal review that you gave but when you look externally, and if you had a wish list, are there certain things that you don't have within your portfolio that might be at the top of the list that you would like to bring in to Lilly's oncology portfolio? Thanks.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Great. John, thank you for the questions. Pretty straightforward. Dave, for the first one. And then over to you, Levi, for your wish list on your external innovation. Dave?","David A. Ricks - Eli Lilly & Co.","Yeah. Thanks, John. On the pricing debate in the U.S., of course, the battle will never be over. I think we need to continue to explain the value proposition we offer and defend the business model. But I agree with you. We have staved off, I think, some of the worst ideas and continue to remain focused in Washington and the states on advocating for strategies that can actually bring down out-of-pocket cost for consumers. As you point out, we published earlier this year that 50% of our list price is discounted on average, and patients rarely receive any of that benefit at the pharmacy counter. One big lever we've advocated for aggressively along with our pharma colleagues is through the Part D program, passing through rebates in the donut hole in some form. That's still on the table.","In commercial plans, we do see growing interest in the same idea from large employers, and if you look at the absolute inflation rate of net pricing in medications versus the out-of-pocket cost for patients, they're not close. Patient out-of-pocket costs are accelerating rapidly. Finally, I'd say we've been a leader in prodding the system, if you would, through programs that work outside of insurance both through Express Scripts in this case, but I see other PBMs active in the space providing a discount program that works outside the insurance system and provides PBM-like rebates directly to patients. We've done this in our insulin business with both Blink Health and more recently with the direct ESI program. We'll continue to do that to point out that net pricing is not something patients enjoy, but I don't expect this to go away overnight and we'll remain focused on it, John, to reduce the long-term risk to the business.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Thanks, Dave. Levi?","Levi Garraway - Eli Lilly & Co.","Well, thanks for the question. So as you point out, one of the most exciting areas of oncology has been just the amount of innovation that exists across the arena. And here at Lilly, Dave has really been pushing the idea of being more active in terms of bringing in external innovation so we're very pleased for that prioritization here within Lilly. To your specific question about a wish list, we don't look at this at an asset-by-asset level, but rather we think about what can boost our strategy. So what could be brought in that might combine well with some of our promising products and, just in general, what are some areas scientifically where it's been obvious that advances have been made and where, if we could leverage what we do well at Lilly in terms of clinical development, we could add value there.","So I would say it's not really an asset-by-asset basis but really letting the science drive strategy and certainly that would cover the gambit of both targeted therapy and immunotherapy advances.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Thanks, Levi. John, if we can go to the next caller, please.","Operator","We'll go to Tim Anderson with Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Timothy Minton Anderson - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you. A couple of questions. On abemaciclib, you described this as one of your foundational assets and later this year you'll present MONARCH 3. Do you think that once those results are presented, the general takeaway from analysts and from oncologists is going to be that abema is clearly better than palbociclib when everyone does their side by side comparisons? Thus far, despite Lilly's claims of differentiation, there's not a lot of people that are convinced that it's truly a best-in-class product.","Second question is on Alimta and the timing of the ruling for the IPR. In the past, Lilly was willing to give a timeline because the rules for this sort of thing are pretty clear. Most recently you've backed away from providing a timeline, and I'm wondering why the uncertainty this time around and what can we expect in terms of a timeline, if you have any updates.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Great, Tim. Thank you for the questions. I think, Sue, those are both for you.","Susan Mahony - Eli Lilly & Co.","Yeah, Tim, thanks very much. Yeah. Well firstly, on abema we're delighted that we have the priority review for MONARCH 1 and MONARCH 2, and we anticipate getting action on those Q1 of next year. With regards to MONARCH 3, we're presenting it at ESMO. I think we've been pretty clear all the way through, Tim, that we do believe that we've got a differentiated medicine here and one that potentially could be best-in-class. We've got to look across all of the data to assess that across the different clinical data, looking at PFS response rate, et cetera, and across different trials, and we've now got the MONARCH 1 data that shows single agent activity. The MONARCH 2 data, which was in an endocrine-resistant patient population, a very homogenous patient population where we, to the best of our knowledge, have seen the highest PFS in any trial today in that population, and of course, we'll see the MONARCH 3 later this year. So we continue to be very excited by this molecule. But I would continue to encourage you to look across all the data and all the trials as we assess this medicine.","With regards to the Alimta IPR, we are now anticipating that we should get a reading on the IPR by the end of this year. That's the latest that we know, okay? And if we know any more, we'll let you know, but that's our understanding.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Great. Thank you, Sue. John, if we can go to the next caller, please.","Operator","We'll go to the line of Andrew Baum with Citi. Please go ahead.","Andrew S. Baum - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","Thank you. A couple of questions, please. The obvious bedfellow for prexasertib given the mechanism and the lack of overlapping top (50:41) would be a PARP inhibitor, so what's your appetite for larger and later biotech deals around, in your own words, a potentially foundational drug in the form of a PARP? Second for Levi, how does your TIM-3 differentiate itself from Novartis? I think both target hospitals (51:01) if I read your slides correctly. And then finally on the outlook statement in relation to animal health, could you break down for us how much of the competitive pressures, market slowing that you're seeing is market-specific versus merely portfolio-specific? Thank you.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Andrew, thank you for the questions. So, Dave, we'll go to you for the appetite for large later-stage biotech deals. On to Levi for the question on TIM-3. And then Jeff, over to you for the drivers in animal health. Dave?","David A. Ricks - Eli Lilly & Co.","Yeah. Thanks, Andrew. Just to \u2013 not commenting specifically on the PARP inhibitor idea, and maybe Levi if I could just chime in on that, but the frame we have on M&A and business development isn't necessarily limited by size but rather by logic, which is we're interested in things that add to our portfolio where we can create new value for patients in the health care system, maybe through combinations or through individual assets. We're not interested in business combinations that create a short term cost synergy. We've said in the past that those would include small and mid-sized M&A and so in that regard, I guess your question is would we rule out M&A, small and mid-sized? No, we wouldn't if it made sense on the first basis, which is adding to our portfolio in a way that creates new value for the health care system.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Great. Thanks, Dave. Levi?","Levi Garraway - Eli Lilly & Co.","Yeah, just adding on prexasertib I would agree with Dave and certainly your point about PARP inhibitors, this particular combination is interesting, but there are actually several potential interesting combinations that we're pursuing with prexasertib. So what we think about this, as Dave mentioned, sort of the totality of what the science supports as opposed to a particular deal or exchange.","With regard to TIM-3, our preclinical evidence suggests that our TIM-3 molecule has a distinct mechanism of TIM-3 inhibition than some of the competitor molecules, and this could be of potential importance because unlike, for example, PD1 where the relevant ligands are well understood in terms of the reason why an anti-PD1 works in cancer immunotherapy, there are actually several ligands for TIM-3 and the relative contribution to those ligands in the tumor immunology context is less clear. So obviously it's early days. We'll need to await clinical activity to determine whether that's a clinical distinction, but preclinically, that does appear to be a potentially important difference.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Thank you, Levi. Jeff?","Jeffrey N. Simmons - Eli Lilly & Co.","Yeah, Andrew, I think I'll just put in a broader context the animal health situation, and then I'll answer the mix versus the market or portfolio. You know, as we signaled earlier this year, we did expect Q2 to be a challenging quarter. Part of this was due to the higher buy-in a year ago with the SAP cutover, but there are really three issues that Dave mentioned in his comments that have impacted our Q2 results in animal health. One, competitive pressures in comp animal parasiticides. Two, market access in food animal. That is portfolio-driven. And competitive pressures in cattle.","So, on the first issue just real quickly, on the competitive pressures in comp animal parasiticides, we continue to see new entrants. We continue to see the space become more crowded. However, we do see positives for us in our comp animal business and I'll touch on two. Galliprant, our deal with Aratana, that growth is meeting expectations. And then our BI vaccine portfolio, that is also on track with our expectations.","As you move to market access, this is where there's a portfolio factor. Posilac, and this is mainly the big driver here in Q2, or rbST, it's a productivity product in the dairy market. We have seen U.S. customers chosen to forego the benefits of this with the oversupply of milk and lower prices. We've seen kind of the clean food label movement, and then you combine this with the unfavorable economics in dairy. And then I think the last issue is just food animal competition primarily in U.S. beef. And this is just increased bundling activity and more aggressive pricing. That's some market-driven, but as well portfolio.","But I've put our focus and where our focus is, is on this medium and long-term agenda. Accelerating innovation, changing our mix into these higher-growth product segments and improving productivity. We've recently launched or soon will be launching a number of new products. Two in aquaculture, a vaccine and a parasiticide, a salmonella vaccine in broilers, and we've recently received an approval for our flea-tick combo product in the EU. So our business mix is improving with vaccines, nutritionals in comp animals (55:40), and it's becoming a larger part of our business.","Finally, I would just say that we've got many productivity streams that will improve overall operations in both manufacturing and sales efficiency.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Thank you, Jeff. John, if we can go to the next caller.","Operator","And that would be Umer Raffat with Evercore. Please go ahead.","Umer Raffat - Evercore ISI","Hi. Thank you for taking my question. I actually wanted to focus on marketed products, if I may. And perhaps starting off on the diabetes side. I was curious what the dynamic is behind Humalog franchising pricing pressure in the U.S., but Humulin franchise has seen pricing tailwinds this quarter. So that was one. On Taltz perhaps in psoriasis, curious to how you're thinking about how IL-23 competition impacts the trajectory going forward or not. And then finally, I found it interesting that you mentioned Alimta U.S. is tracking at decreased demand, despite the Keytruda approval in KEYNOTE-021G and I was just curious what the dynamic is there. Thank you.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Umer, thank you for the question. So, Enrique, we'll go to you for the Humalog and Humulin pricing dynamics. Christi, to you for the question on IL-23 impact to Taltz. Then Sue, the U.S. Alimta question. Enrique?","Enrique A. Conterno - Eli Lilly & Co.","Sure. So as we've noted during previous earning calls, we expect some volatility around our U.S. Humalog sales. We expect that to continue, given that we make estimates on rebates and discounts at the end of each quarter. We do not learn about the actual utilization until later periods.","Now maybe the best way to characterize Humalog is to basically try to look at the underlying performance and try to normalize it for some of these changes that are related to prior periods. When we normalize Humalog, Humalog sales are declining about 5%. There is growth in the low single-digit when it comes to volume, but pricing is basically declining in the mid to high single-digits. Now, why is price declining if we continue to see pressure when it comes to increased rebates? Also, we basically see a continued shift towards a mix of the segments where the higher rebated segments are basically growing faster, i.e., Medicaid to point one example.","In the case of Humulin, I think the situation is a bit different. So we grew in the U.S. Humulin 11%. I think we need to keep in mind that when it comes to Humulin now, 60% of our revenue in Humulin is really \u2013 almost 60% is coming from U-500 and only the rest from U-100. They have very different trends. U-100 is declining while U-500 is basically increasing right now revenue at about 20%. So different dynamics there and that's why I think is you're seeing the reported results. Thanks.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Thank you, Enrique. Christi?","Christi Shaw - Eli Lilly & Co.","Hi, Umer. Yes, we're still very excited about Taltz and what we're seeing in the marketplace that the study is translating into the real world, we're seeing fast response, clear response and we think we've set a pretty high bar if you look at the NBRx growth. With the IL-23s coming to market however, we do believe it's an opportunity for patients to raise the bar on their own expectations so that the market will actually grow for the newer agents which will help all of the new agents that have higher efficacy, especially if you look at the head-to-head trials. So we expect to see the market of the newer agents grow and we're very excited. As you know, we talked at our last earnings call that we submitted for psoriatic arthritis for Taltz and we expect to hear back by the end of the year on our submission.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Thank you, Christi. Sue?","Susan Mahony - Eli Lilly & Co.","Yeah. With regard to Alimta, well, we've seen a steady decline in Alimta's share of market over the year or so, really due to IL competition, as well as some of the targeted agents like the ALK inhibitors. So this has been pretty consistent and we've seen that. So we do have a decline over last year, although we did see an increase Q2 versus Q1. We think that's mainly buying patterns. The KEYNOTE-021 G data clearly is important and we're delighted that the NCCN has now listed that as a Category 2A, so we do believe that we will see a use there, although it's too early to say how much use at this point. And it's also important to note that with the combination with Alimta it's probably going to be used in the PD-L1 low patient population of which Alimta has got about a 50% market share there. So although we believe that we will see use, we don't anticipate that we're going to drive growth of Alimta through this.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Great. Thank you, Sue. John, next caller, please.","Operator","And we'll go to Steve Scala with Cowen. Please go ahead.","Steve Scala - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you. First, a question for Dave on baricitinib, it seems that Lilly and FDA have a significant difference of opinion on regulatory requirements. How, in your experience, are such differences resolved and what are the mechanisms and timeframe for doing so to get the best possible outcome for Lilly? So that's the first question. And secondly, why is the baricitinib psoriatic arthritis trial initiation being delayed? Is it to clarify the landscape for the molecule overall or is it some indication-specific reason? Thank you.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Your question, Dave for the first general question on the situation with FDA and then, Christi, to you for the second question on psoriatic arthritis.","David A. Ricks - Eli Lilly & Co.","Yeah. Thanks, Steve. Obviously, as Christi said and we noted in our remarks, we're disappointed with the outcome. I think we do have clarity on what the FDA's point of view is. It's just not our point of view and therein lies the difference. Now they're the regulator. We need to engage with them and find the best path forward. Considering time but also label quality for baricitinib and RA. The resolution of this, to me, there's a variety of tools available to us.","One of those is to do new clinical work as we indicated that the FDA has requested we do that. That's something certainly we're scoping and looking at now. In addition, all of the original for FDA studies we did in the Phase 3 program continue and so we continue to pile up events, albeit on a baricitinib-only basis to compare to background rates, et cetera, and I think that's important. And then launching in Europe and Japan will quickly eclipse the number of patients treated in clinical trials with those treated in the real world and I think that's also an important set of data to help us work through what is the safety issue of low incidence, which I think Seamus asked about earlier, how do you resolve that. It's going to be a combination of those levers coupled with other tools we can use, whether it be labeling or otherwise to work through this FDA situation.","We're trying to give investors a reasonable expectation as to the timeline for resubmission and then approval because we know that was a big open question. That all said, and as Christi said, we're highly committed to the asset. We've got a long IP runway. We think JAK inhibitors are a profound improvement for patients, in particular baricitinib, given its unique profile in early RA especially and we aim to get it there, along with other NILEXes which we could pursue, like atopic derm, SLE, et cetera. So it's definitely disappointing, but we're committed to move forward, and we have a variety of tools to advance this one.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Thank you, Dave. Christi?","Christi Shaw - Eli Lilly & Co.","Yes. And on the question on psoriatic arthritis, based on the fact it's the same division reviewing RA and psoriatic arthritis, we felt it was prudent for us to take a pause, ensuring that we incorporated feedback from the FDA so that as we pursued the indication we knew that we were aligned. And so that's what we've done, and that's why now we're telling you that we are going to push the go button. And in 2018, we'll be pursuing that trial for bari in psoriatic arthritis.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Thank you, Christi.","Steve Scala - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","John, if we can go to the next caller, please?","Operator","We'll go to Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you. Just sticking with that topic on baricitinib, at what point \u2013 or is there actually a point where you just decide it's not worth going forward, just given that there are other newer agents coming to the market and RA is a really entrenched market to begin with? I mean, is there a point that you just say it's not worth it? Or not? And then should we also assume that the atopic dermatitis and lupus indications are also put on hold until you get better clarity with FDA? And then my other question relates to SUSTAIN-7, which I believe should be reported out sometime in the third quarter. Can you remind us, Dave, your expectations for that study? I think you've said before that you would expect semaglutide to show better efficacy but maybe worse safety than Trulicity. And if SUSTAIN-7 is positive, how do you maintain market share of Trulicity? Thanks very much.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Thanks, Jami. So, Dave, let's go to you for the first question on baricitinib's procedural aspects and if we ever get to a point where we wouldn't go forward with RA. And then, Christi, if you'd comment on plans for atopic dermatitis and lupus? And then, Enrique, on our view on SUSTAIN-7. Dave?","David A. Ricks - Eli Lilly & Co.","Yeah. Thanks, Jami. The bottom line is we're a long way from anything like that point that you're highlighting for a couple of reasons. I think, first, rheumatoid arthritis remains both a large unmet need and the largest category in the autoinflammatory space. Baricitinib has proven profound benefit, best-in-class.","We of course did the Humira head-to-head and methotrexate head-to-head, and so what we need to do is put behind us the sunk cost of this and just go forward and see how competitive is the next investment given the opportunity we have in that space and the unmet need available? We feel very strongly that that's positive, and we're going to be pushing forward.","The IP runway, as I mentioned, is very long \u2013 probably through the end of the next decade. And the way the market works, as you're pointing out, is it's dense with competition. A breadth of indication strategy is probably important for any JAK inhibitor, and without RA in that mix, it probably affects the competitiveness of all of the indications.","So right now we're focused on getting to the next step. We're confident we're going to get through this with the FDA. And Christi can comment on the other indications, but we're moving ahead. And of course remember, the OUS environment for baricitinib is very positive. We have a great label in Europe and Japan. Those TNF markets are also very large, and we're focused on executing the launches in those spaces. And they'll need additional indications as well.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Thanks, Dave. Christi?","Christi Shaw - Eli Lilly & Co.","Yes. So the psoriatic arthritis trial was the only trial that we've paused. We've had good conversations with the derm division at FDA. Atopic dermatitis and lupus have not been paused. They are continuing as planned. And as I said before, we expect data to be released at a scientific session before the end of the year on atopic derm, and we expect data on SLE either later this year or beginning of next year.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Thank you, Christi. Enrique?","Enrique A. Conterno - Eli Lilly & Co.","So, Jami, when it comes to SUSTAIN-7, of course we have to wait for the result, but based on some of the modeling that we've done, what are we expecting, which I think is your question. One is, we expect that they're going to show a difference when it comes to weight, and we believe that they're going to show a small difference when it comes to hemoglobin A1c.","Clearly, we need to weigh all of that against any label that they may receive, and that is up to the regulators. But as you are likely aware, as part of SUSTAIN-6, semagluta showed a signal when it comes to (01:08:27). And the specifics of how was that defined is whether it's blindness, hemorrhaging, ocular injections and so forth. So, clearly we need to wait for the totality of the data and further discussions that Novartis will have with the FDA. We view this as an important competitor to us and we are very much prepared to continue to grow Trulicity going forward.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Thank you, Enrique. John, next caller, please.","Operator","We'll go to Gregg Gilbert with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Maybe just going back to clean up on animal health. Dave, any updated thoughts on Elanco and how it fits into the long-term value creation story you have for Lilly? I assume you've had adequate time now to really dig in on that? And then on the pipeline, is there anything you could share about what was learned in the interim analysis for the BACE inhibitor? And on the DACRA, if I could call it that, how might that be differentiated from Trulicity? Thanks.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Hey, Gregg. Thank you for the questions. Dave, if you want to comment on the first animal health question? And then, Jan, if you like to maybe comment on the interim that we had for the BACE inhibitor as well as the DACRA, and Rick, absolutely feel free to comment on that one as well. Dave?","David A. Ricks - Eli Lilly & Co.","Yes. Gregg, I think this question has come up before and I'll say the same thing which is in any case we need to constantly review our portfolio. We need to make sure all of our assets, we have a basis for holding and driving incremental value versus what anyone else can do and animal health is no different from that. Right now, as Jeff indicated in his answer in terms of the performance issues, and in my early days here, we've been very focused on operational improvements that we've put together a number of companies including Novartis combination. And in my experience, and also I think in our real experience, it takes some effort and work to get to true operational effectiveness after that kind of combination. We also have some environmental headwinds we need to reposition against. Jeff outlined a response to those.","So that's really our focus right now. But your question is a good one. We'll constantly be asking ourselves that question and of course if we have a new thought about that, we'll come back to the investment community.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Great. Thanks, Dave. Jan?","Jan M. Lundberg - Eli Lilly & Co.","Right. In relation to the interim BACE study, this analysis looked at the safety and also assessment if there were cognitive worsening and the sample size re-estimation. And the recommendation was to continue the preferred trial as planned and not change the size of the trial. The continuation of this trial, we should remind also people that it is in amyloid-positive patients and it's the prodromal and the mild population. If we talk about the new DACRA and the calcitonin amylin receptor agonists, this is an interesting new class of agent that potentially could have a superior weight loss with a competitive glucose lowering. That's one way of describing it, potentially less nausea as well. And the key thing here could be insulin sensitization and this agent is different from the GLP-1s since it doesn't release insulin but rather enhanced sensitization for insulin which could mean even a better durability of the glucose lowering effect.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Great. Thank you, Jan. John, if we could go to the next caller?","Operator","We'll go to Geoff Meacham with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Geoff Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Good morning, guys. Thanks for the questions. Just had a few. On galcanezumab, lots of data across the CGRP landscape this year. How are you guys thinking about the payer attitudes before the filing? I can't remember, have you guys \u2013 is the launch reflected in your long-term revenue growth guidance? And then a bigger picture question on biz dev, you guys provided a pretty specific strategy on oncology. How much does valuation inform the decision or the urgency and what's the relative attractiveness to other categories such as neuroscience, inflammation, et cetera? Thanks.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Okay. Geoff, thank you for the question. So, Christi, if you could comment on how we view pair attitudes in the migraine space. Derica, if you can comment on whether or not galcanezumab is in our sort of midterm financial expectations. And then, Dave, you'll take the last question. Christi?","Christi Shaw - Eli Lilly & Co.","So we're very excited, first of all, about galcanezumab. If you think about patients losing up to 50 days of their life every year and being able to cut that in half, it's just an amazing proposition. We do know we're not going to be the only product on the market, and we'll have a lot of competition but I think we have a couple of things. One, I don't \u2013 we don't see any other CGRP data that's better than our own. We look at the data and see that if you look at the response rates, about 60% of patients respond, have a greater than 50% response rate, 33% at greater than 75% response rate, and about 12% or 1 in 8 patients will have 100% response rate. So we feel like we have a very strong efficacy profile, couple that with a really good benefit risk ratio.","So that's number one on galcanezumab. On the contracting piece, the great thing that we have at Lilly is a background in neuroscience, and we have a pain platform. It's not just galcanezumab, but as we go to payers soon after galcanezumab we'll be looking at lasmiditan, which already completed one Phase 3 study. The next Phase 3 study will be completed by the end of the year. And then follow that a little bit further with our partnership with Pfizer on tanezumab, we're looking at really putting a dent in the opioid crisis in the United States. And as we look at the entire platform, we feel pretty confident with our discussion \u2013 going into discussions with payers in the U.S.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Thank you, Christi. Derica?","Derica W. Rice - Eli Lilly & Co.","Jeff, the simple answer is yes, it is in, but on a probable-ized basis, as we do with the majority of our late-stage portfolio assets.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Perfect. Dave?","David A. Ricks - Eli Lilly & Co.","Yeah. So, I guess your broad question on BD, with any transaction, oncology is no different, we're going to look at several factors, of course, how it fits within our strategy both clinically and business-wise, the portfolio and the opportunity to combine it with other things is of course very important to oncology. And then \u2013 so that depends on the assets we're holding.","And then of course we look at the valuation that we need to \u2013 any transaction needs to produce returns well above our cost of capital on a risk-adjusted basis. So when we go through all those filters, it does diminish the field of available targets. And we also, at Lilly, I think we're pretty flexible. We're not \u2013 we don't have to own things outright. I think we're happy to share risk, et cetera, and oncology is no different from that.","Relative attractiveness is an interesting question. I would say in recent times we've seen the price points for oncology, particularly post PoC, are very challenging to get to a number. Our strategy, as communicated today by Sue and Levi, is to really open up that field and look at earlier projects, maybe take a little more risk, trading in front of the proof of concept, but making scientific judgments and then seeing those bear out. In that way we could probably do more transactions that might be smaller, and if we make the right judgments, have that pay off for our shareholders.","Relative to other areas, oncology has a lot of targets. But I would say relatively the pricing is on the higher end. We like immunology a lot. There's also a lot of targets there and pricing, while creeping up, is still good. You saw the deal yesterday on the Nektar transaction, which we thought was an exceptional financial transaction and fits our strategy and is a compelling clinical asset.","And then in other fields, like KeyBioscience, Jan was just talking about the DACRA platform, there are opportunities. So across our five TAs, oncology included, we look at everything, and we are disciplined on our financial analysis, but also strategy and clinical value.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Great. Thank you, Dave. John, if we can go to the next caller?","Operator","We'll go to Vamil Divan with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Vamil K. Divan - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Great. Thanks so much for taking the questions and thanks for the overview on the oncology strategy. So a couple of follow-ups just on the oncology side. CSF-1R I think is a mechanism that we've heard pretty good interest from (01:17:05). So I was a little surprised when you mentioned that's more of a Tier 2 asset now. And you said it was a magnitude of success that (01:17:11) you wanted to see. Maybe you could just give a little more detail on what you're looking for from that asset in terms of the efficacy?","And then a more general question on that front, we've seen other mechanisms, like dose (01:17:22) for example, where you don't see much efficacy as a single agent, but it does seem to have value in combination. So how do you think about that when you're making your prioritization decisions sort of at early stage? And maybe putting your mechanism as a lower priority when there might be an opportunity in a different indication or in combination.","And then second just on abemaciclib, following up on some of your earlier comments, we've heard for a while about some of the opportunity here for this class and this drug outside of breast cancer. And you mentioned non-small cell, I think squamous and I think pancreatic cancer on your slide. Can you just give us a sense of when we might start seeing some more data on these other tumor types to get a sense of potential for the drug and the class outside of breast cancer? Thanks.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Great. Vamil, thank you for the questions. Levi, if you'll take maybe the first two for sure, the CSF-1R and then how we view agents that might not have single-agent activity but could be useful in combos? And then Sue and Levi, maybe you can both contribute to answer the last question on timing for readouts for abema outside of breast cancer? Levi?","Levi Garraway - Eli Lilly & Co.","Sure. Well, thanks for the question. So with CSF-1R, just going back to our decision framework, there are several considerations that we have when we're looking at whether or not an asset is going to clear the bar. In addition to the scientific rationale, we're also looking at clinical magnitude and even also the commercial landscape. And I think with CSF-1R in particular, that's an example of where it's a crowded space, and so our decision making about how aggressively we invest will be determined by the distinctive characteristics of our agent and our study, so \u2013 and we have a couple of studies ongoing that will inform that.","With regard to the other question, you're absolutely correct. It is a very important point that as we build rational regimens we are increasingly seeing that key members of regimens may or may not have that impressive single activity, and IDL could be an example. One could even argue that some of the other Cetacaine (01:19:21) inhibitors were examples of that. So, this is another example of why it's so important to think about the scientific rationale; what is the biology that's operant, what are we trying to target, and is there a reason to believe that if we put a combination together we'll get a much greater effect than we might see with any individual component.","So, in general, so there's not a specific answer to the question, obviously it will depend on the particular combinations and indications, but you're absolutely correct, this is increasingly something we're considering. What's the target regimen, the combination we want to put together and the aggregate biological rationale and not just the individual components.","Susan Mahony - Eli Lilly & Co.","With abemaciclib, let me start and you may want to say more about the other indications, but the lung indication for the KRAS mutant lung, we should have that data in Q4 this year, so you should see that data then or at least we'll do a top line then and then we'll present the data at an upcoming meeting after that. And then with regards to the other studies, we are on an ongoing study in pancreatic cancer. At this present time we should see probably data on that next year sometime, and you want to comment on another?","Levi Garraway - Eli Lilly & Co.","Yeah, sure. So beyond that we also have abemaciclib in conjunction with trastuzumab and I would call the MONARCH HER study which is a HER2 positive- HR positive (01:20:47) breast cancer. That one is enrolling, and it may take a couple of years to have that readout. But then beyond that we have a number of combination studies that we are doing with abemaciclib so that's relevant to the second question. So we have \u2013 those are earlier-stage, but there are several, both portfolio assets and partnered assets, that we are looking at in combination with abemaciclib. So, we have a significant life cycle plan that we continue to add to that will read out over the coming years.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Thank you, Levi. Thanks, Sue. John, if we can go to the next caller?","Operator","We'll go to Tony Butler with Guggenheim Securities, please go ahead.","Tony Butler - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Thanks, thanks very much. Enrique, back to Humalog, if I may, you made a reference to volume being up, but I'm curious about the class as a whole, of rapid-acting insulins continuously down. Is that solely based on price? Or does that actually reflect some level of a decline in overall demand and what might those patients actually be moving toward or moving into as opposed to those rapid-acting agents? And then secondly very simply, Christi, when the resolution for baricitinib with the FDA, whatever it may be, another trial or some negotiation or patients who, you know, you look out in Europe and you're able to supply data to the FDA. The question really is, when you refile does the entire NDA clock restart at \u2013 the 12-month timeframe or is there some other fraction of that which we need to look forward to? Thank you.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Tony, thank you for the questions. So we'll go to Enrique for the Humalog class question for the rapid-acting insulin and then, Christi, do you want to comment or I can comment on the second question on the very (01:22:40) timeframe once we resubmit. Enrique?","Enrique A. Conterno - Eli Lilly & Co.","Yeah. The main impact here when we look at the meal-time insulin class is really related to pricing. Now we do have, when we look at the growth rates of that class, the growth rates have come down, the class is still growing but it's growing less than it was growing two, three years ago and clearly this is part of basically increased utilization of both SGLT-2s and GLP-1s.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Thank you, Enrique, and Tony, and your question, when we resubmit our anticipation would be that the FDA would need to declare that a type 1 or type 2 resubmission and you would have I believe something like a 3 or 6 month timeframe then for them to have a PDUFA date and provide their answer to the resubmission.","Tony Butler - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Thanks, Phil. Thank you, Enrique.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","John, if we could have the next caller, please?","Operator","We go to Alex Arfaei with BMO Capital Markets, please go ahead.","Alex Arfaei - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Good morning, folks, and thank you for taking the questions. A couple on Trulicity which had a great quarter. First, on the cardiovascular outcome study, the REWIND study expected next year, how confident are you in that study given that two out of the four CV outcome studies with GLP-1s have failed to show a benefit? Is there anything in the design or patient characteristics that would basically suggest that the probability of success was more than a coin toss? And then when can we expect the results from AWARD-10 evaluating Trulicity and Jardiance? It would seem like that's a promising combination. My understanding is that the study has completed. Just wondering when we can see the results. And then finally were there any notable inventory changes for Trulicity and Taltz this quarter? Thank you very much.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Alex, thank you for the questions. Actually, before we go on, just to clarify the last answer that I'd given. I think a type 1 is actually a two-month turnaround, not three months. And the type 2 is in fact six months.","Enrique, if we can go to you for the question on how we're viewing the chances for success of the REWIND trial for Trulicity and timing for AWARD-10 to read out. And then if you want to comment if there were any issues or changes in inventory levels for Trulicity, and, Christi, if you want to comment on Taltz. Enrique?","Enrique A. Conterno - Eli Lilly & Co.","Sure. So, it's really dangerous to speculate when it comes to how different trials are going to read out. We do have, I think, a very good experience when conducting cardiovascular trials in the diabetes space. I think Lilly probably has designed and conducted more trials than anybody else in this space, either by ourselves or with some of our partners. So, we feel confident that we've designed the trial in the right way, as we are awaiting on the results clearly. When you look at the different GLP-1s, I would say that not all GLP-1s are comparable, so we continue to like our chances.","When it comes to your question on inventory for Trulicity, nothing material when it comes to inventory. We had some favorability related to changes in the estimates for revision (01:26:00) and discounts may be in the neighborhood of about $15 million out of a $380 million base, in the case of U.S. revenue. And as far as AWARD-10, we should be disclosing that at an upcoming medical conference.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Great. Thank you, Enrique. Christi?","Christi Shaw - Eli Lilly & Co.","An easy answer for me, in regards to Taltz there. No \u2013 nothing unusual. We're really happy in fact to see that the volume and the demand is the reason for the uptake.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Great. John, we have time, I think, for one last question from the line.","Operator","And we'll go to David Risinger with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks very much. So, I wanted to just ask a high level update, please. And then a couple of minor quick questions.","So with respect to the outlook in Washington, it seems like the Trump administration and Congress are focused on matters other than drug pricing, but it would be great to hear your updated perspective and outlook on pharma's focus in Washington and any developments you think investors should be anticipating with respect to drug pricing in the second half of this year? And then in terms of my more minor questions, KEYNOTE-189 is listed as an internal readout on your slide but not external. Is that simply because Merck will issue the external press release? Or, do you not expect an external press release in the second half of this year? And then finally, Derica, on gross margin guidance that was reduced from 77% to 76%, can you just talk about the key franchises and specifically what drove that, whether it's mix or any other factors? Thank you.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Great, Dave. Thank you for the question. So, Dave Ricks, we'll go to you for the first question. Sue, for the KEYNOTE-189 timing question. And then Derica for gross margin percent. Dave?","David A. Ricks - Eli Lilly & Co.","Sure. Thanks, Dave. Probably, we spend a long time talking about what's happening in Washington but I'll try to be brief. Look, we've responded to the concerns as an industry and as a company, I think, pretty well, in terms of putting pro-actively aligned ideas from across the industry on the table that can leverage the power of the marketplace and competition to help consumers with their out-of-pocket costs. We talked about some of these through time, whether it be rebate pass-through and the donut hole, outcomes-based pricing, FDA speeding up the backlog of generic approvals and the like. So we put all that on the table. I think everybody, in any position of authority knows about the aligned pharma agenda. We do expect an executive order. They keep saying, soon. I would say in the second half you should expect that.","We hope that it includes many of the ideas we put forward. My personal view is that won't end the discussion about drug pricing. I think we saw even yesterday, Democrats put this as a prominent feature in their \"Better Way\" paper, and we have a number of budgetary votes coming up in the fall that may include pay-forwards that include the drug industry. So we need to be \u2013 continue to be on our game. I think we've got a good team at pharma now, I think Lilly's doing our part within that, and the industry's on top of its game here. But there is still quite a bit of risk in the environment. I wouldn't want anyone to think otherwise.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Thank you, Dave. Sue?","Susan Mahony - Eli Lilly & Co.","Yeah, with regards to KEYNOTE-189, remember this is outcomes-driven, so it will depend on outcomes, but our expectation is we could have a top line press release later this year, maybe early next year, with data being presented next year.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Great. Thank you, Sue. And Derica?","Derica W. Rice - Eli Lilly & Co.","Dave, it's solely attributable to the FX effect on inventories sold, and given the late movement that we've seen recently, this is what we anticipate. Underlying that, we continue to see very good operating performance of our manufacturing operations, and recall in the slide deck we provided you all and the supplemental in this call is slide 34, we always provide a look at our gross margin both with and without the FX effect.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Thanks, Derica. That puts us at the bottom of the hour. Dave, if you'd like to wrap up the call?","David A. Ricks - Eli Lilly & Co.","Yeah. Thanks, Phil. We appreciate your participation in today's call, and your interest in our company. Driven by the new pharmaceutical products through the first half of 2017, we're generating solid revenue growth, and we continue to improve our margins, leading to even faster income growth. We believe that Lilly's stock is a compelling investment given the diversity of our product portfolio and our top and bottom line growth prospects over the balance of the decade.","We hope that the update shared by Sue and Levi on our oncology R&D strategy provides you with greater clarity on how we intend to up our game in this really important therapy area, to deliver new medicines that can redefine expectations for cancer patients.","I look forward to your continued interactions, and keeping you informed of our progress.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Chairman, President and CEO, John Lechleiter. Please go ahead, sir.","John Lechleiter","Thank you, good morning, everyone. Thank you all for joining us to discuss Eli Lilly and Company's fourth quarter 2014 earnings. I'm John Lechleiter, Lilly's Chairman, President and CEO.","Joining me on today's call are Derica Rice, our Chief Financial Officer; Dr. Jan Lundberg, our President of Lilly Research Laboratories; Dr. Sue Mahony, President of Lilly Oncology; Enrique Conterno, President of Lilly Diabetes; Dave Ricks, President of Lilly Bio-Medicines; Chito Zulueta, President of Emerging Markets; Jeff Simmons, President of Elanco Animal Health; and Ilissa Rassner, Brad Robling and Phil Johnson of the Investor Relations team.","During this conference call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors, including those listed on Slide 3 and those outlined in our latest forms 10-K and 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","The information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It is not intended to be promotional and is not sufficient for prescribing decisions.","As usual, I'll begin by highlighting key events that have occurred since last quarter's call. Following FDA approval in September, we launched Trulicity in the U.S. during the fourth quarter. We also received regulatory approval for Trulicity in Europe.","We\u2019re in the process of launching in the U.K. and Germany and anticipate launches in additional EU countries over the course of this year and next.","In diabetes, we also resubmitted Humalog U-200 KwikPen in the U.S. and along with Boehringer Ingelheim we received approval in Japan for both Jardiance and our insulin glargine product.","In oncology, Cyramza was approved by the European commission for the treatment of advanced gastric cancer and by the FDA for two new indications second line non-small cell lung cancer and advanced gastric cancer in combination with paclitaxel.","Enabled by a fast track designation, we also completed the rolling FDA submission for necitumumab in first-line squamous non-small cell lung cancer. And we submitted necitumumab to European regulators for the same indication.","On the clinical front along with Incyte, we announced that baricitinib met the primary end point of improved ACR20 response compared to placebo in the Phase 3 RA-BEACON study in patients with moderately-to-severely active rheumatoid arthritis who previously failed one or more TNF inhibitors.","The study included a high percentage of patients who would also receive prior treatment with one or several non anti TNF biologic agents.","Along with AstraZeneca, we announced the initiation of the Phase 2\/3 AMARANTH study of AZD3293, an oral BACE inhibitor being studied for Alzheimer's disease.","Earlier this month, we presented Phase 3 data ASCO-GI from the RAISE trial evaluating Cyramza in combination with chemotherapy in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. In this trial, Ramucirumab prolonged both progression free and overall survival.","And we began the second Phase 3 trial abemaciclib in breast cancer as well as a Phase 3 trial in lung cancer.","On the business development front, we announced a pair of immuno-oncology collaborations. One with Bristol-Myers Squibb to study their PD-1 inhibitor, Opdivo with ","galunisertib, our TGF-beta kinase inhibitor, in a Phase 1\/2 study in patients with glioblastoma, hepatocellular and non-small cell lung cancers.","The other was Merck to study their PD-1 inhibitor Keytruda at a Phase 2 study with Alimta in non-squamous, non-small cell lung cancer and in Phase 1\/2 studies with Cyramza in gastric, bladder and non-small cell lung cancer, as well as with necitumumab in non-small cell long cancer.","We also announced a worldwide licensing collaboration with Adocia focused on developing an ultra-rapid insulin known as BioChaperone Lispro, for the treatment of type 1 and type 2 diabetes.","Lilly and Boehringer Ingelheim announced changes to our diabetes collaboration; the companies will continue co-promotion work in 17 countries, representing over 90% of the collaboration's anticipated market opportunity. While in the other countries, the companies will exclusively commercialize the molecules they brought to the collaboration. And finally on January 1st, we completed the acquisition of Novartis Animal Health.","In another news of note, we increased our quarterly dividend by 2% to $0.50 per share and we repurchased $300 million of stock in the fourth quarter of 2014 under our outstanding $5 billion share repurchase programs leaving $3.7 billion remaining. I would also highlight that the total cash distribution to shareholders in 2014 was nearly $3 billion.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Phil for a discussion of our financial performance in the quarter.","Phil Johnson","Thanks, John. And Tom with AT&T, if you could check, we should be the only line as open at this time, we're getting quite a bit of feedback if you could sure that other lines are close, we\u2019ll appreciate it. Thank you.","First, I'll review our GAAP results and then I'll discuss a few non-GAAP measures to provide some additional insights into the underlying trends in our business.","Keep in mind that our 2014 non-GAAP measures include the expense associated with amortization of intangibles. As discussed on our January 7th call, our 2015 guidance however excludes this expense.","When we report Q1 2015 actual results in April, we\u2019ll provide you with 2014 by quarter, restated for removal of amortization of intangibles, and if we had acquired Novartis Animal Health on January 1, 2014. As we report our results during 2015, this should provide a meaningful view of the trends in our business.","On Slide 8, you can see the revenue in Q4 was $5.1 billion. This represents a decrease of 12% compared to Q4 2013 driven by reduction of over $500 million in U.S. Cymbalta and of nearly 200 million in U.S. Evista.","Recall that we lost Evista facility for Cymbalta in December 2013 and Evista in March 2014. Excluding Cymbalta and Evista in the U.S., the rest of our worldwide revenue was essentially flat as underlying performance growth was offset by the stronger U.S. dollar.","Gross margin as a percent of revenue decreased 60 basis points, driven by the loss of U.S. exclusivity for Cymbalta and Evista partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange rates on international inventory sold.","This quarter foreign exchange rates on international inventory sold had a positive impact on our gross margin. However, in Q4 of 2013 there was a negative impact on our gross margin.","Excluding this FX effect from both 2013 and 2014, gross margin as a percent of revenue declined from 77.0% in Q4 2013 to 73.9% in Q4 2014.","As in past quarters, we've included a supplementary slide providing our gross margin percent for the last 10 quarters with and without this FX effect.","Non-GAAP measures are shown on Slide 9. Total operating expense, defined as the sum of R&D and SG&A declined by 13% or nearly $450 million compared to Q4 of 2013.","Marketing, selling and administrative expenses declined 8% while R&D declined 20%. The reduction in marketing, selling and administrative expenses was due primarily to reduction in sales and marketing activities for Cymbalta, as well as ongoing cost containment efforts and to lesser extent foreign exchange. The reduction in R&D expense was driven by lower late stage clinical development costs.","Other income and expense was income of $45 million in Q4 2014, compared to income of $9 million in the fourth quarter of 2013. This increase was due to larger gains on investments.","Our tax rate was 14%, a decrease of 6.5 percentage points compared to the same quarter last year. This decrease includes recognition in the fourth quarter of 2014 of the full year U.S. R&D tax credit.","At the bottom line, net income was flat while earnings per share increased 1% reflecting the benefit of share repurchases.","Turning to full year results shown on Slide 10, revenue decreased 15%. Now, to place this in perspective, this equates to year-on-year reduction in revenue of $3.5 billion. U.S., Cymbalta and Evista decline by a total of $4.1 billion while FX reduced revenue by over $350 million.","These reductions were partially offset by performance growth in the rest of our business of nearly $1 billion or over 5% primarily by insulins, our animal health business, Cialis, Alimta, Forteo, OUS Cymbalta, Trajenta and Cyramza.","Full year revenue totaled just over $19.6 billion or about 400 million less than the minimum we targeted starting back in 2009. Gross margin declined nearly four percentage points due to loss of U.S. exclusivity for Cymbalta and to a lesser extent Evista.","And to reductions and spend behind Cymbalta and Evista, lower late stage clinical development costs and significant ongoing productivity efforts total operating expenses decreased 11% or over $1.4 billion as R&D expenses declined nearly 800 million and SG&A expenses declined more than $600 million.","Finally looking at the bottom line, despite 400 million less topline revenue than we targeted, we nearly met our 3 million minimum net income goal posting non-GAAP net income of $2.988 billion and EPS of $2.78.","While not shown here, when we issued our 10-K you\u2019ll see that we also exceeded our goal of $4 billion in operating cash flow. Our full year result reflects successful execution of our strategy for managing one of the industry's most challenging series of patent expirations.","Driving growth in Japan, emerging markets and Elanco, and in brands not losing patent protection. Replenishing and advancing our pipeline and reducing our cost structure and increasing productivity across our business, to fund the R&D necessary to fuel our future growth.","Slide 11, provides a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS. Additional details about our reported earnings are available in today's earnings press release.","Let's take a look at the effective price rate and volume on revenue. On Slide 12, in the yellow box on the middle of the page, you can see the total revenue decline of 12% in Q4 2014 was driven by a negative volume impact of 9% and a negative foreign exchange impact of 4% partially offset by favorable price impact of 1%.","The negative foreign exchange impact is larger than we've seen in recent years and was driven by the strengthening of the US Dollar against many developed and emerging markets currencies. By geography, you will notice that U.S. revenue decreased 22% driven by volume.","This was due to loss of exclusivity for Cymbalta and Evista. Excluding Cymbalta and Evista, EUS pharma revenue increased 5%. I would note that this year, we extended our shipping to wholesalers until December 30, resulting in lower wholesale inventory build this year end.","In Australia, Canada, and Europe, or ACE, you will see a negative 7% rate impact drove the overall 4% decline in revenue. While on a constant currency or performance basis, ACE revenue increased 3%.","In Japan, pharma revenue decreased 10% driven by the weaker Yen. On a performance basis, our Japanese pharma revenue increased 2%. Growth this quarter was negatively affected by the timing of Cymbalta shipments to our marketing partner Shinogi, as well as by volatility we have seen in customer purchases over the course of 2014 due to increases in the consumption tax.","Turning to emerging markets, we saw mid-single-digit performance growth driven by volume growth of 7%. As a result of the significant negative effect of FX, our reported emerging markets revenue declined 3% versus last year.","Elanco Animal Health delivered revenue growth of 9%. Excluding FX, Elanco grew 12%. This performance growth was driven by OUS animal products, including the acquisition of Lohmann, as well as OUS companion animal products and US food animal products. This was partially offset by a continued decline in the US companion animal product sales, principally Comfortis.","Moving to Slide 13, you will see the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates on our 2014 results. For the four year 2014, FX had a modest negative effect at both the top and bottom line. For the quarter however, we saw a larger effect, and one that differed at the top and bottom lines.","As I mentioned earlier, FX was a topline headwind, reducing revenue in US Dollars by four percentage points. In terms of cost of good sold, FX provided a substantial benefit which led FX providing a modest tailwind benefit for operating income and EPS.","Excluding FX, you can see that our non-GAAP EPS in fourth quarter declined 4% while including FX, EPS grew 1%.","Now let me turn the call over to Derica.","Derica Rice","Thanks Phil.","Slide 14 shows our pipeline as of January 23. Changes since our last earnings call are highlighted, with green arrow showing progression and red arrow showing attrition.","You will see that necitumumab has moved into the regulatory review column, following submissions in the U.S. and Europe. And as John mentioned, Phase 2 testing began for AZD3293, the base inhibitor for Alzheimer's disease that we are developing with AstraZeneca. And in Phase 1, we initiate human testing of a small molecule base inhibitor for Alzheimer's disease.","We also began Phase 1 testing of two biologics, one for diabetic complications and one for hypoglycemia. And we terminated development of a Phase 1 biologic for anemia.","Next, let me provide a recap of how key event played out in 2014. I'll remind you of our key events for 2015 and quickly review our 2015 financial guidance.","Slide 15 is the slide we provided you in January of last year to track our progress against these milestones. As you can see from the preponderance of green check marks, we made significant advances in our pipeline in 2014.","These advances included major progress on eight new molecular entities. Approval and launch of three new products, Cyramza, Jardiance and Trulicity, approval of our insulin glargine product, submission of necitumumab, and positive Phase 3 trial readouts for Basal insulin peglispro for diabetes, Ixekizumab for psoriasis, and baricitinib for rheumatoid arthritis.","2014 was a very productive year for advancement of our pipeline and we expect 2015 to provide more of the same.","On Slide 16 list keep events to watch for in 2015. And we will update this list on each of our quarterly calls to help you monitor our progress.","Since I've discussed this with a detail on our January 7th call, I will not go through each item again today. However, it\u2019s clear from this list of key event that 2015 will be another important year for execution of our innovation based strategy and we are excited for what we believe the year may bring.","We know it's unreasonable to expect all of these potential events to be positive. However, we believe it\u2019s very possible that a significant majority will break our way and solidify our near to medium term growth prospects.","Turning to our 2015 guidance, we have updated the guidance we provided on January 7th to reflect current FX rates. That is the only item prompting these changes.","Now before I step through this specific line item changes, I would like to provide some high level thought on the impact to us both this year and moving forward. On our call in early January, we provided a full P&L impact of FX to our 2015 results. Now this included a topline revenue headwind of about 2.5% or $500 million and a bottom line EPS headwind of about $0.03.","At the current FX rate, the revenue headwind for 2015 will be more like 6% to 7% and the EPS headwind would be about $0.07 per share, not the $0.03 we shared earlier this month.","Now as we discussed before, the FX effect on international inventory sold that flows through cost of sales provides a short term offset to the underlying operational impact of FX. The $0.07 EPS headwind I mentioned is in fact comprise of an unfavorable operational FX effect of about $0.57 largely offset by favorable FX effect on international inventory sold of about $0.50.","Should FX rate remain stable, this cost of sales benefit would go away as we sell the existing inventory will likely be nil in 2016.","So we do experience the same, the exact same operational FX effect throughout our P&L as some of our peers and other U.S. multi nationals. Difference in some however, the FX effect on cost of sales means that the full effect of FX does not show up immediately in on our P&L. We will see part of it this year and the remainder next year.","Now turning to the individual line items, you can see on Slide 17, the FX has caused us to reduce revenue by $800 million, increase our gross margin percent by 1.5 percentage points, reduce marketing, selling and administrative expenses by about $200 million and reduce research and development expenses by $100 million.","As I mentioned earlier, if current FX rates hold for the full year, EPS would be reduced by about $0.04 per share from our prior assumptions and we have adjusted our outlook accordingly.","However, as our outlook still falls within our existing GAAP and non-GAAP EPS ranges, these ranges and guidance remain unchanged. Hopefully, this additional color is helpful as you think about how FX may affect our result.","Also keep in mind that our 2015 GAAP guidance does not include the $200 million payment that we will make to Pfizer if the FDA removes tanezumab from partial clinical hold, and we move forward with the Phase 3 development. And it is based on our current estimate for how we'll account for the Novartis Animal Health acquisition and which could change based upon revise estimates and final accounting treatment.","And as I mentioned earlier, 2015 guidance for non-GAAP measures excludes amortization of intangibles, as well as the other items listed on Slide 24.","In summary, we enter 2015 having successfully navigated through the most significant period of patent expiration in our history. Over the past five years, we delivered on our financial commitment, we advanced our pipeline and what we build what we believe is a sustainable R&D engine.","Again in 2014, we made excellent progress implementing our innovation based strategy. Not only did we advance our pipeline but we also significantly reduced costs and increased productivity. Throughout the balance of this decade, we aim to drive revenue growth and expand margins.","Bolstered by the recent acquisition of Novartis Animal Health, we have a solid base business and we intend to build on that base with a first wave of new product launches in diabetes, oncology and immunology followed by second wave of potential launches in cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer's disease, pain and oncology.","And as John mentioned on our 2015 guidance call, going forward you will see us sharpen our focus on areas where we are best positioned to compete and win. And continue to look for ways to increase productivity and do the work of pharmaceutical R&D better.","We enter this post-patent period in a position of strength and we are very optimistic about the opportunity before us to improve patient's lives and create value for shareholders. ","Now this concludes our prepared remarks. Now I will turn the call over to Phil to moderate the Q&A session.","Phil Johnson","Thanks Derica.","Given the 90 minutes we allot for the overall call, and the relatively brief prepared remarks, we do have quite a bit of time for Q&A but it would be great and appreciated if you limit your questions to two or three. If you have additional ones feel free to rejoin the queue later.","Tom if you could provide the instructions for the Q&A caller please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of David Risinger with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","David Risinger","Yes. Thanks very much. So, I have three questions. First, with respect to the sola extension study data readout ahead, could you just please characterize that? And discuss your level of enthusiasm for that data?","Second, with respect to tanezumab, you were expecting to restart Phase 3 this year. Should we expect a readout in 2016 or 2017 from that? And then finally, Derica, it would be great if you could just explain once again -- and I know you have before -- but why your FX tends to lag peers? And just in terms of the accounting, whether there is an international cost of goods accounting difference? That would be helpful in just putting it in perspective. Thank you.","Phil Johnson","Great Dave. Thank you for the questions. We'll have Dave Ricks, President of Lilly Bio-Medicines handle the first two on solanezumab and tanezumab and Derica obviously be FX question. Dave?","Dave Ricks","Hi, Dave. Thanks for the question. On the solanezumab extension just a remainder we have a 24-month period where we are measuring patient's who all rolled off expedition one and two into drug treatment at their choice of course.","In that data we do expect to come out in the near future because it's not published or announced I can't really elaborate on what's inside that but again we are looking for evidence of a disease modifying effect in that patients who were started on sola coming off placebo.","Don't catch up to those that had sola all along. And so with that sort of guidance of what we are looking for, we wait for the data to be published in the future.","On tanezumab we are hoping to have the class and tanezumab remove from clinical trial hold this year and initiate Phase 3 studies as Derica mentioned.","We have not posted those studies or their design yet, so it would be premature to comment on when they'd be completing read out but I would guide you to say it's probably beyond 16 Dave.","Derica Rice","And David, as regards to the FX effect on international inventory sold, recall that our inventory turns in Lilly is about 12 months. And so if you take back as we build the inventory during the period where the dollar was at a weaker level, or the euro and the yen was at a higher level, those inventories went on our balance sheet as we sell those inventories into the marketplace.","Those inventories get revalued at current exchange rate and that benefit or that differential flows through P&L at that point in time. So in the case scenario we're looking at today, where the dollars has been strengthening, it comes to us as a benefit.","You've seen in prior periods when the rate was going the other way when foreign currencies were strengthening against the US dollars and you were seeing a negative effect or an unfavorable effect flowing through our P&L through cost of goods sold.","Phil Johnson","Thanks Derica. Tom, next caller please.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Greg Gilbert with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Greg Gilbert","Thanks. Good morning. First, on Trulicity, you have been very bullish on the opportunity in the past, given the ideal mix of attributes. So I was hoping you could give us some early metrics on launch success, beyond the simple IMS-type of data we all see.","And then secondly, for John, what are senior management team's and your most important corporate objectives in 2015? Aside from the typical meeting or exceeding of the financial metrics you have provided? Thanks.","Phil Johnson","Thanks Greg. Enrique, for the first question please.","Enrique Conterno","On Trulicity, we have to keep in mind that in mid-November we launched this product in the U.S. to specialist, specialist roughly represent about 30% of the market opportunity.","We are in the process of launching as we speak in primary care right now, and as I have shared in the past, for us it is critical that we basically expand the GLP 1 market. We believe that Trulicity can be an important catalyst for the overall growth of the GLP 1 class.","So we basically have to wait for that. In terms of metric that we actually look at specific to our near, medium and long term objectives are looking at the breadth of prescribing when we look at Trulicity.","So we want to make sure that there is a strong breadth of prescribing in particular among primarily care customers.","John Lechleiter","Greg, hi, this is John. Thanks for your question. I think I would say three things in terms of what we\u2019ve thought the senior management team has talked about around the table.","Number one is to launch well - we\u2019ve launched three products last year Cyramza, Jardiance and Trulicity. We have within 12 month window an opportunity to launch others potential our insulin glargine product, necitumumab. We have other filings in the work. So this is \u2013 we're exercising that launch muscle now and I think that's something we\u2019re acutely focused on.","Secondly to renew our pipeline, we've paid particular attention to putting the company in the position where we do not have to go through the boom and bust cycle, that's characterize the last 10 years.","We're very focused on our Phase 1 molecule enteries on progression from Phase 2 to Phase 3 and ensuring that those molecules are high quality and substantially derisk by the time we get to Phase 3.","And finally I would say improving productivity. We work and operate a very competitive world. We're in growing but very competitive classes and I think learning to operate across our business and ways that respond to the increased demands of our customer and the competitive pressures is something that's on our desk everyday and we're driving with the new conviction.","Phil Johnson","Great. Thank you. Tom, next caller please.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Tim Anderson with Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Tim Anderson","Thank you. A few questions, please. You have several drugs for diabetes, either in the pipeline or that have recently been approved. This includes your new GLP 1, your insulin glargine, your novel basal, and empagliflozin, and then various iterations of those products. Of the four that I have just listed, which one product excites you the most, in terms of the future commercial potential, let's say, five years out?","And then a second question. I would love to hear how you think the commercial rollout of your version of insulin glargine will play out, both in Europe and the US? Ignoring any of the legal challenges that are being mounted against you. I know you can't really comment on price specifically, but can you confirm that, generally speaking, price is really the only selling point with a product like this? And therefore, you will likely price it at whatever it takes to compel payers and prescribers to get on board?","And then last, third question, is just on Alimta. You mentioned price erosion in the US. It's not clear to me what the driver of that erosion would be?","Phil Johnson","Tim thank you for the questions, Enrique can turn for the diabetes will have you handle the first two of the diabetes pipeline assets and insulin glargine and either Sue if you want to look at the U.S. performance and see what explanation you have for his question on Alimta U.S. piece. Enrique?","Enrique Conterno","Tim, I really believe that I can make a strong case for each one of these products that you have mentioned.","We just discussed Trulicity when Greg asked the question about, let's look at Jardiance for a second. We have the EMPA\/LINA fixed dose combination coming up. We have a cardiovascular study that we've going to reel out in the middle of the year. Those two are very significant events when we look at the brand.","I'll comment on insulin glargine in just a second and then of course we do believe that with our innovative basal insulin peglispro we've been able to show reductions in hemoglobin A1c versus the standard of care in basal insulin therapy which is something that has not been shown before.","So I can make very good case for each of these products. We have to basically launch this product and see how they are accepted by our customers.","When it comes to insulin glargine, I would say that it priced the only way to compete, I would say no. And I won\u2019t share how we intend to compete when it comes to our commercial rollout but clearly we do have a portfolio of diabetes solutions.","We know that diabetes price does play a role, we have the liver devices and we think that we will be able to offer our customers an important alternative when it comes to glargine, with our own insulin glargine product.","Derica Rice","And then Tim, on the Alimta U.S. question, we had a very similar very low single digit less price benefit in the quarter like we had in the prior quarters. On various quarters there will be adjustments made for the accruals for rebase and discounts.","There is variability and noise in those kinds of adjustments this particular quarter this happens to be negative adjustments relative to Q4 2013 but there's nothing unusual on the underlying trends that we're seeing what we would have in past quarters.","Phil Johnson","Tom, next caller please.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Mark Schoenebaum with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Salim Syed","This is Salim in for Mark. Thanks for all color. Three questions. One on your CETP. Can you just tell us exactly how we should expect disclosure this year? And if you can just confirm for us that it's just a futility analysis? So the trial cannot be stopped for efficacy?","And then just on diabetes, and with all the pricing pressure talks, can you remind us of the net price increases you have been taking? Maybe for 2014 and recently? And if you think that's sustainable going forward? And then on your GLP 1, Dulaglutide, is there -- is -- Novartis obviously made theirs -- at least are trying to develop their in Phase 3 for an oral. Their [sinagatide] [ph] is an oral sinagatide. Is there a reason why you would or should not do the same thing for Dulaglutide? Thanks.","Phil Johnson","Thank you for the questions. We\u2019ll have Dave Rick handle the first question on CETP inhibitor and then Enrique your diabetes question. Dave?","Dave Rick","Thanks for your question. On Evacetrapib I think we\u2019ve communicated in the past, we do have an event driven futility test which is in the near future, either be in Q1 or early Q2.","I want to play down expectations of any great news coming out of that because the futility hurdle is pretty low in that test. So we will be conducting this in a blinded fashion along with a normal periodic safety review. And this is really the last major set of reviews prior to conclusion of the study we hope in early 2016.","So when we have to something to say about that, we can elaborate further. Yes, we\u2019ve said in the past, that\u2019s not the kind of analysis, being a futility analysis, that would cause us if it is not met, in other words study continues any kind of press release. So we provide regular updates for example on next quarter's call if it's appropriate on the status of that particular analysis.","Enrique Conterno","I assume your questions on the least price increases and net prices refers to our insulin franchise. We have taken least price increases but we also have increased our rebates that we basically - in how we control with the pairs.","As we look at the results for Humalog in the U.S., where we basically saw a minus 2 comparing Q4 of 2014 versus Q4 of 2013. A couple of things that I would have you keep in mind yes of course we did have pressure from managed care contracts. But we had two special events in fact in those results.","We had wholesale buying patterns, nine points when it comes to Humalog or 9%. And then adjustments due to prior periods, primarily driven by greater utilization in Medicaid and Medicare about seven points.","So you can think of those anomalies for the quarter but clearly we do see a highly competitive market when it comes to diabetes.","On your question on GLP-1s, whether we are thinking about oral dulaglutide, I cannot comment on our specific class when it comes to GLP-1 but we have expressed that this is an area of interest to us.","Phil Johnson","Great. Thanks Enrique. Tom, next caller please.","Operator","Next question is from the line of Tony Butler with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.","Tony Butler","Good morning. Thank you very much for taking the questions. There are two. First is on Cyramza. I am curious if you might be able to provide some color of what you are hearing back in the field in gastric cancer. And second to that question is, have you launched in non-small cell lung, given the recent approval? And if you have, any comments back from the field on that launch would be helpful.","And then second, back to solanezumab and EXPEDITION 3, clinic trials [ph] states enrollment continues, and I am just curious on the rate of enrollment? Given, I think, the total number is 2,100 or so.","So the question is, is that rate going -- or occurring in a timely fashion to what you would have expected, given that you are looking for individuals who have a positive plaque in the brain? Thanks very much.","Phil Johnson","Thank you, Tony. So Sue Mahony, President of Lilly Oncoloy for the first question on Cyramza and then Dave again on solanezumab.","Sue Mahony","Regarding Cyramza in the U.S. we\u2019re hearing actually very good feedback on Cyramza in gastric cancer. Q4 sales of Cyramza was $34 million that really is on gastric cancer sales and given that we only had the combination approval towards the end of the year that really is mainly monotherapy.","Since these launched to combination study we\u2019re seeing additional use of Cyramza in second-line gastric cancer with paclitaxel.","We have NCCN category 1 status now both for the monotherapy and for the combination therapy in gastric cancer. And with regards to the lung indication, we had the privilege, at the end of the last year we literally just launched that, so it's way too early to give you impact on that. But as I mentioned, we're feeling very good about the gastric updates.","Dave Ricks","On sola, we remain very encouraged by the enrollment in Expedition-3. I really think Lilly has a best in the industry capability on conducting late phase Alzheimer's studies.","And as you pointed out we're through in significant complexity which is the requirement to prove positive amyloid to enter the study in a 100% of patients. But I\u2019m pleased to say I think our last update was we were two-thirds enrolled, we continue to progress to complete enrollment soon.","I can't say we will mostly likely beat the enrollment window we saw on Expedition 1 and 2 which was a similar number of patients as reminded that was 22 months. So we would expect the enrollment soon and then of course look for read out in 2016 as we've discussed previously.","Phil Johnson","Thanks Dave. Tom, next caller please.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of John Boris with SunTrust. Please go ahead.","John Boris","Thanks for taking the questions. First question just has to do with your operating margins. Obviously exiting the period of YZ, your operating margins are in the high teens. If you look across the businesses where you are having greatest amount of launches -- oncology, diabetes -- and you benchmark those businesses against your industry peers, the operating margins of some of those companies are in the high 30s. So when you think about operating margin expansion going forward, can you maybe help us understand or characterize how those businesses are potentially going to be contributing to that? And any color on the magnitude of expansion would be helpful.","Second question, on Alimta, Germany\/UK. Any update on the patent challenge that's going on there? And then lastly, just on the BioChaperone insulin lispro, if you can possibly characterize the profile of that product? What phase of development, and when you anticipate it might go into clinical? And how it might contrast with the insulin oligo that is being worked on by one of your peers? Thanks.","Phil Johnson","Thank you, John. So Derica obviously for your first question the operating margins and then Sue if you comment on the European patent litigation and then Enrique if you will take BioChaperone and Lispro and Jan if you can contribute if you like as well. Derica?","Derica Rice","As you know we stated that we expect to get our OpEx as combination of SG&A and R&D as a percent of sales back to that 50% of sales or less by 2018 on a full year basis.","While I'm not in a position here on the call to break out the operating margin by business unit, let me just share with you some color as to how we see ourselves improving our margin overtime and provide some examples.","So, one of things we\u2019ve talked about is we\u2019re launching in the area of oncology, obviously highly specialized, we believe we have the commercial footprint in place so even if Sue is launching new product and new indications, we believe we can accommodate that within our existing footprint.","Likewise the same is true in diabetes as well where while we may be tweaking around the edges there are not any wholesale changes in our commercial footprint and from a sales force standpoint clearly there is the variable marketing spend behind these brands.","And then if you look on the manufacturing side, we see ourselves opportunity as we continue to execute and complete the tactical agenda in our insulin business. And from a manufacturing standpoint which enables us to be able to produce the basal insulins that we\u2019re launching in the same facilities today, where we produced our existing insulins in terms of Humulin and Humalog.","So therefore we\u2019re getting a more throughput through the same existing manufacturing footprints which should bring down our per unit cost flowing through those facilities.","So these are some examples of how we believe we will be able to get increased leverage out of our existing infrastructure which will enable us to grow our OpEx at a slower rate and our cost base at our topline and giving us that positive leverage to return to the historical levels of profitability.","Sue Mahony","I actually don't have any update on the European patent situation, the two case is the German and the U.S. case as you know are both being appealed, the hearing for both of those is set for March. So we look to forward being able to provide data on that following those hearings.","John Lechleiter","It is requested the Germany and the U.K. case, not U.S. case in March.","Susan Mahony","Yeah, thank you.","Enrique Conterno","On BioChaperone, this product is already in the clinic. We do have some Phase 1 data and the reason we did a partnership is as we looked both our internal problems as well as what was out there, we felt this was the most compelling assets when we looked at the profile.","We are looking for something that is factor-on and factor-off with the benefit that could basically bring including lower rates of hypoglycemia and lower variability when it comes to overall blood glucose.","Phil Johnson","Thank you, Enrique. Tom, we can go to the next caller please.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Steve Scala with Cowen. Please go ahead.","Steve Scala","Thank you. I have three questions. First, on the evacetrapib interim look, on the Q3 call, I believe the Company said that there are efficacy features to the interim look. Can you give us examples of efficacy features? Are you just looking at HDL and LDL levels? Or are you also looking at trends and efficacy, or events?","Secondly, in the PD-1 arena, I am curious as to why Lilly selected the Bristol PD1 for one study, and the Merck PD-1 for three others? Do you see clinical differences in the PD-1's you seek to accentuate? Or was it for financial or competitive reasons?","And then lastly, a question for Jeff. There are many emerging modalities in Animal Health. We recently saw approval of the first monoclonal antibody for cancer. As a leader in Animal Health, what emerging modalities does Lilly Animal Health find most interesting? Thank you.","Phil Johnson","Thank you for the questions. Dave Evacetrapib please and then Sue for the PD-1 question on the Bristol and Merck collaborations. And then Jeff for the animal health question. Dave?","Dave Ricks","On Evacetrapib we do expect an event driven interim look soon this is for futility. As I said before the bar from an efficacy perspective is low really ruling out absolute futility and we will look at major cardiovascular events in that look.","But I think we've said before, don't expect a major press release on both sides of that of course if we stop to study for futility we would announce that.","Susan Mahony","With regards the trials I wouldn\u2019t lead anything into the number of charts that we got with each company. Basically the decision was made based on the interest of each company at that point in time. We foresee that we\u2019ll continue to have ongoing collaborations in the future with other companies. Again it will depend on our interest and their interest.","Jeff Simmons","Great question I think in Elanco we see a few very key spaces going forward in the medium and long term future. Continued animal disease continues to be a problem both at the respiratory and enteric levels, so that covers a couple key classes that we're worried about. So, Bovine respiratory disease continues to be a big challenge.","So that\u2019s one space. Second is mastitis continues to be one of the most unmet needs in dairy at this stage and we\u2019re expecting to make a nice innovation launch in that space in the U.S. this year.","And then I think the whole area of immune modulation turning the animals immune system and activating it against the disease, versus today when you look at current medications antibiotics et cetera, it's trying to introduce immune modulation.","And I think the last one in the pet space is renal failure. It's continuing to be major issue especially the fee line area. So those are some of the big spaces. Pain would be another one as well.","Phil Johnson","Great. Thanks Jeff. Tom, next caller please.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Seamus Fernandez with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.","Seamus Fernandez","Thanks very much for the questions. So a few here. First off, can you talk a little bit about the BioChaperone, and really what needs to be proven to advance this program into Phase 3?","The second question, can you also update us on what you are seeing globally in the premix market? How market share is evolving here? And what you seem from a demand perspective, for a once-daily premix product?","And then lastly, on the CETP inhibitor, have you evaluated the LDLC reduction using Merck's -- or Merck has published, which is this beta quantitation method. And if so, what did you see, in terms of the LDL reduction capabilities? And if you haven't done that, could you just give us what your estimate is of LDL reduction on top of statins, with the 130 milligram dose that's used in the Phase 3 outcome study? Thanks a lot.","Phil Johnson","Thanks Seamus. So Enrique again on BioChaperone, and as well as the premix question with regard what you\u2019re seeing for share market as well as just demand for once daily premix outside of the U.S. it sounds like. And then back to Dave on the CETP inhibitor. Enrique?","Enrique Conterno","I won't be able to - Seamus, unfortunately discuss the program that we have for BioChaperone. What you should expect is that we need to make sure that this product is going to be effective in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes and we intend to conduct the right clinical studies to ensure that we can have a thoughtful Phase 3 commercial decision.","As I mentioned, clearly we already have mealtime insulins in the market, so we need to show some benefits when it comes to differentiation vis-\u00e0-vis what\u2019s already marketed but won\u2019t be able to comment on that because we believe its important competitive information.","On the premix market, clearly the premix market has been in many areas of the world declining with exception of emerging markets where we see continued growth of this category.","When we look at the share performance Lilly has done fairly well. So we are gaining share in this market whether it\u2019s in U.S., whether it\u2019s Europe, Japan or emerging markets. And I'm not sure how to comment on whether once daily premix would be a strong benefit. We will have to see what the clinical data for that is.","If I'm speculating about what you're talking about, right, a premix needs to provide I believe noninferior control to whatever the standard treatment is when it comes to diabetes. And this particular premix that I think you are talking about, may -- did not meet the primarily endpoints when it comes to hemoglobin A1c control, vis-\u00e0-vis basal-bolus therapy. So clearly, all is going to depend on the actual clinical data.","Phil Johnson","Was there the CETP question?","David Ricks","Okay. Yeah, sure. Sorry. The gap there. I thought there was another question between it. Seamus thanks for the question on CTP. I think a couple points of clarification. All along we've been quoting LBO reduction numbers for our program using these so called direct measurement methods. I'm not actually familiar with the statement you made about Merck's method, but we use this direct method, which is the more accurate way and our numbers are made consistent throughout.","Perhaps with our program the confusion has been, we reformulated as we went to Phase 3. We had tested 100 and 500 in Phase 2. And the formulation of 130 that you mentioned is more bio-available than the 130 equivalents in the Phase 2 study, if that make sense.","So, we would expect the LDL reductions between the one and the 500 that were previously published. And that puts you somewhere in the 30s in terms of percentage reduction using the direct LDL measurement.","Phil Johnson","Great. Thanks Dave. Tom, next caller, please.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Jay Olson","Hi. It's Jay Olson in for Jami Rubin. Thank you for taking the question. Actually, just a couple questions on animal health. Can you please tell us what Elanco's EBIT margins were in 2014?","And then, when the Novartis Animal Health deal was announced, you guided to a dilutive impact on 2015 earnings, followed by accretion in 2016, with some cost synergies and mid 20% EBIT margins. Can you just update us on whether all of your targets are still on track?","And then finally, are you, now that the Novartis Animal Health deal is closed, are you comfortable with the size of Elanco? Or do you anticipate additional business development? And if so, would it be in the companion animal arena, or in livestock? Thank you.","Phil Johnson","Great, Jay. Thank you for the questions. Those were all for Jeff. Feel free, and then if you want a comment at all, Derica, on the accretion dilution as well.","Derica Rice","Sure. I'll take the first one. For 2014 it was around 24% was the EBIT margin. And then, in regards to, just to clarify, when we announced the deal we did say it would be dilutive in 2015. And we said that we expect by 2017 to return the combined entity to the historical levels of profitability, which was in the mid-20s in terms of margins.","Jay Olson","Right.","Jeff Simmons","Yeah. And just to build on that, I think when you look at the Novartis, we feel good. It's better than expected in a couple of areas. Again, we're just a few days in, but close timing was better than expected and also the required divestitures really only meaning to sell one brand in the U.S. and all the other areas where we're clear on. So, at this stage, we've only got limited detail on moving forward, being we're just a month in and we'll definitely give a better view more clear detail in Q2, Q3.","Phil Johnson","Great. Thanks Jeff.","Jay Olson","About business development?","Phil Johnson","About the business development and priorities.","Jeff Simmons","Yeah. We're going to continue from business development perspective. I mean, we feel very good about scale and share our voice being able to -- and Novartis we see as vehicles for the next year of growth. And they've increased our portfolio, our pipeline, and our share of voice. We're seeing that already in the early planning of both of these integrations which are working very well.","I think we're going to look now very much as we have in the past with other acquisitions is where the strategic areas of need are. So, vaccinations in that space, emerging markets in comp animals will continue to be targets and we'll probably be more regional than global in nature.","Phil Johnson","Great. Thanks Jeff. Tom, next caller please.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Wendy Lin","This is actually Wendy Lin on for Chris Schott today. I have two questions on Alzheimer's. It's on the N3PG path-specific antibody. Can you talk about the time lines and the next steps in here? And then on the base inhibitor, can you talk about your study design? How do you see that molecule comparing with Merck's? And when could you move it into Phase 3? Thank you.","Phil Johnson","Great. Thanks for the questions. Jan, if you'd like to lead off with commentary on the N3pG monoclonal antibody. And then, Dave, if you'd like to provide the thoughts on the base study design? Jan?","Jan Lundberg","Okay. So the N3pG antibody is a plaque-specific antibody. And it's in Phase 1 studies, although it's actually done in patients with mild cognitive impairment or mild or moderate Alzheimer's. The purpose of that study is actually to look at safety and have some pharmacodynamic markets, so effects primarily looking at imaging before and after treatment. And the planned completion of the trials are then second half this year.","John Lechleiter","Great. Thank you, Dave. As it relates to the base program in alliance with AstraZeneca we've announced to begun Phase 2\/3 program. So one feature of this is, it say Phase 2 program to confirm dose and safety which will then convert into a Phase 3 perhaps toward the end of this year, early next year depending on enrollment.","I think the two key things. We don't have any comparative data with Merck's base inhibitor. Two key things I mentioned in terms of the study itself and then one operationally. We will be positively screening for amyloid as with the sola EXPEDITION 3 study in this program as well. So the 100% of the patients in the study have confirmed Alzheimer's, and we know that\u2019s an issue from other experiences in this field.","And then, our study is a mild Alzheimer's disease study. And I believe Merck has a mild, moderate plus a prodromal, so different population mixes. We also have different endpoints we're looking at. We favor the activities daily living and cognitive ADAS-Cog measurement points; I mean Merck's looking at different points as well.","So there are differences. We'll have to see how it plays out. I would say operationally, for the previous comment on sola, we feel good about our team's ability to enroll patients in these types of studies. And, of course, there is a race to get a drug to patient suffering from the illness. So we're very focused on timelines and feel confident in our ability to execute.","Phil Johnson","Great. Thanks Dave. Tom, if we can go to the next caller, please.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question is from the line of Vamil Divan with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Ari Jahja","Good morning. This is Ari Jahja in for Vamil Divan. Thanks for taking my questions. I have three questions here. First, on gross margin guidance, can you please clarify to what extent the upward revision is impacted by inventory step-up and amortization related to the Novartis Animal Health deal?","Second on pharma net pricing. Can you share your thoughts on key headwinds and tailwinds in different regions? It is interesting that emerging markets is the only part delivering positive net effect last year. And then lastly, for Enrique, pertaining to the new insulin glargine product, can you talk about Lilly's preparedness ahead of the launch this year? Thank you.","Phil Johnson","Thanks Ari Jahja. And was your second question on animal health pricing or just pharma pricing? I'm sorry.","Ari Jahja","Pharma.","Phil Johnson","Okay. So Derica, do you want to comment on the gross margin piece to start with?","Derica Rice","Sure. In regards to the gross margin change in our guidance, it only relates to FX. So this is not driven by the step up of inventory for the Novartis Animal Health acquisition. In fact, that was included in our regional guidance that we shared on our January 7th call. So, the 78% gross margin projection today is solely due to the change in outlook in terms of the effect on inventories expected to be sold through the period.","Phil Johnson","Dave, you want to comment on other part?","David Ricks","Yeah. Let me maybe just jump in on the -- you're commenting on the 2014 effect of price rate and volumes are we show here in the U.S. being down one on the year perhaps that\u2019s a surprise. Remembering Japan had 2014 was the biannual price year, so we expected and planned for price pressure there. ACE, I think we are macroeconomic pressure in our business along with the plan for generic event of Cymbalta which lead into this year. The U.S. is down primarily driven to the AG offers generic business transactions we conducted on both Evista and Cymbalta which had an effect on our price per unit in a significant way during the year. So, I think that's more or less a one-time event for the U.S. market.","Phil Johnson","Great. And I apologize. I missed your last question.","Ari Jahja","Insulin glargine readiness.","Phil Johnson","Okay, Enrique great. Thank you. Got it.","Enrique Conterno","I'm not sure. What I can say other than we are ready. Clearly, we expect to launch in Europe this year post the expiration of the license patent.","Phil Johnson","Excellent. Thank you, Enrique. Tom, next caller please.","Operator","And we have a follow-up question from Seamus Fernandez with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.","Seamus Fernandez","Thanks a lot for the questions. So just two things. One -- I don't know if I missed the answer to this question -- but pricing on the animal health side of the business? What was the driver there? And is that something that -- where we could see that kind of pricing power going forward?","And then separately, as you look at the choice to enroll Amyvid-only patients, do you have internal data suggesting that the Amyvid staining, or the Amyvid biomarker-positive patient population in the EXPEDITION studies actually did have a wider magnitude of benefit? And suggesting that there could be greater power in EXPEDITION 3? Thanks.","Phil Johnson","Great. Thanks Seamus. So Jeff, for the animal health pricing question, and then back to Dave on solanezumab.","JeffSimmons","Yeah. So, on pricing and animal health, Seamus, a couple of comments. First of all, we have a very market-based pricing, especially on the food animal side. So as you\u2019ve see economics get better in the meat and milk's business and our return and our value preposition changes, we base a lot of our pricing model of on that. Second is we have taken a very global assessment of these markets and the value aspects of this, and have taken a global pricing approach that I think has also benefited.","And then, I think lastly on pricing its liking to our value base strategy. As you know, we bought an analytics company and we're offering a broader set of solutions. So those are the key things. I think we've got to continue to look as you go forward at the cyclical nature, especially of the food animal business and the competitive nature of the comp animal business. So I think the intension is can you get a 1% to 3% price is a question that's out there in the industry that's still isn't validated yet, but I think those are the factors to watch going forward.","Phil Johnson","Thanks Jeff. Dave?","David Ricks","Yeah. As it relates to the amyloid positivity I should be clear, we test the primary number of subjects select for PET scan, some do receive, see themselves as well, but confirming positive amyloid we think is key to development in Alzheimer's. And we believe that because we do have data in house that shows that patients who don't have amyloid do not respond to an anti-amyloid treatment. And we also know from larger scale population studies, they also don\u2019t progress at the same rate. So if they're in the placebo arm they're going to over-perform. So for all these reasons and just logic, we believe that's a critical element in Alzheimer's drug development.","Phil Johnson","Great. Thanks Dave. Tom, next caller please.","Operator","And we have a follow-up question from the line of Tim Anderson with Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Tim Anderson","Thank you. A couple questions. On your novel basal insulin, you continue to talk bullishly about it on your early January guidance call. And you said this remains a very important product for the Company. And that's just not congruent at all with how consensus views the drug. Consensus is very skeptical, recognizing that there might be some positive efficacy attributes. But there is also some unique and potentially worrisome toxicities, like fatty liver. And in a competitive category like insulin, it seems that unique side effects could basically take down the commercial prospects for the product. So I am hoping you can tell us what you think analysts are missing with this program.","And then the second question on -- a general question on base inhibitors. Are -- what are the theoretical safety issues to monitor with these compounds, given the magnitude to which they lower A-beta production? It seems like that's confounded by the fact that nobody really knows what the physiological role of A-beta is. So how do you know what to watch for? And has there been any signals, in any human studies, that you are aware of? Or animal studies?","Phil Johnson","Great. Thanks Tim. Enrique, if you'll handle the first question on the novel basal insulin peglispro, and then, Jan, if you'd like to hand the base question in terms of safety things looking out formally we've seen so far with molecules in humans. Enrique?","Enrique Conterno","Sure. So, on the efficacy side, I think what we basically have is five positive Phase 3 trials against Lantus. Now let's keep in mind that we have not disclosed what the level of improvement is, but statistically significant improvement in hemoglobin A1c in five trials is unprecedented and hemoglobin A1c reduction it is a -- has a tangible benefit when it comes to outcomes, in particular in terms of the development of macrovascular complications.","So we see this as extremely important. You spoke of some of the signals that we basically saw in our Phase 3 programs. At this stage though I think we have to wait for us to be able to disclose the beta at ADA for you to be able to see exactly what is the benefit risk profile of this product.","Phil Johnson","Thanks Enrique. Jan?","Jan Lundberg","Yes, if we look at beta-secretase or base inhibitors, the current base inhibitors in the clinic affects both the base one and the base two enzyme and clearly for the Alzheimer indication and the thinking is it's the base one enzyme that is then cleaning the APP precursor.","If we look at potential side effects, we experience then probably other companies as well off target effects with some initial base inhibitors, which we believe then underline some of the liver toxicity, which is not unheard of with small molecules.","The more specific toxicology observations that we see is actually a deep pigmentation in some animals and the potential explanation for that is probably a base two effect. So this is something that also needs to be monitored in the clinic.","Phil Johnson","Thank you, Jan. Tom, do we have any callers in queue?","Operator","And we have a follow-up question from the line of Steve Scala with Cowen. Please go ahead.","Steve Scala","Thank you. I have two questions. First, on your CGRP monoclonal antibody for migraine, looks spectacularly effective, but with significant safety concerns, including maybe cardiovascular, wound healing, intraocular pressure, maybe [teratogenicity] [ph]. What are next steps for this compound? And there are a number of similar compounds in development. Why is Lilly's best in class?","And then second question, on ixekizumab. Lilly has provided solid top line data in psoriasis. I know there are no head-to-head studies verses Novartis' secukinumab. But based on the full data, which you have and we don't, would you say ixekizumab is comparable to secukinumab? Does it have a chance to be better? Or is ixekizumab less robust than secukinumab?","Phil Johnson","Thank you, Steve. Jan, would you like to comment maybe on CGRP please and then\u2026","Jan Lundberg","Calcitonin gene related peptide or CGRP has been around for quite some time and has been and the mechanism has been studied both with small molecule oral agents as well and has more recently monoclonal antibodies.","And the studies with oral agents I think showed quite positive data in acute migraine treatment relief of symptoms, but due to probably off target liver talks these agents could not be used for more chronic treatment.","On the other hand, they were also tested in a variety of patients with other diseases and there were no real other side effects seen and this has been confirmed even more with the monoclonal antibodies, which have -- are very specific and we have not seen any side effects with these type of agents so far in our studies.","And currently we are then in migraine in Phase 2 preparing for Phase 3 with more safety and dose ranging studies and we're also studying these agents for osteoarthritis, but we are very bullish on this mechanism and realising it is a competitive area with several other players, but we're doing our utmost to execute the trials in a very rapid fashion.","Phil Johnson","Thank you, Jan. Dave?","Dave Ricks","As it relates to the IL-17s we're quite excited about this class. We think both psoriasis has a lot of room for growth and IL-17s present really a compelling difference as a Group versus available therapies, I think you have a strongly exhibited in the topline results we put out in September which demonstrated a very significant effect size improvement over etanercept, in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis, with ixekizumab.","We don't have class comparisons as you mentioned and Steve you will see our data come up pretty soon with a more full look at what we\u2019re looking at. But I'll just say qualitatively, we think we have the potential to have the best drug in the class because at maximum doses, we see extraordinary rates of PASI 100 clearance and I think our numbers are high.","So all the data is not out. We need to see Amgen's full data set but I think we feel good that we could have the most effective medicine in the class. And as we reported safety of ixekizumab in the moderate to severe patients with psoriasis was similar to that we saw with etanercept.","Phil Johnson","Great. Thanks Dave. Tom, one last poll if we have any additional callers.","Operator","There are no questions in the queue at this time, sir. Please continue.","Phil Johnson","Thank you very much. I'll go ahead and turn it over to John and then to wrap up the call. John?","John Lechleiter","Thank you, Phil. A brief wrap-up here. To all those on the call, we thank you for your continued interest in our company and for your support.","As we emerge from this journey that we have taken through years YZ, I'm extremely proud that we have executed on the strategy that we laid out for you and deliver on the commitments we shared five years ago.","On January 7th, we outlined our objectives for the balance of this decade. We intend to drive year-on-year revenue growth through the balance of this decade, spurred by new product launches from our pipeline.","Next, we aim to turn that revenue growth into even greater earnings growth by controlling costs and leveraging existing infrastructure.","At the same time we aim to maintain a sustainable flow of innovative medicines from our pipeline. And finally we will deploy capital to create value which includes returning excess cash to shareholders via both the dividend and share repurchases.","We remain convinced that our strategy is the right one for Lilly in order to create value for patients, physicians, payers and our shareholders. And our ability to execute so far gives us increasing confidence at our future prospects.","As always, we will keep you apprized of our progress.

Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session.","I will now turn the conference over to your host, Dave Ricks. Please go ahead, sir.","David A. Ricks - Eli Lilly & Co.","Thank you and good morning. Thanks for joining Eli Lilly & Company's fourth quarter 2016 earnings call. I'm Dave Ricks, Lilly's President and CEO. Joining me on today's call are Derica Rice, our Chief Financial Officer; Dr. Jan Lundberg, President of Lilly Research Labs; Enrique Conterno, President of Lilly Diabetes and Lilly U.S.; Dr. Sue Mahoney, President of Lilly Oncology; Chito Zulueta, President of International Business; Jeff Simmons, President of Elanco Animal Health; Dr. Tony Ware, who is the interim President of Lilly Bio-Medicines; and of course Kristina Wright, Chris Ogden, and Phil Johnson of the Investor Relations team.","During this call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors, including those listed on slide 3 and those outlined in our latest Forms 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC. The information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It's not intended to be promotional and it's not sufficient for prescribing decisions.","Before discussing key events for the quarter, I'll start with a summary of our progress since the Q3 earnings call using our strategic objectives framework. Starting with Grow Revenue, in Q4 we generated worldwide revenue growth of 7%, which was driven by 9% volume growth in our pharmaceutical business, led by her new products. Prices declined 1% in Q4.","On our strategic objective Expand Margins, total operating expenses as a percent of revenue declined over 400 basis points compared to Q4 of 2015, while our non-GAAP gross margin percent excluding the effect of FX on international inventory sold was essentially flat.","Under the heading of Sustaining the Flow of Innovation, here in the U.S. in our collaboration with BI, the FDA approved and we began promotion of a new CV [Cardiovascular] indication for Jardiance, and we launched our long-acting insulin Basaglar. And in Europe, the European Commission approved Lartruvo for soft tissue sarcoma.","Finally, on Deploy Capital to Create Value, we completed the acquisition of Boehringer Ingelheim's U.S. Animal Health Vaccine business. We announced an agreement to acquire CoLucid Pharmaceuticals, which will add a promising molecule for acute migraine for our late-stage pipeline. And we announced an increase of 2% in our quarterly dividend, and we repurchased $300 million of stock.","We expect to make continued progress in 2017, and we remain on track to achieve our midterm goals for each of our strategic objectives.","Now let's move on to slide 5 for a more detailed review of the key events that occurred since our last earnings call. New product launches continued. As I mentioned, in collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim, we received FDA approval of the new CV indication for Jardiance in December and launched in January, right after the mid-December launch of Basaglar. Our initial sales were largely due to stocking, but we are pleased with initial feedback from customers.","We also launched Lartruvo for advanced soft tissue sarcoma in both the U.S. and Europe, and the product is off to a strong start, while in Japan, we secured the price listing for Taltz in mid-November and launched the product for both psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. We are in the process of opening accounts and completing hospital formulary reviews. While it's very early, initial feedback and IMS data are positive.","In the Animal Health space, along with Aratana, we announced that Galliprant, a first-in-class product for dogs for the management of pain and inflammation associated with osteoarthritis, is now available to veterinarians here in the U.S.","On the regulatory front, we made significant progress. We received conditional marketing authorization from the European Commission for Lartruvo to treat adults with advanced soft tissue sarcoma. Also in Europe, we received a positive opinion recommending approval of baricitinib for the treatment of moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis. In collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim, we received multiple regulatory actions on the Jardiance family of products. A number of these actions were related to the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial.","The U.S. FDA approved of a new indication of Jardiance to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death in adults with Type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease. We were also pleased that the ADA [American Diabetes Association] issued updated diabetes treatment guidelines shortly after the FDA approval.","In Europe, the European Commission approved an update to the Jardiance label, including data on the reduction of the risk of CV death in patients with Type 2 diabetes and established CV disease. The U.S. FDA also approved updates to the labels of Synjardy, Synjardy XR, and Glyxambi to include data on the reduction of the risk of CV death in patients with Type 2 diabetes and established CV disease when treated with empagliflozin. Similarly, Europe's CHMP recommended an update to the Synjardy label to include data on the reduction of risk of CV death in patients with Type 2 diabetes and established CV disease when treated with empagliflozin.","Separate from actions related to EMPA-REG OUTCOME, the FDA approved Synjardy XR, a tablet containing empagliflozin and metformin extended release for the treatment of adults with Type 2 diabetes. The European Commission approved Glyxambi, a single pill combining Jardiance and Trajenta, for the treatment of adults with Type 2 diabetes. Finally, here in the U.S., the FDA extended the NDA review period for baricitinib, and we now expect regulatory action early in Q2.","Moving to slide 6, there was one significant data readout in Q4. We were disappointed to announce that the EXPEDITION3 trial of solanezumab in patients with mild dementia due to Alzheimer's disease did not meet its primary endpoint. Since the solanezumab update we provided on our guidance call, we made the decision to terminate the EXPEDITION-PRO study of solanezumab in prodromal Alzheimer's disease. After careful review of the data from the EXPEDITION3 study and given the overlap in patient populations between EXPEDITION3 and EXPEDITION-PRO, we did not find sufficient scientific evidence to support the hypothesis that solanezumab would demonstrate a meaningful benefit to patients with prodromal Alzheimer's disease. In addition, the decision has been made to continue two ongoing public-private partnership studies in earlier stages of AD, the A4 study in pre-clinical AD and the DIAN2 study in dominantly inherited AD.","In other news, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit upheld the District Court's decision that the Alimta vitamin regimen patent is valid and would be infringed by the generic challenger's proposed products. If the patent is ultimately upheld through all remaining challenges, including intellectual property review proceedings, Alimta would maintain U.S. exclusivity until May 2022.","We announced completion of the acquisition of BI Vetmedica, Inc's U.S. feline, canine, and rabies vaccine portfolio, which also brings a fully integrated manufacturing and R&D site and several pipeline assets. The acquisition diversifies Elanco's U.S. companion animal portfolio by adding vaccines for a range of common conditions.","We also announced an agreement to acquire CoLucid Pharmaceuticals for $960 million. When closed, this will add lasmiditan, a potential first-in-class non-vasoconstrictive migraine treatment to our pain management pipeline. We believe this potential treatment for acute migraine complements our growing pain portfolio, specifically galcanezumab, which is in development for migraine prevention.","Along with AstraZeneca, we announced a worldwide agreement to co-develop MEDI1814, an antibody selective for A-beta 42, which is currently in Phase 1 trials as a potential disease modifying treatment for Alzheimer's disease.","In oncology, we announced an expansion of our existing immuno-oncology collaboration with Merck to add a new study for our Lartruvo with Merck's Keytruda patients with previously treated advanced or metastatic soft tissue sarcoma.","We also announced a partnership with Express Scripts to allow people who use Lilly insulin, in particular those who have no insurance or those who are in the deductible phase of their high-deductible insurance plans, to purchase product at a 40% discount using mobile and web platforms hosted by Blink Health.","Finally, in December we announced a 2% dividend increase, bringing our quarterly dividend to $0.52 per share. And during the fourth quarter, we distributed over $500 million to shareholders via the dividend, and we paid $300 million for share repurchases.","Now I'll turn the call over to Phil for a discussion of our financial performance during the quarter.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Slide 7 summarizes our presentation of GAAP results and non-GAAP measures, while slide 8 provides a summary of our GAAP results. I'll focus my comments on our non-GAAP adjusted measures and provide insights into the underlying trends in our business, so please refer to today's earnings press release for a detailed description of the year-on-year changes in our fourth quarter and full year GAAP results.","Looking at the non-GAAP measures on slide 9, you'll see that Q4 2016 revenue increased 7% compared to Q4 2015, reaching $5.8 billion. Gross margin as a percent to revenue was essentially flat at 77.4%. the effect of foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold resulted in a benefit in both this year's and last year's quarter, with the benefit being slightly larger this year. Excluding this FX effect, our gross margin percent decreased by 20 basis points, going from 75.7% in last year's quarter to 75.5% this quarter.","Total operating expense was unchanged compared to Q4 of 2015. Each of the component parts of total operating expense, marketing, selling, and administrative expenses and R&D expense, was also unchanged.","In marketing, selling, and administrative expenses, higher spending to support new products offset lower spending from late life-cycle products. In R&D expense, recall that in Q4 2015 we had about $135 million in late-stage termination charges for basal insulin peglispro and evacetrapib, while in Q4 this year we had about $75 million in charges related to the EXPEDITION3 study. Excluding these charges, R&D expense grew 5% due to higher late-stage clinical development costs.","Other income and expense was income of $16 million this quarter compared to the $45 million reported last year.","Our tax rate was 17.9%, an increase of 4.4 percentage points compared with the same quarter last year. This increase was primarily due to the inclusion in Q4 of last year of the full year 2015 benefit for certain U.S. tax provisions, including the R&D tax credit. This was partially offset by a higher net discrete tax benefit in this year's Q4, which included a tax benefit of approximately $40 million related to the early adoption of the new accounting standard for stock-based compensation.","At the bottom line, net income and earnings per share both increased 22%. We achieved the significant earnings growth by delivering high single-digit volume-based revenue while keeping OpEx flat.","Slide 10 contains non-GAAP adjusted information for all of 2016, while slide 11 provides a reconciliation of reported and non-GAAP EPS. You'll find additional details on these adjustments on slides 25 and 26.","Now let's take a look at the effect of price, rate, and volume on revenue growth. On slide 12 in the gray highlighted row at the bottom of the table, you'll see the 7% revenue growth I mentioned earlier. The effect of foreign exchange on revenue growth was minimal this quarter, and our worldwide revenue growth on a performance basis also rounded to 7%, and was driven entirely by volume.","By geography, you'll notice that U.S. pharma revenue increased 16%, driven almost entirely by volume as well. Trulicity was the main driver of U.S. volume growth, with meaningful contributions also coming from Humalog, Taltz, and Jardiance.","As cited in our press release issued earlier this morning, we benefited this quarter from a $130 million favorable adjustment related to changes in estimates, rebates, and discounts primarily related to Humalog. From a growth rate perspective, this was partially offset by the gross-to-net benefit experienced in Q4 2015.","The decline in EuCan revenue of 9% was driven by the negative effect of price, and to a lesser extent unfavorable foreign exchange movements and lower volume. On a constant currency or performance basis, EuCan revenue decreased 7%. This decrease was driven primarily by lower volume and price for Cymbalta and Alimta, partially offset by the uptake of new products, including Trulicity, Cyramza, Basaglar, and Jardiance.","In Japan, pharma revenue increased 9% in total, driven by a 13% benefit from a stronger yen and to a lesser extent increased volume, partially offset by a 7% negative price effect from the latest biannual price cut. On a constant currency basis, Japan pharma revenue decreased 4%. This performance decline was attributable to the entry of generic olanzapine this past June. Excluding Zyprexa, Japan pharma revenue in Q4 grew 9% on a constant currency basis, led by Cyramza, with meaningful contributions from Cymbalta and Trulicity.","Turning to emerging markets, revenue this quarter was unchanged, as the negative effect of FX was offset by higher volume. On a performance basis, emerging markets revenue increased 3%, as growth in Cialis, Humalog, Trulicity, Cyramza, Trajenta, and Jardiance, partially offset by lower sales of Alimta and (15:48). Also, this quarter our pharma revenue in China decreased 4% due to FX, while revenue increased 1% on a constant currency basis.","Turning to Animal Health, this quarter worldwide revenue increased 3%, while excluding the effect of foreign exchange increased slightly higher at 4%, U.S. revenue growing 2% and OUS revenue growing 5%. The U.S. increase was driven by new companion animal product launches, while the OUS increase was primarily driven by higher food animal revenue. On slide 13, you'll find this same price, rate, and volume analysis, but for the full year.","As we've done in recent quarters, let's now take a look at the drivers of our worldwide volume growth on slide 14. As I mentioned earlier, excluding FX, our worldwide revenue grew 7% this quarter, driven by an 8% increase in volume. In total, our new products, Trulicity, Cyramza, Jardiance, Taltz, Basaglar, Lartruvo, and Portrazza, were again the engine of our worldwide volume growth. You can see that these products drove 8.9 percentage points of volume. Our meal-time insulins Humalog and Humulin in total contributed nearly 2 percentage points of volume growth, while our Animal Health products contributed 40 basis points to volume.","Due primarily to declines outside of the U.S. resulting from loss of exclusivity, Alimta trimmed 1.5% from volume growth, while loss of exclusivity for Zyprexa, Cymbalta, and Evista provided a drag of just over 2 percentage points.","Now let me turn the call over to Derica.","Derica W. Rice - Eli Lilly & Co.","Thanks, Phil. As in prior quarters, I'll start by sharing some color on our new product launches.","As you can see on the graph on slide 15, our new products generated over $700 million of revenue this quarter, led by Trulicity and Cyramza. This represents over 12% of our total worldwide revenue, up from 10% last quarter. And, as Phil mentioned earlier, these products drove 8.9 percentage points of our worldwide volume growth this quarter.","Trulicity performance continues to be strong. Here in the U.S., we're excited that our new-to-brand share with endocrinologists, which we view as a leading indicator, is now comparable to Victoza. In addition to our strong performance, we're also benefiting from growth of the class, with the U.S. GLP-1 market growing nearly 30%. As I mentioned last quarter, in many OUS markets we're seeing uptake comparable to that seen with the early uptake of Victoza.","Cyramza continues to grow globally, driven largely by Japan, where we're seeing early strong growth and early adoption in gastric cancer, and more recently have begun to see uptake in lung and colorectal cancer. OUS markets now account for nearly two-thirds of our worldwide Cyramza sales, and we look forward to continued growth in these markets. U.S. Cyramza sales declined this quarter.","Moving to Jardiance, we continue to see strong uptake, with our new-to-therapy share with endocrinologists at 35%, exceeding Invokana. As mentioned earlier, in December we received FDA approval of the CV indication, and the ADA also updated its diabetes treatment guidelines. As we stated in the past, we expect these two milestones to be catalysts for the growth of Jardiance and the SGLT-2 class.","We continued to see rapid uptake of Talts, which launched in the U.S. in April last year and has served as a catalyst for continued growth of the IL-17A class of psoriasis. We're pleased that our new-to-brand share of market with dermatologists, a proxy for use in psoriasis, already exceeds that of Enbrel and Cosentyx.","On Basaglar, we launched here in the U.S. in mid-December. The $16 million in U.S. sales we booked were largely due to initial stocking. Physician feedback has been positive so far, and we look forward to providing a more detailed update on our next earnings call.","In the fourth quarter, we also launched Lartruvo for soft tissue sarcoma, with product becoming available in the U.S. in late October. Our Q4 U.S. sales of $11 million were largely driven by demand. In Europe, Lartruvo was approved in mid-November, and we booked initial sales during December in Germany and Austria. Finally, we continued to see strong uptake of I-O agents in first-line squamous non-small-cell lung cancer affecting use of Portrazza.","Now moving to slide 16, you'll see that changes in foreign exchange rates had a minimal effect on our Q4 2016 results. Growth in non-GAAP EPS was 22% including the effect of FX and 19% in constant currency terms. For the full year, FX provided a slight drag on our financial results. Specifically, revenue grew 6% with FX and 7% in constant currency terms, while non-GAAP EPS grew 3% with FX and 7% in constant currency.","Moving on to our pipeline update, slide 17 shows our NME pipeline as of January 18. Over the past three months, most of the movement has been in Phase 1. You will see the Phase 3 attrition of solanezumab for mild Alzheimer's disease with the A4 study in pre-clinical AD now reflected as the lead indication for solanezumab. You'll also see a red symbol in Phase 1 reflecting our decision to stop development of A-beta Fab PEGs.","Several assets entered Phase 1, including the addition of the A-beta 1 to 42-specific antibodies from our expanded collaboration with AstraZeneca, and the entry of a BACE inhibitor for Alzheimer's disease, two diabetes molecules, and one molecule in both cancer and immunology.","One other update; you may have seen Adocia's press release last Friday announcing that we decided to return the ultra-rapid insulin we'd been developing together. We have an alternative ultra-rapid insulin in development that could begin Phase 3 testing before the end of 2017, consistent with the information on our 2017 key events slide.","In our NILEX pipeline on slide 18, you'll see two U.S. approvals in the Jardiance family, the CV indication for Jardiance as well as the once-daily combination of Jardiance and metformin. And as mentioned earlier, you'll see attrition of the solanezumab EXPEDITION-PRO study in patients with prodromal AD.","Turning to slide 19, let's recap the recent progress we've made on the key events we projected for 2016. Since our last call, we added checkmarks for the European approval of Lartruvo for soft tissue sarcoma and, in collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim, the U.S. approval of the CV indication for Jardiance, the European update of the Jardiance label to reflect the EMPA-REG OUTCOME data, and the European approval of Glyxambi for Type 2 diabetes. Finally, you'll see a checkmark to reflect the EXPEDITION3 readout.","Slide 20 shows potential key events for 2017. And even though we're only a few weeks into the year, we have had a number of our few key events occur already. Importantly, as Dave mentioned earlier, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit upheld the District Court ruling that the Alimta vitamin regimen patent is valid and would be infringed by the generic challenger's proposed product. And early this month we closed the acquisition of BI's U.S. feline, canine, and rabies vaccines portfolio.","You'll also see that we've added an entry for the CoLucid acquisition, which we hope to close this quarter, as well as an entry to reflect Merck's recent announcement that the U.S. FDA granted Priority Review with an action date in May for Merck's sBLA submission for Keytruda in combination with Alimta and carboplatin in first-line metastatic non-squamous non-small-cell lung cancer based on the KEYNOTE-021G data.","Turning to our 2017 financial guidance on slide 21, our expectations for 2017 are largely unchanged from when we originally issued our financial guidance in mid-December. You'll see that our non-GAAP line item guidance remains the same. We have adjusted our GAAP financial guidance, specifically the tax rate and EPS, primarily to reflect the estimated charge related to the pending acquisition of CoLucid Pharmaceuticals.","As usual, we've listed the FX rates assumed in our guidance for the euro, the Japanese yen, and the British pound. In aggregate, current spot rates are modestly worse. However, FX rates have not moved enough to cause us to change our 2017 guidance. We're just one month into the year, and we'll monitor rates going forward as well as underlying business trends to determine what changes, if any, are appropriate to our 2017 guidance when we provide our quarterly update.","Before we go to the Q&A session, let me briefly sum up. As we exit 2016, our growth prospects are coming into sharper focus. We have significant opportunities to drive growth over the balance of this decade from the product launches currently underway, with three more new product launches possible before the end of 2018. This should allow us to deliver innovation to patients that fundamentally changes expectations for the outcomes they can achieve and to deliver value to the healthcare system and to create value for our shareholders and other stakeholders.","Our management team will be focused on execution to realize the potential of these opportunities. We'll be focused on: launching new products with excellence; reloading our late-stage pipeline from inside and outside our walls with assets of equal or greater value than our graduating class; driving increased productivity across our enterprise to expand our operating margins and create investment capacity; and investing in the core drivers of our business, talent, scientific capability, and technology platforms, to ensure our future growth prospects.","While policy and environmental uncertainty are high, we see our innovation strategy to drive volume growth through new brands as both valuable and durable. In my 26 years with the company, I can't remember a more exciting time.","This concludes our prepared remarks. Now I'll turn the call over to Phil to moderate the Q&A session. Phil?","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Great. Thanks, Derica. We'd like to take as many callers as possible, so we do ask that you limit your questions to two or a single question with two parts. Thank you in advance for your collaboration with this request.","Kevin, can you please provide the instructions for the Q&A session? And we're ready for the first caller.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Okay, your first question is from the line of John Boris, SunTrust. Please go ahead.","John T. Boris - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thanks for taking the questions. So, Dave, a lot of fanfare this morning on CNBC regarding your meeting with Donald Trump. He obviously highlighted turning down regulation, improving the tax outlook, and also obviously a focus was on price. Does, after this meeting, President Trump understand the level of discount that's going on within DOD, VA, that Medicaid is getting products for free, Medicare Part D hasn't broken the budget? And what would happen under ACA if it goes away? The greater than $100 billion that the industry is contributing out of its SG&A line as a tax, would that go away?","And then the second question, you did put out a release early on reorganization, obviously cut one head to streamline decision-making, but there seemed to be a greater emphasis on China, especially in light of you having run the operations there. Will you be changing any of your reporting going forward?","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Dave, those are for you.","David A. Ricks - Eli Lilly & Co.","Sure, thank you, John. We had a good meeting with the President this morning. It was a broad-ranging discussion. We touched on several of the issues there. And your question in terms of innovation, the President was very interested in understanding how our business works and what the opportunities are to further grow the American innovative engine in the biopharmaceutical industry.","Of course, we talked about taxes and how that could be a positive catalyst for more investment and growth in the U.S. industry. We talked about regulation. I think he made some comments on camera about that. He's interested in finding ways to reduce and streamline regulation, both at the FDA side but also in healthcare markets that the government plays a role in. And then of course, we did speak about pricing. On that last point, I think we all understand the concern he's raising and of course others are that consumer out-of-pocket costs seem to be growing and growing faster than other payers in the system and how we can do a better job as an industry of getting discounts through to consumers, particularly those in high-deductible plans and government programs.","We did not get into elaborate policy detail in terms of the U.S. pricing environment. But I think there will be time for that later, and I left the meeting with some confidence that the people who we'll be working with closely as legislation moves forward have a good grasp of those facts.","Your second question was repeal of ACA and the taxes the industry pays. Of course, we haven't seen any specific legislation here. I think the industry said it was basically $100 billion over 10 years that would have been paid in to cover ACA. That's both in terms of the unspecified fee and other concessions in the original 2009 package. I'd be reluctant here to get into specifics on that because we haven't seen the specifics on the repeal or, for that matter, any pay-fors in the replace. But we're preparing for all those scenarios and working closely with policymakers as well as other parts of the industry on good policy that can promote consumer-driven choice and more broadly available medications in these uncovered populations or in the current ACA populations.","The final question I think was on the reorganization. And of course, we did announce the reorganization, which removed actually several senior management jobs really to flatten the organization and make sure our executives are as close to the markets that matter and the launches that matter as we go ahead. And that was a primary goal was really to emphasize the importance of these new product uptakes and having our business presidents squarely focused on those and making sure that there's a clear line of sight to the customer for them. We also want to improve our proximity to China, as you mentioned, particularly for drug development, where we can do more I think to speed up our innovation into that market, which has an undeniable long-term opportunity for the sector.","We also asked Enrique take on a broader scope of responsibilities, including payer and so forth, hosting responsibilities for the major markets. So that's already announced and rolling out and I think aligns clearly with our stated priorities.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Mark Schoenebaum, Evercore. Please go ahead.","Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI","Hey, guys. Thank you for taking the questions. And first, thanks to Phil and the whole organization for helping out my team while I was gone. I really appreciate that.","I'd like to ask one business question and one science question I suppose. The business question is Sanofi's biosimilar Humira, can you just give us an idea of your expectations for market entry, timing of market entry, and what your plans are to mitigate that? I thought that would be helpful as that gets a little closer.","And then number two, I noticed you said on the call that, I think if I heard you right, you're halting the prodromal trials on solanezumab. And that was interesting to me because I'd be curious. Given that you guys are one of the smarter Alzheimer's companies, I'd be curious to know what your current thoughts are on the A-beta hypothesis. Was the failure of solanezumab a failure of the molecule and\/or was it a failure of the A-beta hypothesis to be \u2013 is A-beta behind Alzheimer's? And with the halting of the prodromal trial, I assume no longer \u2013 you don't believe it was simply the patient population enrolled. Therefore, that leaves molecule-specific issues and the hypothesis in general. I'd love to hear you talk on that. Thank you so much.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Thanks for the question, Mark. Dave, if you'd like to, take the first one. And I did get some feedback that there might have been a little bit of echoing, so we'll mute here in the room as you provide your response. And then, Jan, if you'd like to lead off answering the second question, our view of the failure of solanezumab in the mild Alzheimer's population. And, Tony, feel free to complement his answer as well. Over to you, Dave.","David A. Ricks - Eli Lilly & Co.","I think the question related to biosimilar \u2013 I think Mark said Humira from Sanofi, but I'm not aware of a biosimilar Humira program at Sanofi, correct?","Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI","Humulin \u2013 Humalog.","David A. Ricks - Eli Lilly & Co.","Humalog, yes, okay.","Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI","Sorry, my bad.","David A. Ricks - Eli Lilly & Co.","So maybe Enrique can handle that one.","Enrique A. Conterno - Eli Lilly & Co.","So we of course are prepared for that event. We had in a certain way the fortune of launching a biosimilar glargine in Europe and now a follow-on insulin glargine in the U.S. So that's great preparation in itself because now we're going to be on the other side of that. And we are thinking how to best ensure that Humalog can continue to be an extremely strong franchise for Lilly. I won't discuss our specific plans, but I would say that we're very well prepared.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Great. Thanks, Enrique. Jan?","Jan M. Lundberg - Eli Lilly & Co.","The amyloid-beta hypothesis and the connection to Alzheimer's disease has strong evidence from genetics, where if you have too much amyloid in your brain, you get early Alzheimer's disease. And also the opposite, if you have less amyloid-beta production then by mutations in the APP in the BACE1 cleavage side, you also seem to be protected from dementia.","The key question is so how do you translate then these genetics into realities of pharmacological treatment in an aged patient? And here there are a variety of approaches that have been used. And it's also a key one here to think about if you have an antibody with access to brain, 0.1% through the blood\/brain barrier, how can you compare that result then to, for instance, an oral BACE inhibitor, which some of them go 100% into the brain and are I think more likely to have a marked effect than on the free amyloid beta?","And the second question is clearly then how early do you have to treat? And I think we should recognize that even if you have mild Alzheimer's disease, your brain has been accumulating amyloids for decades, and you almost have maximum amyloid in your brain already. So I think there could be two components here, like I say. If solanezumab really entered the brain enough to affect amyloid beta, I think our biomarkers like amyloid PET didn't really change very much by solanezumab, nor did the actually tau then changes, which are more related to neurodegeneration change. So from that standpoint, we didn't see any objective measures I think that we changed the amyloid content in the brain, nor then neurodegeneration.","Is this against or does this prove that the amyloid hypothesis is wrong? My view is it's too early to say. We need to wait for even more powerful agents. And the next in turn are the oral-based inhibitors, which are more likely I think to have an even stronger effect on the amyloid beta in the brain. And in addition then, we need to look at earlier stages of Alzheimer's.","Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI","Thank you.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Tony, anything to add?","Anthony Ware - Eli Lilly & Co.","Yes, Mark, I think our view on the prodromal trial is that when we saw the results of EXPEDITION3 in patients with mild Alzheimer's disease, which of course were disappointing, when we looked at the prodromal, the patients in prodromal, these are not as distinct clinical divisions as you might think. There's a great deal of overlap between these two populations. And we felt within any given visit, a patient could be on one side of that or the other. So we felt as if that hypothesis had been tested, that those patients were close enough that the prodromal trial would be unlikely to be successful. As you point out and as per Jan's remarks, there are three differences, three potential variables here. There's the clinical stage we just talked about. There's the overall a-beta hypothesis itself, and then there are molecule-specific aspects as well. So those are the three sliders on the equation that we need to try to figure out.","Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI","Thanks so much.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Kevin, if we can, go to the next caller, please.","Operator","Next is from the line of Tony Butler, Guggenheim. Please go ahead.","Charles Butler - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Yes, thanks very much, a single question though for Derica, and it relates to gross margins, Derica. Certainly as the seven newer products that you call out have made an increasing contribution, as you noted, 12% in the quarter to overall revenue, one might expect gross margins to be able to move higher. I guess I'd love for you to comment on the pushes and pulls there, and more importantly, how you think about that as that contribution exceeds 12% certainly for the calendar year, even beyond 2017. Thanks very much.","Derica W. Rice - Eli Lilly & Co.","Sure. The good news is there's no substitute for top line growth, and so having the 7% revenue growth or in the quarter the new products driving almost 9 percentage points of volume-driven growth is tremendous, and really the kudos go to the team in pulling that off. When you get to the gross margin percent, you did not see the improvement you may have been expecting. That's really driven more by mix. So in the quarter you did see, for example, on our insulin business, where you'll see as it gets more weight and we have negative pricing in that regime, that becomes a drag on our gross margin percent. And for now, insulin still is our largest product until the other new products catch up. So what you really saw in the quarter was more a mix effect.","Charles Butler - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Thank you, Derica.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Kevin, if we can, go to the next caller, please.","Operator","Okay, our next question is from the line of Chris Schott, JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Christopher Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great, thanks very much, just two questions here. Maybe first, can you talk about business development priorities? You recently announced an interesting but relatively small deal, but bigger picture, maybe a question for Dave. When you think about how Lilly has historically approached business development, should we think about a similar approach under your leadership, or are there any differences in how you're thinking about business development relative to your predecessor?","Second question was coming back to Alzheimer's and BACE. How are you thinking about your BACE program and your molecule relative to Merck's program? Are there any important similarities or differences we should keep in mind as we consider potential read across from the Merck Phase 3 data later this year? Thanks so much.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Questions, Dave, if you'll answer the question on BD priorities, feel free since you're obviously very well in this space to make an initial comment on the AstraZeneca BACE program we have, and the other BACEs that we're developing and relative to the Merck program, maybe, Jan or Tony, feel free to chime in as well. Dave?","David A. Ricks - Eli Lilly & Co.","Sure. Thanks, Chris. In terms of business development, I don't see a change in our general approach, which is what we've said for a while, which is we see value in deploying capital on business development where we can really complement our core therapeutic areas, where we're looking at acquisitions or licensing transactions that can bring products into the portfolio to drive growth for the future and to do that with a lot of discipline on value. And so that's what I think we've been saying for years.","I do think as we enter this phase coming up, where in our therapeutic areas there appear to be attractive alternatives for investment outside the company as well as inside, we've got a key period to make decisions on advancing assets into Phase 3 over the 1.5 years or so, as Derica mentioned. We need to look at both sources of innovation and we'll do that. The CoLucid transaction, which is one we just announced, I think is a good example of that. So I think the rate may be different based on our circumstance as we're growing the company and have perhaps more opportunities to move assets into Phase 2 and Phase 3, but the criteria really isn't different from how we've thought about this in the past.","On the Alzheimer's BACE inhibitors, I think we've talked about this for a while, but the Merck program has two distinct studies. The first one is a classic first-generation type design in the sense that they have a mixed, mild, and moderate population and no requirement to have amyloid present to be in the study. And we know from prior studies like this, whether it be Lilly or other sponsors, you can end up with 20% \u2013 30% of the patients who actually don't have Alzheimer's disease. In addition, for the reasons Jan mentioned earlier, later probably not better in terms of effect size.","So the Lilly program with AstraZeneca and the later Merck program have those features built in. We have two studies with AstraZeneca. So if Merck I think has a positive signal of any sort, I think we'd feel good about that in terms of BACE inhibitors as a target. If there's no signal, I think we'll have to do some thinking. That's how we're looking at that upcoming readout. Maybe Tony or Jan could add to that.","Anthony Ware - Eli Lilly & Co.","No, I don't have anything additional. I think you highlighted the differences between them. We have two studies. The lead study has both patients with MCI [Mild Cognitive Impairment] and prodromal and mild Alzheimer's disease, the earlier phases, in them. And then the second study that we entered Phase 3 on are patients with mild Alzheimer's disease. And in every case, we have verified the amyloid going forward. We have a single endpoint, which is a cognition endpoint, which also differs from the Merck program. They have more of a classic, as Dave says, dual or co-primary endpoint for the first study, and then they've announced that the primary is the CVR sum of boxes for the second study.","Jan M. Lundberg - Eli Lilly & Co.","And if I may add then, both the Merck and the AstraZeneca BACE are not selective for the BACE1 versus the BACE2 enzyme. And we have two other BACE compounds also in clinical development. And in Phase 2 we have our so-called BACE4 inhibitor, which is low-dose. It's highly potent, 100% brain penetration, which means that you have less peripheral overexposure in a way then to get the brain affect, and potentially functionally less active on BACE2. And we recently then also entered for the first time I think now a selective BACE1 inhibitor into clinical development, and that agent then avoids the impigmentation which you see then in experimental animals during tox studies.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Thanks, Jan. Kevin, if we can, go to the next call, please.","Operator","Next is from the line of Andrew Baum, Citi. Please go ahead","Andrew S. Baum - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","Hi, a couple of questions, please. Would you care to characterize the magnitude of the financial impact from potential dual-eligible reform or alternatively provide us the delta in percentage terms between net prices for Medicare and Medicaid?","And then second, you recently recruited Levi Garraway and Christi Shaw within R&D and SG&A respectively. Could you outline what their mandates are, particularly in relation to building your immuno-oncology franchise, which obviously is not where ideally you would like it? Many thanks.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Andrew, thank you for the questions. Dave, would you like to take that second one first? And then you do you want us to answer here in the room the question on the dual-eligibles?","David A. Ricks - Eli Lilly & Co.","Yes, that makes sense. Andrew, thanks for the question. We have brought in two senior executives recently. We're excited by both their willingness and excitement to join the company, but also what they can add probably in the very short term. Levi is joining Sue Mahony's team, really taking the role that Richard Gaynor had. So he's got all the clinical-phase oncology portfolio and obviously brings a great skill set to do that. I think in terms of immuno-oncology, he's got expertise in that field among other fields of oncology. And it's probably difficult to say too much about what we hope he'll do, but I think clearly it's a competitive field and having a new look at what we're doing, how we combine products, how we could potentially accelerate our efforts in certain areas is something that we're hoping Levi can help us with.","Christi is a commercial person. She started her career at Lilly, most recently ran Novartis's U.S. business. And she's coming into the job I was in, which is a go-to-market and drug development job at running Bio-Medicines. I think she's a strong diverse talent that I think is really an industry veteran who understands the U.S. market extremely well. And so when that opportunity came to pull her onto the team, we made that move, and I think it's going to be great to have her. She starts April 1, so you'll start to see her on the road there in Q2.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Great. Thank you, Dave. Derica?","Derica W. Rice - Eli Lilly & Co.","In regards to your question regarding the dual-eligibles, the best way that I could probably characterize that is that the impact of that would be on the order of magnitude on the industry of the Affordable Care Act is how you should be thinking about it.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","It's been a few years, Andrew, but probably four or so years ago, I think the Congressional Budget Office had estimated the cost of moving dual-eligible and low-income subsidy folks from the Medicare price into Medicaid, and they had estimated that at about $110 billion, $115 billion cost for the industry over a 10-year period, very similar to what the expected cost is of the ACA. We have not said if the bully (49:55) exposure to that kind of a proposal would be greater or lesser than what the ACA cost is, but we have said in the past that the ACA 2011 through 2015 was running on the order of magnitude of $500 million to $550 million a year on average as far as the cost to Lilly for greater rebates in pharma. I hope this gives you some order of magnitude.","Andrew S. Baum - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","Thank you.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Kevin, if we can, go to the next caller, please.","Operator","Yes, and that's Gregg Gilbert, Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks. First for Enrique, in the past, Enrique, you flagged the concern about SGLT-2 new patient starts slowing. What are your latest thoughts on that subject now that you have a label and the updated guidelines? Perhaps you could give some color beyond just scripts.","Then my second question is for Jeff. Can you give us some flavor around your outlook for the key parts of your business for 2017 and what some of the pros and cons were in the fourth quarter? Thanks.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","We'll go to Enrique, and then go to Jeff.","Enrique A. Conterno - Eli Lilly & Co.","Sure, so we are clearly very excited about the new label for Jardiance in the U.S. and the new treatment guidelines for diabetes published by the ADA. We've launched now this new indication in early January. And we are thinking, I'll be honest, pretty big about the opportunity that we have in front of us given the indication that we have.","Clearly for us to be successful, the class has to grow or more specifically Jardiance has to grow. And we think of that not just as we think about what is the Jardiance share in the SGLT-2 class, but what is the overall share that Jardiance could get when we think about people with Type 2 diabetes, and in particular in the segment where Jardiance is indicated for cardiovascular risk reduction, which is in people with Type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular diseases. You can imagine that is as much as 30% of people with Type 2 diabetes, so very, very significant opportunity.","It is too early to comment given that we have basically the first week of scripts, which is the first week that basically we launched the product. But I expect that we will see the uptick and we will see this in terms of new patient starts right away.","Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Jeff?","Jeffrey N. Simmons - Eli Lilly & Co.","Gregg, on the Animal Health business, as you know, in Q4 Elanco revenue increased 4%, so we saw the growth start to come back. This was driven by companion animal growth from new product launches primarily, and also I think some expanded partnerships and distributors around the globe as we continue to increase our footprint. Operating margins also I would state expanded to 24% in Q4. That's in comparison to 19% a year ago, so we continue to make progress on integrating our recent acquisitions, and we anticipate further improvement as we go into 2017.","So as you look at our strategic agenda, I think a few key things in 2017, first the completion of the BI acquisition that's integrated. We're taking orders. The teams have all been trained. We'll see 6% growth come from that in 2017. As Dave mentioned, we launched Galliprant in the U.S. in coordination with Aratana. This will expand our portfolio in companion animal therapeutics. We'll continue to see our base business expand through innovation, even on the food animal side, as well as just execution in bringing the value of the capabilities that we've gotten from the acquisitions through. And some of the external factors we see moderating and stabilizing as you look at Latin America and dairy.","So in summary, I would say our margin improvement will expand to that mid-20s, as we've mentioned, and look to see our growth will return to grow in our base business to the mid-single digits, mostly in the second half of the year, and then again have the BI acquisition growth come through as well.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Great. Thank you, Jeff. Kevin, if we could, go to the next caller, please.","Operator","The next questioner is David Risinger, Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open, sir.","David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great, thanks. Sorry, I had you on mute there. I have two questions. First, Dave, if you could, comment on how the meeting with President Trump concluded and next steps we should expect from the administration.","And then second, I was hoping a member of the team could comment on the abemaciclib Phase 3 readout timings ahead. Thank you.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Great, Dave, thank you for the questions. So, Dave Ricks, if you'll answer the first part of Dave Risinger's question, then absolutely we have Sue Mahony here, who can address your second question, Dave.","David A. Ricks - Eli Lilly & Co.","Thanks, Dave. As I said earlier, we had a positive and broad ranging discussion. And I was impressed with the President's appreciation for what our industry is, which is really a crown jewel of America enterprise in the sense that we invent things, we can change lives in terms of healthcare outcomes, but also we're a great employer and source of economic growth, jobs, and exports.","We touched on lots of things, tax, regulation, as well as the healthcare repeal\/replace discussion. So there's a number of follow-ups that were cited that will be happening through staff and on the Hill with key members of Congress. The specifics on timing and so forth I'm not at liberty to share here, but I was encouraged overall by the sense a) that there will be changes made, likely rapidly. Most of those will involve the legislative branch. And that there will be follow-up with the White House to make sure we're making progress as we go along. But there's not too many specifics I can share in terms of exact timing. Just overall, I think it was productive to engage the President, educational for both sides, and I think we can go forward and really look at enacting policies that can both help the industry but also healthcare in the United States.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Great. Sue?","Susan Mahony - Eli Lilly & Co.","So with regards to abemaciclib readouts, we're anticipating getting the MONARCH-2 data and having that read out this first half of year. With regards to \u2013 and that's the fulvestrant study. The MONARCH-3 Phase 3, we should have an interim the first half of this year. Our base plan, as we've said previously, is that we will continue through the final, which we could see the end of this year.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Thank you, Sue. Kevin, if we could, go to the next caller, please?","Operator","Our next caller, Jami Rubin, Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you, a question for you, Dave. Do you see the opportunity to improve the company's operating margin goals? I think that if memory serves me right, three, four years ago you really set out a goal to achieve SG&A and R&D at 50% or lower. Again, that was set up three, four years ago, maybe even longer. I'm just wondering if you see opportunities to either update that goal you set for 2018 or where you see it going.","And the reason I bring it up is yes, you had a real high-quality quarter this quarter, but you could have massively beat if expenses, came in line, even at the midpoint of your guidance. Both SG&A and R&D were at the very top of your guidance. And for the full year, your operating margins were 21.7%. I think that is the absolute bottom of the industry. So can you talk about with your \u2013 driven by your new pipeline, what the magnitude of potential improvement that you see for operating margins? Are there structural impediments such as mix effects that will keep margins below industry average? How should we think about it over the next three to five years? Thanks.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Okay, thanks, Jami. Over to you, Dave.","David A. Ricks - Eli Lilly & Co.","Sure. Thanks, Jami, great question and one we're spending a lot of time on as well. Of course right now, we're working against the prior goal you cited, which is to get our SG&A and R&D total operating expenses as a percent of sales to 50% or less in 2018. So that's the near-term goal we're very focused on. We've reiterated that again in December, and that's obviously an improvement over where we are today and what we're reporting for 2016.","I would highlight, although we're at the high end of the ranges in terms of our guidance for the quarter on expenses for R&D and SG&A, year over year good progress in Q4, and we did have some one-time items in Q4 which adversely affected that. That said, I think my overall perspective on this question is we have multiple ways to improve the operating margins of the company. And as we launch new brands and grow the top line, that's clearly one. I think if we can really repurpose investment behind those priorities and maintain a lower growth rate, in some cases much lower growth rate in the middle of the income statement, we can deliver tremendous leverage on the bottom line. You can see that in Q4, putting aside the Street estimates, what kind of leverage is available in the business. And we're aware of where we stand in the industry.","I think we're not a single-product company or close to it, like some of the comparables even approaching our size. So that breadth I think does have inefficiency built into it. It has other advantages. We run a global operation. We want to be a global company, not just a multi-market company. That has an implication. But by and large, I think your question is can we improve beyond what we set out in 2018. And I'm personally focused on delivering on the 2018 commitment, and then we'll likely set a goal beyond that for improved operating margins toward the balance of the decade.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Derica?","Derica W. Rice - Eli Lilly & Co.","Jami, this is Derica. Just to maybe add a little bit of color to Dave's comments, recall that the guidance that we provided said we get to 50% by 2018. We also on that same guidance, going back to last summer and our July earnings call, we said we would improve our gross margins between then and the end of this decade. And our starting point was around the mid-70s for gross margin. So that implies that at least at a minimum by 2018, our operating margins will be at least 25% or greater. So if OpEx is 50% of our revenue line, today our gross margin is around 75%, or said differently, our COS is around 25%, so if we get to 50%, we maintain or improve on the 25%. That implies that the floor and operating margin you should be looking at in 2018 is a minimum of 25%. And so to Dave's point is, that's what we said we will get to by 2018. We never said that we will end there, that that wasn't the end goal. That was the intermediate goal. And so there's still progress being made.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Thanks, Jami, for the question. Kevin, if you can go to the next caller, please?","Operator","That's Tim Anderson, Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Timothy Minton Anderson - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you, a couple of questions. One is a higher-level payer question. Do you think that the relationship between drug companies and PBMs will come under more government scrutiny as it relates to rebates? And kind of a thought exercise, from your perspective, would it be good or bad for drug companies to have that whole rebate process potentially go away?","Second question is on Alimta. You noted that that is the chemotherapy drug used in KEYNOTE-189. How does the trajectory of Alimta change from where it is today, if that trial is positive or if the Merck regimen gets early approval in May on the Phase 2 data they filed on? What does your 2017 guidance assume, and could there be upside in 2017 and also beyond 2017?","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Thank you for the questions. Dave, if you'd like to take the first question that we received on scrutiny of the relationship and the business relationships with PBMs and pharma companies. Then over to Sue on the question on Alimta in combination with Keytruda.","David A. Ricks - Eli Lilly & Co.","Sure. Thanks, Tim. I think a lot was written about that question. To be honest, we have good relationships with all the major PBMs. Of course, it's a business transaction and we're on opposite sides of the table. They do their job very well. They negotiate hard for rebates and discounts for their customers, most of which are large commercial plans or Part D. And we do our job, which is to sell the value and try to maintain formulary position. There are always tugs and pulls in that and products are listed and delisted, but overall I'd say we have a good relationship with the PBMs. Of course there's only one major pure-play PBM at this point. But Express Scripts and Lilly have a good relationship, and we announced this Blink Health partnership as an example of that, innovating together to try to solve some of the payment problems.","I think hypothetically, if we didn't have rebates, would I worry long term about our future? My answer is no. I think we're in the business of making innovative products that help patients. We need to do that in a way that creates value in the healthcare system. How we get paid for that value, there are probably lots of ways. As you know, in international markets many, many places where we have productive and profitable businesses, we don't have PBMs or anything like it and we don't have rebates, and we do just fine. So I think because of the breadth of our portfolio because of our new product mix, because of the company's focus on volume growth across several key markets, I think as Derica said in his comments, we have a durable strategy going forward should there be some big disruption, which I'm not sure I see right now. But I think on either side of that, our model would work well. Enrique can add anything to that and then maybe the Alimta question to Sue.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Enrique?","Enrique A. Conterno - Eli Lilly & Co.","No, nothing from my side.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Sue, on Alimta?","Susan Mahony - Eli Lilly & Co.","So, Tim, let me answer the Alimta question. Clearly we can't give guidance with regards to a product. That said, we are very pleased to see the data from KEYNOTE-021G and also the fact that the FDA have accepted it for filing, with a PDUFA date, as you know, in May. And we also are looking forward to the Phase 3 data, which again we should see that in September time.","I think with regards to what this means for Alimta, Alimta has been under pressure, particularly in the second-line setting with I-Os coming through in the first line setting very little at this point. This data is the first data that shows that adding an I-O agent to Alimta-carbo [carboplatin] combination shows not only a good overall response rate, which we think we saw a doubling response rate, PFS of about 13 months. But also although the survival data wasn't different between the two arms, we saw a pretty good survival both at the 12-month and the 24-month mark, which I think was 72% versus 75% of patients survived at that point.","So I think we're excited by the data, and it is the first chemo combo and I would say the only chemo combo with KEYTRUDA or any I-O agent. We await to see what the other data shows this year with the other trials that are ongoing and maybe next year too with the I-O\/I-O combos and the chemo combos. But clearly this, in my view, can do no harm to how people see Alimta. It is the standard of care in first-line setting, and we continue to see that this is additional data that adds to the multiple trials that we've seen with improved overall survival with Alimta.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Great, thank you, Sue. Kevin, we can go to the next caller.","Operator","And that's Steve Scala with Cowen. Please go ahead.","Steve Scala - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you. I have two questions. Can you provide any perspective on the reasons for the delay in the baricitinib PDUFA? So that's the first question.","And the second question is what should we conclude about Lilly's 2017 guidance in light of the fact that I believe Lilly has exceeded the top end of the initial EPS guidance range in each of the last six years? Thank you.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","All right. Steve, thank you for your questions. So we'll go to Tony Ware for the first question on the baricitinib NDA review here in the U.S., and then over to Derica for your second question on guidance. Tony?","Anthony Ware - Eli Lilly & Co.","Thanks, Steve. In any regulatory review, the FDA submits various information requests, and then we respond to those as well as we can. The FDA makes a determination once it receives any of these information requests as to whether additional analyses that we have provided, and that's what they are is new analyses of the data that they already have, are sufficiently complicated so that it would extend the time that they would require to review the application. And that determination is made entirely by them, and we don't have much insight into the rationale for that. I want to point out that they did not ask us to do more studies, which is an important point. So that's about really all I can say definitively.","I would point out, of course, that this application in the wide world of applications that we send to them, it would be on the more complex side. It's five Phase 3 studies. There are different endpoints, different patient populations, different comparators, and different doses in some cases about that. So the fact that it would take them a little longer to take a look at this medicine than some of the other applications I think shouldn't be too surprising. But I'm optimistic that we will get to a good place with the FDA and that we will be able to meet the new data in April.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Great. Thank you, Tony. Derica?","Derica W. Rice - Eli Lilly & Co.","Regarding your question pertaining to guidance, having been in this job for a while, it's been a wonderful ride. If you look at the last few years, we have exceeded our guidance in some of those years. However, in 2016 we actually came in on the lower end of our guidance, if you think about the range that we provided. So it's not only always true that we've exceeded. But when I think about 2016 performance, what we really are encouraged by and I am is the way we ended the year with very strong revenue performance. We're driving 8 or almost 9 full percentage points of growth from our new product launches. It's very much living up to the expectation that we had set when we provided our outlook for the YZ period. And having achieved that, then it does give us opportunities, as Jami was saying in her earlier question, to work on the middle of the income statement to improve our margins.","And so given the way that we finished the year, I'm highly encouraged about our prospects for 2017. I think our guidance is very reasonable. I think our ability to achieve the range of $4.05 to $4.15 in EPS is very much within our grasp. And it implies that we're going to take those top line trends and we're going to translate that into about 300 basis points of OpEx through sales growth and achievement (1:10:41). So that's what we're going to be focused on. And I think Dave summed it up well when we were all out at the JPMorgan Conference together, launch with excellence, improve our margins through productivity, and you'll continue to hear us talking about in 2017 as well as to how we're advancing our pipeline. And so that is something I want to make sure we don't lose sight of because that's what long term continues to make this engine grow.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Thanks, Derica. Kevin, next caller, please?","Operator","Next is Seamus Fernandez, Leerink. Please go ahead.","Seamus Fernandez - Leerink Partners LLC","Great, thanks for the questions, so just a couple here. For Enrique, can you talk a little bit about the opportunity to continue to expand your margins within the diabetes business, particularly in the wake of or in the midst of the arms race pullback that you're seeing from competitors with regard to the field force? I think on your update conference call on the promotional efficiency of the business, you stated that no additional sales reps had been added despite the significant increase in the number of products in the portfolio. So just wondering if you see more opportunity as you continue to grow that business for additional leverage.","The second question is more broadly for Dave and maybe to some degree Enrique, given your new role. Can you guys talk a little bit about the willingness to utilize your relationships with managed care, particularly in areas like IL-17 and with the Taltz portfolio? Is now the right time to start to work those relationships or accelerate them? And do you see similar opportunities for those types of interactions on the oncology side of the business?","And then just one final question, Dave, can you just give us a general sense of how you're thinking about business development on a go-forward basis? Do you see it more as partnerships, or do you see it more as outright acquisitions? I ask that question more in the wake of the decision to walk away from the partnership with Adocia, which again certainly was a surprise to that company who was a partner. And we've seen some questions raised with regard to how the partnerships have been executed in the past. So it would be nice to know how you guys are thinking about the business development strategy going forward. Thanks.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","So I'm not sure we understood exactly, Seamus, the middle question you had about leveraging the relationships with payers on Taltz or oncology. Can you be a little more specific on what you're looking for there?","Seamus Fernandez - Leerink Partners LLC","Just a willingness whether you'd be willing to go to exclusive formulary access or utilize more aggressive discounting despite what are areas of strong potential growth for the industry and for the company in order to participate in that growth earlier?","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Okay, thank you for that clarification. Enrique will lead off with the ability expand margins in diabetes. Dave, then if you'd like to comment on the second question on leveraging the relationship and how that might evolve with the payer group and your BD priorities, then we'll come back into the room so if there's anything you want to add to that middle question on the oncology front, please do so. Enrique?","Enrique A. Conterno - Eli Lilly & Co.","Sure. So we are indeed seeing very significant opportunity to continue to leverage the income statement when it comes to diabetes. We have very strong sales growth, which is driven by volume. As we have mentioned in the past, we're getting some of the benefits from our technical agenda when it comes to diabetes on the manufacturing side. And as we've said, that is for us several percentage points worth of benefit that we're getting, and those benefits continue to accrue and gross margins continue to improve. And finally, when it comes to SG&A, we are basically able to with the commercial footprint that we have support the broad range of products, including all of the products that we have recently launched.","So we do believe we have the right infrastructure to support continued growth without us having to add additional commercial infrastructure. When we look at the number of people out there, we are a little bit below some of our competitors when it comes to diabetes, even post some of the reductions that we've seen from them. But at the end of the day, we have to do what works for us. And I think the numbers speak by themselves, not only very good revenue growth but we are basically gaining share across all of our products in all of the key geographies. So it is a pretty good run that we're having right now.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Great, thank you, Enrique. Dave?","David A. Ricks - Eli Lilly & Co.","Hi, Seamus. First of all, in terms of specialty markets and leveraging our U.S. managed care presence, we have a great team. We've got strong relationships, not just with PBMs but with other managed care entities. And I think as a broad-based pharmaceutical company, it's an advantage when we're entering new spaces because we already have that payer connection both for immunology and oral oncology that that base will serve us well. You can add abema [abemaciclib] should we have positive data and be able to submit, but I think it's a strength of the company.","Maybe what you're really asking is will we leverage the portfolio to drive more exclusive formulary coverage? I would just say in general, that's not our aim. I think we want to compete with as much open access as possible in as many classes as we can because, as someone launching new products, that's a policy position that makes sense for us. Of course, we have incumbent products too. But all things equal, we would prefer patients have access to as many brands as possible, and we compete based on the differentiation of our products. That's more or less what we try to do across the whole of the portfolio.","On BD, I'm not exactly sure what you're getting at there. As I said earlier, it will be an important part of what we need to do going ahead to build out the portfolio and keep upgrading value within the portfolio, whether it be through licensing or M&A. We have a number of very successful licensing arrangements ongoing and in the past. To name a few, of course, the Boehringer Ingelheim arrangement, Pfizer on tanezumab, AstraZeneca on BACE, even the partnering we've done with major oncology firms in terms of combination development with some of our assets I think are all examples of Lilly's open for business on partnerships. There are some specifics around ultra-rapid insulin which I won't go into to here, but I think all partnerships require a shared sense of what the future needs to look like as well as a compelling profile of a product. And when we have those things, we've done very well. If you have information to the contrary, I'd love to hear from you about it. But partnering will be a key part of what we do along with that smaller M&A space, as I discussed, and I think it's a strength of the company.","Seamus Fernandez - Leerink Partners LLC","Thank you.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Comments on oncology?","Susan Mahony - Eli Lilly & Co.","No, I would just say the same as what Dave said. We will compete based on the differentiation of the product. Clearly, what the data tells us will help us to better understand what levers we pull across the whole of the marketing mix.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Thank you, Sue. Kevin, next caller, please.","Operator","Next is Marc Goodman, UBS. Please go ahead.","Marc Goodman - UBS Securities LLC","Hi. First question is you had mentioned that there was $130 million adjustment, mostly Humalog. Can you tell us what was the actual number for Humalog, and what were the other products that were impacted?","And then second, help us understand just the way that the revenues \u2013 I understand the partnership with BI, but Jardiance and Trajenta. And I'm just looking at the way that the U.S. numbers have progressed throughout the year, and they seem to be bouncing around. Just give us a sense here. In the fourth quarter versus the third quarter, was there anything unusual going on? Was there any stocking? Jardiance really ramped up a lot. You see Trajenta coming down a lot, probably much more than what trends would tell you on script trends. So maybe you can just help us understand some of the dynamics there. Thanks.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Thank you for the questions, Marc. We'll go to Derica for your first question, and over to Enrique. Derica?","Derica W. Rice - Eli Lilly & Co.","Hi, Marc. You're correct. We did have a $130 million gross net benefit in the fourth quarter. What we've said is that a good portion, a sizable portion of that is attributable to Humalog. But we have not provided the absolute numbers behind it or any of the other products affected.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Enrique?","Enrique A. Conterno - Eli Lilly & Co.","When it comes to Jardiance and Trajenta revenue in the U.S., we do see numbers in the diabetes category move a bit based on the estimates for rebates and discounts. This is not just an item for Lilly. It's an item for any company in the diabetes space given the sizable rebates that are paid to payers. In this particular case, it is Boehringer Ingelheim that basically does the contracting and the estimation.","In the case of Jardiance, we saw a slight benefit in the fourth quarter. And in the case of Trajenta, we basically saw a negative impact in the fourth quarter, the negative impact probably closer in terms of Lilly revenue nearly probably $20 million. So we expect to see that volatility when it comes to the diabetes product. What we try to look at is really longer term what are some of the trends that we basically see from a volume perspective and also from a pricing perspective.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Great, thank you. Kevin, if we can, go to the next caller.","Operator","Next is Geoff Meacham, Barclays. Please go ahead.","Geoffrey Christopher Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for the question, for Dave, another policy question. Was there any discussion today in your meeting with President Trump on the role of PBMs and the role they play in the pricing equation? Do you feel like this could be a bigger part of the drug pricing conversation going forward?","And on then on the galcanezumab Phase 3, some data from your competitors, namely Amgen, when you look at that, what would you think is the line for a clinically meaningful benefit?","And then finally, with the CoLucid deal, you'll have a range of products. What do you think in this space more broadly is still fertile ground for innovation? Thank you.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Great, Geoff, thank you for the questions. Dave, obviously the first one we'll pass over to you, and feel free if you want to comment on either of the following two. And then both Tony probably and Jan maybe will add some color here in the room as well. Dave?","David A. Ricks - Eli Lilly & Co.","Thanks, Geoff. In terms of PBM specifically, that wasn't a centerpiece of the discussion with the President. Of course, pharma has recently put out some work just to put some facts into the picture in terms of what the total drug spend is in the nation and how much of that is innovative, generic, or going into the channel, if you will. I think it's available on their website if you want to look at it. That was referenced in the meeting, and I think it always does surprise people that fully one-third of spending in the U.S. is not going to manufacturers but going to other entities. I think the President was interested in that.","Mostly we discussed how to get value to consumers who particularly in the ACA plans or in high-deductible plans have limited formularies. They think they bought insurance and they have limited coverage or are paying a lot of out-of-pocket costs, and how to address that situation. And so PBMs themselves weren't mentioned specifically, and we did discuss channel partners broadly, but more as an educational point.","In terms of CoLucid, I'll start there. Obviously, that fits in well with our existing interest in pain and migraine specifically. It is abortive treatment, so people take that when they're experiencing or about to experience a headache. I think it has the key benefits of potentially being labeled for use in patients who have cardiovascular risk factors, which is a major issue with triptans, the major class in that setting, and will fit hand-in-glove with our promotional, commercial, and medical efforts, even future clinical efforts with our potential antibody galcanezumab, for preventing migraine. I guess the question on effect size, I can defer to Tony on that in terms of what we hope to see vis-\u00e0-vis Amgen.","Anthony Ware - Eli Lilly & Co.","Hi. Regarding the CoLucid or lasmiditan, we're encouraged by this as a novel mechanism. There hasn't been a new mechanism to really stop a migraine that's ongoing for many years now. Nearly 7 million people in the United States take a prescription medicine for that, and a lot of them don't get better. And as Dave points out, a lot of them could potentially benefit if they didn't have cardiovascular disease. In fact, there was a recent survey by the American Neurological Association that said 22% of the patients currently taking triptans actually have what would be considered a cardiovascular contra-indication. And I'm sure these aren't bad doctors. I'm sure it's patients that really are so desperate they're willing to take the chance. So we think that there's a lot of room for innovation for that. And of course with the novel mechanism, the Phase 3 study that was carried out by CoLucid showed that many of those patients had already had a poor response to triptan, but nonetheless responded well when they received lasmiditan. So we're encouraged, and we think that this is a significant innovation for this.","For galcanezumab, if we look at our data for Phase 2, we're encouraged by the data that we've seen, and we hope to see the same thing for Phase 3. And there we saw 70% of the patients had at least a 50% reduction in migraine days. We had nearly a third of patient had no migraine days whatsoever. And these are patients, of course, that have in some cases dozens of migraines a month. This is a big difference in terms of whether people can go to work or can take care of their kids and a lot of meaningful benefits for this. So if we end up in the range that we saw in Phase 2, we'll be very pleased.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Great. Thank you, Tony. Kevin, we'll take one last caller before having Dave wrap up the call today.","Operator","That's from Richard Purkiss, Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Richard J. Purkiss - Piper Jaffray Ltd.","Thanks for taking the question. Just given Trulicity's really strong performance, could Enrique and maybe Jan just run through thoughts on how they see the upcoming competition from Novo's semaglutide, also how they view its retinopathy data and just hopes for the REWIND study?","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Richard, thank you for the questions. Enrique, if you want to lead off and Jan can...","Enrique A. Conterno - Eli Lilly & Co.","Sure. So we are very excited about the growth of Trulicity. We're having great sequential growth, both driven by the overall strength and the health of the GLP-1 class, but also because of the share growth with Trulicity. I was just reviewing our latest data, and Trulicity now nearly has a 32% new-to-brand share in the GLP-1 class as of last week. And so it's really, really outstanding performance by the team. Overall for us, continued class growth is probably the most important factor, and we're excited. Maybe I can provide some color because we recently started reaching additional prescribers as of late last year, basically in the last quarter. And we've seen significant continued adoption by new prescribers. So that basically speaks to continued growth as we look ahead for this product.","We do look at the competitive environment and we do look at semaglutide as a potential competitor in the near future. And they do have good efficacy data in a number of trials, including a head-to-head against Trulicity. But they also have reported an increasing retinopathy that was significant as part of one of their trials. So we need to see at the end of the day what the full label will be. And we are of course very prepared, but we really like our chances.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","And then thoughts on the REWIND study and a readout?","Enrique A. Conterno - Eli Lilly & Co.","REWIND, we recently had an interim readout. We were basically told that the study will continue as planned, which basically means that we're looking at 2019 for the readout of the cardiovascular outcomes data for that study.","Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.","Thank you, Enrique. We're almost at the top of the hour, so, Dave, we'll turn it over to you to close out today's call.","David A. Ricks - Eli Lilly & Co.","Thanks, Phil. We appreciate your participation in today's earnings call and your interest in Eli Lilly and Company. Driven by new product launches, Lilly is entering a new growth period. The combination of top line growth and margin expansion over the balance of the decade provides a compelling thesis for investors. I look forward to keeping you informed of our progress, and please follow up with our IR team if you have questions we've not been able to address on today's call.

Joining me on today's call are Derica Rice, our Chief Financial Officer; Dr. Jan Lundberg, President of Lilly Research Laboratories; Dr. Sue Mahony, President of Lilly Oncology; Enrique Conterno, President of Lilly Diabetes; Dave Ricks, President of Lilly Bio-Medicines; Chito Zulueta, President of Emerging Markets; Jeff Simmons, President of Elanco Animal Health; and Ilissa Rassner, Brad Robling, and Phil Johnson of the Lilly Investor Relations team.","During this call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors, including those listed on slide 3 and those outlined in our latest forms 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC. The information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It is not intended to be promotional and is not sufficient for prescribing decisions.","So let me begin by providing an overview of Lilly's third quarter. Again this quarter, we posted strong non-GAAP financial performance. With our continued focus on expanding margins, we leveraged constant currency revenue growth of 5% into operating income growth of 27%. Year to date, we've leveraged 3% constant currency revenue growth into 16% operating income growth.","Along with this strong financial performance, our focus on innovation continues to pay off. Just since our last call, in Diabetes, along with Boehringer Ingelheim, we presented results from the EMPA-REG OUTCOME study with Jardiance. This is the first time a diabetes medication showed a significant reduction in both cardiovascular risk and cardiovascular death in a dedicated outcome study. We anticipate that our colleagues at BI will submit these data to U.S. and European regulators before the end of this year.","In Bio-Medicines, we announced results from two Phase 3 rheumatoid arthritis studies evaluating baricitinib head to head against two of the most widely used RA treatments. In one study, baricitinib showed superior efficacy to methotrexate in treatment-na\u00efve patients. And in the second study it showed superior efficacy to adalimumab, the market-leading biologic in patients with inadequate response to conventional DMARDs. These are outstanding results. Our team is now squarely focused on global regulatory submissions.","And in Oncology, the U.S. FDA granted breakthrough therapy designation to our CDK4 and CDK6 inhibitor, abemaciclib, for the treatment of patients with refractory hormone-receptor-positive advanced or metastatic breast cancer. This is our second oncology molecule to receive breakthrough therapy designation, following olaratumab for soft-tissue sarcoma. As you know, the FDA may grant this designation in certain circumstances where there is preliminary clinical evidence that a drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over available therapy on a clinically significant endpoint. These are all excellent examples of the progress we're making in delivering innovation that is valued by patients, physicians, and payers.","Also, since our last call, we were reminded of just how vexing the pursuit of pharmaceutical innovation can be. Despite demonstrating HDL and LDL changes consistent with our Phase 2 study, our CETP inhibitor, evacetrapib, did not demonstrate a reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events in the Phase 3 ACCELERATE trial. Lilly and its academic collaborators decided to terminate development of evacetrapib based on this new information. This was an unexpected and a disappointing development for patients with high-risk vascular disease and for Lilly. Despite this setback, our pipeline is strong and our future growth prospects are bright. We continue to look forward to revenue growth and margin expansion throughout the balance of this decade, and we believe we've built a sustainable R&D engine for the long term.","Now, let me highlight additional key events that have occurred since our second quarter earning call in late July.","On the commercial front, in diabetes, we launched a number of products in major markets. We launched our weekly GLP-1 agonist Trulicity in Japan. Along with Boehringer Ingelheim, we launched our insulin glargine product in Japan, as well as the UK, Germany, and a number of other European markets. And, here in the U.S., we received approval for and launched Synjardy, a twice-daily combination pill containing the SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin and Metformin. Also in the U.S., we launched Humalog U-200 KwikPen, the first concentrated mealtime analog insulin in the U.S. market.","On the regulatory front, our colleagues at Boehringer Ingelheim completed the FDA submission of Jentadueto XR, a once-daily combination pill containing linagliptin and Metformin. In Japan, we submitted ramucirumab for second-line non-small cell lung cancer and ixekizumab for both moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis and for psoriatic arthritis. In the U.S., we submitted Humulin Regular U-500 in the KwikPen delivery device to the FDA. The product is already marketed in the U.S. in a vial and syringe format. As I mentioned earlier, the FDA granted breakthrough therapy designation to abemaciclib, based on data from our Phase 1b cohort expansions in breast cancer.","On the clinical front, we had a number of noteworthy disclosures. As Enrique discussed on our investor call a few weeks ago, along with our colleagues at Boehringer Ingelheim, we at Lilly are thrilled that Jardiance is the only diabetes medication to show a significant reduction in both cardiovascular risk and cardiovascular death in a dedicated outcomes trial \u2013 in this case, in patients with type 2 diabetes at high risk of CV events. Roughly one in two deaths in people with type 2 diabetes is due to cardiovascular disease, despite the use of statins, blood pressure medicines, and antiplatelet therapy. Clearly a significant unmet need remains for further reducing cardiovascular risk in people with type 2 diabetes to help them live longer and healthier lives.","Highlights from the EMPA-REG OUTCOME study included a 14% reduction in the primary outcome measure of the three-point MACE endpoint, comprised of cardiovascular death, non-fatal heart attack, or non-fatal stroke; a 35% reduction in hospitalization due to heart failure; a 38% reduction in death from cardiovascular causes; and a 32% reduction in death from all causes. This is great news for patients with type 2 diabetes at high risk for cardiovascular events.","As I mentioned earlier, the positive clinical data readouts didn't stop there. Along with Incyte, we were extremely pleased that baricitinib demonstrated superior efficacy to methotrexate in treatment-na\u00efve patients with RA and adalimumab in RA patients with inadequate response to conventional DMARDs. We'll present detailed data from these trials at the American College of Rheumatology meeting in San Francisco in November, and we will host an investor call on November 11 to review the results with you.","Finally, in clinical news, we terminated the development of evacetrapib for the treatment of high-risk cardiovascular disease, as I stated in my opening comments. We expect to disclose detailed findings from this study at a medical conference next year.","On the business development front, earlier this month, as planned, we took back North American rights to erbitux from Bristol-Myers Squibb. We announced the acquisition of worldwide rights to a Phase 3 intranasal glucagon from Locemia. This product could be the first needle-free rescue treatment for severe hypoglycemia. We expanded our collaboration with Innovent, based in Suzhou, China, to include the development and potential commercialization of up to three anti-PD-1 based bispecific antibodies. We entered into a preclinical research collaboration with ImaginAb centered on T-cell based immuno-oncology therapies. And we announced an expansion of our immuno-oncology collaboration with AstraZeneca to include a range of additional combinations across both companies' complementary portfolios.","In other news, we entered into a settlement agreement with Sanofi to resolve insulin glargine patent litigation. Under this agreement, Sanofi granted Lilly a royalty-bearing license so that Lilly can manufacture and sell Basaglar in the KwikPen device globally. Also, Lilly and Boehringer Ingelheim will be able to launch Basaglar in the U.S. in December 2016. The Japan Patent Office issued a notice of closure in the trial regarding the validity of Lilly's vitamin regimen patent for Alimta. We expect a written decision upholding the validity of the patent in the coming weeks. This is the first of two decisions pending. If the patents are ultimately upheld through all challenges and appeals, they would provide intellectual property protection for Alimta in Japan until June 2021. The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana ruled that our Alimta vitamin regimen patent would be infringed by generic challengers' proposed products. The court had previously upheld the validity of this patent, which provides intellectual property protection for Alimta until May 2022. The generics have appealed these rulings, but a date for the appeal has not yet been set. We announced plans to expand our New York City research and development site. This investment will enhance our immuno-oncology capabilities, as well as facilitate academic collaborations.","And, finally, in the third quarter, we repurchased $61 million of stock, leaving $3.2 billion remaining on our $5 billion plan. In addition, during the third quarter, we distributed over $500 million to shareholders via our dividend. We remain committed to providing a robust dividend and to returning excess cash to shareholders via share repurchase.","And now I'll turn the call over to Phil for a discussion of our financial performance for the quarter. Phil?","Phil Johnson - Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.","Great, thank you, John. Before I discuss our Q3 results, it may be helpful to review key features of our presentation of GAAP results and non-GAAP measures. When interpreting our GAAP results and the growth rates versus 2014, keep in mind that 2014 does not include Novartis Animal Health, while 2015 includes the operating results of this business, as well as all the costs associated with the acquisition. For our non-GAAP measures, we now exclude amortization of intangibles. And, to provide you a better idea of the underlying trends in our business, we've adjusted our non-GAAP measures for 2014 to exclude the expense associated with amortization of intangibles and to include Novartis Animal Health as if we'd closed the transaction on January 1, 2014. This should place 2014 on the exact same basis upon which we are reporting our financials this year.","Now let's look at our results for the quarter. Slide 9 provides a summary of our GAAP results. I'll focus my comments on our underlying non-GAAP measures to provide insights into the trends in our business. So please refer to today's earnings press release for a detailed description of the year-on-year changes in our third quarter reported or GAAP results.","Moving to slide 10, you can see that Q3 revenue was just under $5 billion. The decrease of 4% compared to Q3 2014 reflects significant FX headwinds. Excluding FX, our Q3 revenue increased 5% on a non-GAAP basis. As we discussed on prior calls, this year we're still feeling a negative effect from the loss of U.S. exclusivity for Cymbalta and Evista. As we move through 2015, however, this effect is diminishing. This quarter, U.S. Cymbalta and Evista trimmed about 150 basis points off of our worldwide revenue growth rate.","Gross margin as a percent of revenue increased 3 percentage points, going from 74.8% to 77.8%. This increase was driven by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold, which increased cost of sales in Q3 last year but decreased cost of sales in Q3 this year. Excluding this FX effect, our gross margin percent increased by 30 basis points, going from 74.9% in last year's quarter to 75.2% this quarter. As on prior calls, you'll find a supplementary slide providing our gross margin percent for the last 10 quarters with and without this FX effect.","We continue to drive productivity improvements across our business. Total operating expense, defined as the sum of R&D and SG&A, declined by 7% or over $200 million compared to Q3 of 2014. Breaking this into its component parts, marketing, selling, and administrative expenses declined 5%, while R&D declined 10%. The reduction in marketing, selling, and administrative expenses was due to the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates and continued expense control, partially offset by expenses to support recent product launches. The reduction R&D expense was driven primarily by the 2014 charge associated with the termination of tabalumab development and, to a lesser extent, by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates.","Other income and expense was income of $87 million this quarter and included a gain on liquidation of our Receptos holdings that was partially offset by other investment losses and writedowns. Our tax rate was 24.9%, an increase of 1.6 percentage points compared to the same quarter last year. This increase is due to a catch-up for the first nine months of this year to reflect an increased percentage of forecasted earnings in higher-tax jurisdictions. Also, our tax rate in both periods did not include the benefit of certain U.S. tax provisions, including the R&D tax credit, as those provisions had lapsed. At the bottom line, net income and earnings per share both increased 22%.","Slide 11 contains non-GAAP adjusted information for the first nine months of the year. I would point out that, year to date, our non-GAAP operating expenses \u2013 again, the sum of SG&A and R&D \u2013 is 54.7% of revenue. This is more than 140 basis points lower than the same period last year and reflects clear progress toward our goal of 50% or lower in 2018.","Slide 12 provides a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS, and you'll find additional details on these adjustments on slide 22.","Now let's take a look at the effect of price, rate, and volume on revenue. On slide 13, in the yellow box at the bottom of the page, you'll see the total revenue decline of 4% on a non-GAAP basis that I mentioned earlier. The significant strengthening of the U.S. dollar against many foreign currencies drove this decline, as you see the 8% negative effect from FX this quarter. On a performance basis, our worldwide revenue grew 5%, with volume driving 7 percentage points of growth, partially offset by a negative price effect of 2%. By geography, you'll notice that U.S. Pharma revenue increased 13%, driven by volume, partially offset by price. Late-lifecycle revenue for Evista and Cymbalta did influence individual components of U.S. growth, but not the overall increase. In fact, excluding Evista and Cymbalta, the rest of our U.S. revenue grew 17%, with 9% from price and 8% from volume, with new products like Trulicity and Cyramza making significant contributions.","Moving to our international operations, we're now reporting Australia and New Zealand along with our emerging markets, so Australia, Canada and Europe, or ACE in the past, is now EuCan, which stand for Europe and Canada. The decline in EuCan revenue of 17% was almost entirely driven by the negative effect of FX, while on a constant currency or performance basis, EuCan revenue decreased 3%. This decrease was driven by a substantial reduction in the European Cymbalta sales, resulting from a loss of data package exclusivity. Excluding Cymbalta, EuCan sales increased 3% in constant currency terms. In Japan, Pharma revenue decreased 4% in total, driven by adverse currency movements, while on a constant currency or performance basis, Japan revenue increased 14%. This performance growth was attributable to many products, chief among them Cymbalta and Cyramza.","Turning to emerging markets, we saw revenue decline of 18%, driven primarily by negative FX effect of 14%. On a performance basis, emerging market sales declined 4%. This 4% performance decline was driven almost entirely by the negative effect of the Brazil Humulin tender that we had last year but not this year. Also, this quarter our Pharma revenue in China declined 2%, with 1% driven by FX and the other 1% driven by lower volume.","On a non-GAAP basis, which adjusts 2014 as if we'd completed the Novartis Animal Health acquisition on January 1 of last year, Elanco Animal Health revenue declined 9%. Excluding the negative effect of FX, Elanco revenue decreased 2%. This performance decrease was primarily driven by OUS companion animal products, and to a lesser extent by U.S. companion animal products, partially offset by growth in U.S. food animal products.","Moving to slide 15, you'll see the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates on our Q3 2015 results. This quarter FX was a significant top line headwind, reducing revenue in U.S. dollars by eight percentage points. In terms of cost of goods sold, however, FX provided a substantial benefit, as non-GAAP cost of goods sold decreased 15% including FX but increased 5% excluding FX. With both revenue and cost of sales increasing 5% in performance terms, we saw similar growth in gross margin.","Our continued expense discipline is evident in our operating expense results, as even when backing out the favorable effect of FX on our expenses, OpEx still declined 3%. This allowed us to leverage mid-single-digit growth in revenue and gross margin into 27% performance growth in operating income and 25% performance growth in net income and EPS. These are outstanding results.","Moving to our pipeline update on slide 16, you'll see the pipeline as of October 16. Changes since our last earnings call are highlighted, with green arrows showing progression, red arrows showing attrition, and stars showing additions. In terms of advancement, you'll see that we began Phase 3 testing of olaratumab in soft-tissue sarcoma, as well as of our tau imaging agent for Alzheimer's disease. And through our recent agreement with Locemia Solutions, we added the intranasal glucagon molecule. You'll see we began Phase 2 testing for an ultra-rapid-acting insulin in collaboration with Adocia, and we began Phase 1 testing of two molecules, one for cancer and the other for diabetes.","Since our last update, we've also terminated development of a number of molecules, including evacetrapib in Phase 3, two molecules in Phase 2, as well as five in Phase 1. The early-phase terminations you've seen in recent quarters reflect a concerted effort to raise the bar for taking molecules forward and to focus our efforts on the highest priority opportunities.","Now let me turn the call over to Derica.","Derica W. Rice - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Global Services","Thanks, Phil. As on prior calls, I'll recap the progress we've made on the key events we projected for 2015 and then review our 2015 financial guidance.","Turning to slide 17, we're pleased with the positive progress we've made on the key events we laid out for the year. This progress is represented by the large number of green checkmarks that you see. We've highlighted in yellow the key events that have occurred since our last earnings call. They include initiation of Phase 3 trials for olaratumab in soft-tissue sarcoma, ramucirumab in second-line liver cancer, and along with Pfizer for tanezumab in both osteoarthritis pain and chronic lower back pain.","As mentioned earlier, we issued a top line press release and presented detailed data at EASD for the Jardiance EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial. We also issued top line press releases for two positive Phase 3 studies of baricitinib in rheumatoid arthritis, RA-BEGIN in September and RA-BEAM earlier this month. And we terminated the Phase 3 ACCELERATE trial with evacetrapib.","You'll also see that we've updated the regulatory submissions category to reflect Japanese submission of ixekizumab for both psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. Separately, you'll now see on ClinTrials.gov (sic) [ClinicalTrials.gov] that we are running a new psoriasis trial comparing ixekizumab head to head with Stelara.","In the other section, you'll see green checkmarks for the positive Alimta ruling from the U.S. District Court on the issue of infringement and for the similar ruling received in Japan. Key events remaining this year include: regulatory submission of baricitinib for RA; initiation of a rolling submission for olaratumab for soft-tissue sarcoma, with the completion of the submission expected during the first half of next year; FDA action on necitumumab for first-line squamous non-small-cell lung cancer; and legal rulings on Alimta litigation in Europe.","The progress we've made in the past few years and again this year in executing our innovation-based strategy solidifies our near to medium-term growth prospects, and it gives us confidence that our strategy is the right one for Lilly to create value for our various stakeholders, including our shareholders.","Turning to our 2015 financial guidance, let me start with the punchline. We raised and narrowed our non-GAAP EPS guidance to reflect solid underlying performance for the first nine months of the year as well as higher other income.","Looking by line item, you'll see that our revenue and gross margin percent guidance is unchanged. We've reduced our guidance for both marketing, selling, and administrative expense and R&D and development expense. This is driven by our continued focus on expense management. I would note that this lower R&D range includes an anticipated Q4 charge of up to $90 million related to stopping the evacetrapib clinical trials. We've increased the expected range for other income, largely due to the gain on the sale of our Receptos stock holdings.","To reflect an increased percentage of earnings in higher-tax jurisdictions, we've increased our non-GAAP tax rate to 21.5% and our GAAP tax rate to 16.5%. Please note that both tax rates assume the R&D tax credit and other international tax provisions will be extended before year-end, retroactive for the full year.","At the bottom line, you'll see we've raised and narrowed our non-GAAP EPS range and now forecast full-year non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $3.40 to $3.45 per share. Our new GAAP EPS range of $2.40 to $2.45 per share reflect this same upward adjustment. Finally, we've lowered our estimate for full-year capital expenditures to $1.1 billion.","In summary, we again posted solid underlying business performance in the third quarter and for the first nine months of the year. Excluding the negative effect of FX, we drove mid-single-digit revenue growth, with strong contributions coming from recently launched products. Our continued focus on productivity and cost controls drove strong leverage at the bottom line. And the current pace of margin expansion puts us on track to meet our midterm margin expansion goals.","While we did experience a setback with evacetrapib, news from our pipeline has on balance been exceedingly positive. The string of positive results we've had over the last couple of years represents tangible results from our innovation-based strategy, and we still have an exciting period ahead of us. We expect FDA action on two molecules presently under regulatory review, necitumumab before the end of this year and ixekizumab in the first half of next year. And over the next 18 months, we could submit six additional new molecular entities for regulatory review, baricitinib, olaratumab, abemaciclib, intranasal glucagon, our CGRP monoclonal antibody, and solanezumab. The success of our pipeline positions us to drive revenue growth and expand margins throughout the balance of this decade.","So as it has been our stated intent, we have returned to revenue growth on a performance basis. We are reducing OpEx as a percent of revenue, helping to expand our operating margins. We are advancing our pipeline with positive results, and we have built a sustainable R&D engine that can produce additional and exciting new medicines to help people have longer, healthier lives.","This concludes our prepared remarks. Now I'll turn the call over to Phil to moderate the Q&A session.","Phil Johnson - Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.","Thanks, Derica. Linda, if you could, please provide the instructions for the Q&A session and then go to the first caller on the line, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We'll begin with the line of Mark Schoenebaum with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI","Hey, guys, can you hear me?","Phil Johnson - Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.","We sure can, Mark.","Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI","Thanks so much for letting me having the first question. I really appreciate it. John, I have two questions for you, please, if I may, and I hope you're well. Last quarter you said in the 2Q call that you thought SMID-cap biotech stocks in general were in a bit of a valuation bubble. You have proven to be a better stock analyst than me and my competitors. Now that we're 25% lower than your comments, I'd just love to hear kind of what you think. And of course from a Lilly perspective, are you asking your BD folks to kind of speed up the pace of their calls? Or do you want to let this settle out for a while, or do you want to see it go lower?","Number two, I know you're very involved in Washington and what goes on there with the bio and the pharma lobbying groups and industry. I'd love to hear your thoughts on drug pricing but more specifically \u2013 obviously, given the Hillary Clinton tweet, the Marco Rubio comments \u2013 but more specifically, I'd love to know, when do you think the industry is just going to begin defending itself to the public more aggressively, which is going to cost some money? You know that we're only 10% of overall healthcare spending, and the other 90%, and these other costs, et cetera. When is the industry going to begin to spend the money to try to change the image and teach Americans that it's probably worth it? And I'll leave my questions at that. Thanks, Phil, for calling on me.","Phil Johnson - Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.","You're welcome, Mark. John?","John C. Lechleiter - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay, Mark. Thanks a lot. I did make the comment about the bubble, I guess, at the last call. Although I think the hit that the industry has taken may have come from sort of another direction, with the noise around pricing. I think there's no question that valuations are lower. Does that change our fundamental posture with respect to business development? It doesn't, I think we've said all along that we're really not interested in sort of large-scale M&A, but we're going to continue to look at opportunities, particularly earlier in development, even at the preclinical stage, to acquire assets or acquire companies as the case may be. We're very excited about the opportunity we have with Locemia, this intranasal glucagon that we announced just a few days ago.","I don't know how good of a \u2013 I don't think I'd want to change jobs with you right now, though, Mark. I think you do what you do well, and I'll continue to try to do what I do -","Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI","I'd take that trade.","John C. Lechleiter - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay, good. Now, on drug pricing, I think if you go back through successive presidential campaigns, with some bit of variability, drug pricing sort of tends to rear its head, because I think it's something that politicians have found resonates with voters. Having said that, I think the facts tell a different story. Someone showed me some information the other day \u2013 in the second quarter of this year, the net effective price increase for the market basket of medicines in this country rose 0.7%. Well, I mean, that reflects \u2013 not necessarily these things that get called out in the media, these individual huge drug price increases. It reflects the fact that many of our medicines are going generic still. I'm talking about the industry here, Lilly's sort of been through its own situation with that. It reflects the deep discount that we're mandated by the government to provide but increasingly must provide to commercial insurers and payers in order to get onto formularies and to be able to compete for the business.","I think with respect to telling the story, I think you can expect to see more coming from the industry. I think we've got to be careful and thoughtful here. I don't think there's a way you can spend enough money to sort of all the sudden change people's minds, because so much of the criticism comes in the form of earned media. No one's out there spending money, per se; they're just picking up quotes and amplifying those. We've got a great story to tell. We've got medicines \u2013 and if you look at the hepatitis space, if you look at cancer, if you look at diabetes. I mean, huge advances in recent years. Obviously lots of risks, our evacetrapib trial calls that out. At the same time, I've never been as optimistic as I am about the chances we have as an industry to really make a difference for patients. We've got to keep telling the story, reminding people that the medicines as a percentage of total healthcare spend have remained remarkably constant for a long period of time, which suggests that our medicines are helping to hold the line or even reduce other costs in the system that none of us want to incur: hospital stays, being off of work, disability, et cetera.","So we're not tone-deaf, Mark, in terms of the criticism that's being leveled at us. At the same time, I think that we've got more work to do here, and I think you can expect to see more.","Phil Johnson - Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.","Great. Thank you, John. Linda, if we could, go to the next caller, please.","Operator","Yes, next we'll go to the line of Chris Scott with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Christopher T. Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great, thanks very much for the questions. First one is on expense management. You guys are obviously doing a great job on that front, but just a qualitative question as I look out to 2016. You've had a lot of incremental product flows when we think about next year and to 2017, between Jardiance's expanded label, the IL-17, baricitinib, et cetera. Should we think about 2016 as an investment year for the company where we could see SG&A growth kind of resume here, or do you still have enough flexibility with some of your initiatives to absorb some of these launches in the existing infrastructure?","The second question was on baricitinib. Just wanted to get some of your perspective on how you see the superiority data versus Humira playing out in the commercial RA market. I guess is this an area that you think you could take share quickly, or is this going to be a much more gradual story, just given how entrenched some of these TNFs are with the long-term safety, et cetera? Thanks very much.","Phil Johnson - Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.","Great, Chris. Thank you for the questions. Derica, we'll go to you for the first question on the expenses and particularly some of the pushes and pulls as we head into 2016, and then, Dave, for your comments on baricitinib.","Derica W. Rice - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Global Services","Good morning, Chris. It's too early to give specific guidance on 2016 as it relates to our expense management. We'll provide that on our January call the first week of 2016. But what I can say is that we expect to be consistent with what we stated all along, which is that we believe we can expand margins throughout the balance of this decade, and that's also including revenue growth. And clearly to expand margins, that means we either \u2013 we're growing our top line faster than we're growing our expense base. And what ultimately happens to our expense base, we will share the specifics around that in that first week in 2016.","Phil Johnson - Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.","Great. Thanks, Derica, Dave?","David A. Ricks - Senior Vice President and President, Lilly Bio-Medicines","Thanks for the question, Chris, on bari. We're very excited now that we have the full set of data in hand. Recall we have four separate Phase 3 programs, which really span the whole spectrum of rheumatoid arthritis, from refractory patients to biologics. Recall that was the first study we read out, and our study has, I think, a unique feature in it's a very real-world assessment. Many patients had failed on two or three or more biologics before entering that study, and still baricitinib showed very strong, robust efficacy. We then read out a study in conventional DMARD refractory patients. Again, baricitinib really helped patients who had been refractory to methotrexate and other conventional DMARDs. We then demonstrated superiority to really the established standard of care for disease modification, which is methotrexate, in the RA-BEGIN study, and most recently a superiority to adalimumab in DMARD-refractory patients, sort of this first-line biologic space.","So I think we've gotten what we wanted when we started the program. And, to your question on safety, so far, through clinical trial observations, we're very reassured by the safety profile we see. So we're now onto submission.","In terms of what to expect in the market, I think the RA market has some features where one would say this will not be sort of an overweight phenomena of share gain. You mentioned one, which is a natural caution on safety in any new drug where you're suppressing the immune system. We're very confident in the data we've produced on that dimension through our clinical trials, but understandably physicians like to see that play out over time, and I think that's been sort of the normal pattern in this market. As more reassuring safety data from a real-world setting is produced, doctors become more comfortable.","It's also a very competitive space. We understand that, and we're prepared to compete in that. On the other hand, baricitinib I think offers a new choice, which is when I'm failing on inexpensive generic conventional DMARDs, rather than step two, a TNF, I have another alternative now, and that alternative appears to be superior to the standard of care in that setting. And there are a number of patients in that situation have not made that step two, anti-TNFs, for all kinds of reasons, and we'll be competing aggressively in that space.","And so we like our hand. We obviously will have baricitinib for a while to come. We're stepping into a new market for Lilly; we want to do it right. And my view is I think we'll see good uptake. It won't be some overnight phenomena, but on the other hand, we do expect to make incremental gains as we enter the market.","Phil Johnson - Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.","Great. Thank you, Dave. Linda, if we can, go to the next caller, please.","Operator","Next we'll go to the line of Tim Anderson with Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Timothy M. Anderson - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you. I have three questions. On EMPA-REG OUTCOME, is it possible that those results will actually trigger price competition as J&J tries to hold on to its market-leading formulary positioning with Invokana? And Lilly, like most other sellers of SGLT2s, also sells a DPP-4. What's your messaging to physicians on how they should think about those two different classes of drugs? On Alimta, U.S. performance was down year on year. You mentioned competitive pressures. I'm assuming that is the PD-1s. So is that the trajectory we should think about going forward? And then lastly on evacetrapib, knowing what you do about the data at this point, do you think your drug failed because of the way you ran your particular clinical trial? Or do you think it failed because CETP inhibition is just not a viable mechanism? I realize full results have not yet been presented.","Phil Johnson - Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.","Tim, thank you for the questions. So, Enrique, if we can go to you for the first couple of questions on EMPA-REG OUTCOME and messaging around DPP-4 Tradjenta. Sue, to you, then, for the Alimta U.S. dynamics that we're seeing. And then, Dave, on evacetrapib. Jan, also feel free to chime in if you would like, as well. Enrique?","Enrique A. Conterno - Senior Vice President and President, Lilly Diabetes","Sure. Tim, thank you for your question. It's difficult, really, to speculate when it comes to price competition. If anything, the EMPA-REG OUTCOME results create differentiation in the marketplace. So, from that perspective, we feel very confident in the value proposition that Jardiance offers today, which is I think very significant. I would point out that the access that we already have with Jardiance for 2016 is indeed very strong. We will have over 85% commercial access and over 55% Part D access. Could those numbers improve a bit with some of these results? It is likely, but as you know that takes time, and there's a process when it comes to formularies.","At this point in time, there's no promotion of these data. We are clearly seeing an uptick when it comes to new-to-brand prescriptions. Just to frame, we were, before the top line, when we look at EMPA, including both Jardiance and glyxambi, our new-to-brand share was 15%. That creeped up to 17% by the time at EASD. And now we're at 21%. Probably most relevant is the share shift that we've seen post-EASD with endocrinologies going from 21% to 31% new-to-brand share despite the fact that there's no promotion. As John shared in his prepared remarks, we are planning to have the submission before the end of the year.","Now, in terms of our positioning, in terms of promotion, that's something that we do not discuss prior to basically launching our promotion campaign and our messages in this particular case for EMPA.","Phil Johnson - Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.","Okay, and any thoughts at all on Tradjenta moving forward now that we have SGLT2 data and how we'll be competing with that drug?","Enrique A. Conterno - Senior Vice President and President, Lilly Diabetes","Nothing really changes when it comes to Tradjenta. We have, I think, a unique product that is uniquely differentiated in the DPP-4 class. Tradjenta, I think it's important to note, is the fastest grower in that class. So growth is very, very strong. We are planning no changes at this stage.","Phil Johnson - Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.","Sue?","Susan Mahony - Senior Vice President and President, Lilly Oncology","Sure. Tim, with regard to Alimta, we saw a couple of things this quarter. Firstly, we saw a buying pattern where we had a buy-in this time last year that we didn't see this year. And, secondly, we have seen some softening on Alimta in later lines of therapy, in second line and beyond, which we had anticipated. I mean, we just launched Cyramza in the second-line setting, and clearly the I-O agents are also in second line. So we are seeing some softening there and in areas that we're not promoting. Where we are promoting, i.e., the first-line setting and continuation maintenance, we continue to see good usage and continue to believe that we will continue to see good usage in those areas. As you know, we are also doing combination studies with I-O agents. We anticipate getting some data next year on that. So I wouldn't read too much into this quarter's trend.","Phil Johnson - Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.","Dave?","David A. Ricks - Senior Vice President and President, Lilly Bio-Medicines","Yeah, as relates to evacetrapib, Tim, obviously we're disappointed in the outcome, but I guess your question is did we run the right experiment. And our answer is yes. We sought to test the hypothesis, whether robust CETP inhibition, which dramatically raised HDL and reduced LDL, would lead to a reduction in major cardiovascular events. We ran that experiment, I think, exceedingly well in a population of interest, which was high-risk vascular disease. And after three years of observation, the answer is robust CETP inhibition does not change major cardiovascular events with evacetrapib. We really can't say whether that would apply to other CETP inhibitors, but I think we're pretty confident that the experiment we ran was a good one. And we have a definitive answer, thus the discontinuation of development.","Phil Johnson - Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.","One thing \u2013 this is Phil \u2013 real quick. Because we had a number of questions, as you would imagine, after the announcement that we were stopping the development of evacetrapib. Just to clarify the kinds of robust increases we saw in HDL and decreases in LDL. If you look at the Phase 2 study, you'll notice that we essentially had two main doses, a 100-milligram dose and a 500-milligram dose. It was very clear that the 500-milligram dose produced both greater increases in HDL and greater decreases in LDL than the 100-milligram dose. The 130-milligram dose we took into Phase 3 had been reformulated to be more bioavailable and give effects that would be more potent than the prior formulation. In effect, what we saw from the initial data we've seen in our Phase 3 study would have been as we had expected and talked about in the past, additional HDL raising of roughly 120% plus, 130% kind of numbers and greater than a 30% reduction on top of statins on LDLs. So very robust changes that for whatever reasons and unfortunately did not translate into a reduction in MACE events in this particular trial. So more to come on that likely next year, as Dave mentioned.","So, Linda, if we can, go to the next caller, please.","Operator","Next we'll go to the line of Vamil Divan with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Vamil K. Divan - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Great. Thanks so much for taking the questions. I just had two questions if I could. So one just around the pricing discussion from before, just found it interesting on slide 13 when you break down the pushes and pulls on the revenues. I think this was the first quarter in a few that we've seen the impact on price in the U.S. be negative. And so I was wondering if you maybe just could provide a little bit more color, if I'm correct, on what exactly drove that result relative to the last several quarters.","And then second one is just we've received a few questions around \u2013 you've got obviously a lot of news, positive and negative, for the pipeline. And you've kind of generally endorsed sort of the margin expansion story you've talked about before. You've given pretty specific comments in the past around the ranges you expect for SG&A and R&D, sort of in that 2018-2019 timeframe in terms of percentage of sales. Can you just talk, I guess \u2013 do you still feel comfortable with those numbers you gave before? And maybe more broadly, just how much are you factoring in from drugs that are still in the pipeline in terms of delivering actual revenues in that 2018 \u2013 2019 timeframe as you think about hitting the margin targets that you've outlined before? Thanks.","Phil Johnson - Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.","Great. Thank you, Vamil, for the questions. On your first question, this is the first quarter in a while that we had a negative price effect for our U.S. Pharma business. If you do go back to some prior years, I think there were some similar effects as we've gone through loss of exclusivity for products, particularly when we have engaged in helping to supply the market with generic forms of our product. And that's what happened essentially this quarter, in particular with Evista, where we had higher volumes than in last year's quarter for shipments of generic Evista, or raloxifene, and that influenced the price calculation. Again, this is something that is particular to late lifecycle, as John mentioned at the very beginning. This is one of the benefits essentially that the industry provides with our innovation, is that eventually you do lose patent protection, and patient and payers benefit from significantly reduced prices on those innovations.","Derica, on the forward-looking ranges for SG&A and R&D?","Derica W. Rice - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Global Services","Sure. What we've said is we will get our operating expenses, and that's defined as the sum of R&D and SG&A combined, to a level of 50% of revenue or less in 2018. And we feel that given results we've seen here in the quarter and really thus far through the first nine months of this year, we're very much on track to achieve that goal.","And we've also stated that we believe we can achieve that goal regardless of the pipeline output scenario that we're in. So we've never known exactly which molecules would succeed and which ones would fail, but whatever the mix were, we were confident that we could still achieve that margin expansion goal. And we believe that with the payout that we've seen thus far over the last couple years, we're even more confident that we will achieve that and also that we will be able to expand the margins throughout the remainder of this decade.","Phil Johnson - Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.","Great. Thanks, Derica. Linda, if we can, go to the next caller, please.","Operator","Next. we'll go to the line of Gregg Gilbert with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks. Enrique, going back to diabetes, I'm not asking you to show your future strategic cards here. But what is Lilly doing to help shape the diabetes treatment guidelines post the EMPA results? Perhaps if you could, share what you think a realistic, responsible goal would be for Lilly as a company in terms of how to frame the importance of that outcomes benefit for treating physicians.","And then my second question is on the Alzheimer's front. Is Lilly exploring compounds that treat the symptoms of the disease, or are you focused only on disease modification as a goal? A policy question as you approach R&D in that area beyond the later-stage assets. Thanks.","Phil Johnson - Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.","Great, Gregg. Thank you for the questions. So, Enrique, on the first question, and, Dave, if you'd like to take the second one.","David A. Ricks - Senior Vice President and President, Lilly Bio-Medicines","Sure.","Phil Johnson - Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.","Jan, obviously feel free to chime in as well if you'd like. Enrique?","Enrique A. Conterno - Senior Vice President and President, Lilly Diabetes","We have the great fortune that we count within our ranks a number of people that have either participated in developing and writing some of these guidelines in the past both in Europe and in the U.S., or people that have actually called for some of those committees. We have to understand that those committees act in an independent manner. For us, I think our role is to ensure that these bodies, whether it's the ADA or others, basically have full access to all of our data. And we believe that data speaks by itself. I think it's very compelling. And when it comes to the overall benefit, we do expect that the data is such that it would trigger some of these reviews. I'm not going to speak later on the outcome of that.","Phil Johnson - Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.","Thanks, Enrique, Dave?","David A. Ricks - Senior Vice President and President, Lilly Bio-Medicines","We're going to \u2013 I'll just give a quick commercial. On December 8 I'll have a chance to talk a lot to talk about our Alzheimer's strategy, Gregg, so you're welcome to join us then. But in brief, we believe Lilly is very well positioned to capitalize on the emerging science in Alzheimer's. That is primarily focused right now on disease-modifying agents but not exclusively. And as you know, we have disease-modifying agents at every stage of development. But we also have important preclinical efforts on symptomatic agents because people, even with the best-case scenario on disease modification, will live with this disease for a long time. They will suffer from the symptoms of Alzheimer's, and we believe there is space there. We have some expertise there, and we'll exploit it. Our main focus is disease modification, but we're interested in agents that could also help patients just live more comfortably or more safely with the disease.","Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you.","Jan M. Lundberg - Executive Vice President, Science and Technology","I can add that we have a compound in Phase 1, which it said Parkinson's as the heading, but that's also a potential symptomatic treatment for Alzheimer's disease. And in the preclinical space, we also have some efforts that actually build on Lilly's very long experience in the field of psychiatry. So I think we are well positioned, realizing though that it is an uphill battle to understand exactly what mechanist could work then for novel symptomatic treatments in Alzheimer's, but we are also very much involved in new ideas then to learn how the brain is functioning in psychiatry.","Phil Johnson - Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.","Great. Thank you, Jan. Linda, if we can, go to the next caller, please.","Operator","Next we'll go to the line of Seamus Fernandez with Leerink. Please go ahead.","Seamus Fernandez - Leerink Partners LLC","Thanks very much for taking the question, so just a couple of quick questions, first off for Enrique. Enrique, can you talk to us a little bit about the importance of Basaglar and the decision to settle on this? Was the settlement specifically applied only to the device, or does it apply more broadly such that other competitors seeking to enter the market would have to go through the same legal process that Lilly would?","And then in terms of \u2013 again, more of a guidelines follow-up question. As we think about maybe just the guidelines and timing of guidelines around EMPA-REG, can you just update us on which guidelines are the most important? As we've talked to payers and surveyed payers, the feedback that they have provided is that guidelines could be what really changes their willingness to place Jardiance in a preferred position onto formularies.","And then just as a final question, the performance of the insulin business particularly looks really challenged internationally. Can you talk in a little bit more detail about that trend and how you see that going forward? Thanks a lot.","Phil Johnson - Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.","Great, thanks, Seamus. Enrique, it's all yours.","Enrique A. Conterno - Senior Vice President and President, Lilly Diabetes","Very good, let me start with the last question on insulin overall. There is a trend that has not been discussed much. But one of the impacts that we see broadly when we look at the macro diabetes market is that insulin growth has basically slowed down. We see that, of course, for mealtime insulins. We believe that both ACOT2 growth and GLP-1 growth is partly the cause of that.","Now having said that, when we look at our own performance, we grew Humalog 6% in the U.S. and also 6% outside of the U.S., different regions with different growth, emerging markets of course much higher than that. When we look at our human insulin, Humulin, we were basically flat. We were at minus 1%. The U.S. did have positive growth, driven by the Humulin U-500. But we did have a decline in emerging markets as a result of no longer participating in the Brazil tender. So all in all, not big changes when it comes to our overall performance, but we do see a slowdown when it comes to the overall insulin market.","You asked about Basaglar. Clearly, this is a very important product for us. I'm pleased to report that so far our launches I think are going well. Uptake is very good, maybe slightly ahead of our expectations, whether it's Japan or Slovakia or the Czech Republic, which are the first three markets where we launched the product. When we look at our performance with Basaglar, we look at the entire basal market. We don't only look at Lantus. And in Japan, when we look at the entire basal analog market, we are now at 5.5% two months post-launch. So very pleased in particular with that performance in very important markets.","Now clearly, the settlement that we have with Sanofi gives us certainty, which we value very highly. What the settlement calls for is for us to \u2013 we won't be able to sell product until December 15, 2016. That means basically placing our product with a third party from a commercial perspective. But in the meantime, we can indeed contract, and we are of course submitting in order to be able to get final approval for this.","You asked specifically about the settlement. And yes, the settlement allows us to basically market and commercialize Basaglar in the KwikPen on a global basis. Just to remind you, the KwikPen is the product that we utilize for Humalog as well, and there is a royalty-bearing license specific to the U.S. when it comes to Basaglar sales in this particular device. At this point and time, we've settled, so that's water under the bridge, and we are now \u2013 have a certainty when it comes to the launch date, and we're preparing for that.","You asked about the guidelines and how important this would be and which bodies could issue guidelines. Of course, the American Diabetes Association is a key organization and is one that has issued these type of guidelines. AACE, A-A-C-E, which is comprised of endocrinologists, also issues guidelines. I'm not going to comment on the most important guidelines other than to say that we expect that a number of different bodies will be conducting some of these reviews. There's no question that a change in the guidelines would have a huge impact on the overall performance of Jardiance.","Phil Johnson - Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.","Great. Thank you, Enrique. Linda, if we can, go to the next caller, please.","Operator","Next we'll go to the line of Colin Bristow with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Colin N. Bristow - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks for taking the questions, and nice work on the quarter. So, in light of the breakthrough designation received for abemaciclib, could you just talk about the key points of differentiation in the clinical profile of this assets versus palbociclib? And any anticipated timing for the data readouts would helpful. And another question on the Basaglar: Could you just comment on the pricing relative to Lantus in the launch territories? And, acknowledging that it is early, are you seeing any switching from Lantus patients, or is this purely new patient acquisition? And then just lastly on your PCSK9, can you talk about potential points of differentiation versus the competition and when we would expect any updates on Phase 3 progression? Thanks.","Phil Johnson - Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.","Great, Colin. Thank you for the questions. So we'll go to Sue for the breakthrough designation question on abemaciclib differentiation versus the other marketed drug in the class and also timing for data readouts. Enrique with what we're seeing in terms of relative pricing to Lantus. And then, Dave and Jan, if you'll provide the answer on the PCSK9, that would be great. Sue?","Susan Mahony - Senior Vice President and President, Lilly Oncology","Yeah, sure. Clearly we're very excited to have our second breakthrough therapy designation now for abemaciclib. This designation was based on the Phase 1b cohort expansion that we presented at San Antonio Breast last year. And this showed single-agent activity, a robust response rate, acceptable safety profile, durability, so we have a Phase 2 study that's ongoing. We hope to replicate that data in that study, and we should hear next year and see data on that and hope to present that data at a scientific meeting next year. We also have, as you're aware, two Phase 3 studies in breast cancer ongoing. Again, we hope to have data readout on those in 2017, although we do have some interims. And we have a lung cancer study specifically in KRAS.","With regards to our CDK4 and CDK6 inhibitor, we do we believe we have a potential to have a best-in-class inhibitor. As I said, we have single-agent activity. We are also able to continuously dose this agent, which we believe is important given that the whole point of it is to inhibit the cell's cycle, so you'd want to continuously do that. So we believe that that could be an important differentiator for us. So we look forward to seeing the data and to seeing, as I say, the single-agent data next year and the Phase 3 data readouts after that.","Phil Johnson - Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.","Thank you, Sue. Enrique?","Enrique A. Conterno - Senior Vice President and President, Lilly Diabetes","So on Abasaglar or Basaglar, in the three countries where we've launched \u2013 and I'll briefly just highlight what our share is. When we look at the entire market, in Japan, as I mentioned, we are at 5.5%. In the Czech Republic, at 3%, and in Slovakia it's a small market but I bring it up because we are at 11%. We've also launched in Germany, the UK, Sweden, Poland, so we are really in full launch mode. I think it's fair to say that the dynamics when it comes to pricing, they vary from country to country. In some cases, there is a very formulaic path in terms of what's going to be the pricing that we will receive as a result of launching a biosimiliar. And that determines the pricing. Some cases we have discretion in terms of where we price. It is too early to basically say that \u2013 where are these patients coming from. It is likely that in Slovakia, some of these patients are switches, because the reimbursement level in Slovakia was lowered when we launched. And, in this particular case, patients that are on Lantus, my understanding is that they have to the pay the out-of-pocket on some of the difference relative to the Lantus price. We have to see this story evolve, but I think it's fair to say that so far we are pleased with our launch.","Phil Johnson - Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.","Great, thank you, Enrique. And, Dave, on the PCSK9?","David A. Ricks - Senior Vice President and President, Lilly Bio-Medicines","Yeah, I think we've talked about this on prior calls, so I'll be brief. We have our Phase 2 program complete. We believe there are key elements of differentiation for the molecule, but as we've evaluated our options as a company, we've said we're looking at our strategic options for further development of the product. We haven't completed that review, and so there's no real update on progression or other alternatives at this point.","Phil Johnson - Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.","Okay, great. Thank you, Dave.","Jan M. Lundberg - Executive Vice President, Science and Technology","Yeah, and the addition I can make then is this antibody has a longer durability of the LDL-lowering effect than compared to competitors.","Phil Johnson - Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.","Okay, thank you, Jan. Linda, if we can, go to the next caller, please.","Operator","Next we'll go to the line of Steve Scala with Cowen. Please go ahead.","Steve M. Scala - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you. Three questions. When in 2016 are the interim looks for abemaciclib's Phase 3 trials? Maybe you can narrow it down to a half, first half\/second half. Secondly, what is going on with peglispro and potential further studies? It seems as though we are on a path toward Lilly dropping the drug, but maybe you can tell us why that is not the case. And then, thirdly, on evacetrapib's ACCELERATE trial, what is the explanation for, in July, the study being deemed not futile, and in October the study stated to have no chance of success? Were the analyses done using different criteria, or did something bad happen in those three months? Thank you.","Phil Johnson - Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.","Thanks for the questions, Steve. So we'll start off with you, Sue, for the abemaciclib interim timing question, to you, Enrique, on the peglispro question, and then over to Dave on the evacetrapib question from Steve. So, Sue?","Susan Mahony - Senior Vice President and President, Lilly Oncology","Yeah, Steve, obviously these are all event-driven, so things can change. But as we look at the Phase 2 data, we'd anticipate that we'd get the interim data the first half of the year. And then for the Phase 3, probably the second half of the year.","Phil Johnson - Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.","Thank you, Sue. Enrique?","Enrique A. Conterno - Senior Vice President and President, Lilly Diabetes","Sure, so just to remind everyone, we had, of course, unprecedented efficacy when it comes to basal insulin peglispro, but we had some risks that we felt needed to be discharged with additional clinical trials prior to us being able to make a submission. What we have shared is that we're engaged in discussion with regulatory authorities, as well as our advisers. Those discussions are ongoing. We've had some of those discussions with both the FDA and EMEA and are still having some of the discussions with our advisers. So it is something that I cannot make a comment on right now.","Phil Johnson - Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.","Thanks, Enrique. Dave?","David A. Ricks - Senior Vice President and President, Lilly Bio-Medicines","Yeah, as it relates to evacetrapib and the ACCELERATE study and how we're monitoring that and the interim futility, as we said before, the study called for a single interim futility analysis. That was the instructions we gave the independent data monitoring committee. They conducted that analysis in July, and per their charter instructed us to continue the study as planned. We don't know what their analysis or conclusions were in July, other than what they instructed us to do. A few weeks prior to October, first week in October, they informed us they were planning to meet again, and then shortly thereafter they communicated a new recommendation, which was to stop the study for lack of drug effect. We then looked at their analysis, and we agreed with that conclusion.","If you're wondering if there was some big surprise between those dates, the data doesn't seem to indicate that. The independent data monitoring committee's job is to monitor the study on behalf of the patients for safety and making sure we're not subjecting people to study burden when it's unnecessary. It was their judgment to continue during those two periods, and we respect their judgment. And they need to keep the company blinded to their analysis, which they did very well in July. So that's really all we know, and as we look at the data now, we agree with their recommendation. So I think the positive thing is we did call for the interim look, and we got to that answer, albeit it a few months after we originally specified it.","Phil Johnson - Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.","Great. Thank you, Dave. Linda, if we can, go to the next caller, please?","Operator","Next we'll go to the line of Tony Butler with Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead.","Tony Butler - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Yes, thanks very much, two brief questions, one again to Sue. It's on ramucirumab, and the question really is around, much like Alimta, what has been the primary focus of sales today? Where are you getting traction? Does it continue to be in gastric? What's occurring in colorectal cancer?","And the second question is, silently, Lilly has put together a number of assets outside of TGF-beta in the immuno-oncology space, be it bispecifics, et cetera. I'd be interested if you, perhaps, Jan, could frame the overall strategy for what you think you're going to be doing in this space? Thanks very much.","Phil Johnson - Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.","Great, thank you, Tony, for the questions. Sue, we'll start off with you for the first question for sure, if you want to comment on the second as well. And then we'll go over to Jan for additional commentary.","Susan Mahony - Senior Vice President and President, Lilly Oncology","Sure. So, Tony, with regards to the Cyramza launch, as you know, we've now launched in gastric lung and colorectal in the U.S. and in gastric in Europe and in Japan. In the U.S., we're seeing a use actually in all areas, with gastric use in about 40% of patients actually are getting treated now with Cyramza in second-line and beyond. Opportunity we believe is to continue to grow that in the second line, but also we're getting third-line usage, and we want to move that up to the second line. We're seeing about 40% now of the patients that are treated in the U.S. with Cyramza being in lung cancer, in both squamous and in non-squamous. Clearly lung cancer is getting much more competitive in the second-line setting. We're continuing to see use and believe and hear that there is a good place for Cyramza in lung cancer going forward. And we are seeing some usage in colorectal cancer, although that isn't our focus. Our focus is on lung and gastric. We are seeing some uptake in the U.S., though, in colorectal cancer.","In Europe, we have launched in what we call the wave one countries, the ones that you get access to, and again in gastric cancer we're getting good feedback and good uptake there. We continue to work through a succession of launches in gastric cancer in Europe. And, in Japan, we launched the end of June and feel very good about the uptake in our first quarter in this market. It is a big opportunity and an unmet need in Japan; there are two to three times the incidence of gastric cancer there versus the U.S. And the feedback there so far is very good. Clearly, we have a succession of other hopeful approvals and launches in both lung and colorectal around the world to look forward to too.","Tony Butler - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Thank you, Sue.","Susan Mahony - Senior Vice President and President, Lilly Oncology","With regards to I-O, Jan, do you want to comment on...","Jan M. Lundberg - Executive Vice President, Science and Technology","It's a very exciting area. And I think the situation today is that it can still be improved. I think we have seen the beginning here with the response rates up to 20% or somewhat higher, but many patients don't really respond very well still. But what we are doing in this space is to combine our expertise in cell signaling and microenvironment, together with other companies' PD-1 axis agent. And there are numerous clinical trials ongoing, which actually you don't see on our pipeline chart, but I know Sue and others have been communicated from the oncology business unit. So I think it's very important to see also then other novel agents. How can they interact then with the checkpoint axis?","In relation to checkpoints, we're also very interested in our doing then bispecific antibodies, since there are several other checkpoints that haven't been tested yet, and having then the PD-1 as one anchor. And you have seen the recent communication around that. We're also \u2013 want to change the microenvironment with the oral agents, and TGF-beta is one of them, which is very interesting. Both potentially as a monotherapy, but also then in combination with PD-1s. We also want to test other microenvironment oral agents, which we have in the preclinical space. And, finally, it's not only important to activate these cells in the tumor, but you need to direct the T cells to the tumor, because if you don't have them there, checkpoint inhibitors are unlikely to respond. So we have new activities as we also have communicated with key partners such as Immunocore to actively direct T cells then to tumor-specific antigens, which I think represents also a new avenue in immuno-oncology treatments.","Phil Johnson - Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.","Great. Thank you, Jan. Linda, if we can, go to the next caller, please.","Operator","Next we'll go to the line of David Risinger with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks very much. So I have a number of questions. I guess first is on sola, please. So with respect to the DSMB looks at sola, do they assess futility, or is it impossible for the study to be halted early on futility?","The second question is with respect to the U.S. price slide, slide 13, I was just hoping that you could explain the few points in a little more detail. First how it's calculated, and then, second, since the negative impact of generics started at the beginning of the year, it wasn't quite clear why the year-to-date pricing is up 3% yet the third quarter pricing is down 4% for the U.S. business. I just didn't understand what the inflection was in the third quarter, when the negative impact from generics started to be felt quarters ago.","And then third, with respect to the BACE Phase 3 decision, it seems like you'll be rolling that into Phase 3, but if you could just discuss the variables and timing of that decision, that would be helpful. Thank you.","Phil Johnson - Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.","Great, Dave. Thank you for the questions. Dave Ricks, actually since you've got evacetrapib and BACE and also the product that had the dynamic with the shipping to authorized generics, if you want to take the lead on answering all three of them, then we can complement, that would be great.","David A. Ricks - Senior Vice President and President, Lilly Bio-Medicines","Okay, so let me start with the sola question.","Phil Johnson - Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.","Okay.","David A. Ricks - Senior Vice President and President, Lilly Bio-Medicines","Right, that was the first one? And make sure I hit all these, Phil, as we go through it.","Phil Johnson - Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.","Yes.","David A. Ricks - Senior Vice President and President, Lilly Bio-Medicines","Or David. So on sola, we have a more standard Data Safety Monitoring Board, like we do with many large studies. Their mission is really one of monitoring safety. We have, I think, communicated on prior calls, we have not chosen to go for an option to have an interim look specified by the company. And we would not instruct them to conduct such a review. I will say that Data Safety Monitoring Boards, as we set them up, they are independent. Their mission is to look at study data on behalf of the patients. And it's not unprecedented that they may call us and say, \"Well, we think you should stop the study.\" But we have not asked them to do that, and we're under no obligation to follow their recommendation.","Based on our observations from EXPEDITION-1 and EXPEDITION-2, and you would note that it took till about 40 weeks to see a drug effect, and based on the enrollment curve we have for this, we don't see a lot of value in looking at an interim look, because we enrolled the study very rapidly, and most of the benefit will come in the final months if the study behaves like EXPEDITION-1 and EXPEDITION-2. So unfortunately we will be waiting until late next year, the latest part of next year, before we have the answer. And I would expect the study to run until that time.","On U.S. pricing, you were correct to point out our year-to-date is 3%. I think that's more indicative of the underlying trend we see, which is list price gains, net of gross-to-net reductions for all the various mandated and commercial reasons. The one-time event in Q3, which Phil tried to answer earlier, was a shipment to our authorized generics partner. It's a large shipment. The way that deal is set up is we book revenue under the terms of that deal for the bulk product that they then distribute, creating another option for patients, a low-cost option for generic raloxifene. There's clearly demand for that in the market, and we're happy to supply Lilly-made raloxifene with our authorized generic partner. The way that deal is set you up, those shipments happen periodically. It just happened one occurred in Q3, and it was substantive enough to shift down the Q3 reported price below our ongoing trend. But I think the year-to-date numbers are more indicative of our trend.","I think your next question was on the BACE inhibitor and what would trigger that into Phase 3. We've previously communicated that as well with our partner AstraZeneca. We designed this as a Phase 2\/3 program. We're actively enrolling into the Phase 2 components. The primary objective of the first interim analysis, which we expect to happen in Q1 of 2016, will be a look at safety. BACE inhibitors, while very promising in terms of genetic validation and their pharmacokinetics and dynamics, many have gone down on off-target safety. And so this is a first look at sustained dosing in a reasonably large cohort of people with Alzheimer's. And that will then trigger expansion of that study and perhaps triggering another study and movement into the Phase 3 component of Lilly's pipeline and advancing to patients.","Was there another question?","David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you.","David A. Ricks - Senior Vice President and President, Lilly Bio-Medicines","Okay, great. Okay.","John C. Lechleiter - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well done.","Phil Johnson - Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.","Thanks, Dave. Linda, if we can, go to the next caller, please.","Operator","Next we'll go to the line of Andrew Baum with Citi. Please go ahead.","Andrew S. Baum - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","I have two questions. First, (1:20:50)","Phil Johnson - Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.","Hey, Andrew, we're having a hard time hearing you. I'm not sure if you can do anything on your end to improve...","Andrew S. Baum - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","Sorry about that. Is it any better?","Phil Johnson - Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.","Yes, it is.","Andrew S. Baum - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","Terrific. Number one, what was the baseline for the LDL within ACCELERATE? Apologies if you already disclosed it.","Second, I noted that you recently lost your fairly recently appointed head of immuno-oncology. In terms of replacements and how you're thinking about that, I would be interested.","And then finally, do you view our CSF1R monoclonal as competitive with others? In particular, does it block dimerization, and how relevant is that in terms of potential efficacy?","Phil Johnson - Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.","Andrew, thank you for the questions. At this point in time we have not disclosed \u2013 actually maybe we have, Dave. In the paper that was recently published, did we have the baseline?","David A. Ricks - Senior Vice President and President, Lilly Bio-Medicines","The benign paper, I do not believe we did. I think we have commented that the study designed for ACCELERATE to have people come in on a variety of statins that they may have already been on, on the maximum tolerated dose. I'll just qualitatively say that patients who entered the study had LDLs in line with guidelines, and they were really already on best standard-of-care statin. We further reduced LDL, as Phil mentioned, in the mid-30% on top of that. That's quite surprising to us and I'm sure the field, lack of MACE effect. We'll be disclosing more data about ACCELERATE, everything we've learned, and probably more data disclosures after that, sometime in 2016 in a major cardiovascular meeting.","Andrew S. Baum - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","Great, thanks, Dave. And then, Sue, on the question on I-O staffing and then the CSF1R molecule?","Susan Mahony - Senior Vice President and President, Lilly Oncology","Yes, you'll have to remind me on the CSF1R question. With regards to I-O staffing, we actually have a really, really good team of people in New York and in New Jersey who are focused on I-O. Michael Kalos heads our research group there. He came from UPenn. We've also recently brought in some I-O experience in the medical and the development area. And we have in our I-O hub that we announced in New York and New Jersey recently moved one of our very experienced drug developers from Lilly. So we feel very good about the expertise we've got there, and we're going to continue to build that internal expertise as well as through the partnerships. I think we announced over the last year nine different partnerships related to I-O. So our view is that we will use the external expertise and the internal expertise to continue to drive our I-O experience.","Phil Johnson - Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.","And then, Andrew, on your question for CSF1R, were you asking whether we're competitive with other agents and if we downregulate something that I did not catch it when you said it.","Andrew S. Baum - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","So my question was whether your monoclonal prevents dimerization of the two receptors, and to what extent is that an important competitive element versus other CSF1Rs in development?","Susan Mahony - Senior Vice President and President, Lilly Oncology","Jan, I don't know if you can comment on that. I can't comment on that. From a timing perspective, we have completed our Phase 1 dose study and now have a dose of CSF1R. We've just announced actually a collaboration with AstraZeneca to do a combination of their PDL1 with our CSF1R. So we think from a timing and from a development perspective, we're as competitive if not more competitive than other companies. The specifics around the dimerization, we're going to have get back to you on, okay?","Andrew S. Baum - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","That's okay. Thank you.","Phil Johnson - Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.","Thank you, Andrew. I think we have time for at least one more question, Linda, if you can go to the next caller, please.","Operator","Sure. Next we'll go to the line of Marc Goodman with UBS. Please go ahead.","Marc Goodman - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning. I was wondering if you could give us an update on the CGRP program. And I was curious your thoughts about oral therapy given that there was a trade there and a company actually acquired one and is considering moving forward with that. And then if you could, just give us a little bit more detail on the diabetes product that moved in the pipeline there, the URI. Thanks.","Phil Johnson - Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.","Thank you for the questions, Marc. So, Dave, if you can, comment on the CGPR update, and then, Dave and\/or Jan, on the oral approaches for modifying CGRP as well, and then to Enrique on the diabetes compound.","David A. Ricks - Senior Vice President and President, Lilly Bio-Medicines","Sure, yes. We're excited about our CGRP antibody for two different conditions we're studying or plan to study. First for cluster headache, we announced earlier in the year, we've proceeded into Phase 3, and those studies are enrolling as we speak for both chronic and episodic cluster. And then on migraine, we finished our Phase 2b study in the first half of the year, and actually read out the results in June. We saw robust reduction in headache days, et cetera, and we will be proceeding into Phase 3 imminently. We're excited about this program. We think we have a very competitive molecule in a largely underserved space.","In terms of the oral products, there has been a long history of researching and attempting to create an oral CGRP inhibitor. That's proved to be difficult, I think, for many of our competitors. We are in the list of people who also have our own program in this area. We don't have anything to say about that today. We observed the trade that happened and of course wish them all the luck in the world. But right now all the data, in terms of what looks like druggable CGRP inhibition, are antibodies. Those are the late-stage projects, and of course we have one of those.","Phil Johnson - Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.","Good. Thanks, Dave. Enrique?","Enrique A. Conterno - Senior Vice President and President, Lilly Diabetes","You are right that it's listed on the pipeline is the BioChaperone that we licensed from Adocia. So far, I think the program is progressing extremely well. We're very pleased with the results. And as we continue to get results, we'll be sharing them.","Phil Johnson - Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.","Great. Thank you, Enrique. Linda, let's try to squeeze in one more question, if we can, before John closes the call for us.","Operator","Sure, and there was only one more question, so perfect. It's from the line of Jeff Holford with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Jeffrey Holford - Jefferies LLC","Hi, thanks very much for squeezing me in. I know we're ahead of guidance in January. But previously, you have talked about this gross margin line and how there can be some reversal of the benefit we've had this year if we see FX going forward. So I wonder if, Derica, if you could just give us a little bit of a hint there. If we saw FX rates, the major rates, stay flat going forward into next year, just how we might think about that gross margin into next year, just so we don't get any big surprises early next year. Thank you.","Derica W. Rice - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Global Services","Okay. If you notice, on each of our quarterly calls, we provide the absolute gross margin, but then we also provide a slide in the packet where we illustrate what our gross margin would be without the effect of FX. And if you're trying to get a sense of what the underlying run rate is, our gross margins are really running in that mid-70% range. And so once all of the FX noise is cleared out, which we expect to exhaust that once we move into 2016, you should expect that we're going to be somewhere around that natural run rate of mid-70%.","Jeffrey Holford - Jefferies LLC","That's great, thanks very much.","Phil Johnson - Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.","Thanks, Derica. And I also like the fact the IR team doesn't have any homework assignments out of the call. So great, we got through the queue this time. John, if you'd like to, close the call for us, please.","John C. Lechleiter - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay, thanks Phil.

And as a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded.","I will turn the conference now over to your host, Mr. John Lechleiter, Chairman, President, and CEO. Please go ahead sir.","John Lechleiter","Good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us for the second time this week, today to discuss Eli Lilly & Company's first quarter 2014 earnings. I\u2019m John Lechleiter, Chairman, President, and CEO. This quarter and going forward we're taking a slightly different approach to our quarterly calls, we are bringing more of our senior leaders into the room to participate and to answer your questions and we hope that this enhances the quality of the information we are able to provide you during these sessions.","So joining me today are on the call are Derica Rice our Chief Financial Officer; Dr. Jan Lundberg, President of Lilly Research Laboratories; Sue Mahony President of Lilly Oncology; Enrique Conterno, President of Lilly Diabetes; Dave Ricks, President of Lilly Bio-Medicines; Jeff Simmons, President of Elanco Animal Health and Phil Johnson and Ilissa Rassner of Lilly Investor Relations team.","During this conference call as usual we anticipate making projections and forward looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors, including those listed on slide three and those outlined in our latest forms 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC. The information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It is not intended to be promotional and is not sufficient for prescribing decisions.","Before covering our first quarter 2014 results, I\u2019d like to share some high level observations. Lilly continues to make good progress in executing the strategy we laid out nearly five years ago to navigate through this period of unprecedented loss of the revenue and income precipitated by patent explorations for several of our largest products.","We have continued to invest in R&D and have successfully replenished our late stage pipeline. The first fruits of these efforts are manifest in the approval on Monday evening of Cyramza by the U.S. FDA. We have three other molecules currently under regulatory review with more to follow soon and we have the very real prospect of launching two additional NMEs empagliflozin and dulaglutide in major markets later this year.","We had focused our business in core therapeutic areas including diabetes, oncology, neuroscience and animal health. In oncology, our 2008 acquisition of ImClone is paying off, while in diabetes our global partnership with Boehringer Ingelheim will enable us to launch two potential best in class oral agents in a three year period. And you know about Elanco Animal Health soon to be the second largest enterprise of its kind following our acquisitions of Lohmann Animal Health and Novartis Animal Health.","Finally, we worked tirelessly and largely behind the scenes to reshape every aspect of our company to reduce costs, improve quality and productivity and to regain the customer focus that has been at the heart of Lilly's historic record of success.","Today, we are a more capable, more agile and more focused competitors than ever before. While we will never declare a victory, we are encouraged by our progress through this most difficult period and with every positive data read out and every regulatory filing, more and more confidence at this company is on a clear trajectory for success. All of this further [builds] our confidence that 2014 is indeed an inflection point for Lilly leading to a bright future.","Now with that framing, let me get into the meat of today's call by highlighting key events that have occurred since last quarter's call and it's certainly been an event till last three months what we believe shows great promise in the execution of our strategy.","On the regulatory front, the first quarter was another eventful period. In oncology, the FDA approved ramucirumab as a single-agent treatment for patients with advanced or metastatic gastric cancer with disease progression after prior chemotherapy. With this approval, ramucirumab becomes the first FDA approved treatment for patients in the study. This is an important milestone for patients with this difficult to treat disease. It is the third leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide. In coming weeks, we will make the product commercially available under the trade name Cyramza.","In diabetes, the FDA issued a complete response letter for empagliflozin. The letter cited the need to resolve previously observed deficiencies at the Boehringer Ingelheim facility where empagliflozin will be manufactured. The FDA did not ask for any new clinical trials to support the approval of the applications.","FDA has completed its inspection of this facility and Boehringer Ingelheim has provided its responses to the FDA\u2019s observation. At this time, we cannot comment on exactly when we will resubmit the empagliflozin NDA. However, we continue to expect FDA actions in 2014.","In late March, Europe CHMP issued a positive opinion recommending approval of empagliflozin as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes. Assuming the European Commission follows the CHMP recommendation and approves empagliflozin, we anticipate launch of the product in European countries beginning in the third quarter.","Meanwhile earlier this month, Australia became the first market to approve empagliflozin under the trade name Jardiance. We also announced that the NDA for the fixed dose combination of empagliflozin and linagliptin has been accepted for review by the FDA. We\u2019re optimistic that this first in class fixed dose combination of a DPP-4 inhibitor with an SGLT2 inhibitor could provide a valuable additional treatment option for patients with type 2 diabetes. Finally, the FDA issued a complete response letter for the NDA for Humalog U-200 KwikPen, a concentrated version of Humalog. We expect to resubmit the NDA before the end of the year.","In clinical news, we announced that the Phase III REVEL trial studying ramucirumab in second-line non-small cell lung cancer met its primary endpoint as patients treated with ramucirumab plus docetaxel experienced an improvement in overall survival compared to patients treated with placebo plus docetaxel.","We intend to submit the first application of these data to regulatory authorities in 2014 and will present the detailed data at ASCO later this year. This marks the third positive Phase III trial with ramucirumab. We are pleased with this continued progress which confirms the promise we saw on this molecule when we acquired ImClone.","At the AACR meeting earlier this month, we presented data from the Phase I trial of our CDK 4\/6 inhibitor bemaciclib. These data were from a cohort expansion in patients with advanced breast cancer and supported our decision to begin our Phase 3 program in breast cancer. You may have seen that the first Phase III trial has been posted on clinicaltrials.gov and will begin this summer. We are pleased with the single agent activity seen in this patient cohort as well as the product safety profile and believe we could have a best in class molecule.","Moving to diabetes, we announced that the AWARD-6 trial comparing once weekly dulaglutide 1.5 mg to once daily liraglutide 1.8 mg met its endpoint of non-inferiority in the reduction of HbA1c from baseline at 26 weeks. Dulaglutide is the only GLP-1 agonist to show non-inferiority against liraglutide highest approved dose in a Phase III study. We look forward to presenting the detailed data at ADA later this year. ","In business development news, earlier this week as I mentioned earlier we announced an agreement to acquire Novartis Animal Health for approximately $5.4 billion. We\u2019re excited to combine two premier and complementary animal health companies, which will create a new top tier global animal health player, one that will continue to lead in innovation and customer value. We expect the acquisition to close by the end of the first quarter of next year. As you will recall, we also announced in February an agreement to acquire Lohmann Animal Health, a privately-held German company that is a global leader in poultry vaccines. This acquisition expected to close this quarter; we\u2019ll establish Elanco as a global poultry leader and solidify Elanco\u2019s vaccine presence and manufacturing capabilities.","In other news, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana ruled in Lilly\u2019s favor upholding the U.S. Vitamin Dosage Regimen Patent for Alimta, which expires in May 2022.","The German Court also ruled in Lilly\u2019s favor confirming that Alimta\u2019s European vitamin dosage regimen patent would be infringed by the contemplated entry of Actavis\u2019 generic pemetrexed dipotassium product in Germany prior to June 2021. We\u2019re pleased with these rulings and are confident that these patents are valid and enforceable. Also in the news the Sanofi filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the district of Delaware alleging that our new insulin glargine product for which we are seeking FDA approval infringes certain of their patents.","We do not believe that the application for approval of our new insulin glargine product infringes any valid claim of the asserted patents. On March 2nd, U.S. patent protection for Evista expire. After a short delay, generic raloxifene is now on the market. And we\u2019ve entered into an agreement with Prasco to sell and authorized generic raloxifene.","In an act those product liability case in Louisiana, a jury found in favor of the plaintiffs, awarding compensatory damages and significant punitive damages. Lilly disagrees with the verdict and intends to vigorously challenge this outcome. The agreement between Lilly and Takeda calls for Takeda to defend and indemnify Lilly for losses and expenses with respect to the U.S. litigation. After the verdict was entered in this case, Takeda notified Lilly that it was reserving its right to challenge its obligations to defend and indemnify Lilly with respect to the Allen case only. Lilly believes it is entitled to full defense and indemnification of its losses and expenses related to Allen and in all other U.S. cases.","Finally, during the first quarter we executed share repurchases totaling $55 million under our $5 billion share repurchase program. We now have $4.4 billion remaining in the program, which we expect to complete over a multi-year period.","And now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Phil for a discussion of our financial performance for the quarter.","Phil Johnson","Great. Thanks John. First, I'll review our GAAP results and then discuss a few non-GAAP measures to provide some additional insight into the underlying trends in our business.","On slide 7, you can see that revenue in Q1, 2014 was $4.7 billion, $0.16 below Q1, 2013. This decline reflects a full quarter effect of the Cymbalta U.S. patent expiration as well as the initial effect of the Evista U.S. patent expiration.","Excluding Cymbalta and Evista in the U.S the rest of our worldwide revenue grew 1%. It is also worth noting that wholesaler purchasing patterns substantially dampen the U.S. revenue growth in the first quarter. Excluding this effect of rest of our worldwide revenue would have grown 4%.","Gross margin as a percent of revenue decreased 5.4 percentage points driven largely by the loss of Cymbalta\u2019s U.S. exclusivity and to a lesser extent of a loss of Evista U.S. exclusivity as well as by the impact of foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold. This quarter foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold had a negative effect on gross margin. However in Q1, 2013 foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold provided a benefit to our gross margin.","Excluding this FX effect from both 2013 and 2014, gross margin as a percent of revenue declined from 79.1% in Q1 2013 to 75.8% in Q1, 2014. As in past quarters, we've included a supplementary slide providing our gross margin percent for the last 10 quarters, with and without this FX effect.","Non-GAAP measures are shown on slide 8. Total operating expense defined as the sum of R&D and SG&A decreased more than $400 million or 14% versus Q1 of 2013. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses were down 10%, our R&D was down 18%. The reduction in marketing, selling and administrative expenses was due to our ongoing cost containment efforts and the reduction in the U.S. sales in marketing activities for Cymbalta and Evista. The decline in R&D expenses was driven by milestones payments and an asset termination charge in Q1, 2013 that did not recur this quarter as well as by lower clinical development costs.","Other income and expense was net income of $56 million in Q1, 2014 compared with net income of $34 million in the first quarter of 2013. This difference was driven both by lower net interest expense and by higher other miscellaneous income.","Our non-GAAP tax rate was 18.7% an increase of 3.2 percentage points compared to the same quarter last year. There are number of pushes and polls driving this change. Recall that our non-GAAP tax rate in Q1 last year was substantially reduced by the recognition of the full year 2012 R&D tax credit.","In addition our tax rate in Q1 this year is higher as no legislative action was taken in the quarter on the R&D tax credit up for extension. Finally in Q1 this year we recorded a discreet tax benefit and approximately $30 million which lowered our non-GAAP tax rate by 3.3 percentage points.","At the bottom line, net income declined 40% and earnings per share declined 39%. While this is a significant decline, it is consistent with our expectations and places us on track to achieve our full year guidance.","Slide 9, provides a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS and this reconciliation reflects the charge of $31 million pretax equivalent to $0.02 of EPS that was incurred in Q1, 2014 as a result of restructurings reduced the company\u2019s costs. Additional details about our reported earnings are available in today\u2019s earnings press release.","Many of you have noted that nearly all our peers exclude amortization of intangibles from their non-GAAP results while we include this expense. For your modeling purposes and as you will see in our 10-Q we recognized amortization expense of $132 million representing nearly 3% of revenue this quarter.","Moving to slide 10, you can see the total revenue decline of 16% in Q1 2014 shown in the yellow box in the middle of the page was driven by a negative volume impact of 8% and negative price impact of 6% and a negative foreign exchange impact of 2%. By geography you will notice that U.S. volume decreased 26%, this was largely due to the loss of exclusivity for Cymbalta U.S. volume did benefit this quarter from shipments of our authorized generic Evista.","Excluding Cymbalta and Evista, volume on the rest of our U.S. from our products was down 6% this quarter. Excluding the effect of wholesaler buying patterns I mentioned earlier volume on these products increased 2% in Q1.","Revenue in Australia, Canada and Europe or ACE was essentially flat while in Japan volume growth was particularly strong up 37% driven primarily by Zyprexa, Forteo, Cymbalta, Strattera, Tradjenta and Alimta. An increase in the consumption tax that went into effect on April 1st contributed to higher customer purchases.","Our best estimate is that this added roughly $70 million or 15 percentage points of growth to our Q1 revenue in Japan. You can also see that the weaker yen trimmed revenue growth by 17%. At current foreign exchange rates this negative FX effect is expected to be much lower for the remainder of the year.","In emerging markets, we saw strong performance growth of 15% partially offset by a 6% negative impact from foreign exchange. Volume growth was robust to 13% driven by Cialis, Humulin, Humalog, Vancocin, Tradjenta and Cymbalta. Volume growth in Brazil benefited from a Humulin tender while volume in China grew 15%.","Elanco Animal Health delivered revenue growth of 6% and excluding FX, Elanco grew 7%. This performance growth was driven by higher prices for both companion and food animal products as well as by volume growth for food animal products. This was partially offset by a volume decline for companion animal products.","Now, let me turn the call over to Derica.","Derica Rice","Thanks Phil. Slide 11, shows the effective changes in foreign exchange rates on our 2014 results. Now, at a high level, FX had a modest negative effect on our underlying foreign currency dominated revenue and costs. However, this quarter the effect FX on our cost of goods sold also had a negative effect on our results.","In the first rows of numbers you will see the FX negatively affected worldwide revenue growth by two percentage points as Phil mentioned earlier. In the second row, you can see that FX caused cost of sales to increase by 7 percentage points. Driven by the strengthening of the euro, in Q1 this effect this year, the effect of FX on international inventories sold led to a substantial additional cost being booked to cost of goods sold, while last year it led to a modest reduction in cost of goods sold. As a result, excluding FX, cost of goods sold actually decreased 1%.","So as you can see in the last two rows, why our operating income and earnings per share declined substantially due to the patent expiration of Cymbalta in the U.S., foreign exchange further reduced operating income and EPS growth by double-digit.","Slide 12, shows our pipeline as of April 21. Changes since our last earnings call are highlighted with green arrows showing progression and red arrows showing attrition. Now as John mentioned earlier, we received approval of ramucirumab for the treatment of advanced gastric cancer as a single agent after prior chemotherapy.","In addition, we began Phase II testing of a biologic for anemia and we began Phase I testing on a small molecule for cardiovascular disease. And we terminated the development of four assets, two in Phase II and two in Phase I. As John also indicated with a number of encouraging data readouts in 2013, 8 assets in Phase III, 3 assets under regulatory review and 1 just recently approved and more Phase III data readouts, regulatory submissions and product approvals possible this year, we are confident in our ability to return to growth post 2014.","Next, let me remind you of our key events for 2014 and review our updated 2014 financial guidance. In the first three and half months of this year, we\u2019re pleased with the progress we\u2019ve made on key events we highlighted on our 2014 guidance call.","While I would not go through each item on slide 13, we\u2019re excited about the opportunities to continue to advance our pipeline and to share data that will not only help investors better judge our growth potential, but also convey why we view this year as a new beginning in the next phase of Lilly\u2019s rich history.","We expect to begin Phase III studies for two assets, bemaciclib, our CDK 4\/6 inhibitor for cancer and our anti-sclerostin antibody for osteoporosis. As John mentioned, the first Phase III trial of bemaciclib was recently focused to ct.gov and will begin this summer.","With respect to Phase III data, we expect to report top-line results this with detailed data presentation next year for four NMEs and one additional indication for ramucirumab. In January, we disclosed detailed data of the RAINBOW trial for ramucirumab as combination therapy in second line gastric cancer. And we anticipate detailed data disclosures yet this year for dulaglutide; our new insulin glargine product necitumumab and ramucirumab and in non-small cell lung cancer and possibly in liver cancer. We have also submitted the fixed dose combination of empagliflozin and linagliptin for the regulatory view in the U.S. and could have multiple additional regulatory submissions this year across our diabetes and oncology portfolio.","Importantly, we\u2019ve seen positive regulatory action on Cyramza as monotherapy for second line gastric cancer. And we expect to receive European approval for empagliflozin later this quarter, following the CHMP\u2019s positive recommendation for approval in late March.","Till this year, we could have regulatory action on empagliflozin here in the U.S., on dulaglutide and on our new insulin glargine product, although launch timing will be gated by expiration of Lantus\u2019 patent protection and in the case of the U.S. by ongoing litigation.","In other key events for 2014, we are pleased with the Alimta patent rulings granted in our favor in both the U.S. and Germany. And we could receive the ruling this quarter from the recently concluded trials in the UK.","And we lost patent protection for Evista in the U.S. in March and data package exclusivity for Cymbalta will expire in Europe in the second half of this year. Although, we do not expect generic duloxetine to enter the European market until 2015. Clearly, we have a lot going on in 2014 and we\u2019re off to a great start.","Now turning to our 2014 financial guidance. When we announced the acquisition of Lohmann Animal Health, we lowered our 2014 EPS guidance range to reflect solutions from the deal due to business combination accounting and transaction cost. That non-GAAP EPS range remains unchanged, and our updates are to specific line items primarily to reflect the impact of the Lohmann acquisition as well as movements in FX and the Q1 discreet tax benefits.","On FX, the main change is in the strengthening of euro, although a number of other smaller currencies have weakened. In aggregate, these changes modestly benefit revenue, but due to the euro, more substantially add to the cost of goods sold. Our revenue guidance is now a range of $19.4 billion to $20 billion, this increase of $200 million reflects estimated revenue from the Lohmann acquisition as well as the benefit of FX.","Gross margin as a percent of revenue is now anticipated to be approximately 73%, down 1 percentage point from our prior guidance. Again this reflects the Lohmann acquisition including the anticipated inventory step up and the negative effect of the stronger euro. We\u2019ve raised our SG&A guidance by $100 million to a range of $6.3 billion to $6.6 billion, again to reflect the Lohmann acquisition.","Our R&D guidance remains unchanged at $4.4 billion to $4.7 billion and other income is still expected to be in the range of $100 million to $200 million. To reflect the discreet tax benefit booked in Q1, we\u2019ve lowered our full year tax rate by 1 percentage point to approximately 19%, which still assumes extension of the R&D tax credit in 2014.","In terms of net income, to reflect the dilution from the Lohmann acquisition, we now expect net income to be at least $2.9 billion. At the bottom-line, EPS on a reported basis reflects the Q1 charge of $0.02. Our EPS guidance is now $2.70 to $2.78 on a GAAP basis and remains $2.72 to $2.80 on a non-GAAP basis.","Finally, we continue to expect operating cash flow to be at least $4 billion and capital expenditures to be approximately $1.3 billion. Slide 15 provides a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS for 2013 and the associated growth rates from these numbers to our 2014 guidance.","Now, I will turn the call back over to John.","John Lechleiter","","Thanks Derica. Before we take your questions, let me briefly sum up. We describe this moment as a pivotal point for Lilly and it\u2019s literally that. Even as we feel the maximum impact of our patent expirations, FDA approval of Cyramza along with the CHMP\u2019s positive opinion on empagliflozin are significant milestones as we move beyond this period to a path of renewed growth. Our recent announcements to acquire Lohmann Animal Health and Novartis Animal Health position us for continued growth in the attractive animal health business.","For the past five years, we have been candid with you about our challenges and our plans for overcoming them and we\u2019ve delivered what we said we would. We said our first priority was to continue to advance our pipeline. And over the course of 2014, we will continue to generate and disseminate data on a number of Phase 3 molecules.","We expect to make a number of regulatory submissions of potential new medicines and we expect to launch multiple products, starting later this quarter with Cyramza. We said we would offset some of our revenue loss by driving revenue growth across a broad range of products, geographies and businesses.","Three of our so called growth engines performed very well in this quarter. Japan grew 16%, China grew 21% and Elanco Animal Health grew 6% despite the negative impact on companion animal health of a colder than normal winter. We said we would increase productivity and reduce operating expenses significantly and operating expenses in the quarter were down 14% versus the first quarter of last year.","Overall, our first quarter financial results put us on track to meet our 2014 guidance. Our solid financial performance will enable us to continue to invest in our pipeline including our new product launches to pay the dividend at least at its current level to recapitalize our physical asset base to reinvest in our business through opportunistic business development and to return excess cash to shareholders through our share repurchase program. We remain confident in our strategy and in our ability to execute it.","And now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Phil for the Q&A session. Thank you.","Phil Johnson","Thank you John. If I could ask John the operator who is helping us with the call today to provide the instructions to the callers for the Q&A session and then we\u2019ll get started with the first caller.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","Certainly. (Operator Instructions). And the first go line of Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Chris Schott - JPMorgan","Great. Thanks very much for the questions and appreciate you guys putting the whole management team on the call here. My first question was for John, we\u2019ve seen a trend of increased focus and specialization occurring across the pharma group here, I guess more recently we\u2019ve seen companies actually taking actions to look at our strategic alternatives for non-core or sub-scale businesses, obviously you\u2019ve been require some aspects of these decisions, but more broadly, you [celebrate] your thoughts on these trends and would Lilly look to further narrow its focus and potentially divest assets.","My second question was on the CDK4\/6 program, if you elaborate a little bit more on the Phase III program here, I guess would you be looking at adjuvant in addition to the advanced breast cancer market? Second and can you just elaborate what\u2019s the earliest duty of this product to market? I am just trying to understand how quickly you can enroll a study is there interims just realistically when we think about this program being at position that you could file? Thanks very much.","Phil Johnson","","Chris thank you for the questions. We\u2019ll have John to take your first one obviously and then Sue, if you want to comment on the second piece I can help if necessary. John?","John Lechleiter","","Chris thanks for your question, I think that judging from events of the last week, if they combine to make a trend, I think you are, as I think I said in the Wall Street Journal earlier this week, you are seeing companies build on their strength, add to existing areas of strength and get rid of assets that where they believe they might be a subscale. Animal health realistically is one of a few opportunities we have to diversify in a meaningful way in a business that we believe still has very strong synergies back to our pharma business, I mean when we look at research, we share common footprint for research, we share a good number of manufacturing capabilities and assets and a global infrastructure that I think enables Elanco to be successful and we\u2019ll continue to enable Elanco to be successful.","I can\u2019t comment specifically about whether, we would look to shed other assets. I think from -- we're pretty -- we don\u2019t have that many sort of extra assets or businesses and OTC business for example or our vaccines business or what have you. But I think it's pretty clear that we're going to continue to focus a lot on diabetes and oncology and animal health. I think our bio-medicines portfolio gives us some options. We are going to know by the end of the year, will we be able to establish an autoimmune portfolio with 3 Phase III data readouts.","We have a big bet still when you look at Alzheimer's with sola in EXPEDITION III trial ongoing now and enrolling. And then as we have said last call, we've completed [enrollment] evacetrapib which I think could be a very significant product in the cardiovascular space.","So, I think we're guided more by where can we build on a solid footprint and on in the area where we have greater opportunity with the assets we have. And the idea of divesting assets would sort of only follow from that go forward kind of thinking, if that makes sense.","Phil Johnson","Great, thank you John. And Sue on the CDK4\/6 inhibitor.","Sue Mahony","Yes, let me try and address the question on CDK4\/6 inhibitor bemaciclib. We presented the breast cancer cohort data AACRBT and we have announced that we will be starting Phase III studies this year. In fact, if you look at ct.gov we have on that the Phase III study with (inaudible) in metastatic breast cancer. In addition, to that we have a Phase II single-agent study. We are excited by our single-agent activity that we saw in our breast cancer cohort. So we are initiating a confirmatory Phase II study there.","With regards to other life cycle planning and timing of approvals of which I can't speculate on those at this point time, I would just say that we are going to continue to progress this molecule as we do as a safety, as we are excited by the single-agent activity and dosing and safety profile that we've seen so far.","We also will be presenting our long cohort at ASCO this year and look forward to sharing more data on that.","Phil Johnson","Thank you, Sue. John, if we have the next caller please.","Operator","We and that\u2019s Tim Anderson with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Tim Anderso - Sanford Bernstein","Thank you. If I could just maybe finish out with a question on the CDK and that lung data coming up. Can you just directionally give us some idea of your level of excitement with that drug in the lung indication and assuming that the data shows some degree of positivity just that kind of the development plan forward?","And then my other question is on your animal health business from Novartis, can you give us an idea of what you think that dilution will be to 2015 earnings on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. And you are talking remedying the manufacturing problems that division has had, so operating margin that Novartis disclose, I think was basically breakeven so it\u2019s not profitable. It seems to me that the minute you kind of transport this products into some other manufacturing facility, you have an immediate margins bump up, am I thinking about that correctly and what would be the timeframe for that?","Phil Johnson","Great. Tim thank you for your questions. So we will Sue answer the CDK 4\/6, Derica if you would ahead and take the question on the impact for 2015 non-GAAP earnings. And then Jeff if you like to talk about the goals we have for getting profits backup overtime that would be great? Sue?","Sue Mahony","Sure. With the (inaudible) data we presented last year at ASCO the Phase 1 study and we have done a number of cohort expansion since then. As I said, we presented the breast cancer expansion data at AAC, we will be presenting the lung cancer expansion data ASCO, until we present that clearly, I can't comment on that data, against just to say that we are continuing to look at opportunities to progress this molecule and we will be updating you as we get new data.","Phil Johnson","","Thank you, Sue. Derica?","Derica Rice","Sure. Tim this is Derica. I can\u2019t comment or I am not able to comment as to what the dilutive effect would be in 2015 at this stage, obviously it\u2019s going to be predicated on when we actually close the transaction and right now we are still projected to close by no later than the end of Q1. What we have said is that if we assume a January 1, 2015 close we would expect that this deal would be accretive on a cash basis by 2016 and should begin to return to historical levels of margins that you have seen on Lilly\u2019s animal health business no later than 2018 our three years post closing.","Jeff Simmons","","Yes, yes. So, I will follow up on that. First of all I want to emphasize that the manufacturing problems were as you know in Lincoln, Nebraska they were human health related, this is a big part of our diligence. The transfers have already started to take place on the animal health side. We are very confident as we look at the second half of 2013 in Novartis Animal Health, the trajectory that they are on. They came in to these problems in a top-tier growth 6% to 8% is in animal health business. And we believe when we combine what we have seen in their history and their trajectory in the late part of last year and the transfers that are in place that we can get to exactly where Derica mentioned, two to three years out we can get back to that mid 20s EBIT percentage and we have definitely spent a lot of time and the diligence looking at this transfer and transition in this business. So this was a big part of our assessment of the value. I am limited on more details than that at this stage.","Phil Johnson","","Thank you. John if we could have our next caller please.","Operator","","And we will go to Mark Schoenebaum with ISI Group. Please go ahead.","Phil Johnson","","Hey Mark we can\u2019t hear you?","Mark Schoenebaum - ISI Group","","I am sorry guys, sorry about that, can you hear me now?","Phil Johnson","","Yes we can.","Mark Schoenebaum - ISI Group","","Okay. So I would just like to come back to the CD 4K if possible, couple of questions. Congratulations on the data; looked really good. I am just wondering in the Phase III program, you\u2019re using IB (inaudible) I am just wondering why the choice to combine the PET drug as opposed to letrozole which was obviously Pfizer\u2019s choice. And also wondering on the differentiated neutropenia profile that you\u2019ve seen for your drug, if you have any explanation, so that Pfizer has made some comments in the public domain that your compound made buy into different targets than theirs et cetera. I am just wondering if you might be willing to offer a mechanistic rational? And then finally on use of capital, given the Animal Health acquisition recently, earlier this week, should we as investors and analysts view you at least over the next year or so as reasonably be balance sheet constraint such that we should not have expectations that you could do a deal of similar size on the human health side? Thank you.","Phil Johnson","Great. Mark, thanks for your questions. We\u2019ll go ahead and have Sue take the CDK 4\/6 questions obviously and then Derica on the business development going forward. Sue?","Sue Mahony","Sure. The Phase III study that we have currently on clinicaltrials.gov, as you said is bemaciclib in combination (inaudible) in metastatic breast cancer and that includes both first and second line patients, we also I said have the single agent Phase II. We\u2019re going to continue to look at other areas with regards to (inaudible) is one of the obvious combinations of that.","With regards to the mechanism of action, we know that bemaciclib is selected to CDK 4 and 6. We can\u2019t comment on why we\u2019re seeing this different levels in neutropenia other than we are seeing a different safety profile. And we as I said, we are able to do continuous dosing with this agent, we have single agent activity with this agent and we have a different safety profile with lower levels of neutropenia other than to say that we have, we selected CDK 4 and 6 I can\u2019t comment on whether there is a specific mechanism of action here.","Phil Johnson","Derica?","Derica Rice","Mark, this is Derica. As we stated on our animal health investor call earlier this week, the March animal health transaction does not change or materially affect our ongoing capital allocation strategy, we still believe we have the capacity to sustain our dividend at least at this current level, and we're still in a position going forward to consider future dividend increases, this does not affect our outlook in terms of our ability to complete our share repurchase program, we're still committed to the 5 billion.","And as it relates to business development, we still have the capacity to pursue the types of deals that you\u2019ve seen from Lilly historically. We\u2019ve never been adding the space of mega mergers, but if you look at our history, the largest deal we\u2019ve done is ImClone, now the second largest deal is to be the Novartis Animal Health and after that was ICOS for about 2.5 billion. So within that space we absolutely have the capacity to pursue those types of opportunities.","Phil Johnson","","Mark one thing I might add on the CDK 4\/6 neutropenia, it certainly could be that Pfizer condition the market to believe that this mechanism would be causing neutropenia full stop and so those were linked. There was data we presented at AACR to show that those patients that received 30% or greater reduction in tumor size, a significant proportion of those did not have neutropenia.","So I think we may need to rethink a little bit what is actually causing the anti-tumor response and what maybe causing neutropenia. John, if we have next callers please.","Operator","And that\u2019s Steve Scala with Cowen. Please go ahead.","Steve Scala - Cowen","Thank you. Regarding the 2015 outlook, assuming a January 1, 2015 close of Novartis animal health, does Lilly view consensus of 317 as reasonable at this early stage. And if you are not willing to comment, should we conclude you are not comfortable? The second question is on your novel basal insulin. Based on the data that you now have in-house, are you fully confident that you have a differentiated molecule versus Lantus? And then the third question on dulaglutide, you achieved non-inferiority to Victoza in Award-6. But as the numerical trend was worse on some end point, how will you overcome that obstacle in the marketplace? Thank you.","Phil Johnson","Steve, thank you for the questions. Derica, if you will take the first one of 2015 guidance relative to street\u2019s expectations that they have currently and then Enrique for the two diabetes question.","Derica Rice","Hi, Steve, I like the phrasing of your initial question. But let me try to clarify, I\u2019m not able to comment on specific 2015 guidance at this time. And it has nothing to do with our level of comfort or discomfort, it just means that we're not in a position to provide guidance and we typically haven't at the stage of the game. What we have said is that we do expect that in 2015 that we expect to return the growth and margin expansion and obviously that was prior to the impact or the contemplation of the acquisition of Novartis Animal Health.","Phil Johnson","Great. Enrique?","Enrique Conterno","Steve, we have I think very consistently said that when it comes to our innovative basal insulin, we would only see us launching that if we truly can differentiate against Lantus. Now all of our trials are basically against Lantus, we have a number of measures that we are looking at, we have talked about glycemic control, we have talked about nocturnal hypoglycemia, a better weight profile and also lower use of the meal time insulin dose with a product as some indications that we basically saw in Phase II. Clearly, we also saw some signals when it comes to side effects.","At this point in time, I'm just going to ask for all of us to wait, we believe that we should be in a position to issue a top line press release this quarter. On dulaglutide, I really cannot comment more than what we basically have said, as part of the press release, we are pleased with the results of Award-6, we will have to wait for the detailed disclosure of the data. At this stage we believe we have a very competitive product and we are very bullish on it.","Phil Johnson","Thanks Enrique. John, if we could have the next caller please.","Operator","And we will go to John Boris with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please go ahead.","John Boris - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Thanks for taking the questions. First question, John you had mentioned about the improved customer focus; can we maybe hear from your business leaders about that customer focus, especially since this changed pretty significantly over the last decade to the payers and the push back impairs on pricing, but in particular oncology and diabetes, how well prepared you are to secure formulary access for your assets, if you are going forward? And then quick question on the CDK 4\/6, have you applied for breakthrough designation on the compound, if you haven\u2019t, what is the hold up for applying (inaudible). Thanks?","Phil Johnson","Great. John, thank you for the questions, we will go ahead and hit the commercial folks for our pharma business. So, we\u2019ll start with Dave Ricks and then will return to Enrique and then since Sue can comment on oncology part of your first question and then also CDK 4\/6, we\u2019ll finish with Sue. Dave?","Dave Ricks","Thanks for the question. As John Lechleiter mentioned in his comments, we have taken the opportunity over the last four years as we restructured our company to really improve our capabilities to go to market, this includes significant investments in our payer capabilities, already Enrique in particular commented on that as we prepare for the diabetes launches. But we feel good about both U.S. and non U.S. investments we have made to represent not only the major payers but key accounts at all stages in the healthcare system. We have also substantially restructured our sales force not just to be stronger and leaner but I think go to market in a pretty different way. We\u2019re not going to go into the details of that for competitive reasons here but I think we overall feel good about our ability to commercialize the future pipeline. I would also comment that Lilly continues to investment in our direct to consumer and direct to patient capabilities globally which of course includes the DTC in the U.S. but also other direct patients contact initiatives and patient support outside the U.S. So overall, I think we are in good shape competitively here. Enrique, do you want to add to that?","Enrique Conterno","","Sure. When it comes to diabetes, I think all of us know the payer environment is very complex, it\u2019s challenging, both coming from the decision that payers are making as well as competition that we have. From our perspective, we believe and we continue to believe that choice continues to be extremely important. Now, we clearly see that sometimes this is not an option that we have and in those cases, we do compete for preferential access, in particular when it comes to portfolio which is what we are marketing now.","As we make the decisions, we do look at both financial and strategic considerations in terms of how competitive we are going to be with the different accounts. I would mention that in the case of Tradjenta, the engagement with the payers is done through BI.","Phil Johnson","Sue?","Sue Mahony","Yes. And with regards to oncology, clearly from a sales force perspective, we have a very experienced sales force globally in oncology. With payers, again focus is very in ensuring that we are bringing value to those patients in continuing to bring medicines that offer value to patient pays and physicians. We also really clear that we need to ensure that we continue to get value for continuous innovation which is the foundation of oncology development. With regards to our CDK4\/6 inhibitor we are focused here is to ensure that we get this medicine to patient as quickly as possible and we will continue to work with the FDA and other regulatory authorities to enable that.","Phil Johnson","Great. Thank you John. Next caller please.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go to Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs","Thank you. This is really a question for Sue. Just in the spirit of the industry specializing and getting more focused. In the area of oncology Lilly is conspicuously absent in immuno-oncology is that an issue without immune-oncology agents, can you still be competitive in this arena? And then secondly are you planning to develop studies combining your CDK inhibitor with immuno-oncology or rather ramu or the other TGF inhibitor, could you combine that, is that part of the game plan? But just really can you be competitive in oncology given sort of where the paradigm is changing? Thanks.","Phil Johnson","Thanks Jami. Sue?","Sue Mahony","Thank you Jami. It\u2019s a great question. Clearly there is a lot of interest and excitement about immuno-oncology and I think it\u2019s been very clear that we think new data some tumors, particularly melanoma in others. We don\u2019t have a PD1 and PDL-1 inhibitor. We do have a number of molecules in our pipeline though that do work on the immune system. The TGF beta pathway is important in immune defects in a number of tumor types and we have both large molecule and small molecule inhibitors to TGF-beta. We also have other molecules in our pipeline in earlier phase including our CXCL-4 antibodies, F1 receptor antibody and our P38 small molecule inhibitor as well as research efforts focused on it. So no, we don\u2019t believe that we're absent in immune-oncology at all, clearly we are excited at this point in time by the fact that over the last 18 months also we would have four positive Phase III studies, I\u2019m sure an overall survival improvement in lung cancer, in gastric cancer.","And so with very much focus on ensuring that we get those medicines to patients as soon as possible. And yes we do believe that combination both of target agents chemotherapy and immunotherapy is going to be the future in oncology and we're very much focused on that.","Phil Johnson","","Great. Thank you, Sue. Jan, you want to comment as well?","Dr. Jan Lundberg","Yes I can also add that we have seen I think the emergence of a new area where a lot needs to be done still and there are a number of additional targets at the preclinical space that is being explored, but that will come to the clinic in due course. So I think we are serious about this and we have also done some key recruitments recently and are strengthening this area, where we can actually then apply our core drugs hunting skills immediately then to novel targets.","Phil Johnson","","Thank you Jan. John if we can have the next caller please.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go to David Risinger with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","David Risinger - Morgan Stanley","Yes, thanks very much. I was hoping that you could just explain in some detail how you calculate the -- sorry, I had an incoming call, my apologies. If you could just explain your calculation of U.S. net price, so obviously Cymbalta had a significant negative impact on that calculation. But I just wanted to better understand how you run the calculation whether it\u2019s the step down in U.S. net price in the first quarter or your full buck of business was solely driven by Cymbalta or whether the diabetes franchise is experiencing price declines? And how you go about calculating it, maybe you assume, I don't know the authorize generic price for Cymbalta or something and that drives that calculation down dramatically?","And then separately, with respect to ASCO, just wondering, if you are what's your planning on in terms of investor events or specific investor discussions at that event? Thank you very much.","Phil Johnson","Great, thanks for the questions Dave. While Derica respond to your first question and then Sue on your question regarding ASCO. Derica?","Derica Rice","Hi, Dave. In regards to our U.S. net price calculation, it is really comprised of three elements, one is obviously any going rebate that we provide relative to the prior period. Secondly, here in the near term it does include the impact of the authorized generic which would be at a lower net price. And the third would be any adjustments we made to our growth to net accruals as we reconcile to any receipts that we're receiving from the government.","As it relates to the rebate, the first point I started, we did see in the quarter, obviously the impact of the ESI contract in the U.S. where we know in our diabetes business where we did see price deflation rather than price growth on a net basis.","So, those are three elements that are driving the price effect that you are seeing in our Q1 results in the U.S.","Phil Johnson","Thanks Derica. Sue?","Sue Mahony","Yes. With regards to ASCO, we have a number of interesting presentations at ASCO. We have follow up to the RAINBOW, gastric cancer study being presented, we've also got the necitumumab squire first line squamous study being presented as an ORO. And the ramucirumab Cyramza, second line lung cancer study being presented as an oral as well as CDK 4\/6 lung cancer cohort. So clearly we feel that we have got some interesting information and we are planning to have a conference call of some sort to be finalized with [you all there], so to stay tuned on that one.","Phil Johnson","Great. Thanks Sue. John, next caller please.","Operator","And we will go to Jeff Holford with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Jeff Holford - Jefferies","Hi, thanks for taking my call. Just a bit further commentary from you on the insulin pricing environment in the U.S. (inaudible) obviously you\u2019ve got a bit of a onetime impact here. Just give me your thoughts about just sort of going forward how you view insulin pricing environment particularly in the analog space.","Secondly do you think there is any other specific areas within animal health that you would look to add or build on this in the future? And then just lastly on your CDK, and there\u2019s been a lot of questions today, but do you think it is possible there could be any kind of different color got into profile regarding neutropenia on this products used more chronically in combination with (inaudible) therapy? Thank you.","Phil Johnson","Jeff, thank you for the questions. While Enrique take your insulin pricing question for the U.S. obviously Jeff Simmons for animal health question and back to Sue again for the topic of the data CDK 4\/6 inhibitor. Enrique?","Enrique Conterno","Yes. First when it comes to our overall insulin business, let me provide this a bit of broader context. When we look our overall insulin franchise, we had very good volume growth worldwide. Our volume growth was basically 8% to 9% when we look at our insulin franchise and this volume growth was solid across all regions based on our ability to be competitive when it comes to our presence in different geographies.","When it come to the U.S. I think it\u2019s important that we do recognize, there were two impacts here. There was a net pricing impact of the contract ESI and other contracts as well, as well as there was a very significant inventory effect when it comes to wholesalers. That inventory effect was in the high single-digits in the U.S. So that was an important impact for us when we look at our overall demand and all of you have access to the script data, it is very good that we have seen not very significant impact when it comes to our share performance and our overall volume performance.","Going forward right, this is something that we monitor very carefully when it comes to pricing, but we have now over 50% of the market that has gone to preferential formula is when it comes to analogs. Question is how quickly will the rest of the market go there I think it\u2019s fair to say that we are fighting to make sure that patients continue to have choice, but at the same time as I have shared we need to be competitive whenever a payers basically makes the decision that they are going to narrow the formulary.","At this stage it is difficult to make more comments when it comes to looking at the future of insulin pricing, I would just say that we do monitor this very carefully and we have become increasingly more sophisticated to think about both financially and strategically what\u2019s in our best interest.","Phil Johnson","","Jeff?","Jeff Simmons","","Yes Jeff. I think to answer your question the first thing I would say is Novartis, deal we announced this week was our eighth acquisition since 2007. So I think we\u2019ve got a good track record here in terms of integration. And our focus, no question, rest of this year and going forward is going to be on efficient and timely integration of both Lohmann, which we hope to close here in this quarter as John mentioned and Novartis. That will be our focus. So I think as you look at acquisitions, it will be back earlier in the pipeline, heavier focus on innovation, 60% of this growth we\u2019ve out grown the industry 3x, and 60% of that growth has been innovation. So it will be acquisitions more at a product level earlier back in a pipeline.","Phil Johnson","Okay, thanks. Sue?","Sue Mahony","With regards to bemaciclib, clearly we see lower neutropenia in single agents, with single agent bemaciclib. We\u2019ll have to see the Phase III data with combination for fulvestrant to see both the efficacy and safety there. We do have a Phase I safety study that we will in combination with fulvestrant at ASCO, so we have to see some more data there on the safety profile of bemaciclib with fulvestrant.","Phil Johnson","Great, thanks Sue. John, next caller please?","Operator","And that will be Marc Goodman with UBS. Please go ahead.","Marc Goodman - UBS","Yes, first on Alimta, can you give us a little more detail on the usage trends, both in the U.S. and ex-U.S.? And then Enrique, you were talking about diabetes and insulin, maybe you could just give us your sense of what you\u2019re seeing out there with the orals DPP-4s, SGLT2s and also maybe comment on the GLP-1s as well, just trends you\u2019re seeing in the market and growth rates and how much SGLT2s is moving ahead of DPPP-4s and how much is using a combination therapy? Thanks.","Phil Johnson","Marc, thanks for question. We\u2019ll Sue obviously take the first one for Alimta and then Enrique the second. Sue?","Sue Mahony","Sure. So with the Alimta, if we look at our Q1 performance, Alimta sales grew 2% that was given by the U.S. with negative growth offset by strong performance in ACE and Japan. In the U.S. the decrease was nearly driven by buying patterns with to a lesser extent some selling price impact as we\u2019re seeing higher share in [340B] account. OUS, in Japan we saw again buying patterns, which in the other way was more positive way with regards to stocking in prior to the tax consumption change and also in ACE we saw very strong volume growth driven really in the maintenance. So what we are seeing is we're continuing to see a first line market share growth and continuation maintenance growth. And our focus really with Alimta continues to drive back to ensure that when patient start on Alimta, they continue on Alimta and we get more continuation maintenance. Alimta continues to be the market leader in non-squamous, non-small cell lung cancer in the first line setting globally.","We also, Alimta is the market leader in the maintenance setting. However, we still see the opportunity to grow the maintenance market, so that when patient start on Alimta, they continue on to progression and go in continuation maintenance and that\u2019s clearly our focus now and going forward.","Phil Johnson","","Enrique?","Enrique Conterno","","Very good. First, the market dynamic for the orals, I think we're seeing very good growth when it comes to new patient volumes. We\u2019ll take in combination, both the DPP-4s of new patient starts, the DPP-4 class plus the SGLT2 class. This new patient growth that we're basically seeing is slightly above where we had expected it to be. So we're very pleased with that. I think the SGLT2 class is off to a very good start and it seems that is being adopted very well.","When it comes to GLP-1s, I think it\u2019s slightly different that we believe that the GLP-1 market could expand in a very significant way, but we have not seen that at this stage. We, I'll be frank we are counting on dulaglutide to be an enormous catalyst for that growth.","I think, I'd share while we have basically looked at the dula, against liraglutide highest dose, our intent of doing that has been to basically ensure that we get the right price and reimbursement for our product.","We are not seeking to just switch patients from dulaglutide. The big opportunity that we have in this particular case is to ensure that we can expand the GLP-1 plus in a very significant way. And once again, we see dulaglutide as a pretty important catalyst to that.","You were also asking about the payer environment on both of those classes. Without going into a lot of detail, payers today view, when it comes to GLP-1s more differentiation between the products, then maybe when it comes to meal time insulin. I think that's also the case for basal insulins. So the formularies when it comes to GLP-1s and basal insulin don't tend to be as narrow, as they are in the case of meal time insulins.","In the case of the orals, formularies today are narrow, that is clearly a risk going forward. But it is not like the case of the meal time insulin, where you may have just exclusively one product in the formulary. In most of the formularies, when it's comes to orals, there tends to be more than one product, maybe two products in that formulary, maybe not all, but maybe two.","Phil Johnson","Enrique, thank you. John, next caller please?","Operator","And that will be from the line of Vamil Divan with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Vamil Divan - Credit Suisse","Yes, thanks for the taking the questions. So, on Ram, just thinking about that one, and seeing the success you\u2019ve had in gastric and lung in the second line obviously data for colorectal and hepatocellular on all that soon. Just can you give us a sense of what other developments that we might see other opportunities from moving that product over now that you got the first approval here? And then just second one unrelated on the destocking seems like quite a bit of an impact here for you guys this quarter. Any special dynamics that you can highlight, and I think there is a talk about weather maybe playing a little bit of a role this quarter, and is there anything else that we should be thinking about and anyway to quantify some of your bigger products like Alimta, Cialis, Humalog exactly how much of an impact that? Thanks.","Phil Johnson","Vamil, thanks for the questions. Sue, do you want to take the ramucirumab question and then we will actually have Dave Ricks talk a little more in detail about the destocking that we saw in the first quarter based on stocking in Q4. Sue?","Sue Mahony","Yes. Let me talk about Cyramza because clearly we are extremely excited this week to announce that we have the first FDA approval for Cyramza and in fact it\u2019s now the first FDA approved medicine for advanced gastric cancer following chemotherapy. And this is clearly a huge unmet need. And although it\u2019s a very common, it\u2019s a fifth most common cancer globally; it\u2019s the third leading cause of death. It\u2019s a rare disease in the U.S. We estimate about 22,000 patients will be diagnosed with cancer this year, with gastric cancer this year and a proportion of those is going second line treatment.","So while I\u2019m talking about ramucirumab, I want to make sure that I mentioned that. And also we are planning that we will have this product available over the next few weeks because we want to get it to patients. We also know that we got a number of questions of price, so I might as well believe it\u2019s now all there. And we have as I said and it is a rare disease in the U.S., it is ramucirumab, Cyramza had been given orphan drug status. And we have priced CYRAMZA similar to other orphan drugs and (inaudible) biologics.","So the price of an infusion based on the 60 kilogram patient is -- based on 70 kilogram patient, sorry, is $6,120. And given the median numbers of infusions that we use in REGARD trial which is the pivotal trial that led to disapproval this week its total price per patient will be $24,480. So that\u2019s in the single agent second line gastric cancer. With regard to the combination gastric cancer trial, the RAINBOW study, we have submitted that to -- we plan to submit that as a supplemental NDA to the FDA very soon. Clearly, we also have completed the submission to Europe based on the REGARD study and are working to find the most efficient way of getting the RAINBOW study submitted to Europe and we plan to submit in Japan as well.","You mentioned as well, we\u2019ve got the two positive -- the other positive phase study, Phase III study in lung cancer which we will be presenting at ASCO and the HCC and colorectal studies should be leading out yet this year. So we are very excited. Yes, we do plan to do other studies of Cyramza as we plan our lifecycle plans. We are not able to give you specific details there other than to say that given the positive data that we have seen in both gastric and lung, we clearly are looking to ensure that we have full lifecycle plans for this molecule.","Phil Johnson","","Thanks Sue, Dave?","Dave Ricks","","Yes, in regard to inventories, there is two big effects on Q1, the first obviously the U.S., we have as Enrique mentioned a headwind in the high single-digits to even low double-digits across the marketed product portfolio. I just want to remind investors that we had a very robust Q4 on exactly the same products and stated at that time that there was a tailwind. Why this happens, I think is a cluster of just how the calendar works in terms of their buying patterns covering the holiday period in early January coupled with price speculation. Obviously if we look over a longer period of time this tend to smooth out in the U.S. We also in Q1 had a very strong performance in Japan. A portion of that is driven by Japanese stocking from Q2 into Q1 so you need to look through that as well. Again in long-term this tend to smooth out and I think in market performance for these key brands in diabetes as well as biomedicines I think are on track and consistent across the two quarters.","Phil Johnson","Great thank you Dave. And Bob well thanks for the questions. John next caller please.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go to Alex Arfaei with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Alex Arfaei - BMO Capital Markets","Good morning and thanks for taking the questions. First to follow-up on the immuno-oncology question, just to clarify, are you looking for external collaborations for ramu in lung cancer with PD1 or PDL-1? And could you remind us if the ramu ACC and the other trial that\u2019s ongoing is that going to be an external readout this year? Thank you. The colorectal cancer is the one I missed. Thank you guys.","Phil Johnson","Sure. Alex thanks for the question. Sue?","Sue Mahony","Sure. Alex we are continuing to look at multiple combinations obviously, Cyramza with its (inaudible) could be combined with a number of different agents. So we\u2019re looking at multiple combinations including immuno-oncology combinations with many of our pipeline molecule, not just with Cyramza. With regards to the ACC and colorectal we should have the ACC readouts in the first half of this year, the mid this year and later this year, we should have the colorectal to readout. We are anticipating that we would do toplines on both of those and have external data disclosure on the HTC Phase III trial this year.","Phil Johnson","","Thank you, Sue. John, if we can go to the next caller please.","Operator","And that\u2019s Colin Bristow with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Colin Bristow - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","Thanks for taking the questions. Regarding your business development on the pharma side, are you willing to highlight any mechanisms or therapeutic areas of particular interest to you right now? On evacetrapib, it seems like there is less optimism on this class from a kind of mechanistic commercial standpoints in (inaudible) on the outcome trial, what gives you continued comfort this is a viable mechanism? And could you just give some color on where you are seeing this fitting in an evolving landscape in CV risk reduction? And then finally with regards to ramucirumab, can you just confirm the Japanese filing is still anticipate before year-end? Thanks.","Phil Johnson","","Great Colin, thanks for the questions. Let\u2019s have Dave [turn out] with evacetrapib question. Sue if you want to reiterate our plans for ramucirumab in Japan? And then John, do you want to comment maybe on or Derica on the business development areas that we're looking at in pharma?","Dave Ricks","","Great, thanks. On evacetrapib certainly Lilly remains very optimistic about this mechanism and thus the basis for original investment in evacetrapib remains which is that this drug has a very substantial impact on both LDL and HDL as well as other important cardiovascular markers. We believe that and that effect will demonstrate a significant reduction in major cardiovascular risk.","We have a large Phase III program which is fully enrolled, we're waiting for events and we believe we are powered to demonstrate that reduction in major cardiovascular risk based on all those factors and actually on LDL alone. So, we're optimistic about evacetrapib, I think some of the noise in the classes die down posted dalcetrapib readout reminding investors that dalcetrapib molecule was quite different from evacetrapib in both its biomarker effects, but also structure, had much more modest effect in only on HDL.","And of course you\u2019ve a competitor at Merck in anacetrapib and they have had some interesting data come out of their own which I think has dampen enthusiasm for that program, but we remained both committed and excited about evacetrapib is potentially very large products in our future.","Phil Johnson","Thanks Dave. Sue, on Japan for ramu.","Sue Mahony","Sure. With regard Cyramza, yes we are on track to submit in Japan this year.","Phil Johnson","John?","John Lechleiter","With respect to business development we have lots of business development activities, little bit like the duck floats on the water and the feet are paddling away. We're looking at business development opportunities across all categories that we compete in.","You know a lot about Elanco and some of things we've done there, obviously in areas of strength, like oncology and diabetes, we're looking at opportunities that might compliment or strengthen our current portfolio products or which could be used in combination with those products. And in Bio-Medicines, which covers a whole broad range of therapeutic areas, I think a couple of good example recently tanezumab, the collaboration with Pfizer on the anti-CGRP or anti-NGF antibody for pain and then our acquisition of Arteaus in January with the anti-CGRP antibody for migraine.","I think we bias towards areas where we have internal therapeutic expertise, where we understand development pathways and where we have key customer relationships. You can expect that we'll continue to remain vigilant and opportunistic when other opportunities come along.","Phil Johnson","Great. John, Next caller please.","Operator","We will go Damien Conover with Morningstar. Please go ahead.","Damien Conover - Morningstar","Great. Thanks for squeezing me in here. Just a question on the strategic level, it looks like we are seeing more movement from Phase 1 right into Phase 3, I am thinking little bit about this CDK 4\/6 but we are also seeing that with a lot of your competitors, AstraZeneca making some announcements earlier today. Just want to get your thoughts on the risk reward of this dynamic and then also any commentary you have on, how much of this decision is internally based versus get it by regulatory authorities? Thanks.","Phil Johnson","Sure, Damien. Thanks for the question. I think we will have Jan response.","Dr. Jan Lundberg","Yes. We have seen this for some time in the oncology area where some Phase 1 data then are used and then you go directly into Phase 3. And clearly the single has to be strong if you want to do this and you should also have a clear cut understanding of what is the patient population that you are targeting and preferably have some biomarker in the way to guide that.","There is clearly a risk in doing this, because in reality you would like to have more Phase 2 data to ensure them the highest probable Phase 3 success rate. And in our strategy, we are talking about robust Phase 2 data as a good guarantee from improving Phase 3 success rates where you actually know the dose, the dosing regimen the patients who are selecting and the marker and the endpoints and so on.","In relation to the Alzheimer area we and others have limited Phase 2 data then before you go into Phase 3, which is unfortunate but in reality you need so many patients and so long studies, you might as well do the Phase III trial right away. What you can do there though however is again to select the patients better by only selecting patients for instance then for anti-amyloid therapy that really has amyloid in their brain as detected for instance done by Amyvid scanning. So we actually again try to target those population in Phase III.","Phil Johnson","","Great, thank you. I understand the queue is filling up again a bit, so we will continue since we have some time before the bottom of the hour. John, if we could go to the next call please?","Operator","","And that will be Seamus Fernandez with Leerink Swann. Please go ahead.","Seamus Fernandez - Leerink Swann","","Thanks for the questions and for the extra time. Just in terms of the met MetMAb and some of the decisions that Lilly makes from competitor data, can you just tell us a little bit of what keeps you involved in the c-Met mechanism whether it\u2019d be, you have two inhibitors in Phase II study. So what do you need to see in Phase II to warrant a move forward into Phase III, given the sort of subset analyses that were a bit questionable from a competitor moving forward and then the ultimate failure of that Phase III, what is it that kind of has you take a harder look at that?","And then can you give us a little bit more color on the oncology side from a scientific perspective, where how we should be thinking about the CSF-1R antibody and your enthusiasm around that approach in oncology? And then lastly Derica, I know you have been asked this question a number of times, but can you just give us again, you said that $2.9 billion of adjusted net income but $4 billion of operating cash flow, what proportion of that is historical amortization and depreciation, is it sort of a 100% of that or is it about $700 million, just to help us think about the comparable valuations given that most of your competitors actually exclude that from their P&L? Thanks.","Phil Johnson","","Great, thanks Seamus. We\u2019ll have Sue take your first question with regard to the MetMAb. We may actually to get back to you on the CSS-1R question and then Derica had to step out for a moment, so I\u2019ll go ahead and take your question on the amortization and depreciation. Sue?","Sue Mahony","Yes, thanks Seamus. With regards to our MET program, we remain still excited with our MET program. Our MET antibody is different to the genetic antibody, it\u2019s a bivalent antibody and it\u2019s locked both ligand-dependent and ligand-independent cMET signaling which we believe could be important. We have two Phase II trials ongoing in lung cancer with this antibody. And we\u2019re specifically targeting EGFR mutant population since there is -- the science shows that there is evidence for the relevance of EGFR and MET cross talk. So we believe that with the antibody that we got that\u2019s bivalent as I say, targeting both the ligand and independent ligand MET expression plus our focus on EGFR mutant population that we\u2019ve got an interesting molecule antibody development path and clearly we\u2019ve got a Phase II program that we want to see the outcome of that Phase II program to decide whether we\u2019d move forward with the Phase III. So we remain optimistic.","Phil Johnson","Great. Thank you Sue. Derica is now back with us, to now supporting the question in last minute, let me go ahead and I\u2019ll take the answer and you can add if you need to Derica. So, Seamus on your question of the amount of depreciation amortization on an annual basis, that\u2019s about $1.3 billion with a good chunk of that being amortization of intangibles. As I mentioned for this quarter that was about a $132 million that we had of amortization of intangibles but as you pointed out, many of our competitors now exclude from their non-GAAP or core earnings.","We do not knew that and don\u2019t have any short term plans to change, we certainly have notice that trend over time for more and more of our peers to exclude this, we continue to have discussion internally, but we will go ahead make sure that you guys know where to get to our 10-Q and 10-K language to find these numbers, so that you can make it appropriate adjustment for apples-to-apples comparison.","John, next caller please?","Operator","And we\u2019ll go to Mark Schoenebaum with ISI Group. Please go ahead.","Mark Schoenebaum - ISI Group","Hey thanks a lot for taking my follow-up question. I appreciate it, I just wanted to get quick update on your PCSK9 antibody program to a little bit since I think we\u2019ve got an update on that. And the specific question is there has been some speculation out there, I was wondering if you could clarify, if you be willing to clarify or it or not but your antibody might be able to be dosed less frequently than all the other competitors out there, something like once quarterly? Thanks very much.","Phil Johnson","","Thanks for the question Mark. Dave, if you want to answer, fell free to chime in Dave.","Dave Ricks","","Yes. Mark, as I reminder we\u2019re in the middle of Phase II study, we expect that data in the second half. The purpose of that study is really to better elucidate the dosing schedule for the medicine. But I think it\u2019s safe to say we believe that PCSK9s can make a significant difference in cardiovascular risk and that Lilly PCSK9 may have the benefit of an extended dosing schedule; how long what we would actually decide to do, if we proceed it with the medicine is to be determined.","Phil Johnson","","Great, thanks Dave. John, next caller please.","Operator","And that will be Tim Anderson with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Tim Anderson - Sanford Bernstein","Thank you. One of the bare arguments on Lilly relates Alimta and what the future of that product is given changing landscape with the PD1s. So, I know companies maintain 5 and 10 year long range plans, directionally what can you say about how you view Alimta\u2019s trajectory, given what seems to be a change here? Is this something that you think is going to continue to grow or is there going to be some share losses, as you PD-1s start to take some lung business?","Philip Johnson","Tim, thank you for the question. Sue, that\u2019s right up your alley.","Sue Mahony","Yes, Tim that's a great question and clearly the patent decision that we've got this year makes us feel much more comfortable with regard to the future of Alimta. We're going to have to wait and see what happens with regards to the PD-1s and immuno-oncology. We need to see the data mature, we need to see which patients would be most eligible for those agents.","Our focus as I said previously is really to continue to drive the first line and the maintenance, so the continuation maintenance indications for Alimta. And even though we are market leader, we've only got less than 40% share market in the first line setting and only approximately 20% of patients go on to receive maintenance of the first line setting.","So we do continue to see that there are opportunities, there are a lot of different agents being investigated in lung cancer which is great, because they needed huge. We made a lot of improvement over the years but there is an awful lot of improvement that needs to happen. So, I think clearly we\u2019re watching and we\u2019re involved in bringing new medicines to patients. We see that the lung cancer market is continuing to be an area of interest as we're bringing new medicines and because of the size and because of the unmet need.","So I still see opportunity clearly for Alimta to grow. I\u2019m glad that we won the patent and we are continuing to drive what we believe the opportunity is with three Phase 3 trials that show an overall survival advantage with Alimta and showing that you start with Alimta and stay with Alimta in the front line setting data, we can continue to help patients and we\u2019ll continue to [develop] this brand.","Phil Johnson","Great, thank you. We might have time for one last quick question. John, do we have any callers on the line still?","Operator","Actually, no further questions in queue.","Phil Johnson","Okay, fantastic. Then I will turn it over to John Lechleiter to close out the call.","John Lechleiter","Okay, just very briefly I want to thank everybody for joining us. And we appreciate your interest in Eli Lilly and Company. We appreciate your feedback on this format, we have been for the past couple of calls extending the time to allow you to ask more questions and we intend to keep doing that, and to also involve our leadership team which is represented here today and these calls going forward.","So if you have any feedback on this approach, please get back to Phil. We\u2019ll see many of you at ASCO and at ADA. We will be back here again in July with report from our second quarter. Thanks again.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."]}}
