[Operator Instructions] Also, today's conference is being recorded. Before we begin, Kevin Quinn, Vice President, Finance, will make a brief statement concerning forward-looking statements that will be made on this call.","Kevin Quinn","Thank you for joining us on today's call. I would like to remind you that our comments today contain forward-looking statements we intend to be covered by, and we claim the protection under, the Safe Harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.","Forward-looking statements address future events, developments or results and typically use words such as believe, anticipate, expect, intend, will, plan, forecast, outlook or estimate, and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that may cause our results to differ materially, including competitive pressures, demand for the company's products, the economy in general, consumer debt levels, dependence on foreign suppliers, the weather, business interruptions and other factors disclosed in the company's 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2012, and other documents the company files from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","The company intends these forward-looking statements to speak only as of the time of this conference call and does not undertake to update or revise them as more information becomes available. The reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on the call with the corresponding GAAP measures are described in our earnings release and our SEC filings, which can be found in our website at advanceautoparts.com.","For planning purposes, our third quarter 2013 earnings release is scheduled for October 31 before the market opens, and our quarterly conference call is scheduled for the morning of Thursday, October 31, 2013. To be notified of dates of future earnings reports, you can sign up through the Investor Relations website. Finally, a replay of this call will be made available on our website for 1 year.","Now let me turn the call over to Darren Jackson, our Chief Executive Officer. Darren?","Darren R. Jackson","Thanks, Kevin. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our second quarter conference call. And I'd like to start off by thanking our 54,000 team members for their hard work and dedication as we continue to strive to better serve our customers and grow our business. Joining me on the call today is our President, George Sherman, who'll provide you with an update on our 2013 priorities; and Mike Norona, our Chief Financial Officer, who will update you on our financials.","While we are pleased with our nearly 100 basis point gain in operating income rate achieved in the quarter, which resulted from improvement in our gross profit rate and more disciplined expense control, we are disappointed with our comparable store sales performance. As we shared with you on the first quarter call, despite our positive start to the second quarter, our sales outlook remained guarded to ensure the sustainability of yearly trends.","Shortly after the call, our sales softened and the weakness continued throughout the rest of the quarter, leading to a comparable store sales decline of 0.3%. Our comparable store sales decline was driven by our DIY business and partially offset by an increase in our commercial sales.","While our sales were softer than expected in the quarter, we believe that the long-term fundamentals of the industry remain positive. Some of these factors include the increasing age of vehicles, which are now over 11 years, with 70% of those vehicles over 7 years old, stabilizing gas prices and increasing number of miles driven.","However, as we discussed last quarter, we are still dealing with several unfavorable macro factors, including more consumers contemplating the purchase of new vehicles, which creates some short-term volatility as consumers are selective about how much more money to spend on aging vehicles.","The economy also remains challenged by higher payroll taxes, high unemployment and financial stress on our core customers. Further, in an economy of necessity, consumers are only performing repairs that are absolutely necessary to keep their vehicles on the road. As a result, deferred maintenance remains at record levels.","For example, our base oil business, which is core to our maintenance business, was down low single-digits in Q2. Conversely, we are encouraged by the turnaround in our brake and ride control business after a tough first quarter.","Additionally, we saw significant impacts to seasonal categories of our business due to one of the wettest second quarters on record in the eastern half of the United States versus record heat in the southwest. These weather conditions helped drive double-digit increases in wiper sales and lifted the gross margin rates, but at the same time had a significant negative sales impact on several seasonal categories like wash and wax, air conditioning and radiators.","Our comparable store sales shortfall was offset by improvements in our gross margin and disciplined expense control in the quarter. The team effectively managed our gross profit rate to 50.3%, which was 40 basis points greater than Q2 of last year despite continuing headwinds from full operations of our new Remington distribution facility.","Similarly, our diligent expense management resulted in an SG&A rate of 37.7% in the quarter. The rate improved 58 basis points in the second quarter versus Q2 last year. We saw improvements across all areas of the business, in the store support center, field infrastructure and labor productivity as measured by our sales per hour.","We believe that some of the pullbacks cut into our top line growth in select areas. That being said, it was consistent with our profitable sales growth and long-term 12% operating margin goals as a company. Culturally, the focus on achieving profitable sales growth will result in quarters like this one. Striking the right balance is important and I'm proud of how the team delivered on our bottom line goals.","Overall, we remain committed to our 2 core strategies of service leadership and superior availability. Collectively, the company financial objective is to expand our operating margins to 12% over the next 3 years. Our second quarter operating income rate improvement of 98 basis points is a solid step towards our goals. Mike will share more details in a moment.","In 2013, we introduced our company to, one, focus on the fundamentals as our core objective that will guide us for the foreseeable future. Similarly, the outcome to make the day for our customers, which drives our sales and profitability, is the measure of success.","Broadly, when I step back and look at the direction of Advance over the last 5 years, we remain on track with our original mission focus of diversifying the position of the company to reflect the broader auto aftermarket.","Structurally, the customers and the addressable $40 billion market for Commercial is nearly double the size of DIY and growing at 2x the rate of DIY. Our Commercial business is expected to be over $2.5 billion by the end of 2013 and will represent approximately 40% of our business, which is up from $1.5 billion 5 years ago. We remain committed to the original mission.","Our growth has been driven by focusing on basic core capabilities to serve Commercial customers, including improved availability, sales force development, Commercial Parts Pro deployment, delivery driver and truck expansion, B2B and other capabilities. The buildup of these basic core capabilities are complete with few exceptions.","The key remaining capabilities are our daily replenishment supply chain and our commercially focused EPC, which are still in the very early stages of rollout. These capabilities position us to take our sales per advanced commercial program, which stands at $640,000, to much higher levels over time. We intend to complete our daily replenishment centers and retrofits over the next 5 years and our EPC rollout in 2014.","Capabilities, though important, only enable growth, whereas consistency of our sales, service and operations are required to take the next step in accelerating our business.","Growth and focus on the fundamentals has supplanted building capabilities as our key objective for the next 5 years. Predictably, growth includes our new commercially formatted stores, our BWP commercial acquisition and commercial services, including MotoLogic, DriverSide and Keylink.","The customer channel growth that we've prioritized for 2013 has been our Commercial National Accounts. I am very pleased that Monroe has expanded its business with us in the quarter, and Goodyear has awarded us with first call status in key parts of the country. National Accounts were a natural next step in our commercial growth, and they're growing at double digits in 2013.","Looking ahead, heavy duty, fleet, PP&E, government and banner programs are still ahead of us, which our key competitors include in their numbers today. Holistically, diversifying our business while adding more growth options will enhance both our financial and business objectives.","Focus on the fundamentals is about prioritizing consistency over building new capabilities. Consistency in our sales, service and operational execution is always easier said than done. Our recent management changes, to more tightly integrate the leadership, sales and operations of our business are expressly focused on the cultural and operational priorities of the business, specifically, the need to simplify our operations while consistently raising the level of service is what George will discuss in a few moments.","Overall, the results for the second quarter are encouraging, including our 6.1% total sales gain, driven by our growth, including the acquired BWP stores and our new stores. Our Autoparts International sales grew 13% during the second quarter versus the second quarter last year, while improving our operating income by 21%.","We continue to grow the number of stores served out of our new Remington Distribution Center and are seeing the expected sales lift. Fundamentally, both our gross margin rate and sales per labor hour performance reached near-record levels in the quarter as well.","Finally, the leaders that are focused on moving from building capabilities to driving sales and operational excellence began the transition into their new roles this quarter.","In closing, I'd like to share an example of how growth and focus on the fundamentals bring \"service is our best part\" to life. Under the leadership of Regional Vice President, Morgan Schafer, I'm proud to announce that tomorrow, we are opening our 4,000th store, which will be located in Montgomery, New York. This is a significant milestone in the company's history and further evidence of our commitment to long-term growth and continuing to serve our customers","I couldn't be prouder of Morgan and his team, District Leader Michelle Murphy and General Manager, Melissa Mertey [ph] as they prepare to open this new store. Morgan is a consistent leader with proven results, and I'm excited about the work he will continue to lead for us.","This new store is also another example of continued expansion in the Northeast, which is a strategic growth area for us. Morgan, Michelle and Melissa, thank you for your roles in this historic achievement in Advance's history.","Lastly, as you know, George Sherman joined us as President about 90 days ago. And I'm excited that he is taking ownership in ramping up on much of our operational work he will update you on today. I'm encouraged by the progress we have made in our strategic initiatives, and I know under George's leadership, we will continue to see positive results in these areas. While we are not satisfied with our comp store sales, we feel that the progress we made on the gross margin and SG&A is a step in the right direction. I have confidence that George will lead us to accomplishing our previously stated goal of getting 12% operating income rate in the next 3 years while also driving increased sales. I will now turn the call over to George to update you on the work he is leading on our 5 key priorities that support our 2013 objectives. George?","George Sherman","Thanks, Darren, and good morning, everyone. I, too, would like to thank our over 54,000 team members for their commitment to customer service while making strides in our 2013 priorities during the quarter.","During my first 90 days, I had the opportunity to visit stores in many markets, visit with Commercial customers and also spend time with our support staff at our offices. I'm excited at the potential I see in our team members and customers.","Realizing the potential of each and every team member and customer will be critical to our success in 2013 and beyond. I'll now provide you with an update in our 5 key priorities that support our 2013 objectives of growth and focus on the fundamentals.","First, growing our Commercial business through improved levels of delivery, speed and reliability and increased customer retention and share wallet with national and regional customers. Our delivery speeds continue to improve across-the-board, and commercial credit penetration continues to grow as a result of our insource credit program.","We're proud to be able to add Goodyear to our growing national accounts base, and we're continuing to grow our national accounts. We also saw double-digit growth in our national and regional accounts during second quarter, which is a critical component of our Commercial growth strategy. While B2B e-commerce business is up roughly 40% in the quarter, and we continue to be pleased with the industry-leading e-services offerings we have for our Commercial customers. As a result of these efforts, we saw positive comp store sales gains in our Commercial sales. When including the acquired BWP stores, our mix of business in Commercial during the quarter grew to 40.3% versus 38.1% during the second quarter of 2012.","Second, improving our local market availability. Our work continues to increase the number of hubs that we operate through the new store openings and the upgrade of existing stores that had the space and are strategically located to operate as hubs. Throughout the second quarter we've expanded our hub store count to 354, which is an increase of 34 since the second quarter last year.","We also continue to see progress with our operations at our Remington DC. As previously stated, we anticipate 400 stores will be serviced by Remington this year. Through our second quarter, we have 355 stores receiving shipments from Remington at least once per week, with more than half of those stores receiving daily replenishment.","The results of the stores receiving daily delivery continues to be promising, as they've been achieving the expected sales lift since receiving their deliveries versus their control source within the region driven by parts categories. We're still in the early stages and we'll continue to monitor results over the next several months before we can draw any definitive conclusions.","Third, expanding our new store footprint. As you'll recall, we completed the acquisition of 124 BWP stores at the beginning of the fiscal year, we're well into the full integration of the BWP stores into Advance stores and the sales and profitability of the BWP stores are currently exceeding our expectations. Most importantly, during the transition, we're remaining focused on employee retention and customer service. Our first 2 stores have been successfully converted, our product lines are beginning to roll through the supply chain, and we expect to convert approximately 40% of the stores by year-end. We remain on track for finishing the integration by mid-2014, consistent with the timeframe previously communicated.","During the quarter, we added 21 new Advance Auto Parts stores and 5 new Autopart International stores, keeping us on track for a more aggressive new store opening plan this year. The performance of our 2012 and 2013 classes of stores continue to exceed expectations, primarily driven by a faster ramp-up of Commercial business than previous classes of new stores.","Fourth, focus on fundamentals starts with consistently executing to exceed our customers' expected service levels. While we saw positive signs during the quarter with our increased dollars per transaction, units per transaction and [indiscernible] sales productivity, along with our improved customer satisfaction levels, better profitability and low return rates, we realize this is an area where we need to drive improvement.","As part of this focus, we're continuing to improve the level of individual performance to maximize every customer engagement. These efforts include improving our scheduling effectiveness and team member product training which leads to increasing our customer order size by providing our customers with the full solution all the time in order for them to get the job right the first time.","In addition, we are enhancing our commercial model to enable a higher rate of growth, including empowering our field teams to meet the demands of our Commercial customers. This includes simplifying how we run our stores, including report in cash reductions, process improvements and placing a clear field-wide focus on business and customer outcomes.","Fifth, and finally, improving our profitability for increasing our efficiency and effectiveness to other support areas and our store operating model. The work that our leaders have been doing locally and collectively to identify and deliver efficiencies in our business is a contributing factor to putting us on our trajectory to achieve accelerated profitability and reduce our SG&A per store gap versus our industry peers.","For example, the insourcing of our commercial credit processing has significantly reduced the cost of processing those transactions. Additionally, we developed a long-term incentive program designed to accelerate both our profitability and growth.","Collectively, our company priorities remain intensely focused on operations to drive results through customer service, enabled through outstanding and consistent execution. Again, I've enjoyed my first 3 months with Advance and could not be more excited about the future growth opportunities for the company. I look forward to continuing to update you on these important priorities in the future.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Mike Norona, our Chief Financial Officer.","Michael A. Norona","Thanks, George, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start by thanking all of our talented team members for their continued efforts to improve our business and serve our customers as we navigated through our second quarter. I plan to cover the following topics with you this morning: 1, provide some financial highlights from our second quarter of 2013; 2, put our second quarter results into context with our expectations and key financial dimensions we use to measure our performance; and 3, provide some insights on the remainder of 2013.","As we shared on our first quarter earnings call, we were encouraged with the strong start we had to our second quarter, and we were somewhat tempered with our sales expectations. Looking forward, as we were unclear of how much of our strong start was the result of a bounceback from the delayed spring versus a fundamental rebound in consumer demand.","We are not satisfied with our second quarter comp sales performance, which softened in the final 6 weeks of the quarter after tracking up 2% in the first 6 weeks. We believe this softness was the result of record levels of precipitation in our core markets and a continued challenging macroeconomic environment on our consumer, such as increased payroll taxes.","While we are disappointed with negative comps sales, our operating profits grew 15.1% versus second quarter last year and exceeded expectations, driven by both an increase in gross profit rate and disciplined expense management, which led to a 98 basis point increase in our operating income rate of 12.6% for the quarter as we work towards our longer-term operating margin goal of 12%.","We remain focused on influencing the things that are in our direct control and positioning our company for longer-term growth and profitability by maintaining our strategic focus, executing on the fundamentals and simplifying our operations.","While we are pleased with our bottom line results during the quarter, we realize, in order to achieve our 12% goal, we must improve our sales performance while continuing the disciplined spending we've exhibited over the last 2 quarters.","As a result of the weaker consumer demand and record levels of precipitation throughout the majority of the eastern half of the United States, our comp store sales decreased 0.3%. Our total sales, however, increased 6.1% to $1.5 billion, driven by the acquisition of BWP and the net addition of 175 new stores over the past 12 months.","Our comp store sales decrease was driven by declines in our DIY sales, partially offset by positive growth in Commercial sales. Year-to-date, our total sales increased 4.3% to $3.6 billion, and our comp store sales declined 2%.","Our gross profit rate in the second quarter was 50.3% versus 49.9% in the second quarter of 2012 or an increase of 40 basis points. The increase was primarily due to higher merchandising margins, driven by lower product acquisition costs and a favorable product mix, partially offset by planned increases in supply chain costs associated with the operation of our new Remington DC and the impact of BWP sales, which have a lower gross margin rate due to their higher mix of Commercial sales. Year-to-date, our gross profit rate increased 30 -- 13 basis points to 50.1% from 50% over the same time period last year.","Our SG&A rate of 37.7% decreased 58 basis points versus the second quarter of 2012, primarily driven by the timing of last year's company-wide leadership meeting, lower marketing expense, improved labor productivity and a decrease in credit card fees as a result of the insourcing of our commercial credit program.","These were partially offset by higher incentive compensation due to individual store team member performance and operating income growth, fixed cost deleverage as a result of our negative comparable store sales and increased new store openings. Year-to-date, our SG&A rate increased 46 basis points to 39% versus 38.5% over the same period last year.","All in, our operating income was $194.7 million, which was an increase of 15.1% versus second quarter of 2012. This exceeded expectations and is a testament to our ability to drive our gross profit expansion and the team's disciplined focus on expense management despite softer comp store sales performance.","Our operating income rate increased 98 basis points to 12.6% in the second quarter. The increased operating income rate came both from our Advance stores, as well as our Autopart International business, which grew operating income over 20% during the quarter. Our EPS increased 18.7% versus Q2 last year to $1.59 per share and includes $0.01 of transition costs associated with the integration of BWP. We still anticipate the transition of BWP will occur over an 18-month period from acquisition, and the associated costs with 2013 to be in the range of $0.15 to $0.20.","Through the first half of 2013, our operating income dollars increased 1.3% to $398.8 million, and our diluted EPS increased 2.9% to $3.23, including $0.03 of BWP integration costs. Year-to-date, free cash flow is $27.9 million, which is down 89.5% over the same period last year, primarily as a result of the acquisition of BWP.","Excluding the net impact of the acquisition, our free cash flow would have been $198.3 million compared to $265.4 million over the same time period last year, primarily due to an unfavorable change in owned inventory, offset by less capital expenditures.","Our owned inventory is approximately flat to Q2 2012, and our accounts payable to inventory ratio is 85.1% versus 82.9% in the second quarter of 2012. Our total inventory increased 14.8%, driven by our new Remington DC, more hubs, more new stores and the acquisition of BWP. This increase was higher than our expectations due to a lower-than-anticipated sales performance.","At the end of the second quarter, we had roughly $605 million of debt on our balance sheet, and our adjusted debt-to-EBITDAR was 2.2x, which is below our previously stated ceiling of 2.5x. We continue to measure our performance of our business through the financial dimensions of growth, profit and value creation. We continue to prioritize growth as our primary use of capital in order to increase returns and drive shareholder value.","As a result, our focus continues to be on accelerating our commercial growth and stabilizing our DIY business. We plan to achieve this goal by improving our availability through our hub store openings, inventory upgrades, supply chain investments and strengthening our market position with increased new store openings.","We are proud of our improved coverage and in-market availability, driven by the areas that George covered. We're also proud of the accelerated pace of our new store openings, including the net addition of 21 new stores in the second quarter. This includes the opening of 21 new Advance Auto Parts stores and 5 new Autopart International stores, offset by the closing of 3 Advance stores, one Autopart International store and the consolidation of one BWP store into an existing Advance store.","At the end of Q2, our total store count was 3,990. Including the acquisition of BWP in Q1, we've increased our net store count by 298 over the last 12 months. We remain on pace to open 170 to 190 new Advance Auto Parts stores and Autopart International stores this year.","We continue to prioritize our use of capital to drive shareholder value by, first, investing in the business; second, looking at strategic opportunities; and thirdly, returning money to shareholders through share repurchases. In every case, we have taken a disciplined approach to capital deployment, weighing the long-term value creation opportunities of each. Over the past several quarters, we have built up our cash position as we wanted to maintain financial flexibility as we assess a range of organic and inorganic growth investments in our business.","As our industry continues to consolidate, we believe there maybe opportunities which will enable us to drive profitable growth and value creation, particularly in the commercial space. As we evaluate these opportunities, we are focused on driving attractive financial returns like we have achieved with our recent acquisition of BWP, which year-to-date has added $0.04 per share to our earnings.","With this context, year-to-date, we have deployed over $250 million of capital in a manner consistent with our priorities. This includes investing approximately $180 million in our acquisition of BWP and returning approximately $75 million to shareholders via share repurchases, including $15.7 million in our second quarter.","At the end of the quarter, we had roughly $418 million left under our share repurchase authorization, and our average diluted share count was 73.3 million shares. As we have said before, we take a long-term view and look beyond individual quarters in making our capital allocation decisions as we balance investment opportunities against returning capital to shareholders.","Ultimately, our focus is on maximizing long-term value to shareholders in a manner consistent with our capital allocation priorities. And to that end, we do not intend to maintain our current levels of excess cash beyond the short to medium term.","Turning to profit. We are pleased that despite softer sales, we were able to exceed our profit expectations in the second quarter. During the quarter, the 98 basis point increase in our operating margins was driven by some of the key drivers we have identified that will help us get to our long-term goal of 12% operating margins.","They include gross profit margin improvements driven by our merchant and field teams in the areas of merchandising capabilities, global sourcing and the execution and continued improvement in areas like shrink. We also made progress in our expense management, where our field teams delivered record labor productivity as measured by our sales per labor hour. And we continue to lower our administrative and support costs in areas such as professional fees and credit card fees. As a reminder, the pathway to our 12% goal requires sales growth, modest gross profit improvement and a significant improvement in our cost efficiency and execution.","While we are disappointed with our comp store sales performance during the quarter, we believe our gross profit and SG&A progress is a solid step in the right direction. As a result of our commitment to build a more competitive cost structure while funding strategic investments and to employ a more disciplined approach to expense management, our total SG&A dollars per store decreased slightly to $654,000 per store in our second quarter versus $656,000 during the second quarter of 2012.","With respect to value creation, we have maintained our disciplined approach to capital, which is reflected in our return on invested capital of 18.5%. For the quarter, our ROIC decreased 136 basis points versus the second quarter last year, as a result of our increased invested capital due to the acquisition of BWP, the insourcing of our commercial credit and the accelerated pace of our new store openings.","Longer term, we see opportunities to improve our ROIC as we begin to generate benefits from our Remington DC, our acquisition of BWP and as our sales from our new store openings begin to ramp. We also see opportunities to reduce our net owned inventory as we move towards our goal of achieving an AP ratio of 100%.","Turning to the balance of the year, given our year-to-date comp of minus 2%, we are now expecting comps will be slightly down for the full year. We continue to expect our gross profit rate will increase modestly, and we'll continue to adjust our costs appropriately given our sales trends to deliver on our profit expectations. All in, we continue to be confident, at this time, in our ability to deliver the previously shared earnings per share annual outlook of $5.30 to $5.45.","In closing, we are committed to our strategies in Commercial and availability and remain confident in the industry fundamentals and how we are positioned as a company. We are focused on improving our sales performance while continuing to improve our profitability and strengthening our returns to continue to drive shareholder value.","We also want to thank our 54,000 team members who lead us every day with their relentless focus on service and commitment to operational excellence and execution, which are key ingredients to delivering on our goals.","Operator, we are now ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question today is from Matt Fassler with Goldman Sachs.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I've got, I guess, 1 or 2 quick ones. First, I just want to make sure we understand the impact of the inventory accumulation on gross margin. Some of the companies we've dealt with, including, I think, U-Haul a couple of years ago, from time to time get some benefit from UNICAP when the inventory's up to a greater degree in sales, I guess, having to do with timing of capitalizing versus expensing distribution. Has this been and is it a factor for you as we think about gross margin here in Q2?","Michael A. Norona","Matt, it's Michael Norona. No, it wasn't. If you're referring to LIFO, LIFO was actually a little bit of a headwind, a little bit of an expense for us in the quarter, but it was offset by some of the other things that we adjust prices and things like that. But, no, inventory and LIFO had no impact on our gross margin during the quarter.","Darren R. Jackson","True. A fair amount of the inventory build, Mike, is, you got to put into it, Matt, BWP in the quarter. Our new store count year-over-year is up 175 and Remington in the quarter. So I think when you get down to the core Advance inventory growth, it's nominal in terms of inventory growth for the quarter.","Michael A. Norona","Yes, Matt. The inventory growth in the quarter was 14.8% for the areas, primarily driven by the areas that Darren just talk about. And we expect that to normalize throughout the year and the growth at the end of the year will be more modest.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And my second question relates to costs. Clearly, your operating margin is outperforming expectations, as your sales, to some degree, underperformed, I think, your own expectations. And Darren, you referred in your comments to perhaps some of your cost cuts having weighed on sales. I know you have a 12% margin bogey and that seems to be the driving force behind your strategic direction. Given that the top line is lagging a bit, are you considering perhaps reinvesting a bit more? And do you think incremental expense dollars would help the top line story?","Darren R. Jackson","Yes. Matt, that's a natural question. It's certainly a question for us. I would say this -- what's important is staying consistent with our team, as we shared with you and many that we went into this year focused on consistency and profitable sales growth. As you go to achieve that pool, there will be cuts that you make in certain parts of the business. Honestly, where you give up the sales dollar but you save an expense dollar, and that the profitability of the company improves a bit for us. We know we have gaps relative to some of our competitors in the industry. And so we're trying to do that very thoughtfully. And in my comments, there was as many expense dollar takeouts in, what I would say, the store support center, the regional field infrastructure. And as we think about the stores, our field organization, one of our focuses is a proxy organization where do we have productivity opportunities, and that really is location by location and, in many ways, team member by team member. There's no doubt in my mind that, as we make some of those adjustments, and you have to go through that process, we're going to give up some sales momentum in parts of the business. That being said, the other thing that we're growing through is that, in the last 12 months, we've added nearly 300 stores. And so, as you ramp up the new store growth, the core new stores continue to meet or exceed targets in terms of sales growth and profitability. I couldn't be more thrilled with BWP. As Mike talked about earlier, we're balancing bringing Remington up to speed. So there are many places where we continue to invest, looking at the long-term growth profile, hence the 6% sales growth that we saw in the business, and growing Remington, our margin was up 40 basis points in the quarter. But that's a constrained margin, given the cost that we had to overcome in Remington this quarter as well. So as I've said in my comments, we have to strike a balance, so we'll have these quarters where we have the combination. Our seasonal categories, quite frankly, were very tough for us in the quarter; that constrained some of our comp store growth materially in places of the country. And in other places we achieved a total sales growth that we were looking for, too, but it's not lost on me that we have to strike the right balance.","Operator","The next question is from Dan Wewer with Raymond James.","Daniel R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Darren, it looks like the 2-year stack comp sales performance took a turn for the worse in the second quarter. And based on your guidance, it looks like that continues for the balance of the year. It appears that all of this deterioration is due to the weakness in your Do-It-Yourself channel, yet during your prepared comments, and George's prepared comments, all of the discussion was focused on Commercial. Just surprised that there's not a greater level of urgency on resuscitating the Do-It-Yourself business, given it's still 60% of your total revenues.","Darren R. Jackson","Yes. Dan, that's -- you're right. We were pleased with the sales gains that we continue to see in our Commercial business. Our DIY business was challenged, again, in the quarter. Organizationally, we looked across the organization, we have the team focused on -- in terms of the DIY business, and we talked about before across all of our organization that growth really is growing the basket. We saw, again, in this quarter, across the industry, units continue to be challenged in the industry. I would say, one of the things that started to weaken our sales trends, because we actually started the quarter in a good place in our DIY business, our seasonal categories in DIY, particularly air conditioning, wash and wax, they tend to kick in this time here. In the south, we saw the wiper business clearly pick up for us, and I continue to believe that for DIY consumer and, again, the way they're recovering in our economy are uneven across the country, too, that, that pressure that's on that core customer in some of our core markets just continues to be higher. So organizationally we're focused on what we can control, which is the customer in front of us and trying to make sure that we're serving them the best and filling that basket in front of them. George, would you like to add anything?","George Sherman","Yes, I think there's a couple of other initiatives on the DIY side of the business. One is around store simplification. I think when you look at our stores, we have a lot of metrics, we have a lot of messages we're saying in the stores, and we're rapidly cutting back on that. So cash management and getting our teams focused on power hours, the main portions of the business day, when our customers tend to come into the -- our DIY retail stores, is a key focus area for us, as long as -- along with the DIY dollars per transaction that Darren mentioned as well.","Daniel R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just as a follow-up, Mike, in the past, you had indicated that, that 12% operating margin goal would be contingent on comp sales growth of around 2% based on the reduction in the payroll hours. Are you now thinking you can achieve that 12% EBIT goal with less than a 2% comp?","Michael A. Norona","Yes. So maybe, Dan, what we've said is, in order to get 12%, we really need 3 things. We need to have sales growth. And I think the assumption we've made is in around that 2% growth, and that kind of makes the assumption that the DIY is, on a total basis, is flat, and Commercial is in that 1% to 3%, 2% to 4% range. And we always expect to overperform the market so that's the assumption in how we get to 2%. And absolutely, it starts with -- we have to get the sales growing and I think Darren and George both in their remarks and just now shared that, that is a primary focus for us. The second element is modest margin improvements and we've talked about -- it would make good progress in the quarter, and we continue to see some upside in our margins. And then the other aspect is in terms of our cost. And you mentioned taking hours out. That's not how we actually think about our labor. We actually think about our labor as getting more productive. In the last number of years, we've invested a number of tools around performance management, and we're doing better performance management within our store. And we now have tools to measure individual productivity. And I think we think about it more on improving the productivity, but we need to have all 3. So -- and I think you asked the question around the outlook. One of the things -- one of the reasons we're able to maintain our outlook is the progress we're making on the pathway to 12% and how we're doing with respect to our margins and our cost. And I think the last time, in our remarks that we said we were kind of guided to the lower end of the range, we think we're firmly in the range now, partially because of our beak [ph] during the second quarter and the continued improvements we see coming for the back half of the year.","Operator","The next question is from Michael Montani from ISI Group.","Michael Montani - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","One question I had was, if you think about the gross margin rate improvement that you had this quarter, and then rolling out to increase the penetration of national accounts, how are you able to have the conviction that the gross margins could continue to expand in the back half of the year? Maybe if you can expand a bit on some of the initiatives there that you have under way, including Remington. And then, just a follow-up after that.","Darren R. Jackson","Yes, sure. Charles, why don't you talk about gross margin improvements going forward and I'll take the national accounts.","Charles E. Tyson","Yes, I mean, as we look through the quarter, we continue to see benefit from product acquisition costs. Some of that pricing work that we continue to drive through. So while we planned for our margins in national accounts, and as we -- the team had done a great job in expanding that business. We built that entire plan for Q3 and Q4, so we've got good visibility to what we see the impact of mix is going to be and we feel comfortable with the guidance that we put out there.","Darren R. Jackson","Yes. And like Mike said on national accounts, to be honest, the way we look at it is gross margin dollar productivity. And so those national accounts, as I said in my prepared remarks, what we're pleased about is we're growing our business with Monroe, again, this quarter. Goodyear has awarded us first call in parts of the country. And those businesses tend to be growing those national accounts. For us, they're growing at double-digit rates. And they tend to be a higher average ticket. And so if you think about the economics of Commercial, when you have a higher average ticket, a higher average truck rule, that can be a very profitable transaction versus just chasing margin rate on some of the low end. I think we've talked before and I tried to highlight in my comments that think about it, this is a business that you stand in line and earn your way up first call status. And so you earn your way up, the reward tends to be a higher basket and you end up, in some cases, as you serve those larger customers, you may give up some rate at the bottom end, but you certainly add more profit dollars to the overall organization.","Michael Montani - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","And then a housekeeping question, which is really -- if you could quantify the sales dollars of BWP this quarter? And then, obviously, with the great progress on national accounts, should we think about that as mid-single-digit percentage of the business? Is there a way to help sort of contextualize that there?","Michael A. Norona","Yes, I'll take the first part and then I'll let Darren take the second part. So Mike, we're not going to quantify -- we've integrated BWP as we think about it as part of our growing our Commercial business. I will hum a few bars, we're extremely pleased with that acquisition so far. The quality of people we have, the capabilities around Commercial, we're learning a lot from that business. And also we're very pleased with what we've been able to do in the stores to retain our customers, and we think they're going to provide us with a lot of benefits looking forward at helping us build out our commercial capabilities. But we think about that as embedded in our -- we had a positive commercial growth in the quarter. They don't count towards our comp yet. They're in our total sales growth of 6.1%, and we're very pleased with how that acquisition has started off.","Darren R. Jackson","Yes. And Michael, I would say this, is that if you look across all of national accounts, we're still well below a double-digit penetration as a company. We don't give out specific targets for competitive reasons, but it has been a focus area for growth this year, and we continue, quarter in and quarter out, to make double-digit progress in terms of the growth of that business.","Michael Montani - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And if I could just say one last question, which is I think key to the investment thesis, is really, when you look at the comp guidance, it seems to imply that you all could go positive in the back half of the year, despite, you mentioned, sort of negative trends in the last 6 weeks. Is there anything specific that you could point to, to sort of inflect the comp in the back half as the compares are easy but sort of similar? And is there initiatives that you have going on that you can point to specifically or just help us form your view and thought process?","Darren R. Jackson","Yes. So Michael, a couple of things. So as we get to the back half of the year, a couple of things happen. One, as we said in our prepared remarks, we certainly like the turnaround that we've seen in the friction business. We like the bounce back that we saw in the ride control business. The other thing that becomes important to us as we begin the fourth quarter, we begin to anniversary some of the new store growth that we focused on last year. So we're going through a full year of ramping up new store growth, which tends to put pressure on the comp because when you're opening stores in new markets, that will put a little pressure on the comp. You don't have the benefit yet of anniversary-ing those comps. We'll begin to anniversary those comps in the fourth quarter of this year. They tend to have been new store growth in cold-weather markets that tend to hit their stride as you're going into the back half on the Commercial side of the business. Now we all take a step down seasonally in the back half, but we have been positioning those maintenance categories, new store growth and, as we talked about, seeing some signs of that deferred maintenance cycle, particularly in the brake business start to -- start to life again, which tends to be better for us, particularly, in those colder weather markets, which were tough a year ago.","Operator","The next question is from Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets.","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I guess, one of the questions I have is, you've been trying to make a lot of changes to the business over the last couple of years. Is there anything structurally or maybe even just philosophically that you've made to the business as you focus more and more on Commercial and maybe it's had an adverse impact on the DIY segment?","Darren R. Jackson","Well, I think, more broadly, Scot, I mean you asked about a philosophical change. I think it is certainly getting ourselves squarely wrapped around sales and service as the key outcomes in the store. I mentioned we've sent a lot of messages to stores, and sometimes that begins to cloud what's most important. We're eliminating tasks, we're eliminating reports, we're eliminating metrics. We are changing our focus in getting our teams squarely focused on sales and service every day. Outcomes, not inputs. So that is work that we've been working on with the field team over the last couple of weeks. That messaging is being cascaded across our stores. Our teams want to hear it. It leeches [ph] them on sales, so I do think that there's going to be an orientation change as to how we run our business, which is a more of a field-centric led organization. Having great dialogue market-by-market on what we need to do to drive our business while really getting our team focused around selling.","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","In previous conversations with the management team, I know you haven't been privy to all of these, but my sense was that the company is -- that there's certain structural parts of the business that are just fundamentally different from commercial versus retailer. And I guess my question is have any of the changes that you've made, as you try and really refocus the company on being a commercial provider, had an adverse impact in any way, shape or form on DIY segment?","Michael A. Norona","Well, if you get all the way down the store level, Scot, you think about a general manager 5 years ago, what we asked that general manager to do is virtually exclusively focus on the DIY side of the business. So today, as that general manager puts together their schedule, what they have is more intense focus on making sure we have the delivery drivers in place, engaging with that CPP in a different way. And you can see it, as we've talked before, that you got to earn your way up in relationships. So when you're asking the general manager to go do visits to commercial customers 5 years ago, 6 years ago, we wouldn't have had that level of intensity and I tend to think about -- and part of the reason the changes that we've made, as you listen to George, is that, how do we now bring that consistency across all the stores and continue that cultural journey and so the Commercial business, unlike the Retail business, doesn't turn on and off based just on marketing and based on just seasons. It works based on relationships and we're asking that general manager and the sales teams to work together in a different way to continue to build the relationships with those key customers over time. And whenever you ask somebody to do something and to actually focus on something a little different than it was before, you do pay a little bit of a price in other parts of the business. But given the size of the commercial market and its growth profile, I'll go back to what we said, our original mission is to see this business to reflect the overall market as well.","Operator","Our final question today is from David Gober with Morgan Stanley.","David Gober - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just wanted to focus a little bit on the productivity gains that you saw in the stores. Could you give us a little bit more color on what really led to that? Was it just the changing in labor hours in the store or anything more specific that you can give in terms of color there?","Michael A. Norona","Maybe I'll start and then George can talk about specific measures. Over the last and, I think I mentioned it earlier, over the last couple of years, we've put some tools in that now allow us to measure individual productivity and then performance managed. So it allows us to -- and the whole idea of this is improving sales. So it allows us to set goals by individual team member, and it allows us to measure productivity. And that's been one of the opportunities in our company, and it's been a key focus for us. So what we saw during the quarter is record labor productivity, as measured by our sales per labor hour, so that's how we measure productivity, in terms of sales per labor hour. So I think we said in our remarks that we saw record labor productivity, which we're pleased at. And one of the things that we've spoken about and our pathway to 12% in our costs, one of the big areas that we've said there that has to improve is our labor productivity. So we're actually pleased with the actual measurement and the performance of our field teams and maybe, George, you can talk about some of the things we're doing to improve that.","George Sherman","Yes, Mike. I mean, I think we look at labor productivity that we experienced during the quarter and, in general terms, we're happy with that. On balance, we feel that we're taking expense out of the right places. With that said, anytime you try to trim out some expense, you always run the possibility of hitting some muscle and we're clearly open-minded that may have done that in some cases. So that's going to be something that we look at, but to Mike's point, we've seen increased productivity. That is a key metric for us. That is something that we have to do, is to get better sales productivity in our stores, and we're seeing that.","Darren R. Jackson","Yes. And David, you would expect us to also balance that in terms of what the customers satisfaction levels are. We get those by store -- IMR does research on the commercial side. In the second quarter, we saw those metrics improve. And so there's a delicate balance between cost and service levels. And it really goes back to the team because they have to balance those, so in the quarter, we are very pleased with our IMR scores, we were pleased with our NPD stores and our internal scores in the quarter.","Operator","I will now just turn the call back over to Kevin Quinn for any final comments.","Kevin Quinn","Thank you, operator, and thanks to our audience for participating in our second quarter earnings conference call.

I\u2019m delighted to be here with you on my first call since joining the Advance Auto Parts team. Since I walked in the door on April 11, I\u2019ve been working very closely with the leadership team. Importantly, I spent most of my time out in the field speaking with customers and team members to get a deeper understanding of our capabilities, challenges, and opportunities.","I\u2019ve been in my role for just over a month, so admittedly, it\u2019s very early. Having said that, based on what I\u2019ve seen so far and what you saw in today\u2019s earnings release, it\u2019s clear we\u2019re facing real challenges. The good news is I have tremendous confidence that we have an extraordinary opportunity to create value going forward even more than I thought before I joined the company.","On today\u2019s call, I\u2019ll share my initial observation on the business and the quarter. Then I\u2019ll turn the call over to Mike to address first quarter performance before coming back to discuss the overarching themes that will guide our path forward. We\u2019ll leave plenty of time at the end for questions.","Allow me to start with a bit of context on why I decided to join Advance. I wasn\u2019t looking for just any CEO position as I transitioned from a great role in another great company. I was looking for a CEO position in a company with scale, a company in a growing industry, and a company filled with potential, a company with a terrific opportunity where I could help dramatically improve performance and value. Without question, Advance hits on each of these objectives.","First, scale. Not only is Advance a large company based on revenue and market cap, we also have over 70,000 team members and a comprehensive North American footprint. Over the past few weeks, I\u2019ve been consistently impressed by the quality and commitment of our field team in both our store support center and in the field. Given this context, Advance provides the opportunity for me to do what I enjoy most, lead a large team and put tremendous focus on meeting the needs of our customers, engage directly with team members to develop and execute plans to meet those needs, and ultimately to drive financial and marketplace performance as well as shareholder value.","Secondly, growing. We operate in a very large and attractive $100 billion plus industry with strong growth rates. Candidly there are very few industries that offer the compelling growth rates that exists in our space.","And finally, filled with potential. As many analysts have delineated Advance has enormous upside potential. In particular, we have a tremendous opportunity to improve our customer service and competitiveness in the marketplace to accelerate growth.","In addition, I know, we can drive significant productivity and capability improvements in our supply chain and throughout Advance. And without question, we can do a better job of attracting, developing, and retaining talent in our company. Each of these by themselves will contribute upside in our performance. Together in the context of a large and growing industry, they\u2019ll generate meaningful value for shareholders.","The past several weeks have fully validated the perspective I had as I was considering the opportunity. There is no question, we have work to do. But it\u2019s clear the Board and my leadership team are prepared to take decisive actions on a number of fronts to create real value for shareholders over time.","Allow me to briefly touch on our Q1 results and outlook. Our comp performance in the quarter was disappointing. We continue to experience shortfalls on execution, driven by availability and service levels. From my perspective, as a new CEO coming to Advance, it\u2019s clear these challenges are within our control and can certainly be addressed. We\u2019ve been outflanked on supply chain, outperformed on core productivity metrics, and out executed on customer service. As a result our growth rate and profitability have been below that of our peers for several years.","Recently, this is partly due to our focus on the Carquest integration. The integration has been a necessary but distracting agenda for our entire team. It\u2019s caused us to be internally focused versus externally focused. The sum of all of this resulted in continued challenges in Q1 with negative comp sales of down 1.9%.","While these results are unacceptable from our standpoint the entire Advance team and I are excited by the areas where we see room for substantial improvement. We can and will make the necessary changes that will improve our value proposition and service levels for our customers. Clearly, we are not where we need to be in terms of competing at the highest levels to earn more trust from more customers to accelerate growth. My team and I are in the midst of a deep dive on our business and current performance, but we still have work to do. We have a view of the challenges facing the business and where we\u2019ve fallen short.","We\u2019ve developed short-term action plans to address these challenges and that begins with consistently meeting the needs of our customers. In fact, we\u2019re all very passionate about this. In order to return the company to a substantial growth trajectory, we must deliver improved fill rates, availability, and in-stock. In addition, we need to dramatically simplify the business and remove obstacles for our field teams, so they can execute with excellence. These focus plans are now in motion. The reality is performance improvement won\u2019t happen overnight. Our Q1 comps were down primarily due to the internal challenges I outlined a moment ago, notably our shortfalls with availability and service levels.","We also experienced accelerated declines on demand, particularly in our colder weather markets late in Q1 and that has continued into Q2. Based on this trend, we believe it\u2019s prudent to take a conservative approach and revise our assumption for annual comp sales to range between down 3% and down 5%. In addition, we\u2019re no longer targeting the 12% adjusted operating margin rate for 2016 that we previously communicated.","Make no mistake, we can and will do better, but we must be thoughtful regarding our expectations to ensure we set ourselves up for long-term growth and margin expansion. Right now, we\u2019re maniacally focused on what we can control, availability, customer service, productivity, and performance. We\u2019re redoubling our efforts around accelerating growth, reducing cost, and driving efficiencies throughout the organization.","At the same time, we\u2019re confident in our business, our people, and the opportunity that lies ahead. In fact we see significant sales growth and operating margin expansion opportunities over time. We\u2019re going to be very disciplined about how we drive growth and profitability. I\u2019ve tackled this kind of challenge more than once in the past and I\u2019m extremely confident this business can deliver operating margins well above 12% over time.","The reality is that achieving the target this year would prevent us from creating the platform we need to enable sustainable growth and operating leverage. For the balance of the year we\u2019ll sharpen our focus on execution and ensure we\u2019re responding to customers by delivering the parts they want, where they want, and when they want them. Well it won\u2019t take place overnight; we\u2019re committed to making significant improvement on this critical metric.","In a few minutes I\u2019ll highlight three overarching themes that will guide our path forward. Before I turn the call over to Mike for some brief comments on the quarter, I want to say a few words about the CFO transition we announced earlier today.","First, I want to thank Mike for his eight years of strong financial leadership during a time when the company more than doubled its market cap. Mike\u2019s played a key role in developing a strong finance team and building a capital structure to support our future growth. I'm very appreciative of Mike's willingness to support our transition with his leadership, passion, and experience. We\u2019ve commenced an external search for a new CFO and I've agreed with Mike that he will stay on until a successor has joined and an orderly transition has taken place. We've not set a time frame to complete the search as it has just begun, but will move as expeditiously as possible to bring in the best person for the role.","With that, let me turn it over to Mike.","Mike Norona","Thanks Tom and good morning everyone. Before I get into my comments in the quarter I want to say it has been an absolute pleasure to be part of the Advance team for the past eight years. While I\u2019ve decided that now is a good time to make a transition, I remain confident in the company's future and look forward to working with Tom and the rest of the team to ensure we have a smooth transition.","Now turning to the quarter. We delivered adjusted cash EPS of $2.51 for the first quarter primarily driven by softer than expected sales. Turning to sales, overall as Tom said, we were disappointed with our results as first quarter comparable store sales were down 1.9%. These declines were partially offset by positive growth and comp performance from WORLDPAC, CARQUEST Canada, and from our store conversions and consolidations.","As Tom touched on top-line performance reflected continued challenges with availability and lack of execution to improve service levels. We are intensely attacking these areas with urgency to make the needed improvements. With regards to external factors we saw a continuation of the milder winter weather that we experienced in Q4 that negatively impacted our sales, with lower demand towards the end of the quarter, as we experienced a late start to spring primarily in our colder weather markets where approximately 40% of our stores are located.","Seasonal categories with the largest impact during the quarter we see in batteries and hard parts categories which were partially offset by continued strong results in our break business across both commercial and DIY which saw high-single-digit growth during the quarter compared to mid-single-digit growth in the third and fourth quarters of 2015.","In our commercial business, the comp sales declines were more pronounced in our Northeast and Great Lake markets. The softness in seasonal category sales were partially offset by a modest increase in our commercial ticket size and the strength I noted in our break business. We continue to expand our customer base with our national account business and TECHNET which partners with independent repair shops also continue to add new members in the quarter. Within DIY we continue to see strong break results, but that only partially offset softness in our battery and battery accessory as well as other seasonal categories.","Our gross profit rate declined 58 basis points was primarily the result of supply chain expense deleverage due the comparable store sales decline. Our first quarter adjusted SG&A rate decreased 100 basis points year-over-year driven by our continued cost reduction initiatives and disciplined efforts to lower administrative and support costs offset by fixed cost deleverage of our comparable store sales decline.","All in first quarter adjusted EPS increased 5% compared to last year and adjusted operating income increased approximately 2.2% to $315 million and adjusted operating margin increased 43 basis points over the same period last year to 10.6%. Operating cash flow for the first quarter was approximately $75.3 million versus $102.2 million last year driven by a decrease in our AP ratio to 74.8% versus 76.5% last year. This decrease was principally driven by transitional inventory growth resulting from strategic investments in availability, the new WORLDPAC DC, and lower than expected sales.","Our adjusted debt to EBITDAR 2.5 times at the end of the quarter and we remain at our maximum stated leverage ratio of 2.5 times. We are committed to maintaining a balanced and disciplined approach to capital allocation to drive shareholder value while preserving our investment grade ratings.","Turning to the balance of the year. As Tom mentioned, we now estimate our annual comparable store sales to be in the range of negative 3% to negative 5%. Our highest priority and focus is to accelerate our top-line sales momentum. Despite deferring our 12% target we remain committed to improving our profitability which must be driven by sales growth and also continuing to simplify our business and remove cost furthest away from our customer along the organization to be more efficient and effective.","As outlined on our fourth quarter call, our integration activities this year are focused on two main areas. One development and testing work to enable us to combine our AP and CARQUEST supply chain and store systems into one network; and two, the continued execution of CARQUEST market conversion programs.","With that, let me turn it back to Tom.","Tom Greco","Thanks Mike. I would like to provide some perspective on the path forward based on what I\u2019ve seen and heard over the past few weeks. There is three themes which come to mind as I reflect on this. Appreciate the past, acknowledge the present, and anticipate the future.","Let me start by appreciating the past. I spent considerable time with the people who built this business over the years. These leaders have provided me with some timeless fundamental principles that remain true to this day. The late Arthur Taubman started Advance Auto Parts way back in the 1930s in the middle of the Great Depression. I have watched videos and read speeches, he delivered. He had a simple mantra, trust and listen to your customers and treat your employees like family.","His son Nick Taubman shared some of his perspective on Advance with me directly. Perhaps the most inspiring was when Nick told me that best part of the Advance Auto Parts story is ahead of us.","Temple Sloan Jr. was way ahead of his time when he founded General Parts and ultimately CARQUEST. He decided to focus on the independents and major in the commercial parts business back in the 1970s. His son Temple Sloan III met with me recently and reinforced the key levers of success on the commercial side. Making the right merchandizing decisions, gaining acceptance and trust of commercial people in our stores, along with the owners and technicians they serve, and taking care of our people.","Both Nick and Temple were maniacally focused on serving their customers and enabling their people. I cannot agree more with the advice I\u2019ve received from Nick and from Temple.","In addition, I would like to personally thank the Taubman and Sloan family for being so incredibly welcoming to me as I\u2019ve assumed this responsibility. Others like Jim Wade, Garnett Smith, and Darren Jackson could not have been more accessible and helpful in my onboarding. I intend to keep the communication lines open with those built this business.","While it\u2019s important to know where we come from to intelligently plan for where we must go, it\u2019s also clear that we must be willing to continue to adapt and improve.","Turning to the present, make no mistake. I entered this role with eyes wide open and an expectation that there were going to be many areas for improvement. As such I\u2019m going to call it as I see it. There are many areas that need attention and has substantial room for improvement. That\u2019s what got me excited about this opportunity and I believe that our near-term challenges provide an even greater mandate to materially improve the business operations. We are in the midst of a deep drive on operational diagnostics and areas for improvement. Over the next few months, we will be highly engaged in a thorough assessment of our business and current opportunities.","My intention is to come back to you later this year with our long-term vision for the company, along with specific goals and strategic imperatives necessary to achieve our vision. We\u2019re very hard at work. We need to understand precisely what\u2019s working, what\u2019s not working and the lessons learned surrounding our performance over the past few years.","In the short-term, we will ensure all of our team members are taking actions that propel our business forward. With an appreciation for the past and an acknowledgement of the present, our focus is on anticipating the future and the role Advance will play in shaping our industry and delivering results going forward.","Allow me to reinforce. We have a tremendous opportunity to create value at Advance much more than I envisioned when I joined the company. Over the coming weeks, we will construct a multiyear strategic business plan to get after our biggest opportunities.","This process is well underway and I already know one thing our framework will contain three primary chapters. First growth, we develop a demand based growth strategy that puts the focus squarely on customers and getting the right parts to the right places at the right time, predictably, reliably, and consistently.","Secondly, productivity. We\u2019ll instill our relentless focus on productivity while ensuring that we build new capabilities as we reduce waste and cost in our system. We\u2019ll reinvest some of these cost savings in future growth with much of the savings also dropping to the bottom-line.","People and culture, our people strategy will support our business strategy and faster diverse culture which mere\u2019s the market and empowers our people to win in the marketplace every day in every way. Allow me to provide a little more detail.","On growth everything we do starts and stops with the customer. We\u2019re going to make certainly understand precisely what\u2019s important to commercial customers and to DIY customers. To improve our customer service we need to elevate our operating intensity and customer responsiveness. We also need to increase the pace at which we make decisions and execute them. Bottom-line we need to become much more externally focused and in doing so; we\u2019ll get the right part to the right customer faster and more efficiently.","This leads to my second point around improving productivity. Our relentless focus on productivity necessitates establishing a clear defined productivity pipeline that will reduce cost and remove waste, while building new capabilities. This pipeline will be built around investing in those tasks that matter most in meeting customer needs and eliminating those that do not.","We\u2019ll also focus on our thorough assessment of our DC network, fleet, procurement, store productivity, and zero-based budgeting. Productivity will be the engine that fuels our growth.","Finally, nothing is more important than mobilizing our team members across all of Advance. We have an incredibly talented and committed team across the country and we must listen to them, much more than we have, empower them to act, and provide them with the tools and technology they need to win in the marketplace.","Our team members who are closest to the customers know them best. When we empower them and provide them the right tools, they can make decisions that improve execution and drive sales. We\u2019re a company comprised of 5,200 hyper local businesses in any given market were only as good as the talented district managers, general managers, commercial parts pros, and commercial account managers, and the rest of our team members in each market that help serve our customers every day.","We intend to meet the needs of our local teams and delivering for their customers. Our field teams have told us that Advance has been too reliant on the store support center to make decisions and instill processes. We are listening George and the rest of the Advance team are implementing a much more field centric organization where our team members are empowered to make decisions and held accountable for their actions.","I know this by itself will expedite our transition as we provide local leaders the tools, training, and technology required to succeed and win in the marketplace.","In closing I\u2019m humbled and honored to lead this great organization. We have a strong foundation upon which to build, to grow, and to thrive in a terrific industry. We\u2019re in the early days of developing and implementing a disciplined and comprehensive path forward and you will see more later this summer. Until then, our organization remains focused on delivering near-term commitments and business initiatives.","Without a doubt we have a lot of work to do. At the same time, I have tremendous confidence that overtime we\u2019ll deliver superior execution for our customers and outstanding environment for our people and ultimately will drive increased profitability and shareholder value.","Before we open it up to questions, I\u2019d like to take a minute to thank all of our team members for building this business to what it is today. I\u2019m excited to work together with my new team to help Advance reach its full potential.","With that let\u2019s open up the call for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions].","Our first question is from Simeon Gutman of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Simeon Gutman","Thanks, good morning. Welcome Tom and best of luck, Mike. My first question Tom I know it\u2019s early and you haven\u2019t laid out a strategic plan yet but in assessing capabilities and in diagnosing some of the service availability issues, anyway you have an instinct whether there is more of a process issue or an infrastructure issue at Advance?","Tom Greco","Hey, good morning, Simeon. I think my first reaction I\u2019ve been around to several distribution centers, meeting with people in the field, in our stores, I think it is more execution related. I mean the key metrics that are important to drive growth for us availability, fill rate, customer service. Those are the things where we\u2019re not entirely happy with the metrics surrounding those and we\u2019re going to be very focused on improving those key metrics. I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s something that will take place overnight but we clearly can address them and we\u2019re going to focus on making real progress on that over the next couple of months.","Simeon Gutman","Okay. And my follow-up regarding the comp forecast, I\u2019m just curious how much it reflects the exit rate of the business whether there was some national account noise in there or is it further disruption that you expect the business to be under just from some of the changes that are going to take place?","Tom Greco","We obviously spend a lot of time debating that. I\u2019ve been here for five weeks and our business in the last six weeks has been a step down without really an obvious reason, it\u2019s possible that the tailwind of an extraordinarily mild winter, we feel we may have pulled forward some of the business earlier in the year resulting in less hard parts business in the spring. But I won\u2019t blame it on the weather or count on the weather to help us. So I see a lot of areas inside our business where we aren\u2019t performing, executing, or strategizing as well as we should and certainly not as well as I expect.","So we\u2019re going to act and plan to improve our business and execute better to improve our performance with an even greater sense of urgency. It could be that this is a short-term blip versus a trend but we\u2019re not going to count on that and we\u2019re going to run our business based on the guidance that we gave you, we can\u2019t just hope for weather to get better. Hope\u2019s just not a strategy.","Simeon Gutman","And it doesn\u2019t sound like then there was a big like there was a big account loss at the national level causing some of the extra disruption or choppiness?","Tom Greco","No, there was not.","Simeon Gutman","Okay, thanks. Best of luck.","Tom Greco","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Scot Ciccarelli of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Scot Ciccarelli","Good morning guys. Just following up on Simeon\u2019s question. So Tom just to clarify, are you assuming that weather is not impacting the business and the 3% to 5% negative comp is just -- what -- if you just kind of ran at the current run rate through the balance of the year?","Tom Greco","I\u2019m not going to say this is not impacting it. I do think that some business may have been pulled forward earlier in the quarter and we smoothed it out obviously over the entirety of the first call it 20 weeks of the year. So it\u2019s clearly impacting but it\u2019s short-term, right, this is short-term up and down associated with weather, it happens in many industries and certainly in ours. But the ongoing trend that we see is the one that we guided to and we obviously hope to improve on that as we go through the balance of the year as we start to get focused better on execution and improve the metrics that we control but we want to be conservative in our estimate as we indicated in the release.","Scott Ciccarelli","But to get to the midpoint of the negative 3% to 5%, you basically have to run negative five for the balance of the year and I suspect that the business is probably comping down 5% now. But are you assuming it just kind of runs at that same run rate for the balance of the year and there's no improvement I guess that's what I'm trying to figure out?","Tom Greco","Yes, I mean you\u2019ll be able to do the math. I mean the net of it is we're being conservative, and we're going to make sure that we focus on the execution drivers that will driver business forward. We don't -- we're not counting on an overnight fix though Scott on some of these things, and that's why we've been conservative. Having said that, the entire leadership team, George and our field team is focused on beating that forecast by the widest margin possible. But for the purposes of our guidance we want to make sure that we're were reflecting the trends that we see at the moment.","Scott Ciccarelli","Well, you're new in the seat, so that makes sense. I appreciate it. Thanks Tom.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Chris Horvers of JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Chris Horvers","Thanks and good morning. Tom curious if you could compare the culture that you've seen in Advance versus what you\u2019ve experienced at Frito-Lay and Pepsi. What do you think are the big gaps, and do you think there's a culture gap between what you see at the corporate support center and what you've seen in the stores?","Tom Greco","Well, first of all, the culture here is really an impressive one, it's a proud culture, it\u2019s a winning culture, historically it's one that served customers and been incredibly focused on customers. We've got the -- we want to inspire our people out there in the field. We're trying to grow our business. I will say that and George has been addressing this over the last several months. We've got to a point where the center is making many more decisions than we feel is appropriate. I think the biggest contrast would be the front line organization at Frito-Lay, the front line organization here is essentially how we drive our business. If the front line is delivering out there in the marketplace, we're going to win every day.","I would say that at Frito-Lay we do engage and allow the front line to make more decisions than they do here and that's why George has evolved this model to more of a field centric or more customer centric model, I think that\u2019s the biggest difference. And I think over time we can certainly address that. We've got great field leaders, we have no lack of talent out there, but we've got to remove obstacles for them to compete and win in the marketplace and we're very, very focused against that.","Chris Horvers","Understood. So as a follow-up I guess playing devil\u2019s advocate, it sounds like you broadly think it's a -- as someone else mentioned a process challenge not necessarily a strategy challenge. So is that because you haven't had the time to actually get into the details of what the supply chain strategy is, what the -- what the integration strategy is, what's going on at Carquest or is it truly your perspective that we just need to come in here and basically work harder and enable the stores to drive the business?","Tom Greco","Well, I think Chris - I mean there are strategic opportunities, let me be clear with that. I think that a better more clear assessment of prioritization and the demand itself that\u2019s out there in the market, and finding better ways to meet the needs of our customers through a more holistic integrated supply chain strategy is all part of our agenda. We've already kicked off strategic planning process as I mentioned in our prepared remarks. The leadership team is excited to go through a deep dive, looking at the future, anticipating where we think the industry is headed, and really looking to better meet the needs of our customers going forward.","I wouldn't say it all process. I mean there are significant strategy opportunities and it will enable us just back to your earlier question remove some of the activities that we're doing out there in the field and ensure that we're very focused in our agenda. So that there is a -- it is a combination of strategy and execution. I don't want to just tie it all up to operating opportunities although that\u2019s where we\u2019re immediately focused, but we're going to do a deep dive on the strategy part of the business, and make sure that we're really, really starting to impact things that matter most to our customers going forward.","Chris Horvers","Thanks very much and best of luck. ","Tom Greco","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Seth Sigman of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Seth Sigman","Thanks good morning guys. So a question regarding the 12% target previously there were a number of drivers today mostly on the cost side and it seemed like a lot of that was in motion. Obviously we saw good SG&A leverage in the quarter, but as you think about the outlook now shortfall seems mostly related to sales. But is there a component here where we should be assuming higher spend going forward to address some of the issues you mentioned earlier?","Tom Greco","I don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible for me to answer that question right now Seth, I think it\u2019s still early, we\u2019re still going through how we\u2019re going to manage out the rest of the year. Obviously we want to take a very close look at the cost line, if we really believe this 3% to 5% outlook which is what we\u2019ve guided to, we\u2019re going to have to look very diligently at the cost and make sure that we maximize our profitability in the short-term without compromising customer service.","Seth Sigman","Okay, got it. So that means I guess there was a comment earlier that you remain committed to driving profitability this year. Is there anything more you can provide on that comment as we think about modeling out the rest of the year?","Mike Norona","Yes, that may be let me give you a little color. I think Tom has been very clear and the management team is very focused on the first priority is, we\u2019ve got to get the sales line going, because that will help the bottom-line. We\u2019re really pleased with the progress we are making on cost and we\u2019re going to continue to look at cost to make ourselves more efficient and simplify the business and those are things we can control.","The challenge we have when we don\u2019t have at the top-line is we\u2019ve got a pretty high fixed cost model. And when you have high fixed cost model, when the sales come in softer, you just deleverage. So I think those two work together, you get the top-line going again and we expect to see better leverage on the bottom-line but and the -- the other fact is while we\u2019re going continue to take cost out, there is going to be some reinvestment required, as we look at this different parts of the business and reigniting our sales base, so there will be a balance there but I think the primary focus is getting sales going that will give us the leverage to improve our profitability.","Seth Sigman","Okay, thank you. That\u2019s helpful. One more follow-up if I may is, as you think about the store footprint over time I realize it\u2019s early but any thoughts on how the complexion of the top-line needs to change overtime to improve profitability, i.e. closing stores and how we should be thinking about that?","George Sherman","Yes, Seth, this is George. We continue to keep everything on the table, so we clearly look at store opportunities whether it would be closings or new store openings, you\u2019re well aware we closed roughly 80 in the fourth quarter of last year that was we thought was the initial opportunity, we\u2019ll continue to look at profitability store by store. From a portfolio standpoint we will continue to move into more new markets like Dallas and getting further west.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Matthew Fassler of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Matthew Fassler","Thanks so much and good morning. I\u2019ve got two questions and the first Tom is for you, I guess at this point you are the third CEO in the past 10 or so years in addition to two interim CEOs. I know that everyone has meant well in terms of their intentions for the business. If you picking the uncomfortable position about talking about yourself a bit, if you think about how you think you\u2019re coming at this differently and what you bringing to bear these and perhaps the organization has lacked in the past to get to help it fulfill its potential would be very helpful.","Tom Greco","Well, I think Matt I had experiences like this in the past. I\u2019d been assigned to essentially three underperforming businesses in the past 15 years with my previous company in both Canada and the U.S. When I started each of those roles, the businesses lack growth and we were losing share and we did not have a robust productivity pipeline. When I left each one we are growing faster, we are gaining share, and we had a very robust productivity pipeline.","We also had a great leadership team in place that continued the business on. So I actually feel very good about this position. Now that I have been here for month I think the opportunity is far greater than I thought even when I got here. So I can\u2019t speak to my predecessors but I\u2019m very confident that overtime we will grow faster, we will gain share, and we will build a robust productivity pipeline that drives margin expansion overtime I have no doubt about that.","Matthew Fassler","That\u2019s helpful and then my second question is a bit of a financial question. I know you pulled the free cash flow guidance for the year obviously this business should still generate cash, how you are all thinking about allocating cash flow at this point in time as you think about opportunities like debt pay down, like share repurchase, any other uses that you contemplate.","Mike Norona","Yes, thanks Matt. So first of all the first big driver of free cash flow is getting our business going. When we think about our EBITDA and EBITDAR and our leverage ratios I mean the biggest contributor, there is a couple big contributors there is getting our business going, so that\u2019s first and foremost. Tom has talked about that on this call in his remarks, so that\u2019s the first one.","The second one is managing our working capital that\u2019s the second big driver in this industry as you know. And you saw inventory grew higher than we would have anticipated in the first quarter. The three big drivers around that were one WORLDPAC their inventory was up, I want to say close to 11% because we\u2019re opening in DC. So that one we\u2019re going to continue to do. The other big drivers the CARQUEST inventory was up quite a bit as we invest in availability in that business, it will start prior and we did a lot of investments last year. So we\u2019re going to continue to invest in inventory but we anticipate by the end of year, the inventory growth is probably up low-single-digits versus where it was and the other big driver was we delivered lower sales. So and that drove the inventory up. So we\u2019re going to be focused on improving our earnings and improving our working capital and that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to be focused on.","And then in relation to the deployment of capital as you know first and foremost getting the earnings going, that\u2019s first. And then as we think about that -- as we think about buyback, maintaining our leverage ratio was important to us, so we maintain our investment grade ratings that\u2019s a priority and then after we\u2019ve done that, we\u2019ve done a great job paying down our debt which gives us the flexibility to allocate capital to investing in the business or doing share buyback we currently have $415 million open to buy for our buyback.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Seth Basham of Wedbush Securities. Your line is open.","Seth Basham","Thanks a lot and good morning. My first question is just near-term one on the quarter\u2019s results. If you could help us Mike in just aggregating the comp performance by region. You mentioned 40% of the stores in the Northern regions big step down there in last six weeks may be some color there would be helpful.","George Sherman","Hey Seth, it\u2019s George. I would say that broadly if you look at our results, we did see a demand drop late in the quarter and I see that that was most pronounced in the Northeast. On the flip side, our best performance was in the Northwest and the Southwestern markets.","Seth Basham","Okay. Any sense of a gap between the performance between the Northeast and those other regions?","Mike Norona","Good size outperformed in the Northwest and Southwest.","Seth Basham","Okay. And then moving on bigger picture question for you Tom, as you think about the integration of CARQUEST with the Advance business, a key step in that process is supply chain. I know there is a strategy that\u2019s been laid out supply chain wise; you\u2019ve mentioned holistic view of your supply chain strategy; is therefore the integration of the supply chain being put on hold at this time?","Tom Greco","Well first of all just a comment on the integration Seth, I think anytime, I\u2019ve been involved in a couple of these were either an acquisition, an integration, some type of large scale structural change. The complexity associated with the change like this is significant and I think that in my brief time here, it\u2019s clear that the complexity was significant with this change; I think it\u2019s been distracting, it\u2019s caused us to be internally focused, we put obviously necessary resources against it. But as we go forward, as we move out of this era, I feel terrific about getting focus on the customer and making sure that we deliver the right part to the right customer at the right time reliably, predictably and consistently every single time and Charles and the supply chain team are doing a lot of work right now to really elevate our capabilities there.","So I think we\u2019re moving into a very focused agenda on the supply chain side. We\u2019re asking a lot of questions, we\u2019re turning over every rock; we\u2019re trying to make sure that we simultaneously provide better customer service and improve the cost structure of the business.","Seth Basham","Got it. Maybe as a corollary to that is there a timeframe that you have in mind to complete the integration of CARQUEST?","Tom Greco","Well I mean the integration is ongoing. We still have work to do there but I think we are definitely at the tail end of the integration and we\u2019re more focused on the supply chain itself and the strategic plan itself to make sure that we\u2019ve got a very clear agenda going forward across our full business not just on the supply chain side from a strategy point of view.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Greg Melich of Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Greg Melich","Thanks. I want to just get a little more clarity on how the business is trending now then I have a follow-up on strategy. The 3% to 5% guide understand it was worse towards the end of the quarter. Could you help us understand the progression on DIY versus the do-it-for-me and if the step function change you thought was less spending from customers you have on the do-it-for-me side or were you losing some of your first call accounts. Thanks.","Mike Norona","Yes, Greg, we don\u2019t think we\u2019re losing first call accounts, we\u2019ve seen again that drop off across both businesses a bit more pronounce on the DIY side. As you again moving to the Northeast it was deepest in that part of the country. And again both businesses but a little bit of a deeper impact on DIY.","As far as our customers if you look at our trends by product category and we would again point towards all great categories as a particular strength of ours which tells us that we\u2019re talking to our primary commercial customers day in and day out so.","Greg Melich","Okay, great thanks. And I guess more for Tom understand it\u2019s too early to have too much specifics around it but if you think about the leverage you can pull, what do you think is the bigger opportunity to get the customer back in the reengage. Do you think it is inventory investment, do you think its labor investment, do you think its capital? Is there any -- can you steer us in one where you think is the biggest opportunity is over the next year or two?","Tom Greco","Yes, I think Greg we\u2019re going to take a look at everything to be clear and I don\u2019t know that I can give you much specificity right now. I know the end result and the end result I\u2019m working back from there right. In the end we\u2019re in garage delivering a part right and then working back from there through the delivery itself, the taking it into the store the fill rate from the distribution center, those handoffs, how do we reduce those handoffs, how do we make sure we have the right assortment in the stores themselves so we get the right parts to the right customer, how we interface with the customer.","We\u2019re looking at every single aspect of how we drive growth and we are going to look for ways to think differently about the supply chain leveraging tools, leveraging new processes, leveraging technology to get at that so I\u2019m very excited about it. The team is focused on it, we\u2019ve kicked off the work and we\u2019re going to take a very close look at how we get a lot better at the execution side but it is going to require a very deep dive on where we think the future of this industry is headed, where we think demand is going which geographies are going to grow faster than others and integrating that into the supply chain strategy itself.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question is from Michael Lasser of UBS. Your line is open.","Michael Lasser","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Good luck Mike and welcome Tom. Tom, my question relates to some of the conversations that you might have had with the board on managing expectations for how long it will take to effectuate a sustained improvement in the business, can you help characterize that timeline for us?","Tom Greco","Well, first of all I feel great about our board. As you saw yesterday Jeff Smith is now the Chairman. I have gotten to know Jeff over the last several weeks. He has got great instincts on both the business and the people. He is available 24X7 and he is incredibly engaged in our business as is our board. We just had a full day meeting George was there with his division Presidents walking through the plans. They obviously ask a tough question and really engage and trying to help us think through the journey ahead. So, they are very, very involved is the first point you should know.","In addition to that they understand the challenges we face. I mean, clearly as all of you on the phone recognize there is a step function improvement that\u2019s required for our business and we\u2019re all committed to the achievement of that and we\u2019re going to lay all that out in the strategic plan. So I mean we\u2019re going to move as rapidly as humanly possible to get to the -- to get to that level of success and accelerated growth, reduced cost, and much more engaged people out there in the marketplace. So we have a timeframe in mind to get our strategic plan done it should be done by August we\u2019ll talk about it in the fall and we\u2019ll take it from there.","Michael Lasser","Well, based on your initial observations and some of your diagnosis, you think that this is something we can expect to see improvement in the second half of this year or is it more like next year and the year after that where the bulk of the acceleration and the better outcomes we\u2019re going to have.","Tom Greco","Well obviously the focus on execution should impact immediately. Clearly I don\u2019t expect the entire business to change overnight though. We\u2019ve got some big challenges that have to be addressed. I can tell you we\u2019re going to maniacally focused on availability, on fill rate, on speed of delivery, and on customer service and George and his team are all over that, we\u2019re totally aligned on what the metrics that matter most that we\u2019re going to be doing deep on right down to store number 5000. So we\u2019re very clear on that part.","It\u2019s just a question of the bigger strategic opportunity that we can unlock as a company that will really start to accelerate our growth and get us the kind of market share gains that we\u2019re working for a long term, while we\u2019re taking cost down and expanding margins, I don\u2019t have enough information for you to be specific on that at the moment. We should be in a position by the fall to talk more about that.","Michael Lasser","Okay. And let me ask you my follow-up question which is as you been able to do initial assessment on the business, I think the conventional wisdom is that part of what has ailed Advanced Auto is inferior systems, inferior store operating model, and competition formula can make changes with a long-term view in mind, it may require some sacrifice in the near-term, how much sacrifice might you will be willing to make in order to generate better results over the long run? Thank you so much.","Tom Greco","Well, I mean, again the COMPASS is going to be our customer. And in the end we\u2019re going to engineer our solution based on the absolute best possible experience that our customer can have out there in the commercial side and in fact on the DIY side. So whatever it takes to engineer that, we\u2019re going to do it, we\u2019re going to pull back from there and look at the experience they have with our people in the stores, with our commercial parts pros on the phone, with their experiences online and really try to elevate our focus on improving that experience and earning their business over time. That\u2019s not easy but I do believe that being clear about what that end state is, it\u2019s going to help guide us in terms of what those investments are going to need to be across our supply chain, across our technology and information system, and across our people and then the training that\u2019s going to be required to get our people into a place where they\u2019re really, really focused on the customer.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Dan Wewer of Raymond James. Your line is open.","Dan Wewer","Thank you. Tom, inventory levels have been elevated for a couple of years, I think we finished this quarter at about 12% per location. I\u2019m having trouble reconciling that against your comments about parts availability problems. Is it a question that there is a lot of inventory but it\u2019s just been the wrong products or in the wrong locations?","Tom Greco","Well Dan that\u2019s a good question, we\u2019ve looked very carefully at that and we\u2019re going to look much more carefully at that. I mean intuitively, your question is spot on and we've got to take a close look at our days on hand across our system, across every parts that we sell, across all of our distribution centers, across all of our stores, and make sure that we\u2019re balancing our inventory levels with availability.","Dan Wewer","The second question I have in looking at your contract when you joined a company, it talked about you have 12 months to present a plan to the Board of Directors. Do you really think it will take that long to device a new strategy?","Tom Greco","No.","Dan Wewer","What do you think more like six to nine months or do you have a sense what the --","Tom Greco","You know we\u2019re working on it right now and we certainly expect to be exiting the year with an aligned position on a strategic business plan for the next five years. So saying let\u2019s call it, September\/October, it\u2019s kind of the latest that I would see getting alignment to that plan.","Dan Wewer","Yes. And then the last question I have for you revolves around Jeff taking over as Executive Chairman. I know that he's been a proponent of selling WORLDPAC. I know that Jack disagreed with that view when he was Executive Chairman but you think that Jeff taking over that position that Advance will reconsider its thought on WORLDPAC and perhaps putting that up for sale as a way to generate shareholder value?","Tom Greco","Well, first of all of Jeff's been very, very engaged in our discussion around the strategic plan, WORLDPAC is a big part of our growth agenda. So that's new to me. I've not heard that to be candid. And we're very excited Bob doing a terrific job out there WORLDPAC, we're very excited about the prospects to that business. It's growing nicely for us, it's got great potential, we're very -- we just opened a new distribution center in Dallas. We just met with Bob yesterday, very, very exciting. So I don't know that whatever you may have heard Dan is still the case.","Dan Wewer","Well they started work when they were putting together their white paper back in September and looking at potential catalyst for the stock called out potentially selling WORLDPAC. That\u2019s the reason, I was asking.","Tom Greco","Yes, he wants to maximize shareholder value, and I think WORLDPAC is a key component in our ability to do that.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Bret Jordan of Jefferies. Your line is open.","Bret Jordan","Hi good morning. Following up a little on the last question, some of your suppliers in the second half of last year were saying they were some in-stock issues that they were seeing, and I guess that comes back around at the right inventory on the right places. Could you talk sequentially whether your availability improved or deteriorated in the first quarter from the fourth quarter or may be as a kind of your ability to say yes, when you get an order out to find a part in the store?","Tom Greco","I can tell you our availability deteriorated in the first quarter, and it deteriorated versus the fourth quarter and it deteriorated versus year ago. And that's why we're very focused on improving it going forward.","Bret Jordan","Okay. And then a follow-up question on the supply chain, I know at the end of the year you were thinking about a web-based POS system may be in the second quarter and then working on the IT to consolidate the distribution software in the second half. Is that still a timeframe to think about for those particular projects or is that going to be pushed out just given the sort of new eye balls on it?","Tom Greco","Yes that\u2019s correct, Bret. We have successfully piloted the new POS system and the new catalogue in a couple of stores. Early on like the initial results and we remain on track as far as the deployment of that POS system and catalogue and that leaves a sign track for the back half of year trying to align around these recent centers.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Carolina Jolly of Gabelli. Your line is open.","Carolina Jolly","Hi, thanks for taking my question. So regarding some of the higher inventory that we spoke of earlier in the call, how do you rework that do you see any opportunity to work with your suppliers to extend terms and may be grow your AP to inventory ratio towards some of your peer averages?","Tom Greco","Well first of all Carolina, I poured through your report on the weekend and it was great, appreciate the note. Clearly we want to figure out how to get our inventory levels down, I mean it's always a challenge, I mean getting availability up and getting inventory down is something that you're always going to focus on and that's one of the big strategic challenges as we construct our demand based strategy that informs the supply chain. And on the payables front I'll let Mike, may be speak to that question, if you want to talk to that Mike?","Mike Norona","Yes, I mean may be just related to your question, I mean we have return rights with our vendors. We have credits that we get from our vendors in terms of reserves that we have. So we feel good about that and competitively we feel so good there. I mean our focus is improving our availability, and making sure we have the right part in the right place at the right time. And so localized model that we run, so when Tom talked about availability that's what we're focused on.","And then you know what we know we have some inefficiencies in our inventories as Tom talked -- just talked about them. So we're going to work with that make sure that we have the right inventory and that we think there's an opportunity, I think the greatest opportunity to improve our AP ratio will be in our inventory management. We've done a great job with our terms. I think we're competitive on that front, but the bigger driver will be as we manage our inventory. And I would anticipate this year, I shared it with you earlier we expect our inventory to be up low-single-digits but 2017 is really a year that we would expect to see some real improvements in our inventory.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question today comes from Tony Cristello of BB&T Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Tony Cristello","Hi thank you, good morning. Thank you for taking the time. I guess Tom the question I have for you is I know you don\u2019t want to give too much in the way of a timeline or how you\u2019re assessing things. But if you could draw upon your experience of similar situations that you\u2019ve been in with the complexity of this sort of integration and such that\u2019s going on today, what was the average time it took for you to accomplish your goals and get to these level of profitability that you ultimately wanted to achieve?","Tom Greco","Obviously Tony it vary, but I think the question for me here is given the starting point can we move faster and that\u2019s the big question and I given 30 days in the job, it\u2019s difficult for me to provide that at this point. But I can tell you that I think the opportunity here are far greater than I\u2019ve seen in the previous three times that I\u2019ve been challenged with this type of situation. So I do believe there is a possibility that we will be able to impact it quicker as George mentioned, we are really focused on driving those customer service and execution metrics right away.","But we want to make sure we get the strategy right and that\u2019s why you\u2019re seeing the numbers that that you\u2019re seeing from us. The strategy and driving the value of this company through the roof over the next five years requires us to have the right approach for multiple years and that\u2019s why we are being very thoughtful, deliberate, and disciplined about how we approach the short-term guidance and then also our strategic plan which is going to be as we said earlier on the call completed sometime in the fall which will give me a much clear idea of what we\u2019re speaking about here. The ability to impact Q2, Q3 I don\u2019t know at the moment we talked about our sales trends. We talked about the need to improve execution how quickly that will impact short-term results is an unknown for me right at this point. But I do know this strategic plan that we pull together for the fall will be something that will enable us to really unlock big growth, big productivity and really gets shareholder value moving.","Tony Cristello","But and then I guess that\u2019s good color and I guess what I\u2019m trying to understand is this any different from a complexity standpoint that could say, hey this might be a two or three year strategy that we may this fall versus historical you\u2019ve seen things you turn quicker or take a longer period of time. I guess I\u2019m just trying to hit a baseline for how this may differ from what you use to in your past experience.","Tom Greco","Yes, I know I would say that it is not different and if you look up and which you could past experience that was not two years. I would say us impacting much before that.","Operator","Thank you. At this time I will turn the call back to our management as our CEO has a few closing comments.","Tom Greco","So obviously I want to thank all of you, for your questions. In closing, allow me to reinforce we\u2019re extremely well positioned. We have tremendous scale as a company, we\u2019ve got a passionate and motivated team there is no doubt we\u2019ve got many areas to improve. But the exciting opportunity ahead is to transform this business into the leader it should and needs to be. You can count on us to listen to our customers, you can count on us to be a customer driver culture, you can count on us to enable our team members to win in the marketplace. And ultimately we\u2019re all very confident that this will lead to increased value for all of our shareholders. So thank you for joining us today. And this concludes our call.","Operator","That concludes our call today. Thank you. You may now disconnect."],"619":["Advance Auto Parts, Inc.

Before we begin, Elisabeth Eisleben will make a brief statement concerning forward-looking statements that will be made on this call.","Elisabeth Eisleben","Good morning and thank you for joining us today to discuss our first quarter 2018 results. I am joined this morning by Tom Greco, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Jeff Shepherd, our Senior Vice President, Controller, Chief Accounting Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer; Bob Cushing, our Executive Vice President of Professional; and Mike Broderick, our Executive Vice President, Merchandising and Store Operations Support. Following their prepared remarks, we will turn our attention to answering your questions.","Before we begin, be advised that our comments today may include statements that are not historical facts and maybe deemed forward-looking statements as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. While actual results may differ materially from those projected in such statements, due to a number of risks and uncertainties, which are described in the company\u2019s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and on our website, we maintain no duty to update forward-looking statements made.","Additionally, our comments today include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to our quarterly press release and accompanying financial statements issued today for important information and additional detail, regarding both the forward-looking statements and the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures referenced in today\u2019s call. The content of this earnings call will be governed by the information contained in our earnings press release and related financial statements.","Now, let me turn the call over to Tom Greco.","Tom Greco","Thanks, Elisabeth and good morning everyone. Before we review our first quarter results, I would like to thank the entire AAP team as well as our network of Carquest Independents for their continued focus on improving execution and serving our customers better than ever. As a result of their hard work and diligent customer service, I am proud to report that the first quarter of 2018 was one of improved performance across many operational metrics. Our team\u2019s relentless focus on execution enabled us to deliver a sequential improvement in sales, operating margin expansion, double-digit EPS growth and a significant improvement in free cash flow.","In the first quarter, total revenue decreased 0.6% and comp sales were down 0.8%. The first quarter was a tale of two cities. We got off to a good start. Through the first 11 weeks of the quarter, our quarter-to-date comp sales were positive. However, our sales during the final 5 weeks of Q1 were significantly impacted by the delayed spring in our North Central and Northeast markets. Of course, spring eventually came in the north during the first week of our Q2. This combined with a much colder winter than we have seen in the past 2 years has resulted in a strong start to our second quarter.","Our adjusted operating income margin of 7.8% increased 71 basis points compared to the prior year quarter and our adjusted earnings per share increased 31% to $2.10. Rounding out the financials, we are very pleased with the impact of our continued focus on working capital resulting in free cash flow of $119 million, an increase of $149 million versus the prior year quarter. Consistent with the past several quarters, our Worldpac and Canadian operations once again delivered sales growth above the industry average in Q1.","From a category perspective, we saw an increase in batteries, lighting and wiper sales. Meanwhile, the performance of appearance chemicals and accessories was down mid-single digits. This was a result of unusually cold temperatures and above average levels of precipitation in March and April, particularly in northern market. The good news is spring-related demand bounced back nicely in May and we expect improved top line sales in Q2.","Shifting to the balance of the year and consistent with our comments earlier this year, we remain bullish on the top line growth outlook for both the category and AAP. At an industry level, the major demand drivers remained positive and more normal winter conditions to start the year is benefiting large failure-related categories like ride control and undercar. From an AAP perspective, our execution is improving every month and this is translating to improved performance on input metrics, sales, and market share.","Turning to the bottom line in Q1, we were able to control costs and drive productivity. This is evident in both gross margin expansion which increased despite lower sales and in a reduction of adjusted SG&A costs. SG&A costs were down in terms of both absolute dollars and as a percentage of sales versus Q1 2017. We remain dedicated to removing unnecessary costs in a highly disciplined fashion without impacting our customer value proposition. Jeff Shepherd will elaborate further on the details of our financial performance shortly.","I will now shift to an update on the key initiatives within our long-term plan. Starting with professional, in the first quarter, we continued the roll out of Advance Pro, our e-commerce engine for professional customers. I am extremely proud of our team in converting existing as well as enrolling new professional customers in Advance Pro. We now have nearly 20,000 professional Advance customers ordering through this platform. As customers enroll in Advance Pro, our B2B online penetration is increasing an important long-term metric for us. Under Bob Cushing\u2019s leadership, our Advance Pro catalog is more user-friendly than ever, and we are seeing momentum across our professional business on both the 1- and 2-year stack as a result.","Related to Advance Pro, we also completed the implementation of cross-banner visibility in February. As a reminder, cross-banner visibility enables both professional customers and all Advance, Carquest and Worldpac team members to see inventory, including in-market inventory on one platform versus opening multiple catalogs to find parts. The completion of this important step enables both customers and team members to find the breadth of AAP\u2019s industry-leading parts in one place and saves time researching and ordering. Cross-banner also allows us to say yes more often, increase close rate, and reduce order to delivery times. While it\u2019s still early, adoption of cross-banner functionality is increasing and driving accelerated growth across all AAP banners.","Finally, during the first quarter, we made progress on improving our assortment methodology. We are applying learnings from availability transformation stores to assortment, inventory positioning, and broader supply chain initiatives. We expect to complete the transition to demand-driven assortment by the end of 2018. We are confident this will further improve assortment store-by-store and market-by-market to better serve the needs of our customers. In terms of DIY, we are maniacally focused on improving the customer experience in our stores and making notable progress. We have increased several important elements of customer satisfaction, including the percentage of time we greet and upsell to the customer which is driving growth in units per transaction, or UPT. We estimate that every 10 basis points of UPT improvement results in an incremental $70 million in DIY sales. And despite recent progress, we still have plenty of room to grow here. While the majority of our DIY sales today take place in our stores, our e-commerce business is growing strong double-digits. As customer buying habits evolve, we are committed to further investments that enhance both online presence and strengthen the in-store experience, recognizing the value of customer service and expertise that our team members offer.","In terms of supply chain, we are working to strengthen and streamline our supply chain from end-to-end to meet the evolving needs of customers while improving efficiencies across the enterprise. We remain focused on a limited number of KPIs within supply chain with improvement to baseline execution as our first priority. During the first quarter, we made progress on fill rate, close rate, and store in-stock rate. We expect to see further improvements in each of these metrics throughout 2018. We are also focused on improvements in order to delivery time, safety and cost. In fact, the installation of Telematics across all our vehicles had a measurable impact on key safety metrics in the first quarter, including collision frequency rate, or CFR, which was down 15% since the end of 2017. Additionally, we are seeing improvement in our total recordable injury rate, or TRI, which decreased 10% in the quarter.","With day-in and day-out execution improving, allow me to provide an update on our longer term supply chain strategy. As a reminder, there are three key elements of our strategy: first, a market-by -arket approach to drive share; second, the optimization of distribution centers; and third, the repurposing of our in-market store and asset base. Here we continue to evaluate the entirety of our asset base and build the plans we need to gain share over time based on the future shape of demand market-by-market. In terms of DC optimization, we made the decision to close our Gallman, Mississippi distribution center, which we expect to be completed by the end of this year. We will work with both team members and customers to ensure we improve in-market availability while transitioning these stores to other AAP facilities.","In terms of our in-market store and asset base, we have implemented a much more rigorous approach to closing stores in Q1. Now, when we close a store in any given market, we are performing dramatically better than we had in the past in terms of redirecting our professional customers to other stores, retaining knowledgeable parts people and minimizing lease obligations. In fact, the 15 stores we closed in Q1 are far exceeding the targets established and we expect these changes to be significantly cash flow accretive over time. It\u2019s important to note that as we optimize our supply chain footprint and reduce redundant assets, we remained laser focused on accelerating growth. As such, we are filling in gaps where we have growth opportunities. In Q1, we opened two new Worldpac branches and they are off to an excellent start.","In terms of supply chain, in Q1 we refined our structure to be more in line with our store operations leadership team to strengthen cross-functional partnerships. Just recently, we announced the Division Presidents, Mike Creedon and Maria Ayres will now have dedicated supply chain leaders for the North and South division. I am confident these experienced leaders will help drive improved performance, expand collaboration across the business and enable us to implement industry-leading solutions as we continue to execute our supply chain transformation.","Finally, we have talked in the past about the importance of suppliers and external partnerships to help us better serve customers, drive sales growth, increase margins and improve cash flow. In line with these long-term financial priorities and after several months of discussions with Interstate Batteries, we have decided not to proceed with the partnership announced in December. The value envisioned by both parties was compelling, but circumstances changed. Our decision was made through the lens of our financial priorities and is in the best interest of our shareholders. We still believe Interstate Batteries provides a leading brand, quality products and an exceptional service model and we wish them continued success.","Separately, our battery business is off to a strong start year-to-date and going forward we are strengthening our partnership with the pre-existing battery supplier. We will continue to look for impactful partnerships with suppliers and external partners that create value for all parties. Consistent with this in April, we teamed up with Uber as its exclusive aftermarket auto parts supplier for the Uber Visa Debit Card program for driver partners. We expect this partnership will drive DIY traffic into our stores and online. Uber has over 1 million driver partners in the U.S. and Puerto Rico who depend on their cars to make money and will make this easier while saving drivers money at the same time. We are excited by the potential of the program and optimistic for a deeper relationship with Uber driver partners in the future.","Lastly, before I turn it over to Jeff for a more detailed review of our financial results, I want to take the opportunity to introduce our new Executive Vice President and Chief Technology Officer, Sri Donthi. Sri joined us in April with more than 20 years of experience leading and developing technology functions and reengineering IT infrastructure to support core business priorities. Technology, including the integration of artificial intelligence and machine learning tools into many of our core processes underpins virtually every initiative we have in-flight at AAP. We needed to find a proven global technology leader to help us fully realize our potential. After a lengthy search and vetting of numerous candidates, I could not be more excited to have Sri take the helm of our technology agenda.","We also recently announced a few changes to our Board of Directors. I want to personally thank Jack Brouillard and Bill Oglesby for their significant contributions to Advance for over 14 years. We are also pleased to announce Doug Pertz was elected by our stockholders at our annual meeting last week. Doug has over 20 years of CEO experience and has helped guide companies through operational turnarounds and growth acceleration initiatives. His expertise and guidance will be valuable as we continue to strengthen and execute our transformation plan. I want to personally welcome Doug to our board and look forward to working with him.","To conclude, I am pleased to introduce Jeff Shepherd, our Senior Vice President, Controller, Chief Accounting Officer and recently appointed Interim Chief Financial Officer. Jeff has been with Advance for nearly 1.5 years and in his tenure has already had a significant impact on our business and proven to be a great asset to the team. I am thankful for Jeff\u2019s leadership as we continue to execute against our strategic objectives throughout 2018.","With that, I will turn it over to Jeff for a review of our financial performance.","Jeff Shepherd","Thanks, Tom and good morning everyone. I will begin with the operational performance of the business and specific impacts on our margin results. In the first quarter, gross profit was $1.3 billion. On a rate basis, our gross profit margin of 44.3% improved slightly as compared to the prior year quarter of 44%. The primary driver of our gross margin expansion was a reduction in material cost and related items, which improved 86 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2017. These improvements were partially offset by increased supply chain costs, which reduced our margins by 54 basis points. Biggest drivers of our supply chain headwinds were related to transportation costs due to the higher fuel prices as well as the expected costs related to the new distribution centers opened in the second half of 2017.","Adjusted SG&A was $1.05 billion in the first quarter, a decrease of nearly $18 million as compared to the first quarter of the prior year. As a percentage of net sales, our first quarter adjusted SG&A improved 39 basis points from 36.9% down to 36.5%. Continued progress in our expense management during the quarter including third-party fee reductions and lower travel costs were partially offset by higher utilities, maintenance and repair costs and rent.","Turning to adjusted operating income, we delivered adjusted operating income of $224 million in the first quarter. Our adjusted operating margin of 7.8% was 71 basis points higher than the prior year and stronger than we estimated on our February call. The stronger margin performance was partially due to timing of certain costs primarily related to IT and marketing initiatives that were originally expected to be incurred in the first quarter. We expect these costs to ramp through the balance of the year with higher costs now estimated in the second quarter as we begin the rollout of a new marketing campaign currently in the final stages of design. As a result of changes in the tax reform law that reduces the federal corporate tax rate from 35% down to 21%, our Q1 income tax rate was 24.5%.","Moving on to our capital investments, we remain committed to the disciplined review of every capital project as we discussed throughout 2017. During the first quarter, our CapEx spending was $34 million. With several large projects scheduled to begin in the second and third quarter, we expect to spend between $200 million and $250 million this year. This is in line with our full year guidance. In addition, we remained laser focused on increasing cash flow and are pleased with the improvements to our first quarter operating cash flow of $154 million as well as our free cash flow, which was $119 million compared to a negative $30 million in the prior year quarter. Managing our cash has been a key focus for us for several quarters now and we continue to see success as a result of our working capital management program and disciplined CapEx policies both of which were implemented last year.","In summary and as Tom said, we are very proud of the continued improvement by our valuable team members in the first quarter. We are confident in our ability to successfully execute our transformation agenda throughout 2018, while growing market share and closing competitive sales growth gap among our peers.","With that, let\u2019s open it up to addressing your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Thank you. And our first question will come from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Simeon Gutman","Thanks. Good morning guys. My first question is on operating margins, they performed much better than you guided. Jeff, you just spoke about some costs that I guess ramp as the year goes on. My question is are your productivity and margin savings, are they at their full run-rate, and even though there maybe some costs that step up in the second and third quarter, if comps improve, could we still see an outsized amount of leverage?","Tom Greco","Hey, good morning, Simeon. I will start and I will let Jeff finish off. First of all, we feel really good about the progress we are making in driving productivity. As you saw in the quarter, we improved on gross margin rates, strong discipline in SG&A, and we are going to continue to focus on those three big buckets that we have been speaking about material costs, supply chain, and zero-based budgeting. We are investing some of this back to drive our long-term growth. We have invested on our technology platforms, particularly our B2C website, our Advance Pro catalog, which Bob can speak to later and then also machine learning tools around the rollout of dynamic assortment, which is coming later on in the year. So, the investments there, our investments in e-commerce, and brand building on the marketing side, and we continue to invest in our people, in particular, our frontline organization. So, there are some offsets to the productivity that we are driving, but we feel really good about how we are driving productivity, and I think that the discipline that we have put in place on a multiyear productivity agenda is really starting to come into play. So, Jeff can speak to the latter part of your question.","Jeff Shepherd","Yes. Thanks, Simeon. Yes, I think Tom hit on the productivity really well. Just a little bit more on the investment side, I think we said 25 basis point improvement. We had some deferral of some planned investments that we are going to invest in the first quarter, particularly in IT and marketing, with Sri [ph] coming on very late in the quarter, we want to make sure that he was reviewing some of these projects before we kick them off. And then marketing program, we just want to be really thorough and that resulted in just some delays in those investments. But if you look at the SG&A savings in particular this quarter and compared to the prior quarter, you could expect that up to 50% of that we are going to see coming through in the second quarter in the form of the investments.","Simeon Gutman","Got it, okay. And so I will make it part of my followup, but there is no change to the full year guidance and I will make \u2013 I will just ask my second question, is the arrival of spring it looks like we have seen a lot of pent-up demand, it normally brings some, given how cold the winter is are you seeing a bigger than usual start to this period? I am not trying to really gauge a number, but just trying to compare if the industry is going to go through this period of better demand, we have had what was a pretty cold winter. I am just curious if weather is still going to be part of the conversation or now that you have seen how the quarter is starting and we have had this winter breakage that we are just going to have a steadier rate of demand going forward?","Tom Greco","Well, as you know, we did reiterate our guidance about a month ago, Simeon. So yes, we are reiterating our guidance. We feel really good about the way the second quarter started to your point. As we mentioned in the prepared remarks, we were positive on comp sales through the first 11 weeks, and in that last 5 weeks, categories that you would expect to be really strong associated with spring: breaks, ride control, obviously big, big on the professional side of the business, appearance chemicals on the DIY side, they were really soft and they have come back extremely strong in the last several weeks as we start our Q2. So yes, the weather is going to be a tailwind for us this year we believe, and we really feel good about the way we started the second quarter.","Simeon Gutman","Okay, thanks guys. Good luck.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Bret Jordan","Hi, good morning guys.","Tom Greco","Good morning.","Jeff Shepherd","Good morning.","Bret Jordan","When you look at the market, and I guess regionally could you sort of breakout regional performance and then maybe talk about how you saw your performance maybe relative to the underlying demand trends in sort of share gain versus loss in Q1?","Tom Greco","Sure. Well, regionally, our strongest markets were in the west \u2013 southwest, northeast. It was really that middle corridor, Bret, where we saw some softness particularly as I said in that last 5 weeks, the central part of the country, Great Lakes even into Carolinas that you think about kind of Heartland being through Carolinas is where we saw the softness. I think in terms of the relative performance we feel great. We look at the last \u2013 we want you to compare us obviously on an apples-to-apples basis. We had a 16-week quarter, others had a 12-week quarter. If you look over the 12, if you look over the 16, in fact if you look over the last 28 weeks and you compare it to our relative performance prior to that, there has been a significant improvement in terms of our relative performance. So, I feel very good about how we are performing in relative terms; in terms of share, the only thing we can measure as you know is on the DIY side of the business. In our DIY share, we actually gained share in the first period of this year. Q1 was our best performance since I have been here. We did not gain share in the quarter overall in Q1. However, we had a much better performance than we have had historically and we are very focused on share gain going forward. So, we are going to be relentless on relative sales growth and market share and we are simply not going to be satisfied until we are at or above the market growth rate.","Bret Jordan","Okay. And then I will ask my usual IT question as far as distribution consolidation, you are shutting the Mississippi, DC, are you making some progress as far as that cross catalog lookup ability that you can start reducing the distribution infrastructure or maybe some idea around timing of your supply chain consolidation?","Tom Greco","Well and I will let Bob speak to cross-banner visibility here in a second, because that\u2019s really exciting for us. We have made a lot of progress on enabling our people to see parts across the enterprise. We are going to continue to look for opportunities to bring \u2013 to take unnecessary costs out and that essentially announcement that we are going to shut the Gallman facility down is obviously an important step in the right direction. We will be able to reduce our overall cost, our stem miles, all those kinds of things, but we are integrating as many parts of the business as we can, Bret and in particular cross-banner visibility is a customer-facing benefit as well as an employee-facing benefit and maybe Bob, you could speak to the progress on cross-banner.","Bob Cushing","Yes, Tom. So, on cross-banner, we had a number of phase there number one at the latter part of 2017, we had the store-to-store access and then of course midway through this quarter we introduced cross-banner visibility to our customers to Advance Pro. And what we have seen is conversion rate improvement, we have seen order value increases across it and importantly another outcome of this is this actually informed our store assortment strategy going forward, we are saying say yes, to the customer more often and is fully deployed throughout the entire enterprise.","Bret Jordan","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Lasser with UBS. Your line is open.","Michael Lasser","Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my questions. So, Tom, you outlined a lot of the progress you are making with your initiatives and yet you are still reporting a negative comp. And granted there are differences in your calendar, but your comp is still trailing behind your peers. So at what point do we \u2013 can we expect that the external observer to see your comp perform independent of some of the external factors like the weather such that all the work that you are doing is really going to shy growth?","Tom Greco","Good morning, Michael. I think the answer to that is as we get to the back half of this year is the short version. We feel good about the momentum. I think we are executing better than we ever have. Our key metrics are very positive as we look at what\u2019s happening in our store operations. Mike Creedon and Maria Ayres are leading the store operations team very, very successfully. We are being very surgical about how we execute and we talk about our units per transaction, seeing great progress there in terms of how we are executing in the store. We are up 8 weeks in a row now in units per transaction. We haven\u2019t seen that since I have been here. Our weekend service is very strong. Two professional customers were capturing more business on the weekends. So, each week that goes by, those metrics are improving. So, I do believe as we get into the back half of this year, we will be performing much more in line with the overall growth rate of the industry.","Michael Lasser","And if not Tom, is there a plan B, do you have to scrub strategy, you have to start over?","Tom Greco","Well, we have obviously engineered our infrastructure this year around our original guide. So, we feel very good about our guide for the year and our cost structure is engineered around the midpoint of that guide. That said, we feel very good about our sales performance and going forward we are going to continue to focus on market share and sales growth and better execution to drive that. So I would say we kind of have a plan B that was engineered into our original plan to answer your question, because the cost structure that we have built into the company for this year was engineered around a guide that we feel very good about.","Michael Lasser","And then let me just try and clarify some of the comments you made previously about your market share, so you said you have gained market share on the DIY side thinking lost market share overall that would obviously imply you lost some share on the commercial side, why did you think that\u2019s the case?","Tom Greco","Well, first of all, what I said was we gained in the first period of the year, there is four periods in the year, right, Michael. So in the first quarter we did not gain share in the DIY side. So to be clear, we lost share on DIY and that\u2019s improving significantly from where it was. So, that\u2019s on the DIY side of the business. On the professional side, we are making a lot of progress. We look at our professional business holistically now across all of our banners, we aggregated under Bob\u2019s leadership and we are looking at 1 and 2-year stacks on that business and we like what we see.","Michael Lasser","Okay, thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Greg Melich with MoffettNathanson. Your line is open.","Mike Montani","Hey, guys. Good morning. It\u2019s Mike Montani on for Greg. Just wanted to ask if I could. You mentioned the distribution center closing in Mississippi and then there was a comment in the press release that there would be four more phases of layoffs before the end of the year in addition to that. So, I guess the question was is it reasonable to think in terms of DC rationalization that there could be another full incremental DC slated for closure and does each DC typically serve about 100 stores just as we think about it for modeling purposes?","Tom Greco","Well, obviously these are really sensitive topics in terms of both the competitive and for competitive and internal reasons, so we are not talking about any additional changes. We feel really good about how we are executing the Gallman closure. We are measuring our transition of the stores very carefully. I think we treated our people extremely well through that change. We have offered them alternative employment outside of AAP where possible and we are making sure as we transitioned the stores that we don\u2019t disrupt the customer and so we measure our metrics in Gallman obviously before and after we measure our metrics in the receiving DCs before and after. And so far we are executing this plan very, very well. So, the future plans are sensitive. So, I am not going to comment on specifics there other than to say that we feel really good about how this one is going and we will handle it as it comes.","Mike Montani","Understood on the competitive dynamics there. And then if I could just follow-up this is two-parter, one was the comps obviously improve from down to 06 to down 08, is it more of a ticket size improvement or was it transaction counts. Can you guys just give some color and update on overall where transaction counts up or down in the quarter and how is that changing?","Tom Greco","The DIY side is primarily transaction. As I said earlier, we are making a lot of progress on units per transaction and of course that translates into dollars per transaction. On the professional side, we are actually making progress on both. So good progress on the professional side, DIY, we do have an opportunity on transactions which we are working on. We have got a new marketing campaign that we are contemplating right now and ready to bring to market in the back half of this year that we feel very good about. So, the DIY transactions, is the big opportunity area.","Mike Montani","Just the last follow-up was in terms of the store rationalizations that you all have done lately, it sounds like there was noteworthy improvement there on cash flow as well as on retention of business. So, is there any commentary you can share in terms of historically maybe kind of 20% to 30% retention rates, is that looking more like 50% to 60% now with the store closure work you are doing and with the stores basically that were closing EBITDA negative and that was the main criteria for the closures?","Tom Greco","Yes. We obviously have a very clear set of criteria that we put our stores through in order to make a decision like that. And if there is multiple variables that go into that model to make sure that when we decide to close a store, it\u2019s going to drive cash flow for the company. The process that we used in the past I am not going to go into a lot of detail on it, because it wasn\u2019t a very good process. We essentially closed stores rather rapidly. It was concentrated in different parts of the country. It was difficult to execute it in a way that we would be proud of and we gave up a lot of market share and didn\u2019t drive cash flow. Now, when we look at the stores, we look at the whole country, we make sure that the stores that we are talking about were very clear about how are we going to retain the professional sales in that area, how are we going to retain the DIY sales, how do we retain the team members. We want our team members, the great parts people that we have here at Advance to stay with Advance. And then of course we want to minimize the lease obligation that we have to the landlords, where we are renting the facility and all four of those variables are measured rigorously every single week. So, we set targets around each of those. The targets that we set are obviously resulting in a positive outcome for the company and I can tell you we are exceeding all four of those dimensions as we go forward, because the receiving stores, the districts that we have, the Region Vice Presidents that are managing it are all over this. And we said 15 in the quarter. We have dispersed them across the country. So, it\u2019s very manageable for the Region Vice Presidents to manage and I got to say I am really pleased with how they are managing this and the discipline they are having to drive our performance against each of those criteria we spoke about, so great progress there and we will continue to work it.","Mike Montani","Helpful color. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Horvers with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Chris Horvers","Thanks. Good morning. So just want to follow-up on the commentary about the reinvestment, so you beat first quarter by about \u2013 EBIT was up 70 basis points year-over-year and you have said up to 50% of that gets pushed out into the second quarter or is it the second and third quarter?","Tom Greco","Primarily, we are looking at the second quarter. These were again investments that when we originally put our annual operating plan together we anticipated making these investments in the first quarter, because we are going through a very detailed and thoughtful process you got delayed, but we don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be delayed beyond the second quarter. So we expect this reinvestment in the second quarter.","Chris Horvers","Understood. So, in the context of your original guide I think you said sort of up flat 50 on the operating margins, so as you think about that second quarter, do you expect 2Q operating margins to see expansion or are you implying that 30 basis points here could be \u2013 that could be a headwind and decline in the operating margin in 2Q?","Tom Greco","Yes. We are not going to comment specifically on second quarter operating margins, but we feel really good about the guidance that we have put out there for the year and we think even with these investments which again were just deferrals in the first quarter we are going to be in line with what we have communicated in February and reaffirmed last month.","Chris Horvers","Understood. So it sounds like you sort of beat by 10 basis points on the first quarter, its early three quarters ahead of you so we are just going to reiterate the year basically?","Tom Greco","Exactly. You got it.","Chris Horvers","And then on the gross margin was there a capitalized inventory cost headwind in the quarter sort of like what happened last year and do we get some of that back perhaps from last year and what\u2019s the expectation for that in the upcoming year? Thanks very much.","Tom Greco","Sure. Yes, sure. The capitalized inventory was really immaterial kind of flat year-on-year and that\u2019s really because if you look at the build in the inventory was relatively consistent, little bit down compared to last year, but for the balance of the year, we really expect that to be neutral on a year-on-year basis and that\u2019s largely because we expect to drive our inventory down consistent with last year. Remember, last year was about $157 million of inventory reduction and we feel confident at this point we will be in that range again this year.","Chris Horvers","Awesome. Best of luck guys.","Tom Greco","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Seth Sigman with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Seth Sigman","Thanks for taking the question. Hey, guys. My question is on the top line, so if you look at the positive performance through most of the first quarter and you also discussed strong trends to start Q2, I am just wondering if we cut through all of the weather or noise any sense on whether comps year-to-date are positive, can you give us some sense of the year-to-date comps that will help us sort of cut through all that weather noise?","Tom Greco","Yes, Seth, obviously I can\u2019t comment on that, you will be able to do the math on our second quarter, but we are excited about the start to the second quarter. All of the categories that you would expect to bounce back after a soft finish in the first \u2013 on those spring-related categories have come back really nicely, brakes, ride control, under car, appearance chemicals. So I mean, literally the very first day of our second quarter was when we saw a big shift in the weather and it really did benefits the last couple of weeks. So, we feel great about the year-to-date performance and excited about how the balance of the year is going to unfold.","Seth Sigman","Okay, great. That\u2019s helpful. And then just to clarify so with the store closings and all the supply chain work that you are doing at least on the store closings, it sounds like that\u2019s performing better than in the past, I am not sure that\u2019s different than the current plan you laid out for this year, but I am just wondering are these benefits that are already baked into the guidance or to the extent that you continue to close stores and they perform a little bit better that would be upside to what you have laid out? Thank you.","Tom Greco","Yes. I mean, in terms of the overall cash flow performance, our performance is better than we are seeing than we originally targeted. So as I said, it\u2019s not a lot of stores at the moment, but as we start to get down the road and build this muscle stuff, we feel really good about our ability to drive harder and improve the cash flow performance over time. So, there was a target built in to our original operating plan and we are exceeding that target, which is good news.","Seth Sigman","Great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt McClintock with Barclays. Your line is open.","Matt McClintock","Hi, yes. Good morning, everyone. Tom, you gave some pretty impressive sensitivities for what an improvement in UPT can do for your business and I just like to get some more conceptual, I\u2019d like to conceptualize that a little bit better and put some context around it, 10 basis points of an improvement, how much of an improvement could you go there? And when you talk about already starting to see some improvement are we talking in single basis points here, because if you just do some basic math on those numbers you can get to a pretty impressive comp store sales? Thanks.","Tom Greco","Yes. Thanks, Matt. I mean, we obviously benchmark UPT and we look at what other people do in the industry and we are in that 1.95, 1.96 range. We know others are in the 2.4 range. Lots of food on the table there is the bottom line. So, how far are we growing? We are up 40, 50 basis points \u2013 sorry, 4 to 6 basis points like 1.92 to 1.96 in that range. So we are early stages, but we are growing it and we have been declining it for three straight years. So we think there is a lot of room for us to grow on UPT and get up to the industry standards. And our people are doing \u2013 there is very much embracing it. They are greeting customers when they come in the store. They are talking to them about what type of job they are trying to work on, what problem they are trying to solve and they are working really hard at attaching sales to really help the customer solve the problem they are trying to solve. So, we feel great about it not just from a financial point of view, but from a customer service point of view, we are really helping our customers out and it\u2019s showing in other metrics as well.","Matt McClintock","So if I could just follow-up on that with, it seems to be more people driven in terms of training and just changing your process of how you interact in the store, does that mean that because this is kind of early stages that we could see much more meaningful acceleration from the 4 to 5 basis points that you have kind of experienced so far and maybe into the tens of basis points in a single quarter at some point?","Tom Greco","I think that we are definitely going to accelerate. I mean, each week goes by, we are seeing improved widening of it, Matt and we have a lot of our team members really weighing in on, here is some ways for us to do even better on this and Mike Broderick and his team are fielding some of those ideas to make it easier for our people to essentially drive that units per transaction. So, I don\u2019t see any reason why it wouldn\u2019t accelerate moving forward to answer your question.","Matt McClintock","Thanks a lot for the color, Tom.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Fassler with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Matt Fassler","Thanks so much and good morning. As you indicated would be the case we are seeing significant transformation costs in any given quarter and I believe you talked about those relating primarily to supply chain, so can you give us an update given that those numbers are coming in as guided, where those dollars are going and how far ahead some of these investments are looking, i.e., are they for supply chain changes that you expect to implement over the next couple of years?","Jeff Shepherd","Yes, sure. If you just look at the quarter, we are pretty consistent with last year, but what you are really seeing is the shift. Last year, we were still focused on the GPI integration and those dollars are really shifting to the transformation in the supply chain and footprint optimization. So I think what you are going to see is the continued effort not only in our distribution centers, but in our store footprints and those who were going to be very surgical about that Tom has already addressed the work that we are doing in Gallman and we got to be real careful and very strategic in how we implement these, because Gallman, for example, serves over 200 stores. And so we got to make sure that when we do these we don\u2019t interrupt anything related to the store or serving the customer. So we are going to continue to invest in this area, where we feel really good about the guidance that we have given of those 140 to 180 and it\u2019s going to be driven by these types of initiatives throughout the balance of the year.","Matt Fassler","And to be clear, you typically designate dollars into those buckets when they relate to new or closing facilities or is there work being done in existing facilities that\u2019s classified as transformation?","Jeff Shepherd","Probably won\u2019t go into details into exactly what we put in there, but generally speaking, these are broader transformational initiatives. So, if we were just going to routinely close the store that would be an example. We would not put it into a unique transformational expense, but what we are trying to do with this category of expenses is delineate normal business operations from huge transformational larger types of projects and initiatives.","Matt Fassler","Got it. And then by way of quick follow-up on working capital you have just based on benchmarking vis-\u00e0-vis peers kind of a $1 billion plus opportunity if you were to get your payables ratio to where your most direct competitors have theirs, I know that numbers have been down year-on-year kind of flattish year-on-year in this quarter. At what point would you feel comfortable starting to lengthen those terms a bit when you think of being able to start to monetize some of that opportunity?","Jeff Shepherd","Are you speaking specifically to the AP ratio?","Matt Fassler","Yes, exactly.","Jeff Shepherd","Okay. Yes, so couple of things there. First of all, Mike Broderick and his team has done a fantastic job of working with the vendors and we are in the process of extending terms wherever we can get the opportunity, we want to fully utilize our supply chain financing and continue to work on those terms. And then on the inventory side, we are being very, very strategic in how we are going about working down our inventory. There is really two phases. One is being more strategic with the way that we are purchasing, I am sure you saw we didn\u2019t increase our inventory as much, some of that is being a lot more strategic with the spending patterns that we are deploying across the enterprise and more importantly is we have got a much better process in place and how we are deploying the existing inventory on hand. And that\u2019s really important, because we have good inventory, there is no secret we have a lot of it. But what we are doing is we are taking that inventory and we are deploying it into the places where it\u2019s going. And that\u2019s going to take some time. And again, we want to make sure we do that without interrupting the stores and making sure that we have discipline throughout the entire process. It\u2019s going to take some time, but we are still confident we can get back to a market-based metric.","Matt Fassler","Got it. Thank you so much guys.","Tom Greco","Thanks, Matt.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Scot Ciccarelli","Good morning, guys. Scot Ciccarelli.","Tom Greco","Hey, Scot.","Scot Ciccarelli","Hi, guys. So two questions. First of all, how are you measuring the impact of improved inventory visibility cross-banners, is it just through the UPT, but obviously that\u2019s being impacted by a lot of different factors or were there other metrics you can kind of zero in on just kind of help us understand whether we are seeing I guess expected improvements on that front?","Tom Greco","A couple of different ways, I mean I think the first way we weren\u2019t measuring this concretely Scot before, but now when we get a call from a customer or if someone orders on Advance Pro, we are capturing that information. So, someone called us and asked us for A part in A store, we now know that, that lookup occurred. And when that lookup occurs we measure a couple of different things, we measure is the part available in that store. So think of that as the store in-stock rate and then we click it up a couple of notches right, obviously, beyond the store is it available in a group of stores in that area, is it available in the broader market area, is it available in our system. So each of those we measure, so we know where the part is fundamentally and how close it is to the customer. And obviously we measure what we call the close rate, which is there are times when we have the part, but we still don\u2019t close the sale and there maybe other reasons for that, so we want to understand what those reasons are. But all those metrics together are going to eventually connect to this notion, we call dynamic assortment, which Mike Broderick is driving, which is a new way of assorting parts, which is connected to the demand that\u2019s coming in and quite similar honestly to the approach that Bob Cushing has had at Worldpac for a number of years.","Scot Ciccarelli","Interesting. Okay, thanks Tom. And then second question is what are your plans for cash now with operating cash flow and free cash flow improving, year-over-year you guys are up about $500 million or so on a net cash basis. So I am just kind of wondering what\u2019s the right way for still think about what you guys are doing on the cash and debt front? Thanks.","Tom Greco","Yes. Our cash priorities haven\u2019t really changed. First and foremost is we want to make sure that we maintain our investment grade rating that\u2019s very important to us as we fully utilize the supply chain financing. So we keep that kind of front of mind as we think about using our cash here in the future. First, we want to reinvest in the business and we have implemented a very disciplined process on how we do that. Every single project is reviewed to make sure it has the highest ROI and best return for our shareholders. That\u2019s our first priority. Second priority is returning cash to our stockholders and our investors. And we haven\u2019t announced any share buyback here, but it\u2019s something we would be looking at, but again, our first priority is making sure that we have the investment grade finance or investment grade status as well as investing back into business in high ROI projects.","Scot Ciccarelli","Got it. Okay, alright. Thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Chris Bottiglieri with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.","Chris Bottiglieri","Hi, thank you for taking the questions. It\u2019s hit on a little bit before, but noticing that the Carquest consolidations conversions looked to kind of a standstill, but you closed a small number of AAP AI stores, but then I guess combining the fact that you seem pretty pleased with your holistic approach to store closures. So I guess my question is how do you balance these two factors? Is there an opportunity given how happy you are to reaccelerate closures? And then just lastly semi-related like anything how do you think about store count growth, do you ever see that being positive again or was that kind of not in the cards right now?","Tom Greco","Good question, Chris. I mean, I think the question on accelerating closures it really emanates around our confidence level and getting a individual store closure right and we feel really good about how we are now executing against that so to the extent that a region is really performing well in terms of how are executing. We are retaining the sales. We are retaining the team members. We are getting out of leased obligations that are onerous. We are in a very good position to continue to do that. Now, to be clear, the overall goal here is to drive top line growth and expand our market presence throughout the country. So there we are looking at each market individually and where the market is headed. So, you take any given market in the country we want to know in the next couple of years how much growth are we going to see in DIY, how much growth are we going to see in professional in relative terms? What\u2019s happening in terms of ordering on the professional side through an online platform versus calling in all of those variables go into the mix and then we decide what we are going to put in terms of our infrastructure into that market. And as we said we opened a couple of Worldpac branches in the first quarter, you are going to continue to see us look for opportunities to fill in where we can drive growth. So, it\u2019s not just about closing stores, it\u2019s about optimizing our footprint in each market and driving market share gains with less infrastructure, so it is a very much an holistic approach where we look across the enterprise at Advance, Carquest, Worldpac, Autopart International, our Carquest Independents who by the way had a great quarter. We are continuing to have a lot of success with our independent platforms. We are growing that base. There is cases where we have sold an Advance corporate store to an independent and they have done very well with that. So, it\u2019s very much a holistic approach to drive our top line sales and do so in a more efficient fashion.","Chris Bottiglieri","That makes a lot of sense. And then just the cross-banner visibility maybe ultimately think about store density or is it just maybe not material not to affect that decision process?","Tom Greco","Well, we are learning a lot with cross-banner visibility. I think we are at the early stages and we really like the fact and so do our people. Every week, we are seeing an acceleration of sales that we have converted from cross-banner visibility. So, it is informing our end-to-end supply chain work. It\u2019s informing how we route in any given market and it\u2019s informing our asset base. So, there is a lot still to be done there to be honest, but making it available, making those parts available to our people and letting them figure out how to go get the part, that was kind of job one, so we can delight the customer. Now, we have to do it more efficiently and that\u2019s the approach we are taking.","Chris Bottiglieri","Got it, okay. And sorry one final question all related, since you don\u2019t have kind of like a store algorithm right now, which you are kind of like optimize in consolidating, could you help us think through conversions like \u2013 you may think that those would be lower volume stores when you converted them, you got some sales slippage, which means they were getting lower volume than they were previously. Do you think those stores are structurally lower volumes or are you getting some kind of like tailwind over time as those stores ramp up the way new store would and then that\u2019s it for me?","Tom Greco","Yes, I want to make sure I understand your question. So, when you say conversion specifically, what are you referring to?","Chris Bottiglieri","So you have the old Carquest stores, you converted them to an AP store, so presuming the productivity was $1 million, you had some sales slippage, how that like that store that before is converted to an AP store would be a lot less productive than your legacy stores, how you think about those?","Tom Greco","Yes. I think how I\u2019d answer that is the approach of gee, we want to make everything Advance, is not the approach that we are taking as it pertains to our footprint. In fact, the Carquest brand has a lot of equity in different parts of the country in particular in the west. So, we are not kind of \u2013 I will use the word blindly looking to just convert a Carquest store to an Advance store. We look at the performance of the store the cash flow of the store isn\u2019t performing well with the sales, with the profitability, with the cash flow, with the proximity of that store to another store, with the competitive footprint around that store, where are those sales going to go were we could close it. Those are the kinds of variables we put in there and then when we come to the conclusion to close, we measure very rigorously, but it\u2019s not an effort to just say hey, we want to convert Advance stores to Carquest \u2013 sorry, Carquest stores to Advance. We are looking at making sure we drive the cash flow of the company and in many cases, Carquest stores performed very well and there is lot of markets where we have got a lot of equity.","Chris Bottiglieri","Got it. Okay, thank you for the help. Appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Baker with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Mike Baker","Thanks. It\u2019s been a long call. So, I will be real quick. Just to clarify, I think to Mike Lasser\u2019s question earlier, you talked about comps in the back half, was the answer \u2013 by the back half you expect the comps to be up in line with the industry or in the back half you expect positive comps. And I guess the key of the question is if it\u2019s going to be back half comps positive, why wouldn\u2019t we expect comps to be positive in the second quarter, I get you over tough comparison, but it sounds like you are really pleased with the start? So really, that\u2019s the key point we are trying to get to. Thanks.","Tom Greco","Well, first of all, we do \u2013 we are driving hard to get our sales growth in line or above the rate of growth of the industry and we are driving hard to achieve that in the back half of 2018. In terms of the second quarter, we are not going to comment specifically, but we like the way it started. There is certainly some demand that shifted from the tail end of the first quarter into the second quarter at least for us and we feel very good about the performance of the key categories in here and we are going to keep driving it. It\u2019s encouraging Mike, because a lot of those categories have not performed at this rate for a couple of years and we are seeing the benefits of having a lot of potholes in the road and some a difficult winter in the north part of the country and given our footprint that\u2019s a good thing for us.","Mike Baker","Okay. And two follow-ups on that one, could you remind us how the months paced in the second quarter of last year? And again one more follow-up, so just to be clear, so you are not necessarily signaling down comps in the second quarter up in the back half, you are just not really commenting on the second quarter?","Tom Greco","Right.","Mike Baker","Okay. What remind us the comparisons by month last year?","Tom Greco","Last year, we obviously had a different cadence. I think we ended up with a slower start to the year and it was a little bit stronger towards the end. But that\u2019s kind of the way it played out, but let me say this, I mean, the 2-year comp performance which we look at very carefully is improving. And if you look at the last 28 weeks, the 2-year comp is a significant improvement over where it was previously and for a long time. So, we feel good about where we are in the comp sales side. The 2-year we are going to keep watching, we are going to keep driving our market share against all of the categories that we are competing in. And we like the start to the second quarter.","Mike Baker","Okay, understood. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Zach Fadem with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Zach Fadem","Hey, good morning. Thanks for fitting me in. On the double-digit e-commerce growth, I know its early days here, but how much of this do you attribute to the recent website improvements and thus far could you comment on what you are learning about your customers based on the online sales and for the customers that are buying online, do they prefer delivery or pickup in store?","Tom Greco","Sure. First of all, we are moving at a very rapid pace now on our online platform, much more rapidly than we had been doing. We are releasing multiple releases in the quarter now as opposed to the pace that we are at. So just as an example in the first quarter alone, we had several releases, one which improved the page load time of our \u2013 both our digital our mobile platform as well as our desktop platform. We changed some font sizes, which made some big difference on our pricing. We introduced some new monitoring tools. There is a lot of things happening on the e-commerce and mobile website side. We have enabled a distribution center to start delivering to ship to home, which wasn\u2019t able to do that before. So, you are going to see a lot of work done to continue to improve our online experience whether that\u2019s through desktop or through a platform. The metrics that we look at are continue to measure our traffic obviously, which I think you have seen in other reports that have come out as has really been growing, I think we are up in the 90% range in April. There is \u2013 we still have work to do in conversion rate. Our conversion rate is improving, but not at the kind of rate that we would like to see. We measure conversion rate very closely. So, the overall platform that we have is moving at a very rapid pace and we like the growth prospects there and still tremendous amount of upside there in our view. I think if our CMO, Yogi Jashnani were on the call, he would say there is still a lot of room for improvement there on our platform, but we are making a lot of progress there.","Zach Fadem","That\u2019s helpful. And second, is there any color on the decision to mix the Interstate partnership and what were the major sticking points here and for your existing AutoCraft offering, should we anticipate any supply chain disruption given the change and is there anything you plan to tweak as far as promotion or how you are going to market in the category?","Tom Greco","Sure. Couple of comments on this one. I want to really reinforce the point that our suppliers and our external partners are very important to the transformation at Advance. I mean, we have we spent a tremendous amount of time, Mike Broderick particularly strengthening the relationships that we have with our suppliers. And I think our relationships with our suppliers are in a better spot than they have ever been since I have been here. So, I feel very good about that. Whenever we engage with the supplier or a third-party external partner, we evaluate it in a pretty straightforward way. I mean, we want to know where the consumer is headed. We want to know what\u2019s best for our customers. And of course we put it through a financial lens that looks at sales, margin expansion and cash flow. So in line with those financial priorities, I mean, we decided not to proceed with the IB partnership, because circumstances fundamentally changed since it was announced last December. So, I am going to leave it at that other than to say that Interstate is a great company with a great culture. They are building a great business down there in Dallas. We wish them a lot of success going forward. And separately, our battery business is off to a very strong start this year. We are very pleased with how we started the year. Going forward, we have strengthened our relationship with the pre-existing battery supplier. So, we don\u2019t anticipate any kind of interruption to demand going forward. In fact, we feel very good about this decision and there is no doubt it was in the best interest of AAP and our shareholders.","Zach Fadem","Got it. Thanks, Tom. I appreciate the time.","Tom Greco","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Seth Basham with Wedbush. Your line is open.","Seth Basham","Thanks a lot and good morning.","Tom Greco","Good morning.","Seth Basham","My question centers around the gross margin outlook really good improvement this quarter in material costs and related items, those improvements, do you expect them to persist through the balance of the year?","Tom Greco","Yes, I think so. I mean, we continue with our productivity improvements as it relates to material cost, material handling, the zero-based budgeting. We did see some headwinds with the DC operations. Some of those we knew about, we stood up the Nashville and Houston distribution centers in the third quarter of last year, so that manifest itself into the margin. And then we are seeing some headwinds associated with transportation both from inflationary pressures, both domestic and import as well as gas prices and that\u2019s something we are going to be monitoring closely, but we are very excited about the material cost savings that we are seeing and we think we are going to continue to see that and we will continue to monitor the potential headwinds.","Seth Basham","Got it. As it relates to those potential headwinds, I should be annualizing opening of the DCs later in the year and to potentially we will see some improvement if you are able to manage your transportation costs little better. So, do you expect better gross margin results for the balance of the year, how should we be thinking about it?","Tom Greco","Again, I think looking down to the bottom, looking at OI, we feel really good about the adjusted OI range that we provided. This is just one component of that. But on whole, we feel really confident with the 7.3% to 7.8% that we provided in February.","Seth Basham","Fair enough. And then my follow-up question is just around the dynamic assortment that Mike Broderick and team are working on, can you provide any quantification of the lift you are seeing in stores that have received dynamic assortment?","Tom Greco","Well, to be clear, we are not actually executing dynamic assortment yet, we are still actually using our current methodology, we call it probability to sell, but we just had a deep review of this yesterday and we are pretty excited about how this could play out, because obviously you are looking at a very rapid change to assortment in a store that is real time as opposed to the way we do it today. So just today twice a year we make changes to our assortment in a store. This is going to refine that pretty significantly so that we are able to respond much more quickly to changes in market demand. So, we have got a pilot that\u2019s being rolled out very soon and obviously we are taking it category by category and into different parts of the country, but the plan is to roll that out over time and make sure that we get it right as we are rolling it out, but very exciting. This is something that should drive lift overall and allow us to say yes to the customer more often.","Seth Basham","Excellent. Thank you very much and good luck.","Tom Greco","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Kate McShane with Citi. Your line is open.","Kate McShane","Hi, thank you for taking my questions. I know you highlighted the macro drivers as favorable, but as you mentioned gas prices are up and it does sound like your competitors are being a little bit more cautious when considering that dynamic given the impact on miles driven. So I just wondered if you could talk about how you are thinking about how you are thinking about the macro \u2013 excuse me when you think about your comp for the rest of the year?","Tom Greco","Sure, Kate. I mean for sure we are watching that very closely. I think that the bigger question as you indicated is around the impact it\u2019s going to have on consumers and less on our cost structure. We did have clearly a plan in terms of what we felt fuel prices going to be this year, and it\u2019s above that, where we didn\u2019t plan for the current price of fuel. That said, we have enough productivity initiatives in place to offset that from the P&L. I mean, the bigger question is will this cause a change in consumer behavior. Miles driven are up slightly on a year-to-date basis, but we are going to continue to monitor that closely overall and more to come there, but that\u2019s the bigger question. And we will have that \u2013 better picture of that as the balance year unfolds. That said everything is going to a record Memorial Day this week. We expect miles driven to be up nicely this week. So we will see.","Kate McShane","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.","Brian Nagel","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I know the call is going longer. So, I will be quick. Just two quick follow-ups. One on the online sales, your commentary there, the margin is quite good and frankly seems stronger than commentary from other similar type companies. How much of your \u2013 with you are seeing online sales now, how much of that is skewed to buy online pickup in store? And as you look at the numbers is there anyway to tell at this point the degree to which online is driving incremental sales versus cannibalizing sales that may have taken place in the store otherwise?","Tom Greco","Well, first of all, we are still biased towards buy online, pickup in store. And that means two things. It means we want to build on that strength and it means we have got a big opportunity in ship to home. So, both of those represent opportunities, Brian. I think in terms of buy online, pickup in store, we have changed some things inside the company to better enable that and most notably how we incent our employees. We used to have a different way of incenting our people. They were only incented for sales in the store. They were incented for buy online, pickup in store, but they were not incented for ship-to-home in the proximity of their stores. So that created a bit of a confusing platform for our people in communicating with customers. We want our customers saying wow, I can order online, I can pick it up in the store, I can go to my home. If I get it at my home, I can go to the Advance store and get some advice. We want to be a very flexible provider of a lot of parts to our customers and serve them the way they want to be served. So, now our people are embracing this whole e-commerce platform that we are standing up and they are really driving it in the stores as they talk to customers who come in to pickup parts. So, it\u2019s a big opportunity. We see a lot of growth there. And we think that we have the right to succeed in that space and we are going to continue to strengthen the overall experience that our customers have when they order off their phone. I mean, most I think over half of the purchases in our category now start with an online search of some type a description. So, we feel we can be best-in-class in that area and count on us to continue to get better.","Brian Nagel","Right, thank you. And then just real quick follow-up, lot of questions already or comments about the pickup in sales we have seen during the month of May, whether it presumably turns more normal? But I guess more from a qualitative standpoint as you look at your business, again \u2013 and I think as watchers of this sector we have been waiting for this dynamic for some type. But as you look at sales now begin to materialize, is it happening as exactly as it should or there are still some lagging categories despite improving weather that we can\u2019t make a sense of?","Tom Greco","I think we have done so much work on the long-term outlook for the industry. Everything is positive on that front. You think about the big variables. There is four that really stand out, we analyzed over 48 variables or something like that last fall, car park is a big variable, that\u2019s going up, miles driven I just spoke about a minute ago, vehicles in the sweet spot is an important variable and you guys look at this, that is going to improve for the next several years. It was down high single-digits last year the way we look at it, this year it\u2019s down again a little bit, but then it goes up. It starts to go up in \u201819, \u201820, \u201821 so that vehicles in the sweet spot piece, is very important, because that\u2019s obviously the time when vehicle repairs start to peak. So, that\u2019s looking very, very favorable. We have done some work honestly on \u2013 or some parts lasting longer and if so what are the implications and we don\u2019t see a big change in the outlook for the category. So this is a very healthy category and our belief is it\u2019s going to get better in \u201819, \u201820 and \u201821.","Brian Nagel","Thank you very much. Appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ben Bienvenu with Stephens Inc. Your line is open.","Ben Bienvenu","Hi, thanks. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Tom, you guys are clearly pointing to a number of metrics internally that are highlighting improvement in the core business, but the 2-year stack did sell from 4Q, it is better than the first three quarters of last year, but just help us understand what kind of noise might be in the 2-year stack and perhaps how indicative or not that is for the core performance in the business?","Tom Greco","Yes. Ben, I think the 2-year stack you got to look at over the Q4 plus Q1, it was just an exceptionally strong Q4 in 2016 when we had a 3 comp. So, we really have to look at those Q4 plus Q1 together. That\u2019s how we look at it. So, if you take that 28-week period there is a significant improvement over not just the first three quarters, but many quarters before that. So, lots of improvement there and then we watch that every week it\u2019s as we said the second quarter started out strong, we like the 2-year stack.","Ben Bienvenu","Understood. And then thinking about gross margin and overall operating margin opportunities, when do we start to see the influence of supply chain optimization in addition to material cost benefits, it sounds like you are moving some of the pieces down with DC and Mississippi? When do we start to see that materialize more meaningfully in the margins?","Tom Greco","Sure. First of all, we have got opportunities in supply chain that are both kind of short-term and long-term, I think in the short-term we have just got base execution opportunities out there whether that\u2019s improving our labor in the distribution centers our transportation. Safety was a real standout in the quarter. Ben, we really liked what happened in safety for the first time. The disciplines around collision frequency rate, injury frequency rate are starting to really go in the right direction, which is a good sign. We want our people to be safe obviously and there is obviously cost savings associated with that. The longer term supply chain transformation is going to take time. We are going to be very thoughtful and disciplined about that weather that\u2019s the DC optimization or the in-market store optimization. These are things that have significant value creation opportunity over time and they have to be done very, very well and executed flawlessly. So, when you think about optimizing our DC network we have got to do that in a way that\u2019s very thoughtful and that\u2019s going to be a multiyear journey, but there is a tremendous amount of value creation that comes with that over time.","Ben Bienvenu","Thanks. Best of luck.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Elizabeth Suzuki with Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Elizabeth Suzuki","Great, thanks. I will keep this very quick. Can you just give an update on merchandise margins and whether you are starting to see the benefit of inflation in your average ticket and you may have addressed this already and I missed it, but just any update you can give on inflation? Thanks.","Mike Broderick","Elizabeth, this is Mike Broderick. Good morning. We are from a merchandising perspective seeing the very natural inflation that this market always basically has year-over-year and that\u2019s low single-digit and that is pretty much what are seeing as we speak now and we continue manage it from a \u2013 we index it to our major competitors, so that we always stay price relevant in the marketplace.","Elizabeth Suzuki","Alright. That\u2019s all I have. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And I am showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back to Tom Greco for closing remarks.","Tom Greco","Well, thank you. We would like to conclude our call by thanking all our team members and independent partners across the AAP family for their efforts to better serve customers in the quarter. And in addition as we approach Memorial Day, we would also like to express our sincere appreciation for all the members of our military for their service, including over 6000 AAP team members. Our relationship with the military runs deep. We couldn\u2019t be prouder of our association with Building Homes for Heroes, which is an organization committed to providing homes to wounded warriors who are returning to the U.S. and we are particularly excited about the journey that Kirstie Ennis and Caitlin Sheehan are about to embark on in-service to some that as they attempt to be the first female team of veterans to summit Denali. Please join us in your support and check out Kirstie and Caitlin\u2019s story on their website, servicetosummit.org.

Before we begin, Elisabeth Eisleben, Senior Vice President, Communications and Investor Relations, will make a brief statement concerning forward-looking statements that will be discussed on this call","Elisabeth Eisleben","Good morning. And thank you for joining us to discuss our fourth quarter and full-year 2019 results. I'm joined by Tom Greco, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Jeff Shepherd, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Following their prepared remarks, we will turn our attention to answering your questions. ","Before we begin, please be advised that our comments today include forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

And good morning. And thank all of you for joining us to discuss our Q4 and full-year 2019 results.","I want to begin by recognizing and thanking every single AAP team member and our network of Carquest independents for their dedication throughout the year. ","With an unrelenting focus on delivering against our strategic priority, we made progress on many initiatives throughout 2019 and we plan to continue strengthening the company as we begin 2020.","In Q4, we delivered our seventh consecutive quarter of top line growth, with an increase of net sales to $2.1 billion and comparable store sales up slightly compared to the prior year. ","We also expanded our adjusted operating income margin rate by 106 basis points in the quarter. This focused effort to deliver margin expansion with lower-than-anticipated sales growth translated to adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.64, an increase of 40.2% in Q4.","In the quarter, we also completed our acquisition of the iconic DieHard brand, which we're excited to add to our industry-leading assortment of national brands, OE parts and own brands.","For the full-year 2019, our net sales increased 1.3% to $9.7 billion, with comparable store sales growth of 1.1%. We delivered adjusted operating margin expansion of 36 basis points year-over-year, adjusted diluted earnings per share growth of 14.9% and generated $597 million in free cash flow.","Following our second consecutive year of sales growth, margin expansion, and strong cash generation, as well as our confidence in ongoing improvements in 2020 and beyond, our board approved the first increase to our quarterly cash dividend since the 2014 acquisition. In fact, this was the first increase since AAP introduced its quarterly dividend in 2006.","Before I turn the call over to Jeff for more details on our financial performance, I want to highlight the operational performance improvements we implemented in 2019, as well as several exciting new initiatives planned for this year, which we expect to enable ongoing top line growth and adjusted OI margin expansion in 2020 and beyond. ","In Q4, our professional business led our growth rate, highlighted by Worldpac, Canada and our Carquest independent businesses. As we continue to bring all our professional assets under one roof, we remain focused on providing best-in-class parts availability, improving order to delivery speed and consistency, and strengthening our overall value proposition to our customers. ","This includes ongoing enhancements to our one-stop shop professional online platform, MyAdvance, as well as improvements to our best-in-class online B2B catalog, AdvancePro. MyAdvance improves the customer experience with fully-integrated access to promotions, product information and our pro rewards program, credit reconciliation and key performance indicators. This enables us to leverage customer data to drive engagement, while improving visibility to enroll promotions and customer involvement.","Additionally, we expanded the categories included in the rollout of dynamic assortment, with 50 categories now rolled out across nearly 4,000 stores, representing over 50% of our backroom sales. ","Dynamic assortment is continuing to improve stock and close rates in key categories. Once fully implemented, we expect dynamic assortment to drive top line improvements through a better understanding of customer demand and utilizing multiple data points to improve availability and help ensure that we have the right part in the right place at the right time. ","In terms of our DIY omnichannel business, we had a challenging Q4, particularly in the north. That said, the heavy lifting we did in the back half of 2019 has resulted in a much stronger DIY plan for 2020, which we believe will build momentum throughout the year. ","There are four primary areas of focus here. One, launch DieHard. Two, build awareness. Three, drive loyalty. And four, execute with excellence. ","So, first, we're very excited about launching the iconic DieHard brand throughout the Advance network in 2020. DieHard is the number one battery brand among all customers and presents us with several ways we believe we can differentiate our offering and drive increased customer traffic to our retail stores. ","Our goal with DieHard is to build on its strong reputation, creating a differentiated value proposition. While we're confident the addition of DieHard to our industry-leading assortment will drive incremental growth for DIY omni channel, we also see the potential to leverage DieHard with our professional customers and independent Carquest partners. ","In the future, we also believe there's a significant opportunity for brand extension into other categories and geographic expansion of DieHard. Without question, both the Advance team and our Carquest independents are very excited about DieHard.","Second, we're focused on significantly improving awareness of events. Our unaided awareness improved in 2019, but still lags our primary competitors by a wide margin. ","Our 2020 plans are highlighted by a new marketing campaign, including a significant increase in media, which we source from preexisting, lower performing marketing spend. We're confident this new advertising will differentiate the Advance brand over time. ","Additionally, we're very excited to leverage our recently announced partnership with Penske racing and our new driver Ryan Blaney. ","We'll also continue to drive awareness by improving our digital experience as we know that most transactions start online. Our DIY online business continued to grow traffic and transactions, resulting in double-digit ecommerce growth in both Q4 and the full year. ","Our team is also making progress on the expansion of product offerings on walmart.com, including the addition of product reviews that facilitate a frictionless experience for our customers.","Third, we continued to make progress on our loyalty program, Speed Perks, and we're excited about the launch of our new mobile app for DIYers in Q1. Our app will make Speed Perk and our mobile experience even more accessible to our loyal customers.","When we relaunched Speed Perk 2.0 mid-year, under 25% of our DIY transactions were Speed Perk transactions at that point. We finished the year at close to 36%. This enables us to leverage first-party data to personalize our offering. In Q4, we added close to 1 million new Speed Perks members, finishing Q4 at close to 12 million active members. ","In addition, we saw increasing graduation rates from one spending tier to the next. We'll continue to build loyalty behind Speed Perks by leveraging personalization and communicating directly with our customers. ","Four, our field team continues to improve on key execution metrics, including units per transaction, weekend coverage and net promoter score. ","In 2020, we plan to improve both the quality and execution of our automotive training for our team members, while improving the customer experience for buy online\/pickup in store. The fact that our turnover in frontline customer-facing roles declined in both 2018 and 2019 has helped us improve execution overall. ","In terms of category performance, our Q4 growth was led by brakes, batteries and filters. Due to a weak December, we underperformed on winter-related products such as starters and alternators as well as radiators. ","Geographically, our regional performance was highly varied, with our Midwest, West and Central regions delivering mid-single-digit growth in Q4 and the largest sales increases on both a one and two-year stack compared to prior years.","These geographies significantly outperformed our weakest geographies in the quarter, with our Great Lakes, Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions trailing the top performing regions by over 600 basis points on average. ","To summarize our growth initiatives, we've elevated our focus on differentiating and improving the customer experience for both our pro and DIY omnichannel business. We remain relentlessly focused on delighting the customer across all of our businesses. ","Our pro business continues to build momentum across all banners and we continue to integrate key platforms to simplify and improve the customer experience across AdvancePro and MyAdvance.","In terms of DIY omnichannel, while it remains a work in progress, we have the strongest marketing calendar of activity on DIY omnichannel in years, with our plans to launch DieHard, build awareness, increase loyalty and improve execution. ","Moving on to our key pillars of margin expansion for 2020 and beyond, our first priority is to improve sales and profit per store. This includes optimizing our existing footprint, expanding where we're underpenetrated, and closing unproductive or underperforming assets where appropriate. ","Starting with our largest business on the professional side, our team continues to expand our professional footprint to drive share growth. In 2019, we opened 17 new Worldpac branches and continuing to add new Carquest independent locations. ","In addition to the growth of our existing locations and sourcing new opportunities, our team has also started the consolidation of our Worldpac and Auto Part International banners to deliver improved productivity and product assortment across our professional business. This effort will continue throughout 2020. ","In addition, behind consistent gradual improvements and execution across our Advance and Carquest stores, our average sales per store has increased from $1.5 million at the end of 2017 to roughly $1.6 million per store at the end of 2019. We're confident we'll continue this growth and are on track to achieve our goal of $1.8 million per store over time. ","Separately, we continued to address more structural opportunities within our retail stores, which includes a strengthened store refresh program and the ongoing optimization of our store footprint. ","We expect the actions we're taking to improve sales and profit per store will benefit both DIY and pro.","Our second margin expansion priority is within our supply chain. And I'm pleased to say we're now in full execution mode on this critical area of our transformation. ","Our supply chain team has done a thorough review our entire footprint and we're now executing plans that we believe will significantly enhance our enterprise-wide supply chain.","With 50 distribution centers today, we have a clear opportunity to further rationalize our footprint over the coming years. Importantly, we'll work to optimize the network while improving our service to customers. It's imperative that our DCs have the right part in the right place at the right time, so we win more often.","One of our major supply chain productivity initiatives is cross banner replenishment, which we began to deploy in late 2019.","Following the successful lead markets, we're now beginning to scale this capability throughout our DC and expect to be completed by mid-2021. Once fully implemented, we expect we will improve product availability, drive turns and deliver significant cost productivity.","In addition, we are continuing to invest in the consolidation of several warehouse management systems, or WMS for short, to one system across our Advance and Carquest network, which as you can imagine is a significant undertaking. ","When we began our supply chain transformation, we were dealing with multiple WMS systems, along with extensive manual processes and high turnover and R&D fees. Not only is our turnover down significantly in our DCs, our safety performance and engagement scores are now trending in a positive direction. ","While it took time to build the right team and stabilize operations before we introduced a new WMS system, I'm confident we now have the right team in place to help us further our transformation progress. ","Importantly, our team recently completed the first conversion to our new WMS platform in one of our largest decrease. And that DC is off to a terrific start.","We expect this initiative, coupled with the implementation of a new labor management system, will allow us to run common across our DCs, so we can provide better product availability at more optimal inventory turns and costs.","We're currently on track with our supply chain agenda, and I'm excited for what this will deliver in 2020 and beyond.","Our third pillar of margin expansion focuses on category management. Here, we've implemented a standardized approach across key categories to facilitate material cost optimization, own brand expansion, and unit and profit growth through strategic pricing. This has been a highly collaborative effort with our supplier partners. ","In terms of material cost optimization, while unplanned tariffs reduce the benefit of our performance in 2019, we made good progress on MCO both in Q4 and for the full year.","For our own brand expansion, we began to roll out additional Carquest branded products in the back half of 2019. We're working to ensure the highest of quality in our Carquest brand roll outs as this brand resonates so strongly with our professional garages.","In parallel, we've been exploring own brand opportunities for DIY with our suppliers, with DieHard being the best example of this today.","Finally, we expect to deploy our new pricing platform by mid-year. This will enable single price execution across all channels to provide consistent and more efficient management of our pricing. A big benefit of this new capability will be the ability to centralize price right down to store level, if needed.","Finally, SG&A productivity rounds out the fourth pillar of our margins expansion. SG&A was a highlight of our 2019 performance as our team continued to make excellent progress in managing our costs. ","In the fourth quarter, we were able to leverage our labor-related costs, including store labor as a percent of sales, in spite of wage inflation and lower-than-expected sales. This was largely driven by the improvements from our new store level labor management system which we rolled out in Q3.","Additionally, our diligent efforts to build a culture of safety is becoming ingrained in how our team members work, leading to a reduction in our liabilities and claims expenses across the organization, which benefited the quarter and the year.","In fact, we lowered our total recordable injury rate by 8% in 2019 and our LTIR, or lost time injury rate, which represents the worst safety incidents, was reduced by an impressive 17% compared to 2018","Finally, we continue to make progress on rent in the quarter and in the year. For the full year, we leveraged our occupancy in basement by roughly 20 basis points.","To wrap up our SG&A performance, we made good progress across multiple lines, enabling us to leverage SG&A to drive margin expansion, while, at the same time, we made significant investments in technology, ecommerce and supply chain in 2019.","In summary, 2019 was a year of continued progress for AAP as we registered another year of top line growth and margin expansion, while making important long-term investments.","In terms of our outlook for 2020, we've previously discussed that this year would be similar to 2019 in terms of investment requirements. With that said, some additional items for you to keep in mind.","First, as you probably know, we've just experienced the warmest January in history, which is expected to impact demand in the front half of the year.","From an AAP standpoint, we also expect the elevated coupon investment we're making in our loyalty platform to continue in the front half of 2020.","On the positive side of the equation, industry dynamics remain very attractive. This includes continued increases in the car park, miles driven, as well as an increase in vehicles greater than seven years old.","All of these are projected to have a favorable impact on demand throughout 2020. Further, we also expect our pro and DIY initiatives to build top line momentum through the year.","Finally, I'm confident in our team's ability to continue our margin expansion trajectory and deliver further progress against our strategic objectives in 2020. All of these factors are contemplated in the full year guidance we introduced in our press release this morning. ","In summary, we remain very excited about the tremendous opportunity ahead to fully unlock the potential of AAP, and we're committed to driving consistent improvement across the enterprise over the next several years. ","With that, I'll turn it over to Jeff for details on our financial performance. ","Jeff Shepherd ","Thank you, Tom. And good morning, everyone. In the fourth quarter, our adjusted gross profit was approximately $929 million, which was essentially flat compared to the prior-year quarter.","Adjusted gross profit margin of 44% declined 19 basis points from the prior-year quarter, primarily driven by LIFO headwinds, as well as the expected headwinds from continued investment in our enhanced loyalty program Speed Perks 2.0. These headwinds were partially offset by pricing actions taken in the quarter.","Our adjusted SG&A was approximately $779 million in Q4 2019 compared to approximately $802 million in Q4 2018. As a percentage of net sales, our adjusted SG&A expenses improved by 125 basis points to 36.9%.","I'm pleased with our team members' dedication to control costs throughout 2019, which enabled us to leverage expenses every quarter.","In Q4, we leveraged labor-related costs and once again reduced our insurance and claims expense at key training programs and focus on safety drove improvements across the organization.","Adjusted operating income in Q4 was $150 million, which improved nearly 18% compared to the prior-year quarter. Our adjusted OI margin rate increased 106 basis points to 7.1% in the quarter.","Adjusted diluted EPS for Q4 was $1.64, an increase of 40.2%.","For the full year, net sales were $9.7 billion, an increase of 1.3% compared to 2018, and comp sales improved 1.1%.","Adjusted gross profit for the year increased 1.1% to $4.3 billion and adjusted gross profit margin decreased 12 basis points to 44%.","Adjusted SG&A for the year was flat compared to 2018 at $3.5 billion. On a rate basis, our full-year adjusted SG&A was 35.8%, which was an improvement of 48 basis points compared to the previous year. ","Adjusted operating income for the year was $795 million, an increase of 6% compared to the end of 2018.","Our adjusted operating margin was 8.2% for 2019 which increased 36 basis points compared to the full-year 2018. ","Adjusted diluted EPS increased 14.9% to $8.19 compared to $7.13 at the end of 2018. ","Moving to free cash flow, we delivered $597 million in 2019, which was lower than our expectations. Factors negatively impacting working capital include higher-than-expected increases in both our receivables and inventory. ","We also realized an unfavorable payment term mix within vendor payables. This was driven by an increase in Worldpac inventory associated with the opening of Worldpac branches, which carry shorter payment terms, as well as an unfavorable mix impact within Advance and Carquest vendor payables. These factors resulted in higher cash outflows at year-end than we previously modeled.","Consistent with increasing capital spend throughout 2019, our CapEx in Q4 was $101 million, bringing the full-year spend to $170 million, an increase of 39.4% year-over-year.","As we've previously discussed, our investments have primarily focused on information technology and supply chain projects. And in 2019, more than 60% of our capital spend was concentrated on these two critical areas. ","Our IT initiatives continue to address longstanding lack of investment in critical systems and back office integration, which we expect to continue in 2020 and beyond. Nearly one-third of our IT spend in 2019 focused on customer-facing systems, and I'm pleased with the near completion of our next gen store system upgrade across our footprint.","In addition, throughout 2019, our team worked diligently on our finance ERP project, which integrates our back office finance systems. We went live with our first release in this new system at the start of our fiscal 2020 and I'm confident the continued rollout of this initiative will create significant efficiencies across our organization. ","In addition, our supply chain team worked relentlessly throughout the year to stabilize existing operations. We invested in DC improvements in 2019, with additional plans for 2020, including network upgrades and continued rollout of our single warehouse management system across our legacy Advance and Carquest network to enable improved accuracy and efficiencies within the distribution centers. ","In line with our financial priorities \u2013 to maintain an investment grade rating, invest in the business and opportunistically return capital to shareholders \u2013 under our current share repurchase program, we repurchased nearly $11 million of Advance stock during the fourth quarter and a total of approximately $487 million for the year. ","Importantly, we remain confident in our ability to generate meaningful cash from the business. As you saw yesterday, we are pleased to announce our board has approved a meaningful improvement to our quarterly dividend, which was increased from $0.06 to $0.25 cents. We're committed to a balanced approach in returning capital to our shareholders, while making important investments to drive our transformation. ","As we begin 2020, we remain focused on our strategic objectives and disciplined in our execution to deliver against our financial priorities. ","With that said, this morning, we introduced our 53-week full-year 2020 guidance for several key metrics including net sales of $9.88 billion to $10.1 billion; comparable store sales growth of flat 2%; adjusted operating income margin expansion of 20 basis points to 50 basis points; capital expenditures of $275 million to $325 million, focusing on continued IT and supply chain investments; our 2020 tax rate is expected to be 24% to 26%; and as we continue our disciplined approach to cash management, we expect to deliver a minimum free cash flow of $600 million. ","As a reminder, 2020 includes a 53rd week. Our financial outlook provided today includes an estimated $125 million to $150 million in net sales and approximately 10 basis points to 20 basis points of margin expansion from the 53rd week contribution.","In summary, I want to reiterate our gratitude that Tom began with today to all our team members and independent partners for their effort throughout 2019, which enabled our continued progress toward our transformation objectives. ","We remain committed to further improvements in 2020 to remain disciplined in our approach to capitalize on the significant opportunity still ahead for AAP.","With that, let's open the call to address your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. [Operator Instructions]. Matt McClintock with Raymond James. Your line is open.","Matthew McClintock","Yes. Good morning, everyone. Tom, I was wondering about the initial guidance for 2020. Just comp expectation is 0% to 2%. Can you kind of give us an idea of how you factored in the warm weather from December into that expectation?","Tom Greco","Sure. Good morning, Matt. So, let me provide some color on that. First of all, we're very dedicated to the long-term strategic objectives we've laid out before, and that includes some investments this year that we're making as we communicated in the past, both 2019 and 2020 being somewhat similar in that regard. And those investments are designed to enable top line growth and additional margin expansion down the road. ","So, as we looked at the sales guide, we did a lot of work on the December\/January timeframe and we factored in the impact of what at least at this point is an extremely mild winter compared to other years. You guys have written about some of the 2017, 2012. It was one of the warmest in history for North America this year, December\/January. And given our northern footprint, we've valued the impact that's going to have on top line sales really in the front half of the year. Considering this, and the fact that it's very early in the year, we're being prudent on the sales guidance. ","That said, there's a lot we're very excited about for 2020 and longer term on the sales front. As you've heard from others, the industry drivers of demand are very positive. The car park is continuing to grow. We're going to cross $280 million this year. Miles driven continues to increase. And the vehicles in the sweet spot \u2013 in addition to that, the vehicles about seven years and greater is growing. So, those are all positive impacts and that'll benefit the whole year. ","Separately, obviously, we've got a number of top line initiatives across pro and DIY that we'll build throughout the year, including our launch of DieHard. So, in terms of margin expansion and cash flow, our plans are very robust and we're continuing to execute against them. So, that was kind of the thinking that went into sales. The building blocks of our plan are continuing to work nicely together. We've got a great team that's poised to deliver against the guidance. We've delivered sales growth and margin expansion two years in a row and we intend to do that again in 2020. ","Matthew McClintock","And then, just as a follow-up on DieHard specifically, can you talk through how we should conceptualize the launch? How you plan about going about launching it and how we should think about the benefit from that launch? Thanks. ","Tom Greco","Sure. Well, as we talked when we issued the original press release, there's a tremendous amount of strategic and financial rationale for us behind DieHard. It gives us the opportunity to really differentiate within particularly inside of DIY. As you know, DIY traffic is our number one customer and business issue. And all the work that we've done says that DieHard can really help us with that. It enables us to differentiate with DIY customers. Brands matter to DIY customers. And we'll be able to differentiate there. ","We also plan to build out a unique position on pro with DieHard capital. And so, we're excited about that also. ","As you think about the launch, we're not communicating any specific timing or anything like that right now, but we're obviously working very diligently to buildout the launch plan for DieHard. And needless to say, it'll benefit us more in the back half of the year than the front half.","Matthew McClintock","I appreciate the color. Best of luck.","Tom Greco","Thank you. ","Operator","Seth Sigman with Credit Suisse, your line is open.","Seth Sigman","Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I'm going to ask a couple upfront. Just the Q4 cadence, obviously, December was very challenging. I'd love to just see your observations what you guys were seeing prior to that because it seems like, seasonally, it should have been in a better place. So, just any color on how the quarter was performing prior to the December slowdown?","And then, just second, as you think about the guidance, the margin guidance for 2020, up 10 basis points to 30 basis points excluding the extra week, can you just break that down a little bit more between gross margin and SG&A?","And just that SG&A piece, related to the fourth quarter, the sustainability of some of the benefits that you saw this past quarter, any color on that? That'd be helpful. Thank you. ","Tom Greco","Yeah. Good morning, Seth. I'll take the first one. I'll flip the second question over to Jeff. In terms of October, November, December, it wasn't that different at the national level. We did see a slowdown in December, but it was a marked difference geographically, as we called out in our script. ","First of all, in the West, in the Midwest, in Central, it was very cold in October. We had a very strong October, November in those geographies. We didn't get that benefit necessarily in the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic and Great Lakes. And as we got into December, when it was much warmer in those geographies, that really pulled down our business in December overall. ","So, I think the headline there is the difference. The distribution was quite wide geographically for us in the quarter. As we said, over 600 basis points between the top three and bottom three. ","Jeff, do you want to cover off the other? ","Jeff Shepherd","Yeah, sure. I'll start with the fourth quarter, Seth, and then work into the guidance for 2020. Fourth quarter, you saw SG&A improved 125 basis points. Three broad categories. Labor, labor related, we did leverage store labor in the fourth quarter. We saw some improvements in our marketing program as Jason McDonell comes in and looks at some of the underperforming spend. We pulled back on some of that. ","And then, for the fourth quarter in a row, we've seen improvements in insurance and claims, and this was really some favorability around some of our actuarial assessments. So, throughout the year, what we've seen is improvements in both the volume of claims and the severity of claims. And those are two key contributors to an actuarial valuation to estimate out into the future what you think your costs are going to be. Those are going to come down, albeit slow. So, that sort of gets into 2020. We think we're going to continue to see improvements in the areas of labor, of supply \u2013 sorry, of safety. Safety, what I just discussed. Labor, we're going to continue to leverage myday. We believe we can continue to see improvements there. ","We have integrations going on in the back office. We've talked about the ERP. We're going to see second half savings there. And we're also integrating AI and Worldpac. So, as we continue to get synergies around that, we'll see savings in SG&A. ","Stepping back to 2020, as we think about where we're going to see the expansion, we do think we're going to see savings, but we also have a significant amount of investment. Similar to what we guided last year, we're going to continue to have OpEx investment this year in marketing, in people, in supply chain and in IT.","At this point, we think we're going to see more of the improvement in our margin and gross margin. And that's largely driven by two factors. First is the supply chain. And we've been working on this for a couple years now. And we said it was going to take more time. We're going to start to see those improvements in supply chain in 2020. ","And then, the second is category management, which is a combination of MCO, material cost optimization, private label and pricing. And the combination of those items, we really think we're going to see the benefit as we sit here today, more in gross margin and less in SG&A as we take on some of those OpEx investments within SG&A.","Jeff Shepherd","Okay, great. Thank you for all the color. Appreciate it.","Tom Greco","Welcome.","Jeff Shepherd","Michael Lasser with UBS, your line is open.","Atul Maheswari","Good morning. This is Atul Maheswari on for Michael Lasser. Thanks a lot for taking our questions. First question is on the weather commentary. So, why have you factored in the weather impacting only the front half of the year? Back in 2017, when we kind of had a similar mild winter, I believe it led to subdued sales for the industry throughout the year. So, why would this be any different?","Tom Greco","Yeah, we didn't actually find that. We did the work, category by category, geography by geography. We compared the differences. We did see it in the second quarter, but we did not see an impact in the back half of those years, at least for our sales.","Atul Maheswari","Got it. It's very helpful. And as my follow-up question, can you talk about the current trends in the first quarter? Basically, where are you tracking compared to your flat to 2% comp guidance for the full year? Basically, I'm better trying to understand the degree of acceleration needed in the back half to achieve this guidance?","Tom Greco","Yeah, we're not going to comment on in-quarter performance. But, obviously, we did say that January was very warm. So, implied in our guide is acceleration in the back half of the year. ","Atul Maheswari","Thank you.","Operator","Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley, your line is open.","Michael Kessler","Hey, guys. This is Michael Kessler on for Simeon. Thanks for taking our questions. First, just wanted to ask about the comp relative to the operating margin growth expectation for 2020. It seems like composite, a fair guide given the backdrop. And still guiding to solid margin expansion. I just wanted to ask you, how confident are you that you can achieve that, given potentially a lower comp with the weather headwinds? And how much of the margin expansion, especially on gross margin, is really not even dependent on sales growth and you think you can get it regardless of the top line?","Tom Greco","Sure. Well, first of all, we're excited about the fact that, in the fourth quarter, we delivered margin expansion amid a quarter where our sales were lower than we expected. So, we've always known we've got a tremendous opportunity to expand margins. We've been working on our agenda for a couple of years now. And the four big territories that we have for margin expansion, the majority of that upside is not sales dependent. ","So, if you think about supply chain, we're going to essentially roll out cross banner replenishment, which is nothing more than repointing a store at a distribution center that's closer to the store than the previous one. So, that's in full rollout right now. ","We're standing up a warehouse management system platform that will enable us to standardize our labor management throughout the supply chain. That is not sales dependent. We're integrating Worldpac and AI, as Jeff just mentioned. Big opportunity for us there to not only save money, but also to improve our assortment offering and availability to our customers. But most of the supply chain agenda has nothing to do with any sales dependency. ","Separately, we're rolling out, inside of category management, our own brand platform. Jeff has stood up a pricing function. We've got a new pricing platform that we're \u2013 a software tool that we're standing up in the middle of 2020. It will enable us to price at \u2013 right down to store level and price regionally, which we can't do today. So, again, not necessarily sales dependent.","And then, SG&A, Jeff just covered, but really nothing inside of there is sales dependent, whether that's the integration of our back office platforms, improved safety performance, indirect procurement, improving our performance on medical, all of those things are going to happen independent of sales. ","So, I think the key point is, obviously, we want our sales to grow as rapidly as possible and we remain focused on building on our plans there, but our opportunity to expand margins is not as sales dependent as it might be in other companies.","Michael Kessler","Great, thanks. Appreciate that color. And just as a follow-up, so we've been hearing that some suppliers are advising some of the major DIY auto distributors that the parts supply out of China could be constrained by what we're seeing with coronavirus. I know you guys are a little less exposed to DIY than some of your competitors. But could you comment at all on what you're seeing or hearing thus far and whether there's any contingency you're building into your guidance for any disruptions?","Tom Greco","Yeah. Well, first of all, from a business standpoint, to be clear, our guide does not contemplate any impact from the coronavirus, as you said. It's pretty much a level playing field. All of the major players in our industry source from China. But erven compared to other industries, auto parts is relatively low. I think we've communicated in the past, at least at Advance, we're in the teens roughly in terms of products sourced from China. We have several months of inventory depending on the product. We've got, obviously, our own infrastructure here in the US. We've also got a distribution center that has additional inventory in Shanghai. So, we're going to continue to monitor it closely. But at the moment, we don't see any impact in supply disruption for us in 2020. But it's, obviously, a very dynamic situation and we've got to continue to monitor it very closely.","Michael Kessler","Right, thank you.","Operator","Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities, your line is open.","Seth Basham","Good morning. My question is around your supply chain progress. Clearly, you're making a lot of progress, integrating your supply chain. If you'd give us some perspective on types of financial benefits and other things that you're realizing from the DC that you've converted thus far, that would be really helpful.","Tom Greco","Sure, Seth. First of all, I'm really excited about what Reuben Slone and his team are doing inside of supply chain. Again, it's taken us longer than we might have liked. But we're not only improving the effectiveness, the efficiency of the supply chain, the effectiveness is going up as well. And as you know, it's one of our biggest opportunities to not only expand margins, but improve availability. ","So, I think he has really three big chapters that they're focused on. The first is driving execution where there's been a number of leadership upgrades and a focus on reducing turnover in those DCs, which we made a lot of progress on in 2019. I believe we'll continue to make progress on in 2020. ","The second is we call invest to make it better. I covered those a minute ago. But, again, that's really changing the physics, if you will, of our supply chain. DC optimization, cross banner replenishment, driving execution through the WMS system. And I actually was at our first distribution center that we've stood up, the new WMS system, very exciting. As we indicated in our prepared remarks, we've had multiple warehouse management systems, a lot of manual processes. And to go to a single warehouse management system across the entire Advance\/Carquest network has huge upside for us. It'll help us improve our availability and, obviously, standardize the actions that are going on in those DCs. We talked about Worldpac and AI separately, which is also part of this invest to make it better chapter.","And then, third, we talk about innovation. And in there, we've got things like our DC automation projects that we're working on. ","So, the value of the supply chain productivity agenda is significant. I think we've indicated it's right there at the top of our opportunities to expand margins. And I'm very confident in our ability to improve within supply chain. And not only expand margins, as I said, but to improve availability and drive top line growth as a result.","Seth Basham","That's really helpful. And just as a follow-up, as you think about the financial benefits from the supply chain initiatives, do you expect them to ramp through the year 2020? And similarly, would that mean that gross margin improvement over the year should also ramp?","Tom Greco","Yeah. We're now at a point where we expect to leverage supply chain through the year. And I think it's pretty evenly distributed throughout the year in the case of supply chain and in other areas. Jeff mentioned the coupon investment that we've made inside of Speed Perks. That's mostly a front-half investment on the gross margin side of the house. So, that'll improve in the back half, but supply chain is relatively uniform through the year.","Seth Basham","Thank you very much.","Operator","Scot Ciccarelli with RBC, your line is open.","Gustavo Gonzalez","Hi, good morning. This is actually Gustavo Gonzalez on for Scot. So, just a quick one on \u2013 just wanted to know if you can sort of quantify the gross margin and comp impact during the quarter from the coupon redemption.","Jeff Shepherd","Yeah, what we've said is that it was similar to what we experienced in the third quarter. We're not going to break it out specifically, but think about a comparable number on a rate basis. And so, it had a comparable impact on our net sales gross margin than we saw in the third quarter,","Gustavo Gonzalez","Got it. That's helpful. And then, anything on just \u2013 sort of on a go-forward basis, just kind of mentioned it's going to impact the first half year. Is it going to be similar kind of decelerating or to what degree? That would be helpful. ","Tom Greco","Yeah, what we said was that \u2013 obviously, the coupons associated with the original Speed Perks platform are no longer available. So, they're expired. So, we're seeing less redemption than we did in the back half of the year. It's still greater than we saw at the beginning of 2019. But it's less on a rate basis. But we think this is an important investment for us to be making. It gives us \u2013 we were able to add new members. As we said, we added about a million members to Speed Perks. We also are seeing less \u2013 if you think about traction, retention and graduation, so we're attracting new members in, about a million in the quarter. We're losing less people, so our net number is continuing to grow. And then, we're graduating people up the tiers, and that allows us to personalize and leverage first-party data. So, very excited about Speed Perks and its ability to improve our loyalty with our most loyal customers.","Gustavo Gonzalez","Got it. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Daniel Imbro with Stephens, Inc., your line is open.","Daniel Imbro","Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking our questions. Jeff, one for you. Starting on MCO, it was a big success, it sounds like, in the fourth quarter, helped kind of limit the gross margin degradation. I think about a year ago, you guys said you're about 80% through capturing the material cost optimization savings. How far along are we today in terms of capturing those savings? And should that tailwind diminish through 2020 or have you guys unlocked more opportunity there?","Jeff Shepherd","Yeah, sure. The material cost optimization is really an iterative process. So, we have been through all of our categories. So, we're in the process now of going back through certain categories that, maybe a year ago, we've already been through, but we're looking at all of the various aspects, whether it be costs, whether it be packaging, whether it be supply chain financing. We still think we have a significant opportunity there. And so, we're going to continue to do that on an ongoing basis. And we're also looking at it at an enterprise level. Because when we first started, kind of the first round, AAP\/CQ was our focus. We're now going back as an enterprise focus to bring in AI and Worldpac. So, again, really going to iterate on that. We believe we're going to continue to see benefits to that in 2020 and beyond.","Daniel Imbro","Helpful. And then, maybe just follow-up to an earlier question. Tom, I think you mentioned and talked to the cadence of gross margin expansion in 2020. But as we take a step back and think further, when should we see the full run rate savings from the multiple warehouse systems and the new systems there? Is that a first half of 2021 time frame or kind of when should that be full run rate in the cost?","Tom Greco","Yeah, I think inside of \u2013 the different initiatives, right, have different timelines, Daniel. So, in terms of DC optimization, that's going to spread out over a couple of years. Okay? That's two to three years. In terms of cross banner replenishment, we expect to complete that by the middle of 2021. Okay? So, that's essentially 18 months out. We're in the process of pointing stores at a more freight logical location right now and we're just kind of going through that market by market and we'll realize the full benefit by that time frame. ","In terms of the warehouse management system, that's going to take a little bit longer than that. We've, obviously, got to make sure that we've got everything ready. We're going through that market by market as well. We stood up one building. That's more like 2022, 2023 timeframe. We haven't landed on the final date there. It depends on how quickly we're able to make the transition with these DCs and the training and everything that needs to go there. Worldpac\/Auto Part International integration, early 2021. ","So, you've got a combination of things there. But as I said, we will leverage the supply chain this year. And next year, we expect to leverage supply chain and then get the full benefit. I think you'll see into \u2013 2022, you're going to see the full benefit of most of the big initiatives.","Daniel Imbro","Got it. That's helpful. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Michael Montani with Evercore ISI, your line is open.","Antonio Tabet","Hi, this is actually Antonio filling in for Mike. I just want to shift gears a little bit to talk about multichannel. So, also, can you give a breakdown \u2013 before that, can you give a breakdown of how the DIY consumer is performing? Because I know, earlier, you mentioned commercial is strong, but also from the walmart.com partnership, are you seeing a meaningful impact to the DIY segment? Thanks.","Tom Greco","Yeah. First of all, in terms of DIY, in isolation \u2013 I'm going to take DIY in total. We did improve in the back half of 2019 versus where we were in the front half. We do attribute at least part of that to the launch of Speed Perks. There's so much upside there yet for us that we're going to really tap into this year based on all the big initiatives that we've put in place that we're still very focused on the improvements there, but we did improve in the back half of the year. ","Walmart is not a meaningful number yet, and we're continuing to work with the Walmart team. , they've been a great partner on this. What we're very focused on is making sure the customer experience is best-in-class. And as we go through each initiative with them, we've got to ensure that the online experiences working for our DIYer and, obviously, the fulfillment experience is working well. So, we're adding those categories, those SKUs where we feel comfortable with that and they feel comfortable with that. And when we're ready to launch, we've got to make sure that the customer experience is right before we launch the different categories, I guess is the key point. ","Antonio Tabet","All right. And just a quick follow-up to that. Is it fair to say that some of that benefit you're seeing there will be realized in 2020? Or is this more of a long-term initiative that you'll see in 2021, for example?","Tom Greco","We'll definitely see some benefit in 2020. But to your point, this is very much a multi-year long-term partnership with Walmart. And with all the initiatives that we have going on and they have going on, we're making sure the customer experience is best-in-class. That's kind of at the center of everything we do when we meet together with that team. We're very focused on making sure that the customer experience is where it needs to be.","Antonio Tabet","Got it. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Bret Jordan with Jefferies, your line is open.","Bret Jordan","Hey, good morning, guys.","Tom Greco","Good morning, Bret.","Bret Jordan","Could you talk about what you saw from inflation in the fourth quarter and what you're expecting inflation impact on 2020 to be? ","Jeff Shepherd","Yeah, sure. In terms of pricing inflation, we saw right around, on a like-for-like SKU, about 2.8%. And we're modeling for 2020 about 2% from a pricing inflation standpoint. ","Bret Jordan","And that 2% will be skewed to the first half before you lap the tariffs or is that sort of evenly equated? ","Jeff Shepherd","Yes. Yeah. So, that's including \u2013 tariffs are sort of the same. ","Bret Jordan","Okay. And then, a question on DC optimization. As you start rolling out some of the cross banner, what do you see the right number of DCs being? If you've got 50 in three years, what's that count? And how many of the DCs you see in the future do you currently own or what kind of DC buildout might you require?","Tom Greco","Yeah. First of all, we're not going to provide a specific number there, Bret, obviously. We've announced these DC closures very thoughtfully. And we've got our own people in those buildings. We want to make sure that we do it the right way, et cetera. So, we're not going to break any of that out. But, obviously, there is a big opportunity for us to further rationalize inside of our network. And we do that by looking at the sales in the out years and geographically, how can we ensure that we don't have a service challenge. We did close Armonk in New York and repoint stores at relevant DCs and that's gone very smoothly. So, we've now \u2013 I think we're up to four in total that we've closed to date. And we've got it down. So, it's just a matter of phasing that out over time. So, you'll hear more about that when we have something to say and we've had our chance to speak to our people first.","In terms of own \u2013 yeah, I don't \u2013 Jeff \u2013 yeah, we'll have to get back to you on that, on owned versus lease. We'll get back to you on that.","Bret Jordan","The question was more what's in the portfolio. If you see a 30-DC network in three years, are there DCs that you're going to need to build out or do you have most of what you need to rationalize your distribution? ","Tom Greco","We do feel we have most of what we need. Keep in mind, we also have Worldpac out there in places like California. So, as Bob starts to integrate the assortment across all the banners, we look at all of the assets of the company. So, it's not just red and blue, if you will. ","Bret Jordan","Thank you. ","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to the presenters for closing remarks. ","Tom Greco","Well, thanks to everyone for joining us this morning. 2019 was an important year in our journey. And as you heard this morning, we're making progress toward our long-term objectives, including consistent, gradual improvements to enable meaningful top line growth, margin expansion and strong cash generation. I'm confident in our team's ability to deliver further progress in 2020 and beyond. Thanks for joining. ","Operator","This concludes today's conference call. We thank you for your participation.

And thank you for joining us on today's call to discuss our first quarter results. I'm joined this morning by Tom Greco, our President and CEO; Tom Okray, our Chief Financial Officer; and Bob Cushing, our Executive Vice President for Professional.

I'd like to begin by acknowledging all of our team members and independent owners across the AAP family for their efforts to better serve our customers in the quarter. Through their dedication, we\u2019re executing well against the five-year plan review that our investor conference last November. In Q1, our comp store sales performance was down 2.7%. This result reflects the impact of a series of factors we anticipated in Q1, as well as short-term headwinds that were not planned. These headwinds impacted the entire industry in Q1.","Let\u2019s start with what we expected. As we noted last quarter, our Q4 performance benefited from two significant factors; first, the shift of New Year\u2019s Day into Q1, which help Q4 but reduced comp store sales in Q1; secondly, a substantial increase in winter related demand was pulled forward into December and out of January. In particular, our Northern markets benefited from the cold December. Given our geographic footprint, we disproportionately benefited from this in Q4 and it disproportionately hurt us in Q1. None of this was a surprise and the fact that our comps in Q1 were lower relative to Q4 was consistent with our 2017 operating plan and consistent with what we said last quarter when we reported comp sales of 3.1%, our strongest performance in the 12 quarters post the GPI acquisition.","We\u2019ve been looking at our across business across Q4 and Q1 combined for several months now. This provides a normalized picture of sequential sales improvement. For the 28-week period, we delivered positive sequential improvement in our comp sales performance. The combined comp for Q4 and Q1 of down 0.3% was approximately 70 basis point improvement versus the comp in Q3 2016. The sequential improvement we\u2019ve delivered in recent quarters demonstrates we\u2019re making real progress.","At the same time, we\u2019re not immune to the macro headwinds within the industry, which resulted in unexpected substantially softer consumer demand in the middle of Q1 as reflected in the publicly available data. This timeframe was worse than expected and resulted in a slow start to the spring selling season. That said, these short-term variables tend to smooth themselves overtime and while we need to manage them as part of our day-to-day operations, they don\u2019t change how we\u2019re transforming the business and how we think about long-term growth. The beginning of the quarter was in line with our expectations, as was the end of the quarter. We along with the rest of the industry experienced softness in February and March.","The good news is we closed Q1 with stronger performance and this is carried into Q2. As a result, we expect sequential improvement in our top-line growth once again in Q2 as compared with our Q4, Q1 combined number of down 0.3%. So to reinforce the key points surrounding our top-line performance, we\u2019re viewing Q4 and Q1 as one combined timeframe in our transformation. Q3 last year had comps to down 1% and Q4 and Q1 combined had comps of down 0.3%. While this was less than we planned, it represented sequential improvement and we expect to deliver sequential improvement again in Q2.","Our steadily improving sales performance reflects the impact of decisive and consistent actions we\u2019ve taken across three areas of focus, giving us confidence going forward; first, our priority to put the customer first is permeating the organization. It has been and will continue to be the key driver for consistent top-line growth. Second, our sustain investments and availability, customer service and our front-line is strengthening execution and engagement. And third, better execution throughout our supply chain is driving increased fill rates, higher in-stocks and reduced order to delivery time. Together, this is resulting in a better experience for customers in both Professional and DIY.","Turning to operating income, we\u2019ve been clear. Our turnaround won\u2019t be linear. It\u2019s important to note that while we\u2019re not managing our business quarter-to-quarter, our Q1 operating income results were generally in line with internal expectations at the beginning and end of the quarter with the notable exception of larger than anticipated sales softness in February and March. As in the past several quarters, our operating profit performance reflects deliberate choices to invest in our business and specifically in the customer to position AAP for the long-term.","When sales slowed down in the middle of Q1, we could have made a short-term decision to pull back on customer service. But in fact, we made a deliberate decision to sustain investment. At times, we know the difficult choices need to remain to fully capitalize on the significant opportunity we have to drive growth and margins over the long-term. Given the early stage of our turnaround and focus on reinvigorating the customer experience, the choice to sustain investment and customer service in the middle of short-term whether related softness was one of the easier decisions made in the quarter.","These investments are beginning to pay-off as evidenced by sequential improvement of comp store sales along with progress on core input metrics, including improved in stock rates, significant reductions in turnover and faster delivery times to customers. The other drivers of our operating margin decline resulted from fixed costs deleverage due to the comparable store sales decline and our continuing efforts to optimize our inventory. Tom Okray will provide more color on the financial shortly.","At the same time, our productivity agenda is on track and ramping up nicely. We\u2019re now executing against the framework we\u2019ve been constructing over the past several months. As the program boost and design to execution, we\u2019ll realize considerable productivity savings in the back half of the year for our annual operating plan. As a result of these factors outlined, we delivered an adjusted operating margin rate of 7.1% and adjusted EPS of $1.60. Taking all this into account, we remain confident with the progress we\u2019re making as we execute our plan and expect sales and customer momentum to continue with more operating leverage as we enter the back half of 2017.","We\u2019re performing well relative to our primary input metrics as the beginning and end of the quarter was in line with expectations. Unfortunately, the middle of the quarter was below plan as was broadly experienced across the industry. We also believe the sales softness was short-term in nature given recent trends. Importantly, Importantly, our productivity agenda ahead of plan. We\u2019ve now conclude that we can drive more gross savings in a shorter period of time. We will do this while continuing to position the business to grow faster. We\u2019ll begin to see improvements from our productivity initiatives in the second half of this year, which will help us meet bottom line targets. With Q1 behind us, I am pleased to report that we are now officially transitioning from Phase 1 of our transformation plan to Phase 2.","Phase 1 had three overarching objectives. First, refocus the organization from top to bottom on the customer. We have lost faith of this top priority and needed to regain a customer first culture to ensure a long term growth. Everyone at AAP needed to raise their gain by putting the customer first in everything we do. Across our businesses, we are now seeing adoption of a mindset that everyone's number one priority is sharing for the customer. Second, develop and align the organization behind a clear strategy and five year plan to accelerate performance. In addition, we have defined and are now executing against the new set of foundational cultural shifts we need to make. And third, build a world class leadership team that can execute our plan in the short term while transforming our business in the future. We are re-advancing Advance Auto Parts and I am excited by the fact that we have built a new and highly skilled leadership team by attracting top talent from multiple companies and industries. This when combined with deep parts experience throughout the organization give us a team which can both perform in the short term while transforming our business over the long term.","In Phase 1, we made deliberate and sustained investments and availability, customer service and our front line. This has improved input metrics and sales trends were getting market share performance moving in the right direction. With Phase 1 complete, we\u2019re turning our attention to Phase 2. Our objective for Phase 2 include; first, elevate focus on the customer and continue to narrow the performance gap; second, flawlessly execute the multi-year productivity plan we have been developing. We have a significant opportunity to thoughtfully and permanently remove unnecessary costs; and third, challenge our new leadership team to elevate our focus on attracting and developing talent throughout the organization. With stronger talent, we will build new capacities required to win in the future and evolve the culture to deliver value.","We have been hard at work with our growth agenda and over the past three quarters developing our Phase 2 initiatives, we\u2019re very excited about the capabilities we\u2019re building as we test and learn new ideas throughout the country. We\u2019re now beginning to scale the top performing initiatives. First, we\u2019re improving the customer experience and driving consistent execution across our network for both Professional and DIY customers. In Professional, it all starts with improving availability. Here we are building on the successful pilots we ran last year. Our availability transformation positions the right parts closer to the right customers by store reduces order to delivery time and drives growth. We have now added more stores to the availability transformation and we are seeing similar robust performance improvements that we saw in our lead markets in 2016.","As a result, we\u2019re expanding in select market throughout the balance of the year. We\u2019re also augmenting this improved availability with an enhanced technology platform. We piloted this last fall with exceptional results and made the decision to invest in the back-end analytics engine combined with front end consumer facing technology for customer account managers to improved sales productivity. With better insight into our customers, our customer account managers are able to more effectively manage their time with customers to better meet their needs. This will be fully deployed in Q3.","In DIY, we\u2019re equally focused on improving our customer and team member experience. We\u2019ve been running DIY experience pilots in a number of stores and markets. These pilots are standardizing the in-store customer experience store-by-store and region-by-region. So every store has the same consistent processes, the same consistent training and the same consistent approach to servicing the customer. In addition to making critical investments in the customer to drive growth, the second pillar of Phase 2 is the focus on our robust productivity pipeline.","Since we announced the productivity agenda and corresponding targets last November at our Analyst Day, we\u2019ve been aggressively putting the structure and leadership team in place to execute a sustainable multi-year productivity program. As we said previously, the productivity muscle simply is not exists at AAP. Our agenda includes thoughtful planning to change the work, investment and infrastructure and people to drive it and an intense focus on increasing visibility and performance management of costs. Our new leadership team has been instrumental in applying both longstanding experience and fresh perspectives to build our productivity agenda.","As a result, we\u2019re updating the target we shared with you last November of 500 million in productivity over five years and we now expect to achieve 750 million in gross productivity over four years, reflecting both the significant increase and acceleration. Over the past several months, we\u2019ve been aggressively challenging our sales to think differently about the work and how to thoughtfully and permanently remove waste from our system. The additional 250 million has resulted from our new leadership team challenging the status quo and will allow additional investments in our customers while expanding margins.","To be clear, the productivity target is not sales dependent, it\u2019s a gross number and some of this cost benefit will be used to fund growth initiatives, while the vast majority of it will drive margin improvement. Our productivity agenda continues to focus on the three pillars we shared last November; first, zero based budgeting or ZBB; second, the optimization of our supply China; and third reducing material input costs. We\u2019re very excited about this work. Allow me to share some examples. First, on ZBB, we\u2019re standardizing our first to cost control while eliminating redundancies and unproductive spending. There are substantial opportunities here throughout the Company.","Our ZBB agenda includes fundamental process redesign, policy changes and a complete rethink of how work it\u2019s done. This has been completed in many areas throughout the Company, and we expect to realize cost savings from this in the back half of 2017. Second, the simplification and optimization of our supply chain will drive both effectiveness and efficiencies. We are looking at our supply chain very differently than we have in the past. We\u2019re starting with the customer and working back to better meet their needs while leveraging the formidable footprint we enjoy today. In doing so, we\u2019re building new capabilities and leveraging the entirety of our asset base.","The great news here is that this approach provides the dual benefit of new capabilities and productivity without requiring additional investment in new buildings. As an example of supply chain optimization, we\u2019ve already consolidated fleet management companies, transitioning from three partners to one. Previously, Advance, Worldpac and Auto Part International negotiated three contracts separately, which resulted in three different suppliers and three different contracts. We\u2019re moving to one. In addition to significant savings, AAP will benefit from enhanced analytics and coordination across our entire fleet associated with having a single dedicated partner. This is a material simplification opportunity that leverages scale, dramatically improves asset utilization and lowers cost.","Third, let's talk material input costs, again we\u2019re taking a very different approach been in the past. We\u2019re conducting deep dives on product categories to better understand the material cost of the skews in our assortment and what type of collaborative value engineering we can do with our suppliers or brand partners as we now refer them, who are helping us find the wins both of us need to drive accelerated growth.","This work has already been conducted on several product categories, resulting in increased cost transparency and an improved material cost structure. We are working with our suppliers and partnership to apply this rigor n process across many categories throughout the balance of the year. To-date, we\u2019ve been building the foundational elements of our productivity agenda and have a high degree of confidence in our plan. We are now ready to drive execution of this plan, which will generate meaningful savings this year and beyond.","In summary, as we enter into Phase 2 of our transformational journey, we\u2019re investing in customer service and execution to narrow the top line growth gap versus the industry. We\u2019re dramatically increasing the focus on our productivity agenda to drive margin expansion and perhaps most importantly, we\u2019re we are increasing our proficiency in growing talent and evolving our culture. This is not an overnight process but we\u2019re pacing as expected and we will continue improving each quarter. As I said from the beginning, the opportunity to drive shareholder value at AAP is substantial to fully capture the opportunity ahead. We\u2019re taking focused disciplined approach to accelerate long term growth, while staying lesser focus on improving execution and performance for the balance of the year.","With that, I\u2019ll pass it to Tom Okray to share financials.","Tom Okray","Thanks Tom and good morning everyone. Our adjusted operating income came in at $204.9 million with adjusted operating margins down 349 basis points over the same period last year to 7.1%. Tom shared the high level drivers of our operating profit decline. But allow me to provide some additional color on each; first, our sales decreased 3.0%. While we anticipated a sequential decline, the expense to leverage from the comparable sales decline accounted for slightly more than 20% of the 349 basis points operating margin decrease. Second, our investments in the customer accounted for slightly more than half of the year-over-year operating margin decline. We know these investments put short-term pressure on earnings, but we believe they are absolutely the right thing to do to enable us to better serve our customers and accelerate top line momentum in order to regain market share.","Before I move to the third driver, it\u2019s important acknowledge the context of these customer investments versus the significant short-term cost reduction executed last year during the same period. Last year, the aggressive cost reductions in Q1 came at the expense of critical investments to serve the customer, including labor in the field and the store. This hurt our ability to get the right part to the right place and dramatically impacted our ability to service our customers. Compromising our service proposition is not the right approach for a company that is in the business of the delighting the customer. It is also not consistent with our renewed focus on driving sustainable performance improvement as we position the Company for long-term growth and profitability.","In contrast to last year and under renewed focus of caring for the customer first, we are prioritizing customer service and making the necessary incremental investments and initiatives that enable our field and frontline teams to serve the customer significantly better than we ever have. Our current productivity plan is also aimed at cost reduction, but we are acutely aware of the customer impact from cutting the wrong cost, or cutting the cost the wrong way. We are taking a more constructive and sustainable approach focused on, no regret cost removal, by fundamentally changing the way we work and removing cost while improving our service and execution, not at the expense of customer service. This approach is fundamentally different than the prior practice and harder, it takes more time to identify to plan and to implement.","We have been hard at work for over the past eight months, constructing our productivity agenda in a thoughtful manner with the customer always at the forefront of our planning activities. I'll come back to our productivity agenda in a moment. The remaining component of our operating margin decline was related to our ongoing inventory optimization efforts. As we continue to take proactive steps to reduce inventory and optimize working capital, we maintained a very disciplined approach to inventory in the quarter. We are managing inventory much smarter and more importantly, in line with our sales plan.","While this is good news and another step forward in the right direction, it does create a year-over-year short-term headwind to our operating margin. We will continue to focus on thoughtful inventory reduction for the balance of the year without impacting the customer, it is unquestionably the right choice for us to make.","Turning back to our productivity plan. We have been maniacally focused on our agenda and are seeing the productivity mindset permeating the organization. This dynamic, coupled with fresh ideas and industry best practices from new leadership that have recently joined AAP team, have changed the way we are running AAP. We have been building momentum, and today, we increased our initial gross productivity target to $750 million and accelerated the achievement from five years to four years. With respect to the pacing of our results, we knew our transformation was not going to be linear. We are in the midst of transforming both our top and bottom line performance with a lot of exciting work underway, which we expect to build on throughout the balance of the year.","For 2017, we expect the operating performance impact of our collective action will be weighted toward the back half of the year. As we said previously, we absolutely expect to get to the point where we will balance top line growth with bottom line expansion. We are confident in long term opportunity as we build new muscles to drive productivity and accelerate margin expansion.","Before moving to Q&A, I would like to draw attention to the new accounting rule, which we implemented in Q1. Beginning January 01, 2017, the excess tax benefit for stock based compensation is recognized as a component of tax expense rather than equity. This change resulted in a decrease to our tax expense for the quarter and a corresponding increase to our net income and earnings per share. Further discloser and the impact of the adoption of this accounting change can be found in our Form-10-Q.","With that, we will open third call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now being the question-and-answer session [Operator Instruction]. I would like to remind participants to please limit yourself to one question and one follow up. Our first question is coming from the line of Chris Horvers of J. P. Morgan. Your line is now open.","Chris Horvers","I want to follow up a little bit on the expense conversations, especially as we think about the second quarter. So last year in the first quarter, the yield management team levered expenses about a 100 basis points despite comping down too. So do you think about the 200 basis points or so decline in operating expense rate or increase operating expense rate in this quarter, is that 100 basically, we have to give that back and so really about half of that operating expense deleverage in this quarter relates to the under spending last year?","Tom Greco","When we looked at the investment that we are essentially needed to make in the first quarter of this year, last year the changes that were made in our customer facing hours in the stores was quite negative for the overall customer experience. So we made the conscious decision to invest back in the customer in the quarter.","Chris Horvers","And so as you think about the second quarter, last year, they come down but they only deleverage operating expenses 20 basis points. And actually if you look at SG&A per store, it was down nearly 2%. I guess to help us out on the second quarter, what should been that deleverage or last year in the second quarter or what was the right rate of inflation and SG&A per store that we can base off of as we put in second quarter estimates?","Tom Greco","Well, Chris let me step back, I mean we\u2019ve gone in the construction of our strategic plan, we\u2019ve obviously look overall longer timeframe than individual quarters. And what we concluded last year and we communicated to, I think the analyst community in November, was the company it really lack focus on the customer period for quite some time. As you know, we\u2019ve been losing market share for seven years and over that timeframe, habits get built-up, our people take a different approach to the customer that we would have liked, different than we would have liked. And as we built-out the strategy itself, we wanted to make sure that we were change that approach with the customer up and down in the organization; so from a leadership team perspective; from a planning of our customer facing hours; from the standpoint of how our stores either active with customers.","So as we build out the five-year plan, we look at what we needed to do in 2017 and 2018 and beyond; as you know, we started to make some of those investments last year in the back half of the year. So we\u2019ll start to lap those as we get into the back half. But without a doubt, as we plan the business in 2017, we knew that the first part of the year was going to require investment in the customer.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Forbes with Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open.","Steve Forbes","Maybe if you can start given the leadership changes that I taken place recently, can you just expand. I know you touched on it. But can you just expand of where you are in the optimization cycle as it relates for the team, both of the executive level and store ops? And I believe you mentioned the foundation is in place. So are you generally satisfied and that\u2019s why, we\u2019re going into Phase 2 of the program here? And I guess lastly, if you could just expand, how those new individuals that have joined the team have integrated in the platform, both culturally and accepted and as opt as a plan that you laid out back in November? I mean, have they been pretty smooth and optimistic?","Tom Greco","Well, first of all, we\u2019re building a world-class team here in AAP. And as I look around the room, most of the people in the room in here today work with Advanced nine months ago. So that part is dramatically different than when I arrived here. The team we\u2019re building is committed to really building our performance culture up and down in the organization, and that excludes existing leaders at AAP, who\u2019ve been in the industry a long time and are really stepping up. Bob Cushing in the room here with us today, he is got 30 years of parts business experience. We also brought, some of the new people we brought in, have come from the part of the business. People like Mike Broderick who similarly has 30 years of experience and is now our chief merchant.","Bob and Mike are really committed to dramatic improvement, performance improvement here at AAP, so that part is really exciting. I think we\u2019re also injecting smart talented new leaders that have exceptional industry experience up and down the organization. So we brought in Tom Okray from Amazon, as you know; Leslie Keating Frito-Lay; Natalie Rothman from Pepsi; we brought in Maria Reyes to run one of our divisions from Private Equity, Mike came to us from Tyco. And these are global leaders who are bringing a completely different mindset and approach to transform AAP. So that might fundamental leadership team is pretty much in place now and now of course we are going the next level down and Tom and self with sitting here, there is two people in the room today that Tom has hired from other companies that have joined us, that are going to add tremendous value.","How are they acclimating, I think that\u2019s a great question and integrating to the Company. We still have work to do, I think to build the team work and the energy around the opportunity going forward, these are very talented individuals. They are bringing different perspectives in. But you can snap your fingers and have the top 200 people in the company immediately gel. So I think we have got a little bit of work to do there, but I feel terrific about the talent that\u2019s joining new organization. And I have been really excited by the fact that we have been able to recruit such talented people in, and we have been very successful of that.","Steve Forbes","And then a quick follow up. Given the increase in the productivity goals right over the next four years here, has any of that impacted the anticipated CapEx spend for the year or does the '17 I guess guidance you laid out or I guess number still stand. And if you can, I am not sure if you done this in the past. But can you help us breakdown the 250 million into packets whether be IT, supply chain, maintenance, new stores, just from insight and where the CapEx spending is being allocated?","Tom Greco","Yes, let me take that one. No we\u2019re going to stay with our guidance of approximately 250 million. The additional gross productivity number is not dependant on that. With respect to breaking down the 250million, you hit on the key points; it's IT; it's new stores; it's maintenance. We\u2019re not going to go into further detail other than the bucket of that way.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Simeon Gutman","First question is a follow up to Chris's earlier, so since you\u2019re moving now into Phase 2, what is that imply for the margin outlook in the second quarter?","Tom Greco","We\u2019re not going to comment on the specific margin outlook in the second quarter. We do feel really, really good about our ability to thoughtfully remove cost and improve our flow through as we get to the back half for the year.","Simeon Gutman","My second maybe more strategic and into the couple parts to it. Tom can you help us understand at what changing of anything from how you looked at this business six months ago, just some of the actions you are taking today. I know Bob Cushing has been elevated, I am just curious, if some of the plans have evolved? And the bigger question is if there are all these investments that need to be made, why wouldn\u2019t it made sense to just rebase the earnings of the business this year and make these investments without promising margin improvement until they can more fully ramp in the end here?","Tom Greco","First of all, I\u2019ll let Bob talk a little bit about with changing on the Professional side of the business. I think it's changing pretty dramatically. Bob, can you talk about how you are pulling together the Professional side.","Bob Cushing","So we are certainly transforming our professional business by driving the culture of care for our customers first. We have a number of key initiatives out there to transform our customers\u2019 experience. What it's focused on, it's focus on what our customer value most and this will enable first call capability. Foundationally, our issues on standing on leveraging our enterprise value proposition across all band. So, first let me start with where do our customers value more, improve product availability. So we\u2019re providing our industry leading portfolio of brand and absorbing quickly to the marketplace. We have a number of new models that are out there that we\u2019re losing out to deliver the right part at the right time. And we\u2019re really excited about a new model that we basically developed for the professional business and we\u2019re standing it up next week, we\u2019re opening it next week and this will provide and leveraging entire enterprise portfolio products under one roof. And so we\u2019re excited about that more to come on that.","Secondly, we\u2019ve deployed our new catalog system called APAC at over half of our stores, as the catalog has reached content multi brand strategy of course the enterprise that is supply chain availability. It's basically our enterprise catalog. Third, we\u2019re focused on either doing business. We have piloted with over 500 customers on our new B2B commerce platform, it has enhanced features, deeper integration and to shop software system. And fourth, to drive innovation in sales force effectiveness, we have deployed iPads to our entire field sales force. Overall, we are transforming the capability for our customer.","And as a result of some of the actions that we\u2019ve already taken, we\u2019ve had a number of major wins with strategic accounts that guide us multiyear agreements due to the actions we\u2019re taking. What I will tell you simply this, we are staying maniacally focused on basically what drives customer value and we\u2019ve been continue this transformation journey to succeed.","Tom Greco","And Simeon, let me get to your second question, which was around the pacing of the investment. If you think back to what we showed last November, Company lacked focus on the customer, no cohesive strategy inability to execute notable capability gaps on the leadership team. But as we laid things out and constructed the new leadership team from Bob to Tom Okray to Leslie Keating is come into our supply chain to Mike Roderick, I mean we really saw an opportunity to drive the productivity agenda faster. And the opportunity there is significant. We really see that a line of sight to the entirety of the 750 million over the four years, it's in the three buckets that we described in the prepared remarks. We plan it strategically, working from the customer back. I mean we\u2019re routing our productivity agenda in the customer. It's not just taking cost out, so we\u2019re routing in the customer. And then we\u2019ve done a very rigorous bottoms up planning exercise that essentially phase of the productivity by year, by period, by geography. So we feel really good about our ability to take the cost out without disrupting the customer.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Seth Sigman of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Seth I. Sigman","I just wanted to clarify on the guidance. Did you guys actually update the comps or EBITDA targets you laid out previously?","Tom Greco","So let me step back from this one Seth and provide some context. And our approach is to provide guidance once a year. And consistent with our focus on offering for the long term, we're not going to provide regular updates as a matter of course. The long term outlook for the industry remains very, very compelling for us and we remain focused on executing the key elements of our transformation plan. With respect to 2017, well Q1 had a weak patch in the middle of quarter that impacted the entire industry. We've actually seen improved trends over the last several weeks and based on this, we expect a more normalized environment for the rest of the year. And our investments in the customer are clearly having an impact and with our productivity initiatives kicking in the back half of the year, we feel all of this will drive significantly improved results.","Seth I. Sigman","And then as you think about those long-term productivity targets that you updated today, does the timing change at all, so you shorten the timeframe. Does that impact 2017 or more of the incremental savings in \u201918 and beyond?","Tom Okray","The timing for the additional 250 million is primarily going to be in \u201918 and beyond. As Tom stated, we\u2019re not going to change guidance in fiscal year \u201917. We\u2019re comfortable with the outlook for adjusted that we provided.","Seth I. Sigman","And then my follow-up is on gross margin. The 135 basis points decline this quarter, it seems to be significant in last quarter. Obviously, it reflects the inventory optimization efforts you mentioned in higher supply chain costs, I think from last year. Assuming that\u2019s an ongoing process, but how does that stabilize through this year? Can you walk us through the timeline and how think about gross margin as we move through the year?","Tom Okray","Let me give you on some additional color on the 349 bp deterioration. We\u2019ve been very consistent and clear that we need to make investments in our customer in drawing down our inventory. In Q1, the impact of these investments were magnified by two main factor; the first one was the softness in the middle of the quarter causing the deleverage; the second one was the lapping of the 2016 Q1 initiatives that are in consistent with our current strategy. As Tom said, the Company was cutting customer service hours, which is just something that we\u2019re not going to do in the short-term.","When we\u2019re going to be delighting the customer, we\u2019re going to smartly optimize our customer service hours. And the second point previous leadership was building up inventory. As part of our end-to-end supply chain optimization, we are going to be optimizing our inventory. We\u2019re going to be drawing it down. How that plays out over the year, wWe\u2019re not going to break this down quarter-by-quarter; having said that, the productivity is going to come in the back half -- largely in the back half of 2017.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Scot Ciccarelli of RBC Capital Markets. You may now ask your questions.","Scot Ciccarelli","Just a quick clarification. Tom, did you just say you are comfortable with DIY guidance that you previously provided?","Tom Okray","I mean, as a matter of course, we are going to update guidance. We\u2019re going to give guidance once a year. We\u2019re going to give the fiscal year guidance. As Tom said, we\u2019re very comfortable with the industry dynamics. We\u2019re very comfortable with the strategic initiatives that we\u2019ve got availability. Our digital online plans are accelerating, customer experience on the DIY side, we expect to see these improvements in the second half of the year and it gives us confidence in our ability to drive top and bottom-line performance.","Scot Ciccarelli","And then the follow-up would be, can you help us understand your expectation for the $750 million of productivity gains you just outlined? We understand that the $750 million is a gross number. But you also suggested some of that will be reinvested and I guess what the investment group would basically want to know is. What\u2019s the right way to think about what we might see on a net basis? Thanks.","Tom Greco","Well, first of all, Scot, we really excited about this productivity agenda. I can't tell you how excited we are, it's been nine months in the making. Obviously, we\u2019ve been working on with our entire team. As Tom came in November, he really brought a dimension to how we were thinking about that we started to accelerate things that hadn\u2019t been accelerated. We brought Leslie Keating in who is a terrific executive, track record of success with productivity Mike Roderick with significant experience interacting with the supplier community being both on the supplier side and working on the part side of the business. So the construction of the productivity agenda is something that we\u2019re very, very excited about. As we look forward we\u2019re going to continue to look at ways to be ahead of where the customers going. Obviously, we want to go over the path is moving and to that end we are going to continue to look places to invest to sustain long term growth.","What we showed in November was our goal is to perform above the industry average in terms of sales growth and to expand margin significantly from where they are today, that stands as we sit here today. We\u2019re not going to update exactly how that\u2019s going to play out in the next 12 months, but we should be able to update you towards the end of the year and how that will in fall. But the 750 million obviously is a four year number now, so we are in '17, so '17, '18, '19, '20 is the timeframe for the 750 million.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser of UBS. Your line is now open.","Michael Lasser","I recognize that you only want to update your guidance once a year, so to achieve the prior objective of 15 to 35 basis points of margin expansion, would imply that you are going to have to achieve anywhere from 200 to 300 basis points of margin expansion in the back half of the year. But this hasn\u2019t really -- that doesn\u2019t really have a history of doing that. How would it possible even with those productivity metrics to achieve that type of margin expansion?","Tom Greco","Well Mike, I certainly understand the question. I am go back to as we planned the business for 2017, knowing what we knew in November, which was the challenging situation we were dealing within the front half of the year, reducing customer facing hours, really an inability to execute. We\u2019re still billing out that productivity muscle, some gaps on the leadership team at the time. We obviously plan the business accordingly. From our standpoint, if we hadn\u2019t reflected on the factors I just mentioned and used that in our plan, it would have been somewhat responsible. So we did plan the business to be back half loader in terms of margin flows through. Obviously, we\u2019re\u2019 mindful, we are attracting four in the year but we can\u2019t really speculate on hypotheticals right now.","We\u2019re focused on executing our plan and really positioning the business to deliver long term value and that include investments in the customer and building out the productivity. So our transformation is well underway and we are confident we\u2019re going to show the impact of our actions on both top and bottom line in the second half of '17 and beyond.","Michael Lasser","And you provide some examples of in your prepared remarks of where you are harvesting your productivity savings, such as consolidating fleet management down to one provider. But in light of the fact that you don\u2019t really want to touch customer service and labors, your biggest expense bucket, can you provide other concrete examples of where you're get the productivity savings starting the second half of the year?","Tom Okray","Michael, labor is certainly a big cost, but we are going up and down the P&L. And let me just take you back to the three buckets that we\u2019ve got for productivity; we\u2019ve got material cost; supply chain; and ZBB. So I'll just go a little bit deeper on each one. Material cost is significantly bigger than labor, and we have started an entirely new clean sheet process with our brand partners where we are going deep dive into the cost structure, packaging, raw materials to really work together in a collaborative way to optimize the specs and the offering from the customer. And we see tremendous potential in this to drive results. We have a good start in the first quarter. We see significantly more opportunity in the back half of the year and ongoing.","And then let's go to supply chain, supply chain which is distribution centers and transportation. Within the supply chain, we\u2019ve got standardization of distribution centers where we can eliminate touches have more efficient labor execution, better fixed cost performance by putting in network wide subject matter experts. On transportation in addition to going from three to one fleet companies that\u2019s just the start; we\u2019ve got better utilization of our vehicle; we\u2019ve got less miles, we\u2019ve got fuel savings. So there is on the supply chain. Moving to ZBB, again a ton of opportunity there some of the things that we\u2019re doing. We\u2019re looking at our professional services or a consulting expenses and doing from a zero based approach and really taking cost out there. LED lighting in our stores and looks better for our customers. Our customers are delighted we\u2019ve got a good ROIC on it.","So to really make this just a labor play is really not looking at the entire P&L. And coming back to what Tom said, we are unable to this by the strong leadership team that we brought in. We\u2019re able to change the meetings forum; we\u2019re able to bring different perspective; we\u2019re able to drive the deeper into the organization; the depth of analysis is much greater. So I couldn\u2019t be more excited. When I first came in, in November and we gave the 500, I've been here a couple of weeks. Now that I've got more of a lay of the land, there is just tremendous opportunity here.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Baker of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Michael Baker","So just want to talk about 2017 and then longer-term. It did seem like and maybe correct me if we shouldn\u2019t take this comment too specifically, but it did seem like you are comfortable with the full year operating income number of up 15% to 35. It also seems like the first quarter was probably below your plan because of that patch in February and March. That would imply that something needs to be better in the second quarter or the second half. Is that the right way to think about it? Or if that\u2019s not the case maybe the 15% to 35% isn't the right way to think about this year? And then I'll ask the longer-term follow-up question. Thanks.","Tom Greco","Well, just on your question on will it be better about the year, absolutely, no question about that Michael. We haven\u2019t talked a lot about the sales number. But there was, as we said in our prepared remarks. We have the date flip, right? The date flip is pretty basically. We knew exactly what that was going to be worth in the fourth quarter last year. We also had this significant pull forward pull forward or winter related demand into December. In particular, in our Northern market, which we had an idea that was happening, and obviously we finalized our plan in November and early December. So we didn\u2019t know how big that December was going to be.","And when you look at some of the categories that performed well in the fourth quarter, they were winter related categories and a lot of that got growing out so not all of that was plan as we planned to first quarter. That said, in the last several months as we continue to really work this productivity agenda hard, Tom Okray, Leslie Keating, Mike Broderick, Bob Cushing, we were really, really pressing hard to take real cost out of the business sustainability and that\u2019s why we feel very good about the long-term prospects to get at the margin expansion opportunity that exists.","Michael Baker","And I guess that would biggest takeaway into the longer term question. I don\u2019t know if you specifically reiterated on this call yet, if you did, I apologize. But last few year outlook for 500 basis points of margin expansion over five years. Is that still the right way to think about it with the additional cost savings? And is part of remind us what kind of sales list to be offset the reinvestment? I think you would say comps getting to a mid-single-digit range by 2021. Is that still the way you\u2019re thinking about it?","Tom Greco","I mean, our goal is to perform above the industry average, which as you know is 3% to 4%. Everything we look at, says this is a very healthy industry; car park, 2016 new vehicle sales; vehicles in operation; miles driven; average age; all of them say 3% to 4%, which means that we have to be above that in order to achieve our comp sales goals.","Michael Baker","If I could just talk to Mike and ask one follow-up to something you just said, you talked about the vehicle aging. I\u2019m curious how you look at that. What you think the sweet spot of vehicle maintenance is and if you look at the number of vehicles in that sweet spots and how that might be changing on an annual basis?","Tom Okray","No, when I look at, it is certainly what we look at is the vehicles in the bucket of six to 10 years old. And when you look at since 2009, when we show certainly new vehicle sales increased dramatically from the low that we have been, those vehicles are coming into play out. So we see there is a tremendous upside over the next five years is both as much as 10% to 20%. So that\u2019s going to play well into the aftermarket side into that six to 10 year old bucket. So we\u2019re pretty positive about 3% to 4% range and guidance on the aftermarket sales growth, which we\u2019re certainly targeting our sales, if not certainly higher.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matt Fassler of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Matt Fassler","My first question relates to your investments in the customer. I\u2019m mainly interested in what you\u2019re spending on particularly since in the prior couple of quarters incentive comp, seemed to be a piece of the acceleration in spend. And with the revenues having been under pressure, I would imagine that would have a bit factor from a sales force. So can you talk about just a little more detail and where that spends is coming from, please.","Tom Okray","I\u2019ll start and then I\u2019ll have Tom to be constructive little bit more. But I would like to talk about the incentive comp and our team members. Our customer facing employees are so critical to the success of our Company in terms of their ability to connect with our customers and help them solve problems they love to solve problems. As you know we had been experiencing tremendous turnover in the Company at these front line customer facing roles be that a commercial parts pro, a customer account manager, a general manager, a district manager. And I am excited to let you know that our turnover continues to go down dramatically there. We\u2019re down 20% to 40% in turnaround over on those key rolled in the first quarter.","And we\u2019re going to continue to stay focus on really getting our people excited about serving the customer and building that performance culture in the Company. Part of that was what we call our field to front line incentive program for our customer facing employees and we continued to invest in that and that was part of our customer facing investments in the first quarter to drive that behavioral change that cultural change that we feel is so important for the long term success of the Company. I got to tell you, I probably got 50 notes in the last couple of days of employees that have been recognized through our fuel the front line program and that continues to grow and build momentum in the company overall. So Tom can you take a little bit more of a dive on how it was deconstructive?","Tom Greco","Sure, yes Matt, I think the way to look at it for investment in the customer is really four buckets; the first one is customer service hours referred to its labor, the second how much is describing is our fuel the front line or filed incentive, the third is parts availability and supply chain, making sure we are getting the right part at the right time at the right place, and then the last is promotion. And just a little bit more color, I mean as Tom said, when we came in and are looking at the Company and its transformation we really need to build the foundation. So are we over indexing and our investment in the customer, absolutely. Is that going to give more surgical overtime and optimize; certainly. We are always going to invest in the customer, but overtime we are going to be able to do it more efficiently. As our productivity agenda catches up is well, this is all going to hit together and we are going to have an inflection point. So that\u2019s the way I think about the investment in the customer.","Matt Fassler","And then, I guess, my second question relates to the integration with Carquest I know that there is a lot of work will be done. Can you talk where that sitting in terms of your activity levels, the financial consequences of the integration work that\u2019s going on, the integration work is still to evolve overtime?","Tom Greco","I mean, we\u2019re accelerating our efforts on this now. As you know, we took a bit of step back from what we had been doing, which was more of the old PCR work which was consolidating stores, converting stores, relocating stores. As Leslie has come on in conjunction with Bob, we have really starting to work from the customer back on our asset base. We have got plenty of assets; Leslie would say that, Tom would say that, I would say that. We just haven't leveraged them the way that they could be leveraged and to their potential. So making sure we put the customer first in everything we are doing and construction our supply chain from that is where we\u2019re headed.","And we are making some pretty big strives on that. I'm not going to get into all of the details for competitive reasons. But we\u2019re pretty excited about how our enterprise, customer facing tools, technology and supply chain will evolve overtime and really start to improve our key metrics on order to delivery time, having the right part in the right place, our availability in the market, all of those are part of the plan. And the idea is to leverage the entirety of our asset base, not to approach it from the previous approach which trying to integrate advance and Carquest, and we\u2019re looking at it more broadly.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Nagel of Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.","Brian Nagel","Maybe to shift gears just sort of a bit, you talked a lot about the soft patch and sales during in Q1 and by no means you the only Company you have the competitor you actually talking about it a little bit. Maybe get your perspectives on what caused that, what was different this time around? As the business ticked up was the reason rebound or was that more of a normalization? Thanks.","Tom Okray","Brian, again, I'll reiterate we\u2019ve looked at every number. The long-term variables are very positive. They are point to the 3% to 4% we referenced earlier. The short-term impact of what happened in February and March, we looked at all of the factors you'd expect. We\u2019ve looked at products, geographies, channels, customers, weather, tax; everything we look at says that this was a blip, not a trend. We\u2019re going to continue to monitor it closely from an industry standpoint, I mean, if you look at the categories and you look at how they play out Brian over the really the last call it 32 weeks; the Q4 numbers than the Q1 numbers for us, then the early start of three or five you go well; batteries had a huge Q4, soft in Q1; now are seeing a bounce back, it was very cold in Q4 in December; we had a very warm Jan-Feb now we had a very hot week last week in the summer. Those are the type of things that can swing quarter-to-quarter, but we really believe that 3% to 4% is solid.","And from an AAP standpoint, Q4 plus Q1 was sequentially better than the previous quarter, and we expect Q2 to be sequentially better than Q4 plus Q1 and we\u2019re sitting here with $10 billion out of our $135 billion in the categories. So the long-term outlook and opportunity ahead is substantial and we feel we\u2019ll continue to sequentially improve.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Seth Basham of Wedbush Securities. Your line is now open.","Seth Basham","My question is around strategic accounts with multiyear agreements that you mentioned. You picked up a bunch of these. Could you provide some examples and is this a form of investment and price that you're referring to?","Tom Greco","So as you well know, many of the strategic accounts have put out or the industry there looking for both the year agreements with their suppliers. And so a number of those come up over the last six months and so. And I\u2019ll tell you that we basically have one certainly in every single one of them, so we\u2019re winning. And we\u2019re winning because of what we basically bringing the capabilities of the organization and certainly what we\u2019re working on, which we shared with them. And we see them as our strategic partners, they basically have looked at us certainly from what we\u2019ve already been able to provide today. And certainly, now, certainly leveraging all the banners across the enterprise, they know what\u2019s coming as well. And as I mentioned that new model that we\u2019re putting out there, they\u2019re extremely interested in that, we\u2019re going to leverage that as well. But I will say, for the most part, customer-by-customer, we\u2019re winning and we\u2019ll continue to win in that particular side of the business there. And as I said, it\u2019s growing, and it will continue to grow.","Seth Basham","How material is this to the sales outlook through 2017? Is it a material incremental boost to comps as these accounts ramp up and a query to that, is that a weight on gross margin?","Tom Greco","Obviously, we look really close that those things said before we handle these RFP. I mean I think it\u2019s a natural outcome that the large customers in the Professional side of the business or growing get lager. So we\u2019ve got to manage that in our overall portfolio. We reported not going to comment specifically on the size of it, we\u2019re pretty excited about the fact that Bob has coming with his background, with his leadership team. They\u2019ve done a great job packing up what we consider to be the most, the best portfolio in part in the industry, including the training institutes that we\u2019re standing. Bob standing up, integrating the Carquest Training Institute with the Worldpac Training Institute which provides tremendous value to our large customers out there in the marketplace. So we\u2019re going to continue to leverage the scale of all of our businesses to build a more attractive portfolio for our customer based. And overtime, we believe that will help us winning the market.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dan Wewer of Raymond James. Your line is now open.","Dan Wewer","I want to talk about promotional pricing and how that could be impacting gross margin, as in fact for member of Speed Perks, I was getting 20% off anything online would seen aggressive. Is that a change in strategy?","Tom Greco","Well, we\u2019re pretty excited about Speed Perks, Dan. We\u2019ve got an opportunity to do a better job connecting directly with our Speed Perks members. I will tell you that will evolve overtime. We want to make Speed Perks more sticky it should be more than just a promotional coupon off events. And so I\u2019ll leave it that but we\u2019re working pretty hard on at a better connect, our physical and digital assets, and that includes the Speed Perks program.","Dan Wewer","Well, I know your competitors claim that there is minimal price elasticity for demand in this industry, and we\u2019ve had this amazing gross margin expansion cycle the last 10 years. But do you think we\u2019re at the point now where it becomes necessary use pricing to drive market share?","Tom Greco","Yes. It certainly not a huge part of our agenda going forward, we\u2019re looking very carefully and strategic pricing. But in terms of a weight on gross margin, we don\u2019t see that.","Dan Wewer","And then just one follow-up question, can you talk about why the higher productivity savings today. It doesn\u2019t sound like, we\u2019re going to see much change in the second quarter, doesn\u2019t really begin to kick into the third quarter. And even then, it really doesn\u2019t really begin to gather momentum until 2018? So curious as to why today was it necessary to talk about the savings, particularly when you\u2019re not comfortable talking about the net savings, on the gross savings?","Tom Okray","Yes, I mean the reason we\u2019re bringing it out today is this is about five or six months since the entire leadership has come together; myself, I have been on the ground five months; Bob has been in position a little bit longer; Mike Roderick has been in his position for a few months; Leslie has got a feet on the ground in terms of supply chain and we are all coming together to really work on a daily basis on productivity. And we\u2019ve been tracking this versus our 500 million targets and we are very optimistic, so we have this opportunity with the investment community and we want it to make a public, nothing other than that. We are excited about it. We think it shows the leadership team, how we are working together and that\u2019s the reason.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ben Bienvenu of Stephens. Your line is now open.","Ben Bienvenu","Recognizing that the turnaround is unlikely to be linear. What are some of the things that we should be focus to judge the progress you\u2019re making quarter-to-quarter in achieving your goals? Is that ultimately comp improving substantially?","Tom Greco","Well, for sure, comps are the primary focus for us at the moment. We\u2019re driving at customer investments we\u2019re driving at things that matter to our customers, both on the professional side of business and on the DIY side of the business. And our goal is to continue the sequential improvement which we talked about. And obviously relative performance is important within our market share. We don\u2019t get a lot of market share data band. But what we do we pay very close attention to it and we are making progress there. We are not gaining share, okay, to be clear. But we are narrowing the gap in terms of our performance and we are going to continue to stay focused on that. And overtime, the goal is to narrow that completely and then obviously at some point perform above the industry average. So that is the primary focus.","Ben Bienvenu","And then thinking about the multiyear 500 basis point improvement in margins and mid single digit comps, is it your implication if you see comps slowing to intensify your spend in customer facing roles and supply chain initiatives. And similarly, if you outperform your comp assumptions, what is your inclination to try and leverage SG&A, how should we think about ultimate long term operating margin expansion once you get to a sustainable run rate of improvement?","Tom Greco","Well, first of all, the 750 million is literally down to the dollar, right? The 750 million is planned out over the next four years. We know exactly where that is in the vast majority of cases, that 750 million is not sales, and there is a very little of that moves up and down with sale. When you go to one fleet company from three companies, that doesn\u2019t have anything to do with what we sell. If I am able to reduce the touches which are way too high in our current supply chain, if I can take the touches down, that\u2019s worth something. If I can reduce the number of miles driven on the same number of deliveries in the same amount of sale that takes cost out without driving sales; so we\u2019ve constructed the productivity agenda such that is not sales dependant. So we\u2019re not looking for leverage on these cost out measures, because they tend to be waste or redundancies or things that that can be reduced. And given where our relevant margin is versus the industry average, I think, you can probably see that we have pretty good opportunity to do that, because we have peers in our industry that have already done it. So we\u2019re focusing on essentially looking at our asset base and our model and how we invest with the customer and how do we close the margin gap as we\u2019re driving at the customer agenda.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kate McShane of Citi Research. Your line is now open.","Unidentified Analyst","This is Chris in for Kate. Thank you for taking my question. I was wondering with -- potentially you seem the date all at the end of Q1. Are you seeing comps running in line with your annual guidance for comp? And I guess, also what's the comp benefit that you are getting from some of those availability test initiatives that you\u2019re rolling out and how big is that right now as a percent of your store base?","Tom Greco","We\u2019re not going to comment specifically Chris on the quarter, I mean but we\u2019ve seen a dramatic improvement in our comp obviously coming up a difficult Q1. Your second question was on the -- repeat your second question?","Unidentified Analyst","So you talked about some of the availability type initiatives that you're rolling out. Just kind of curious what kind of comp lift that you're seeing in the test markets? ","Tom Greco","Very strong, very, very strong lift. We\u2019re now up to I think we\u2019re up to five markets and we\u2019re continue to see the same performance improvement. We\u2019re not going to give a specific number, but it\u2019s very, very strong and very compelling.","Unidentified Analyst","And just on the Q1 gross margin, just curious if you could give sort of breakout a little bit maybe like how much of that decline was merchandize margin and how much of those deleveraging on occupancy costs and other fix cost?","Tom Okray","Yes, I mean going back to our prepared remarks, a little over half was investing in the customer little over 20% was the comp sales impact and remainder was primarily inventory related optimizing our inventory.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bret Jordan of Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Bret Jordan","Could you talk a little bit about the trend on the AP inventory and maybe at what point might we see the accounts payable to begin to expand again. Obviously, debt-to-EBITDA of 2.8 is that getting to be an issue, and maybe we\u2019re have an even contraction in the second quarter, is there a point where that sort of impairing or ability to leverage the working capital?","Tom Okray","Yes, great question. I mean we still see a significant opportunity to improve our AP ratio overtime. We said on previous calls, we see that definitely in the 90% range. That said, of the AP ratio for those this is a quarter was impacted by the lower sales environment coupled with the lower AP balances, which were driven primarily by the inventory that was purchased last year in Q1 when the Company was significantly building up inventory. Let me also just go back to the leadership that we brought in the Company. We now have single credit leaders on the key component of our cash flow. This is something that we didn\u2019t have in the past. We actually have a director of working capital now, which is an external higher.","We\u2019ve got people on AP, AR inventory that are single threaded leaders totally focused. And we\u2019re meeting twice a week now in terms of being able to really dive deep. And this is something that we just didn\u2019t have before and I want to take you back to the prepared remarks. We are running the Company different way. The insight that the new people are bringing is dramatic. I\u2019m not happy where the AP ratio is. I\u2019m not happy where our focus on cash is, trust that\u2019s going to get better, we\u2019ve got the foundation in place to make it better.","Bret Jordan","When we expect AP to start to expand in the second half? I guess is it something that reflects this year or I got something that longer term?","Tom Okray","Yes. I\u2019m not going to talk about a specific timeframe, just because it is so integrated to our end-to-end supply chain optimization. So we could very easily do a short-term action to pull the inventory out but we got very high guardrails because that would really hurt the availability for the customer. And as we\u2019re repeating here and you\u2019re getting the strategy, we\u2019re just not going to do that. Availability is key for our customer. So we\u2019ve got high guardrails there, we\u2019re going to think the inventory out in a measured smart way. We grew 2% in Q1 versus 6% or 7% last year in Q1. We\u2019re making progress it will get faster, but just don\u2019t want to be pin down to a specific timeframe right now for this year.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question today comes from Chris Bottiglieri of Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.","Chris Bottiglieri","I was hoping to dig in on the supply chain. I\u2019m going to work in the assumption that your three businesses, Worldpac, AI and Advanced, are kind of three disparate businesses with three discrete customers. So I get the sense that from DC to store there\u2019s probably geographic synergies from semi, stuff like that. But I guess first question is, would you agree at my assessment that three different disparate business that customers. And then two is there an opportunity to improve that semi\u2019s from store to customer, synergizing these three businesses?","Tom Greco","First of all, great question, Chris. I mean, we\u2019re -- with Leslie coming on we\u2019re taking a very different step back on the supply chain; again, starting with the customer. She is actually conducted or our team is conducted a series of interviews with customers to better understand the need. We spend a lot of time on DIY consumer insights last year, professional customer insights last year. We\u2019re augmenting that this year to really make sure we understand we\u2019re delivering against what the customers want. She is also looking at it end-to-end. So we\u2019re not looking at discrete parts of our supply chain. We\u2019re looking at the entirety of the supply chain, because a lot of times, in supply chain, you can reduce costs in one area and increase it in another area. So it\u2019s really end-to-end look at it.","As part of that, we have, she would say, we would say, Bob would say, all of us would say, we have significant inefficiencies in our current supply chain. We have many nodes, many assets. Obviously, our stores operate at fulfillment centers, as you know. So taking a step back and looking at the entirety of our supply chain and the seamless movement of parts across it, is something that is very much on the agenda and we\u2019re building up the plan to better integrate the various notes we have within our supply chain, which ultimately will improve our order to delivery time for our customers. As you said, take miles out take cost out and reduce our inventory overall. So that\u2019s the goal and more to come.","Chris Bottiglieri","And then you said you won't be adding buildings. But what you roll out attracting buildings at this point, you got a hub stores, large square foot footprint of DCs. How do you think about that?","Tom Greco","Yes, we are not going to comment specifically on that, but everything is on the table, to be clear. We are going to operate as efficiently as we can.","Chris Bottiglieri","And then one challenging longer term question, want to get your perspective on, Worldpac going to proven that you don\u2019t have to need stores to compete in this business. Can you tell us what is about that business that allows you not to have stores? What is that intact your core AAP stores like what is it about that Worldpac that allows the customer and expect a longer delivering window through centralized warehouse delivery rather than part shopping in local markets? Thank you.","Tom Greco","Let me make a comment on that. First of all, I think what customers want wasn\u2019t anything, if they want consistency and execution of delivery. So when they know there\u2019s deflation in order they know when you are having. So I think critically important at Worldpac we have always remain to be focused on making sure that we have that same execution day in and day out. So customers count on that, number one. Secondly, they all have to do certainly with the product assortment as well. Worldpac has unique product assortment, certainly has dispatches repair shops throughout the entire North America. And so that also is not the part of where lion share of a lot of their business is basically schedule. And so therefore that it's valid to schedule delivery.","However, there is again more and more pressure on reducing the order cycle time and Worldpac is taking the number of steps to reduce the order cycle time as well. So that\u2019s part of the trends in the industry we\u2019re all doing it. So I think as I mentioned earlier where we are transforming the professional experience with these new start up type of pilots that we have, one that we are starting next week is having all of that capability under one roof. And that\u2019s going to transform and differentiate Advanced from the rest of the industry.","Operator","At this time, there are no further questions. I\u2019ll turn the call back to Zaheed Mawani for any final comments.","Zaheed Mawani","Tom, go ahead.","Tom Greco","Thanks operator. We would like to conclude our call by thanking all of our team members and independent our owners across the AAP family for their efforts to better serve our customers in the quarter. In addition, as we approach Memorial Day, we would like to thank all the members of our military for their service. We are making major changes at AAP and we remain focus on the substantial long opportunity we have to drive shareholder value. We look forward to updating you on our progress once again in August.

Before we begin, Prabhakar Vaidyanathan will make a brief statement concerning forward-looking statements that will be made on this call.","Prabhakar Vaidyanathan - Advance Auto Parts, Inc.","Good morning, and thank you for joining us on today's call to discuss our third quarter results. I'm joined this morning by Tom Greco, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Tom Okray, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Bob Cushing, our Executive Vice President of Professional. Following their prepared remarks, we will turn our attention to answering your questions.","Before we begin, be advised that our comments today may include statements that are not historical facts and may be deemed forward-looking statements as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission's Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. While actual results may differ materially from those projected in such statements, due to a number of risks and uncertainties, which are described in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and on our website, we maintain no duty to update forward-looking statements made. Additionally, our comments today include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to our quarterly press release and accompanying financial statements issued today for important information and additional detail, regarding both the forward-looking statements and the reconciliation of non-GAAP measures referenced in today's call. The content of this earnings call will be governed by the information contained in our earnings press release and related financial statements.","Now, let me turn the call over to Tom Greco.","Thomas R. Greco - Advance Auto Parts, Inc.","Thanks, Prabhakar, and good morning, everyone. In the third quarter, our total revenue growth was down 3% and comp sales were negative 3.4%. Our adjusted operating income margin rate was 7.9%, and our adjusted earnings per share was $1.43. Overall, we remain focused on accelerating growth, expanding margins, and driving operating cash flow improvement over the long term. In Q3, we made important changes in the organization, which set us up to achieve these goals. Additionally, we made progress on key initiatives that benefited cost control. Finally, we sustained growth in operating cash flow, primarily driven by our inventory optimization efforts.","Let me provide some context on our sales results. As we've outlined previously, 2017 has been a challenging year for the industry. This year, all major players have experienced a slowdown in sales performance on a one-year and two-year stack basis. We discussed the key drivers of industry softness in detail on our second quarter call, and they've been widely written about. From our vantage point, the second half of 2017 is playing out as expected. While overall, the industry growth continued to be below historical levels in Q3, there were businesses and regions at AAP, which performed very well in Q3. On a positive note, our WORLDPAC business continues to deliver strong growth rates, well above the industry average. WORLDPAC's value proposition of strong brands and integrated supply chain, best in class technology, and parts availability continues to be a winning formula, a formula we intend to leverage going forward.","In addition, our independent Carquest business grew throughout the country. Our Canada Carquest business also performed extremely well, with sales growth in high single digits for Q3. In our U.S.-based Advance and Carquest owned stores, we had a challenging Q3. This was in part due to the temporary impact of necessary transformation actions we implemented to set the company up for long-term success. It's important to note that these actions were taken only in U.S. Advance and Carquest owned stores where performance has significantly lagged the industry over the past several years. These actions included streamlining field operations from 34 to 12 regions, right-sizing the Professional sales team, leveraging analytical pricing tools to manage local price-match override for customers, or PMOR for short, and optimizing inventory.","Following several quarters of consistent progress in narrowing the competitive sales gap versus the industry, we saw an opportunity to accelerate important elements of our five-year plan in our U.S.-based Advance and Carquest-owned stores. We felt this was the best time to proceed knowing the primary drivers of demand for our industry are expected to improve in 2018. As we implemented the leaner structure and staffing changes, many of our field operations and Professional sales leaders moved into new positions or geographies, which can be disruptive. That said, we're pleased that we now have the right structure and leadership team in place, and this critical change is now behind us.","In addition, we accelerated elements of our multi-year productivity plan, including optimizing inventory. During the quarter, inventory declined $138 million as compared to prior year, and $74 million from the second quarter. This is the third consecutive quarter we've reduced inventory on a year-over-year basis. We also began more rigorous management of PMOR. We now look at PMOR performance every week by store, which enables us to address unnecessary discounting. Both of these initiatives remained important for us to drive the long-term performance of the company. That said, in some cases, we believe that our inventory optimization and PMOR initiatives had a temporary impact on sales in the quarter. When we saw it was affecting sales more than we projected, we immediately reacted and refined our plans accordingly.","Given our refinement to remain focused on the customer through more fine-tuned initiatives, it's now unlikely we'll be able to pull back as much inventory in the back half of 2017 as originally planned. Executing our original plan would have hurt our customer value proposition, which we simply will not do. We'll continue to optimize our inventory, but we'll need to do so at a more measured pace. As a result, we expect an estimated non-cash year-over-year impact from inventory optimization of 30 basis points on our full-year adjusted operating income margin. There's no change in the full-year 2017 guidance that was provided in August. We continue to believe in the long-term inventory opportunity, and will adjust the pace of inventory optimization, while putting the customer first.","In spite of our Q3 sales performance in U.S.-based Advance and Carquest stores, our research tells us that our customer value proposition is not only strong, but strengthening in these banners. This is evidenced by the positive comps we saw in our Carquest independents. In addition, in company-owned Advance and Carquest stores in our central, Gulf, and Carolinas regions, our business strengthened. Meanwhile, the west has been leading our regional performance all year, and continued to perform well in Q3.","We experienced temporary softness in Puerto Rico, as well as in our Florida and southwest regions, primarily attributable to the hurricanes. Our weakest performance was in the north central, mid-Atlantic, Great Lakes, and northeast regions. Part of the softness in these northern regions was driven by back-to-back mild winters followed by a mild summer. In Q3, this impacted categories such as air-conditioning, air-conditioning chemicals, and radiators, which were all down double-digits versus prior year. Clearly, there were other factors impacting our performance in these underperforming regions in addition to our transformation actions. In summary, we made important changes in Q3 that position us well for long-term success.","Turning to the bottom-line in Q3, we're pleased that we began to realize savings from material cost optimization, which benefited gross profit, along with the impact of productivity actions, resulting in adjusted SG&A cost reductions. Tom Okray will speak to this further shortly. I'll now provide an update on the key initiatives within our five-year plan. I'll begin with transforming Professional, where our availability transformation, or AT for short, was rolled out to an additional 123 stores in the third quarter, bringing the total to more than 500 stores. AT is a vital first step in improving our assortment methodology. The knowledge gained from AT has been valuable, and is being incorporated into our core processes as we move towards demand-driven assortment. We're now capturing key metrics from Apex (09: 27) to determine real-time availability by store, including on-hand inventory. This is showing us that AT markets have materially better availability than non-AT markets.","Secondly, we successfully piloted cross-banner visibility in the third quarter for both store employees and Professional customers, and have initiated a nationwide roll-out. This enables our customers and employees to see a broader range of inventory across AAP and place their order from one system platform. To be clear, this is an important and long overdue step. Once cross-banner visibility is deployed, all Advance store employees will be able to see and order parts from Advance, WORLDPAC, and Carquest on one Apex screen. Today, they have to close out the Apex catalog, open up a different catalog, re-enter the part, and search for it again in a different system. They likely need to toggle between systems to complete an order. This is a cumbersome and time-consuming process. As we roll out cross-banner visibility, they'll be able to see all the inventory and portfolio brands available in market, regardless of the banner or store that has the inventory. This will enable us to serve our customers faster and more efficiently.","Of course, this is something that anyone would expect from a single, unified company, and it's taken much longer than we would have liked. The good news is, cross-banner visibility will finally be in place in Q4. This will make a big difference for our employees by making the critically important task of finding parts much easier and faster. This is the same for our Professional customers using our new B2B platform, Advance Pro (11: 22) directly or through the shop software system. In Q3, Advance Pro was deployed to 8,000 Professional customers, up from 1,000 at the end of the second quarter. And once again, cross-banner visibility is an added feature embedded in Advance Pro.","We also implemented cross-banner visibility in all U.S. Carquest stores for both company-owned as well as independent Carquest stores. This gives them the ability to view and order products from the Carquest network, in-market Advance stores, Advance DCs, and WORLDPAC; once again, all in one place. These stores are performing well and exceeding initial projections. Our independent partners were instrumental in enabling us to move faster on this and continue to provide an important perspective as we construct our plans. Our employees and independent partners are providing us with very positive feedback on cross-banner visibility. They're seeing higher conversion rates and increased average spend per transaction and lower returns. Cross-banner enables us to do a much better job leveraging our asset base to make more parts available to more customers faster and easier than we do today.","In summary, we're making excellent progress in enabling our people and customers to find parts more easily when the parts they need are not available in their particular store. To build on this and improve order-to-delivery speed and efficiency, we continue the installation of telematics in our vehicles. We'll be leveraging telematics data with a fleet and transportation management system. This technology solution is critical for real-time fleet management and enables us to accurately measure and manage order-to-delivery times. Additionally, this new capability will provide critical insight into efficiency and safety metrics. We'll begin leveraging these new capabilities in Q1 2018.","Shifting to DIY omni-channel, we're building new capabilities to integrate physical and digital assets to ensure a seamless omni-channel experience across all customer touchpoints. Following the successful launch of our enhanced website, we're now seeing significant improvements in traffic and conversion rates. We want our customers to get the best of online, while also enjoying the convenience and satisfaction of our knowledge and store base for pick-up, exchange or delivery.","In the stores, we're improving the customer experience, which is driving performance on key metrics like units per transaction and social media sentiment. In terms of productivity, we began to implement and execute our multi-year agenda. Our material cost optimization, or MCO for short, our supplier partners are invaluable to AAP, and a critical contributor to our long-term success. We've engaged material cost discussions at a higher level than we have in the past, and the conversations are as much about long-term growth and partnership as they are about MCO. We're finding ways to work collaboratively with our suppliers to result in positive outcomes for both sides. We've now conducted comprehensive category reviews on approximately 56% of our core-product categories in 2017, with plans to complete the balance in 2018.","In terms of supply chain, we made progress on several initiatives, including standardization across distribution centers, refinement of our material flow process, and improved utilization of our transportation vehicles. Our supply chain productivity agenda is partially offsetting previous investments in supply chain which were made in a siloed fashion and have been a headwind on costs in 2017. Our early work on end-to-end supply chain is expected to optimize this asset base over time.","On zero based budgeting, or ZBB for short, we started to realize benefits in Q3 and are gaining much-needed momentum in managing costs. Examples of ZBB contributors to Q3 savings include G&A associated with our restructuring efforts, efficiencies realized in managing professional fees, and process improvements which are yielding savings in rent. Further areas of focus include vendor consolidation in Goods Not For Resale categories, including facility maintenance and temporary staffing. Rounding out our transformation agenda, we are tracking and developing talent across every function at AAP. In the past few months, we stood up a digital marketing team, a fully integrated professional marketing team, as well as a data and analytics center of excellence. We continue to have considerable success attracting high caliber talent to the new AAP where we need it.","In summary, we took deliberate actions in Q3, and continue to build a strong foundation to delight the customer. With three quarters of a five-year transformation plan behind us, we continue to move forward on key initiatives that are core to AAP's long-term success. This includes, first, transforming Professional through our availability transformation, cross-banner visibility, and the implementation of order-to-delivery measurement and performance management. Second, reinventing DIY omni-channel with a heightened focus on improving the customer experience both online with our new website, and in our stores, as we leverage improved tools and training. Third, streamlining our supply chain from end-to-end as we advance our plans to optimize the asset base across all of AAP. And fourth, implementing our productivity plans through MCO, supply chain, and ZBB. With the major field operations and Professional sales team restructure now behind us, the high-caliber team we've built at AAP is now laser-focused on driving execution without the distractions we experienced in Q3. We're confident in our ability to drive significant shareholder value going forward.","With that, I'll pass it to Tom Okray.","Thomas Okray - Advance Auto Parts, Inc.","Thanks, Tom and good morning, everyone.","In the third quarter, net revenue of $2.18 billion was down 3% as compared to the prior-year third quarter. On a comparable store basis, this represents a negative 3.4% comp. Gross profit for the quarter was $948 million and, on a rate basis, our gross profit margin of 43.4% was 51 basis points lower than the prior-year quarter of 43.9%. The primary drivers of our margin contraction in the quarter were increased supply chain costs and shrink, which reduced our margin by 44 basis points. In addition, the non-cash impact of our inventory optimization efforts in the quarter negatively impacted our gross margin by 23 basis points. Improved material costs in the quarter helped offset these increased costs by 17 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2016.","Adjusted SG&A was $776 million in the third quarter, an increase of $5 million as compared to prior year. This was $22 million lower versus Q2 2017 adjusted SG&A of $798 million. As a percentage of net sales, our third quarter adjusted SG&A increased 127 basis points from 34.3% to 35.5%. Labor, medical costs and insurance claims resulted in a 131-basis-point increase in the quarter. In addition, increased marketing expenses accounted for 26 basis points. These were partially offset by 25 basis points in third-party fee reductions and other improvements in utility, maintenance and repair costs.","Turning to adjusted operating income, we delivered adjusted operating income of $172 million in the third quarter and adjusted operating margins of 7.9%, a 178-basis-point reduction as compared to the prior year. Our third quarter adjusted operating income margins were impacted by the gross profit and adjusted SG&A levers we described above. Going forward, we expect that our adjusted operating income margin, when compared to the prior year, will have similar results in the fourth quarter as were posted this quarter. That said, there is no change in the overall full-year 2017 guidance that was provided in August.","Turning to cash flow, our free cash flow was $240 million, a 7.7% increase as compared to prior year. This increase was the result of reduced operating income offset by the change in inventory, in addition to lower capital expenditures. I am encouraged that our focus on cash flow is bearing fruit. We have modified our finance organization, meeting forums, and compensation programs to focus on cash. These modifications have enabled us to make progress in inventory optimization, working capital, and capital expenditures.","Transforming our organization to become an industry leader for the long term requires innovation. In many cases, the innovation will be iterative. Importantly, we need to fail fast, learn from our mistakes, and move forward. It is important to note, at Advance, we're building a culture that embraces this philosophy. We will continue to aggressively pursue innovative initiatives that increase our performance, while ensuring that we delight the customer.","With that, let's open it to addressing your questions. Brian?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. And our first question will come from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi, guys. Scot Ciccarelli. First, just a clarification. Tom, did you say that you expect fourth quarter operating margin to be down in the fourth quarter at a similar rate to the 178-basis-point decline we just saw in 3Q?","Thomas Okray - Advance Auto Parts, Inc.","That's correct, Scot.","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Got it. And can you help us understand what the \u2013 if you can quantify at all, how much disruption you guys think you caused yourselves by the labor changes implemented to the organization?","Thomas R. Greco - Advance Auto Parts, Inc.","Well, first of all, good morning, Scot. We made some pretty bold moves in Q3, as you know, to really set us up for the future. And we're really excited about the changes that we made. I mean we had 34 regions, and it was just difficult to run the business with 34 regions and a very disparate approach on how we ran it. We know that when you make these kinds of changes, and I've done them many times in my career, you're going to have temporary distraction from the business because there's a lot going on. People are moving into new roles, they're learning new direct reports, they're learning new geographies, they're learning new customers. So, there's a lot of change that happens there.","That said, we really feel good about the end result. I was on a call with the regions yesterday, and I think all of them would say that we're performing better than we were pre-the change, because we're able to really get focused on specific issues in specific geographies. For example, Florida. We're running Florida as a separate region now. We used to have four people running Florida. So, we're operating much more effectively and efficiently than we were. And we're really more focused on the customer, which has been the goal of the whole change that we made. So, we knew this was an important change for our transformation effort. We'd originally planned to do it in 2018 and we're really excited that it's behind us and we're able to perform better as a result.","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets LLC","And is there a way to quantify what you thought the disruption was, Tom?","Thomas R. Greco - Advance Auto Parts, Inc.","It's difficult to say, obviously, but if you look at the two-year stack, we were essentially above 30 basis points below where we were in Q2. So, I mean, there were a lot of other factors into the equation, but I would say that's probably in the range.","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Got it. Okay. Thanks, guys.","Thomas Okray - Advance Auto Parts, Inc.","Thanks, Scot.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Matt Fassler with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thanks a lot. Good morning. I have a brief follow-up on Scot's question and then another very quick one. You talked about having modulated the pace of some of the change during the quarter, so the question associated with that is the degree to which you saw the sales perhaps erode and then presumably improve as you pulled back from the pace of disruption.","Thomas R. Greco - Advance Auto Parts, Inc.","Yeah, I think the big things we talked about, Matt, in terms of the change were obviously the restructure itself, not just in terms of the field, but the Professional sales organization that Bob Cushing leads. And then we also optimized our inventory and initiated a little bit more aggressive actions in our productivity agenda. I think all of those things combined, we had some learnings out of them. The restructure is kind of a one and done, right? I mean, you make the change; people get adjusted to their new geographies. The sales people get adjusted to their new customers. And we feel pretty good about the fact that we made the change, it's now behind us.","And then on the productivity agenda, we're going to continue to work productivity agenda hard because we believe we've got a substantial margin expansion opportunity out in front of us and we're going to continue to push the envelope on productivity. We had some good learnings as it pertains to optimizing inventory and managing excessive discounting and PMOR that we're continuing to thread through the P&L. And you saw some of the benefits of that in the third quarter, which we're going to continue to see going forward. I guess the key point we want to make is, as we roll out the productivity agenda, we're going to put the customer front and center, and we're not going to do anything where we feel we're impacting the customer. And where we saw that happen, we quickly reacted, literally within weeks. And all of that has, obviously, been adjusted and is behind us.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","And then just quickly following up, you reduced the annual impact of the non-cash inventory hit to gross margin by about 40 basis points. You left the annual operating margin guide unchanged. So, does that get offset somewhere else? And also, does that inventory reduction hit show up sometime in 2018, or are we likely not to sustain it?","Thomas Okray - Advance Auto Parts, Inc.","Yeah, no, as Tom said, Matt, we still believe that we need to optimize our inventory. But the actions that we put in place in Q3, just to come back to his comments, we learned a lot. We learned about stratification of the SKUs. We learned about how our supply chain could process returns. So, we have pulled back a little bit on that, but we will continue to aggressively optimize the inventory going forward. We stand by an AP ratio of being in the high 90%.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you so much, guys.","Thomas R. Greco - Advance Auto Parts, Inc.","Thanks, Matt.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Mike Baker with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.","Michael Baker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks. Just simply wanted to ask about the pace of same-store sales through the quarter, sort of what Matt was getting at. But I will just specifically ask if you can talk about comps through the quarter, and then what is the fourth quarter expectation? We know you have the full-year guidance, but that gives you a huge range for the fourth quarter. So, you must be able to narrow that a little bit, as you did for the full year operating margin outlook and what that implies to the fourth quarter. Thanks.","Thomas R. Greco - Advance Auto Parts, Inc.","Well, Mike, there's a lot going on, as you guys already know, in the third quarter. Clearly, we had our own internal actions, which we just talked about. Independent of that, you had an historic hurricane season. We talked about that in our prepared remarks. We also had our northern geographies where we've had the back to back mild winters, a mild summer, over half of our store base is up in those northern geographies. We can see much more movement in those geographies when we have extreme weather. I think we disproportionately benefit in these northern geographies when we have extreme weather and we disproportionately get impacted when it goes the other way. And I think in the third quarter, we had a little bit of that on the downside.","We also expect that in period 13, where it was unseasonably cold last December, we've had a very difficult lap. That said, the set-up for 2018 looks terrific. We've done all the work on the key variables that drive long-term demand in the industry. The car park, the vehicle miles driven, vehicles inside the sweet spot, GDP, all of those things look very positive for us in 2018. The pace of the comps in the third quarter, we're not going to comment on them specifically, but we feel good that the key changes that we made are behind us. And obviously, the important thing for us is we're executing better than we were prior to the change.","Michael Baker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And so, does that better execution presumably show up in better same-store sales? Is that a fair assumption? You had answered a previous question by talking about looking at the two-year comp rate. Is that a fair way to look at the fourth quarter outlook?","Thomas R. Greco - Advance Auto Parts, Inc.","I think it is. I think it is. I think it's important to look at the two-year, and it's also important to look at Q4 and Q1 combined. Because that's what, what we really saw last year. And the set-up for that timeframe looks favorable for us on a two-year basis.","Michael Baker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","If I could ask one more, sorry to hog the mic, but if you're saying the two-year stack should stay the same in the fourth quarter, that would imply it down 7% in the fourth quarter. I just want to be clear if that's what you're trying to say or not. My guess is it's not. But I'd like to hear that from you.","Thomas R. Greco - Advance Auto Parts, Inc.","The two-year stack will improve in the fourth quarter.","Michael Baker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Understood. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Chris Horvers with JPMorgan. Please proceed.","Christopher Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks. Good morning. So, on the operating income performance in the third quarter, as well as in the fourth quarter, was there something that you're pushing out, it seems like, some of the beat in the third quarter, you're sort of tucking into the fourth quarter in that regard. So, was there something in terms of a timing that hit in the third quarter that maybe came early relative to your expectations or an expense that's coming into the fourth quarter that you had not anticipated previously? And is any of this just trying to be conservative given the volatility in the numbers?","Thomas R. Greco - Advance Auto Parts, Inc.","No. I mean, there's nothing about being conservative in the numbers. The Q3 went largely as we thought it was going to go. And, as we said in the prepared remarks, we're reiterating our full year guidance.","Christopher Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Understood. And then, following up on the \u2013 two follow ups. So, first, on the inventory reduction, I think you had previously spoken about taking maybe perhaps a $1 billion of inventory out of the system over time, over $800,000 of inventory per store, much higher than peers. Based on what you've learned, is that still a long-term target? Are you thinking that, given that you have the four different platforms, essentially, that you will end up something south of that.","Thomas Okray - Advance Auto Parts, Inc.","We still stand by the AP ratio up into the high 90%. And if you do the math, that's going to get you to roughly a $1 billion. You're right. We have a headwind now that we've got the four different supply chains. But if you recall, we've got an end-to-end supply chain initiative that's going to rectify that. So, again, AP ratio in the high 90s, we need to optimize inventory. Part of that is getting to one supply chain.","Christopher Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Understood. And one quick follow-up as well. You're approaching three times leverage, it looks like, from our perspective at the end of this year. That's actually an adjusted number, it's not on GAAP number. So, what's the conversations like with the rating agencies, this has been a question that's been going around the market. So, curious what the conversation is there on a potential risk and a downgrade?","Thomas Okray - Advance Auto Parts, Inc.","Yeah, I mean, I can't speak for the rating agencies, but our focus on cash inventory optimization, free cash flow, working capital, I believe that's going to be attractive to both equity and debt investors.","Christopher Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Alan Rifkin with Boyd Thomas (sic) [BTIG] Please proceed.","Alan Rifkin - BTIG LLC","Thank you. It's Alan with BTIG. Tom, you had said that you will continue to optimize your inventory at a more measured pace. And I believe in the past, that was a significant contributing factor in your EBIT margin degradation of 200 basis points to 300 basis points for the year. So, why then have you not \u2013 if you're taking at a more measured pace going forward, why are you actually not raising the EBIT margin degradation number or lowering it, I should say? Why is it not a narrower EBIT margin loss?","Thomas Okray - Advance Auto Parts, Inc.","Well, Alan, as we learned in Q3, there's a lot of volatility, a lot of moving parts that happen in this inventory optimization space. To reiterate again, we learned a number of different things throughout the process. So long story short, we didn't want to put an adjusted operating income margin related to the inventory out there. We're just standing by the full year that we have guidance.","Alan Rifkin - BTIG LLC","Okay. And as a follow up to that, since it will be a more measured pace, can we conclude that you won't get to where you want to be on the inventory level, the $1 billion reduction until even later in 2018?","Thomas Okray - Advance Auto Parts, Inc.","Yeah, wouldn't conclude that. We're not talking about that right now. More to discuss that in February.","Alan Rifkin - BTIG LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Thomas R. Greco - Advance Auto Parts, Inc.","Thanks, Alan.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Please proceed.","Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC","Hi. Good morning, guys.","Thomas R. Greco - Advance Auto Parts, Inc.","Good morning","Thomas Okray - Advance Auto Parts, Inc.","Good morning.","Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC","On that line of questioning, I guess, inventory reduction, but then you're talking about you are expanding your payables program to the 90s. Are we talking about gross inventory reduction or are you talking about funded inventory reduction?","Thomas Okray - Advance Auto Parts, Inc.","Both.","Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC","Okay. So, when we're talking about a $1 billion, are we talking about taking $4.2 billion to $3.2 billion or are we talking about some mix of the two?","Thomas Okray - Advance Auto Parts, Inc.","$4.2 billion to $3.2 billion.","Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC","Okay. And then I guess as we're looking at the supply chain, obviously you've got the cross-banner initiative going. At what point can you ship across distribution centers, so you can basically start consolidating the number of DCs in the field?","Thomas R. Greco - Advance Auto Parts, Inc.","Yeah, we're actually really excited about the intense supply chain work that we've been doing, Bret. It's revealing a lot of opportunities in our overall supply chain in terms of how we move products around. We really think that an integrated and holistic look at supply chain is the way to go. And we just haven't been doing that. We looked at supply chain essentially in four different places, as you know, and even inside the functions, we were quite siloed in how we viewed supply chain. The store operations team managed the fleet that shipped to the stores, the supply chain managed the DCs to the stores, all of those types of things.","So, now it's fully integrated under one single point-of-contact. We do have plans to pilot some of the moves that you're describing in 2018. We'll talk more about that in February next year. But the cost take-outs associated with that are substantial. And we just have to make sure that we've got the technology platforms right, that everything's working properly, that we have a broad-based, company-wide assortment strategy in place. So, we're working through all those details, but needless to say, when you've got 50 million square feet of assets, around 50 distribution centers, we've got optimization opportunities up and down the supply chain.","Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Please proceed.","Michael Louis Lasser - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. Do you still expect that SG&A dollars are going to be down $25 million or so from the second quarter to the fourth quarter? And if you do, why would your gross margins be so much worse in the fourth quarter, down, call it 120 basis points to 140 basis points compared to the improvement that we've seen progressively over each quarter of this year?","Thomas Okray - Advance Auto Parts, Inc.","Yeah, Michael, I mean, first of all, we're happy with the traction that we got in SG&A in the prepared remarks. We said $22 million less than Q2 for SG&A in this quarter. We believe that we're on track to get into the $25 million range for Q4. Some of that might have been pulled ahead into Q3, but we think we're going to be in the neighborhood of $25 million in Q4.","Michael Louis Lasser - UBS Securities LLC","And if that's the case, then why was the gross margin down so much to get you to an operating income decline of 175 basis points to 180 basis points in the fourth quarter?","Thomas Okray - Advance Auto Parts, Inc.","I'm not following the point here. I was talking SG&A and you're switching to gross margin?","Michael Louis Lasser - UBS Securities LLC","Yeah. Yeah, so, if your SG&A dollars are down by about $25 million year-over-year, it would imply about 45 basis points of SG&A deleverage on a minus 4% to minus 5% comp in the fourth quarter. And that would mean your gross will be down in the neighborhood of 120 to 140 basis points to get to overall operating margin decline that's equal to where it was in the third quarter. And it seems like it's a big step-function change from the trajectory of your gross margin and where it sits.","Thomas Okray - Advance Auto Parts, Inc.","Yeah, remember, we're talking about for the Q4, we're talking versus Q2 $25 million, not year-over-year.","Michael Louis Lasser - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. I'll follow-up with you on that offline. My other question is just on the overall outlook for the next few years. Tom Greco, it seems like some of the actions you're taking are having unintended consequences of disrupting your sales. So are you seeing anything in the business that's making it less likely that you'll be able to achieve some of your long-term objectives based on the disruption that you're seeing as you implement your strategy in your productivity (41: 10)?","Thomas R. Greco - Advance Auto Parts, Inc.","Good morning, Michael. I think I caught your question. You're breaking up a little bit. But, first of all, the big impact in Q3 was really the restructuring. And we got the question earlier. I mean, we really feel good about the moves that we made. And, as we get behind these moves, we did exit with momentum in the quarter. We like the start out of Q4. So I don't believe that the changes that we made are disrupting the long-term performance of the company; in fact, quite the opposite.","Again, I had the 12 regions on our weekly call yesterday. We literally went around the horn on where we are in putting those changes behind us and dialing our execution and every one of those key field measures that we look at every week in terms of our execution performance, and it's getting better. So our ability to drive the agenda is actually better now than it was four or five months ago. So I'm actually more confident in our long-term prognosis and ability to get above the industry average growth rates. That's the goal. We're putting the customer first, and our goal is to be above the industry growth rate, and we're not going to be satisfied until we get there. And I think the changes we made in the third quarter actually underline and strengthen our ability to accomplish that goal.","Michael Louis Lasser - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Matt McClintock with Barclays. Please proceed.","Matthew McClintock - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi, yes. Good morning, everyone. Tom, you talked a lot about the new and improved Apex and providing that access or view to inventory across all the banners. Just how do you think about the benefit of that building? Is that something that can create a step-function change in your business as you roll that out? Or is that something that really \u2013 is something that builds over 2018 into 2019 and beyond? What have you seen in the stores where this access has been provided? Thanks.","Thomas R. Greco - Advance Auto Parts, Inc.","Well, I'll flip this question over to Bob. I mean, Bob has been intimately involved, Matt. He's built a very strong platform at WORLDPAC that has enabled us to have an advantaged business model with our professional customers. I'll let him respond.","Bob Cushing - Advance Auto Parts, Inc.","Yeah. So, thanks. So throughout 2017, we've been building the foundation for growth. What matters most to the customers, first to market, to enable first-call status. So importantly we needed to start with the catalog. So we have the enterprise catalog Apex so that we could end up eventually getting to where we are today where we've just tested out the cross-banner visibility and rolling it out across to all the stores. So importantly, for all of us, we needed to make sure that we could end up showing and displaying to our customers the portfolio of brands across the enterprise, which we've done.","So Apex is kind of the engine behind it. So when you look at Advance Pro, which is the new B2B platform that we introduced with 8,000 customers and growing and accelerating that out, the Apex catalog is basically behind that, meaning it's powering it. So importantly that was another opportunity that's out there. Advance Pro has a lot of features and benefits out there for the customer, most importantly on the cross-banner side. In market, it's showing availability of all the portfolios between Advance, Carquest, and WORLDPAC. So now as one location, one portal they see all of that. So Apex is driving that. So that's a critically important part of all of this.","Because, again, as with anything else, what we're seeing in all of this is, number one, on Advance Pro with the customer we're seeing a larger order size. We've seen improvement in that. Secondly, we've seen a higher conversion rate. Thirdly, we basically have seen return rate go down, which means that accurate catalog, they're getting the right part at the right time accurately. So, we're driving that. Tom mentioned earlier, as far as on the order cycle time, working on all of that. So Advance Pro, basically, again, powered by the Apex catalog, cross-banner visibility, all of these are the technology footprint we're building out having first-call status with our customer. And again, it started with Apex and now it's working through. This has been our plan all along. We're basically setting it all up in 2017 to come out strong in 2018.","Matthew McClintock - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Seth Sigman with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.","Seth I. Sigman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to follow up on the SG&A question from earlier. So if you go back to your productivity targets for 2017, I think you had originally talked about more coming from gross margin this year. It seems like based on trends year-to-date, more is actually coming from SG&A. So I'm just wondering, is that right. If so, are you seeing just more near-term opportunity on the SG&A side versus gross margin?","Thomas Okray - Advance Auto Parts, Inc.","Yeah, that's a great question, Seth. Let me comment on the gross margin. While we saw some traction this quarter, we're not satisfied where we are from a gross margin perspective. Let me give you one example or couple of examples. On our material cost optimization, we've got two components of that. We've got material cost reduction and we've got trade or vendor income. The trade and vendor income is masking the great work that we're doing with our vendor partners to lower our acquisition costs for material.","The only way to capture that trade vendor income is when we start to grow and get our sales going in a positive comp basis. So right now that good work is being masked or delayed until we start to grow. Another headwind that we've got is from a supply chain perspective. We have opened a couple of DCs, and there is the legacy cost associated with opening those DCs, which is hitting the gross margin. So while we started to get some traction, we expect that to accelerate significantly in the future.","Seth I. Sigman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Is there a way to quantify how big that trade and vendor income issue was this quarter and what it's been year-to-date?","Thomas Okray - Advance Auto Parts, Inc.","We're not going to break that out, Seth.","Seth I. Sigman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","So when you look at gross margin in this quarter, it was down 50 basis points. Last quarter, it was down 90 basis points year-over-year. So the trend is improving sequentially. So what are the drags that are actually improving from quarter to quarter? Were the issues just less impactful or did you just have more offsets within the gross margin now?","Thomas Okray - Advance Auto Parts, Inc.","The MCO or the material cost optimization definitely improving. So we stand by what we said that we would see the productivity in the back half. But the gross margin was masked by three big things. One is the new DC costs associated with that. The other one is the trade or vendor income. And then there's the 23 bps for the inventory related.","Seth I. Sigman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Thomas Okray - Advance Auto Parts, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities. Please proceed.","Seth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Thanks a lot and good morning. My first question is going back to the outlook for the fourth quarter in terms of operating margins. Last quarter in the call you said that fourth quarter operating margin should be higher year-over-year excluding the inventory reductions. I just wanted to make sure that guidance is no longer accurate.","Thomas Okray - Advance Auto Parts, Inc.","Yeah, that's correct.","Seth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Got it. And the biggest changes from your perspective are related to what's happened in the gross margin line?","Thomas Okray - Advance Auto Parts, Inc.","Yeah, that's correct. As well \u2013 yeah, factoring in the softness in the industry for sure. Thank you.","Seth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Fair enough. And my follow-up question is related to Availability Transformation initiatives that you're testing in 500-plus stores. Can you give us any perspective on what kind of lift you're seeing in sales or profitability from those stores since those tests were implemented?","Thomas R. Greco - Advance Auto Parts, Inc.","Yeah, good morning, Seth. We're really pleased with the learnings we're getting out of Availability Transformation. We're seeing mid-single digit growth versus control in those stores, and we're gradually rolling them out. I think we announced that we achieved 500 stores in Q3 and we're continuing to roll those out in the fourth quarter. We're getting good visibility. Again, I'm going to go back to Bob and WORLDPAC because historically they've been able to assort parts quite differently than we do here at Advance. And one of the benefits of Availability Transformation is we're now getting visibility into the physical lookups that are coming into our store, whether they're coming in by phone or a customer ordering off of Advance Pro or one of our B2B platforms. That gives us much better visibility into the demand that exists in that store. And that's a much superior way for us to be assorting parts and making sure that we're able to say yes more often. And that's the goal for Availability Transformation.","We're pleased with the performance in the test versus control. We're continuing to monitor it closely. And when we see a region that's not ready to get it done or has some key indicators that we don't like, we essentially don't roll it out there. But when we do have all the positive indicators in place, the leadership team is ready to go, they're executing at a level that we believe is necessary to achieve the goals for the Availability Transformation overall, we continue to roll it out. So it's been a very positive initiative for us, and we're continuing to focus on it.","Seth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","Simeon Ari Gutman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning. It's Simeon. Thanks for taking my question. I don't know if this was asked, but sort of big picture, I think the big question we're trying to figure out is how the restructuring or how sustainably beneficial this restructuring is going to be. You lowered your cost structure a lot. It seems like it came at the expense of sales. So how on that lower cost structure are you able to then reaccelerate the top line, which looks presumably like lower \u2013 fewer resources?","Thomas R. Greco - Advance Auto Parts, Inc.","Yeah. I think, Simeon, we think \u2013 we don't think, we're absolutely convinced that this was a temporary impact, okay. Again, a large restructuring of this size where we did take out a lot of cost. We went from 34 to 12 regions. We reduced the number of customer account managers that are out there in the marketplace, but we enabled everyone with new tools and technology. Bob has rolled out iPad devices to all the customer account managers. We're giving them the tools they need. So if you go to one of our customer account managers and speak to them today, they're far more enabled to get their job done. Find a 25-year-old or 30-year-old young leader in our organization and ask them if they would rather be walking to a customer with a stack of papers and having the responsibilities they had before, or walking in with an iPad device and having all the tools and technology that we have to enable them today, and they would absolutely say they're far better off today than they were before. So we didn't just make the changes without enabling them. We did both. So we're very confident that the changes we made were the right changes for the future. They obviously impacted us when we made the changes but, as I mentioned earlier, every week that's gone by, we're executing better and we're seeing that in our performance.","Simeon Ari Gutman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","And you mentioned, Tom, that in the future you expect the business to outgrow the industry. I guess with some of the traction that you're getting in some of the recent changes, I guess what is the reasonable timeframe for which to expect that to occur?","Thomas R. Greco - Advance Auto Parts, Inc.","Yeah, I mean, obviously we're going to \u2013 we're finalizing our 2018 plans right now, Simeon. We have narrowed the competitive gap two years in a row now versus our peer set if you look at where we were in 2015, where we were in 2016, and where we are year-to-date in 2017. So we're continuing to narrow the performance gap versus our primary competitors in the industry, and we expect that will continue into 2018. And I don't have a specific time for you, but that's the goal.","Simeon Ari Gutman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks. Good luck.","Thomas R. Greco - Advance Auto Parts, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. Please proceed.","Brian Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So it might be a bit of a follow-up to Simeon's question just from a bigger picture perspective. With all that we've done now in the last three quarters and what you've detailed in your comments today, how much of the heavy lifting is now done as far as just the correcting the infrastructure? And the second part of that is what's the next thing as we're looking to the fourth quarter, more likely early 2018, what's the next big initiative that needs to take place?","Thomas R. Greco - Advance Auto Parts, Inc.","Well, first of all, we've done a lot of the very difficult stuff, I would say. The people changes are always hard, and we had to make those changes. That was an important part of the transformation journey. You can't go from where we were to top quartile performance without a leadership team that is a global leadership team and one that can compete at the highest level. We've done that. I feel like we have a leadership team that is capable of competing at the highest level. We did not have that a year ago. There's no way we could have done what we're about to do with the leadership team that we had. So that is probably the most difficult part; it's finding the capable talent that you need, not just outside of Advance but also inside of Advance. Finding the great leaders inside of Advance that we've lifted up and developed and put into big jobs. So that part of it's done. The heavy lifting on the planning, the strategic planning is done. The field restructure is done, which is an important initiative for us because that gets the 12 best field leaders we have out into the marketplace driving execution as compared to 34 individuals that were not as capable as the current 12. That's done.","So really we're moving into a stage here where we're executing against the key initiatives that we've outlined in our strategic plan, which is about being clear on expectations, measuring the performance rigorously, sharing best practices, and driving the agenda. So do we still have some heavy lifting to do? Yes, we do. We referenced earlier the fact that we've still got work to do on the supply chain front. And we've got a pretty robust plan to go after that one. So it's difficult to say where we are, but from here we like the setup for 2018, and we think the moves that we've made today have really positioned us well for the future.","Brian Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Got it. That's really helpful. And then my second \u2013 my follow-up and I'll make it quick. You talked about, as others in the industry have as well, just from a sector perspective, the setup into 2018 looks better with a number of the factors you've outlined. Recognizing that a lot of what's going on at Advance right now is internally driven, but as you look at the sector backdrop, have you started to see some type of solidifying or maybe even strengthening in demand trends along the lines of what we should expect in 2018, or is that still on the come you think (57: 03)?","Thomas R. Greco - Advance Auto Parts, Inc.","Yeah, no, I think the \u2013 Brian, we do. We do see some improvement. I mean one of the things that we've had to do unfortunately as everybody faced similar industry-related challenges in 2017 is go back in time and look at what's happened over time in our industry, which is a great industry over the last 15 years or so. And you have had years like this that are followed by some very positive years coming in behind it. We looked at the key variables that drive demand. The absolute car parc (57: 37), which, as you know, is approaching 280 million vehicles. That's continuing to grow. The vehicles miles driven is expected to grow again next year. The vehicles in the sweet spot that's been a challenge and that's a difficult one to talk about because it is also contingent on how long it takes parts to fail, which has been changing over the years as qualities improve. But that factor is actually improving as we head into 2018 as well. So the macroeconomic factors that drive our performance and the industry's performance overall look better for 2018 than they did in 2017. And then you've got the famous weather variable, which has been difficult over the last couple of years. But we know that one's going to come back, and we've seen that happen repeatedly in the last 15 years. So I believe the industry is going to have a stronger year next year and the setup looks good.","Brian Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Thanks a lot. Appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Ben Bienvenu with Stephens, Inc. Please proceed.","Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.","Hi. Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to ask just about how the organization is responding to the changes you're making. In particular, I'd love to hear about the response from the fields that you're seeing and if you're continuing to see the improvement in turnover that you've highlighted in the past despite the disruption associated with the regional reorganization.","Thomas R. Greco - Advance Auto Parts, Inc.","Well, I'll take that in two parts. I'm going to ask Bob to speak about the professional sales organization in a minute and I'll talk about the field leadership team and the districts and what we've seen there. Again, big change to a big thing, no question about it. This was distracting. You've got the before, the during, and the after. And you've got the planning before where people are speculating and wondering what's going to happen. You've got the during where you're literally impacting people who've been with the company for a long time, and then you've got the after where people are meeting new people and meeting new customers and all of those things. So, for that group, it was very challenging.","I think the field reaction to it today, and I get out in the field a lot. I'm leaving for a trip to Florida here tomorrow. I try to listen to the field leadership team. We have a call every week with the region vice presidents where we get feedback. We have ways of hearing from our districts and reporting back up. The field \u2013 obviously during the change, we went through a trough. There's no question about it. It's a difficult time when you're impacting people. That said, I think, today they would say we're much better positioned than we were. Much better. So, overall, the feedback we're getting is very positive on the changes that we made. And again, the important thing is we're enabling them. We're not just making the change, you know, reducing people. We're actually changing the work. And when you change the work and you enable people with new tools and technology, and you make the job better, that's a positive. So, Bob, do you want to talk to Professional a little bit?","Bob Cushing - Advance Auto Parts, Inc.","Yes, sure. So, you said it, I mean, certainly the technology that we built there, with the iPads, and certainly what we've done on the CRM side of it, we're giving them those tools. We've released a digital sales aid. So we digitized basically all the information that they need when they're making calls. I think, importantly, the customer engagement strategy is working quite well. We also have a defined accountability relating to the customer engagement side with both the CAM, of course the commercial sales manager, and of course on the district manager and GM side. So, that's all there. We have measurements. We have key performance indicators. It's all there today. The team is extremely excited, especially about now that they have all of these other tools with Advance Pro, the Apex catalog. Especially now the cross-banner visibility. This is huge. Everybody's excited about it, both in store and in the field. So, overall, when I look at this and they're working shoulder to shoulder with the operations team on execution, this particular to me, this is the best possible configuration structure we can have out there to be most effective for taking care of our customers and being able to say yes to them more often. So, we're excited about it, the team is. And we're looking forward to a terrific 2018.","Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.","Understood. Thank you. And then, can you discuss the investment in labor that you're making? And what evidence are you seeing that this investment, in particular, is yielding improved results or would you say that the benefits are still somewhat theoretical at this point?","Thomas R. Greco - Advance Auto Parts, Inc.","Well, first of all, our \u2013 I guess I would say the science around how we invest in labor has evolved materially since we got here. And Mike Broderick, who is leading that effort, joined us with 25 years of experience in the industry, has really led a very different approach to how we're managing labor in the stores. We're making sure we have people in the stores when our customers are there. I know that sounds like an obvious thing, but we weren't necessarily doing that. So that we're supporting them on the weekends. We're enabling our people with the tools they need and the incentives they need to really go after it.","And I'll give you an example. We introduced, obviously, the Ship to Home, we've been doing Ship to Home off of our website for a while. But we weren't compensating our general managers and our store personnel for Ship to Home orders and that was something that we changed in the third quarter to make sure that when somebody walks in for buy online pick up in store, we're actually selling the customer on going to our website and ordering parts off of our website. And if they want it shipped to their home, that's great. And then the people in the store will go after it. So, our investments in labor are much more focused on the high performing stores, and the ones that are actually earning the rights to have more labor in the stores. And we obviously measure the lift against it. And if they don't perform against that lift, we pull back on that labor. So, we're getting much more granular store by store, full-time\/part time mix, weekend service, all of those things are variables that Mike and our two division presidents look at every single week with every single region. And I'm very confident that we're going to continue to get better at how we measure and perform with respect to our investments in labor.","Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.","Great. Thanks for that color.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Chris Bottiglieri with Wolfe Research. Please proceed.","Chris Bottiglieri - Wolfe Research LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Follow -- actually follow-up on the omni-channel initiative, so from our vantage point, I think, you're probably a little more forward looking company in the industry right now. We're witnessing here I think greater buy online, pick up in store discounts. You just talked about you are incentivizing your local managers to encourage customers to Ship to Home, when it makes sense to do. From your perspective, are you doing this from competitive response what you're seeing in the marketplace? Or is this your philosophical view of the world? Customers demanding a more integrated omni-channel approach and more transparent pricing between channels?","Thomas R. Greco - Advance Auto Parts, Inc.","That's a good question, Chris. I mean, first of all, we look at every decision we make through the customers' lens. So you're referring here to the DIY customer, and again, I mentioned, Mike Broderick earlier, he's come in with a lot of experience in DIY. We're really excited about DIY. Someone asked me the industry trends earlier. We did see an uptick in DIY performance, in the most recent couple of periods, and \u2013 through NPD. So, DIY is still a pretty exciting place. DIYers \u2013 our business is going to grow in DIY, but we have to be able to give the customer what they want, where they want it and how they want it. And some of our customers are going to want to come into our store and speak to one of the \u2013 our knowledgeable staff and get advice. Others are going to want to order off of a mobile device and have it shipped to their home. The thing is, in our business, when you have a very high return rate, and knowledge and advice is so critical, which is quite different than other industries. Imagine yourself trying to repair a vehicle on a weekend and finding out that the parts you ordered online was the wrong part, now what are you going to do? Well, in our case, we have, obviously, a footprint of stores where somebody can go to the store and get advice. They can return the part. They can learn from it.","So, making sure from our vantage point, it's really understanding the demand journey that exists for the customer itself. And what are the decisions they make along the way on that journey, and how can we delight them at every touch point? Where do they get angry along that demand journey, with an online experience, and how do we make sure that we capitalize on that? So, there \u2013 we've looked forward. We've got a pretty clear idea of where we think the demand is going to unfold, how much of it's going to be in-store, how much of it's going to be buy online, pick up in store, how much of it is going to be Ship to Home and we've obviously engineered our resources and investment platforms around that.","Chris Bottiglieri - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. That's very helpful. And then, unrelated, just wanted to ask about changes you're seeing in the oil and gas prices. I know, there's a lot of puts and takes here. Can you maybe just talk about the same (1: 07: 16) cost inflation, which you were able to pass through, and how that's helping comps? And then maybe how it's affecting the supply chain, and if at all you're seeing any kind of customer response to the marginally lower discretionary spending? Thank you.","Thomas R. Greco - Advance Auto Parts, Inc.","Yeah, the only real commodity headwinds that we saw, Chris, were R-134a refrigerants and ethylene glycol in the quarter. Other than that, didn't really see much.","Chris Bottiglieri - Wolfe Research LLC","Got you. And...","Thomas R. Greco - Advance Auto Parts, Inc.","Yeah. And fuel prices, obviously, are important for our industry. We see a real high correlation, obviously, with fuel prices and miles driven. And there hasn't been a ton of movement there. I think, it's been \u2013 it hasn't come down as much as it did a year ago in the previous year, which obviously benefits miles driven. It's a pretty clear inverse correlation between fuel prices and miles driven, right?","Chris Bottiglieri - Wolfe Research LLC","Got you. And then, in terms of like \u2013 you haven't seen any kind of changes to pricing from suppliers on base oil, like kind of, motor oil, chemicals or even some of your costs or some rising fuel prices, like, do you anticipate that could be something to think about for next year? Or how do you think about that?","Thomas R. Greco - Advance Auto Parts, Inc.","Yeah, I mean, it's something we're looking at, obviously, with the vendors, and each negotiation, we have it split out with the commodities which impact a given category. And, just to repeat, the only real headwinds we saw in the quarter were ethylene glycol and the R-134a refrigerant.","Chris Bottiglieri - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks for clarifying. Appreciate the help.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Steve Forbes with Guggenheim Securities. Please proceed.","Steven Forbes - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Good morning. Maybe a multi-part question here on the end-to-end supply chain optimization effort. Right, so, can you remind us where Leslie and the team are as it relates to the strategic review of those assets? And I guess, maybe just touch on, if you can, right, is it fair to say that we should expect kind of a detailed plan as it relates to both the timeline and maybe the magnitude of opportunity of those initiatives in February? Or is that still too early as it relates to kind of going back to where you guys are in that whole review?","Thomas R. Greco - Advance Auto Parts, Inc.","First of all, just to give you the color on what we're doing here, Steve, I mean, the approach we've taken, Leslie's taken is really customer back. Okay? So, we're starting with the customer and trying to understand from that lens how do we go back from what the customer wants and go into the supply chain. We're looking across all of the current supply chains that we have, which we mentioned. There are at least four \u2013 I would argue five if I include Canada into that mix, because what you really want is an integrated North American supply chain. When you make changes to a supply chain that \u2013 such as ours that has the size and scale that ours does, you've got to make sure that you get it right.","You've got to have all of the technology platforms in place. You've got to make sure the assortment plan is dialed; the execution is planned. So, we are planning on piloting changes with our supply chain in 2018, and we'll come back to you more in February. But, in terms of a detailed plan, in terms of how that's going to unfold, this is going to be an iterative effort over a period of time.","Steven Forbes - Guggenheim Securities LLC","So, I guess, maybe a follow-up on that, right? Because as we try to conceptualize, really mainly the holistic margin outlook for the business, can you touch on, right, you have the three buckets: Material costs, zero based budgeting, and supply chain. I mean, how big is supply chain optimization, right? And how does everything you just laid out, right, maybe just the timing, headwinds, or some of the other headwinds in the industry, how does that affect, right, the timeline for the net productivity gains that we should be modeling?","Thomas Okray - Advance Auto Parts, Inc.","We've got roughly $1 billion in the baseline in our P&L related to supply chain. And we're looking at our end-to-end supply chain can be a couple hundred million opportunity off of that $1 billion baseline. As Tom said, we'll give more color as we get further along with our pilot. A lot of what we're doing \u2013 we \u2013 you have to remember, we're in the third quarter of a five-year transformation. We've got a number of moving parts, as you saw in Q3. We're doing a lot of innovation, testing a number of different things. The profile is going to be a little bit lumpy. Rest assured that we're going to continue to mine the gold out of each one of these P&L items, as I've taken most of you through on many different occasions. But we're going to have the guardrails for the customer, and we're going to iterate accordingly. So, it's a little difficult at this point to give the exact profile as it relates to end-to-end supply chain. But the overall opportunity is very meaningful, couple hundred million dollars.","Steven Forbes - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Dan Wewer with Raymond James. Please proceed.","Dan R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thanks. Tom, when you increased your estimate on cost take-outs, I think, now we're looking at what, $750 million? I believe, one of the buckets was reducing the amount of product returns and reducing the amount of sales discounts. Are you now thinking that the blowback from customers to making those changes could be so significant that you'll perhaps dial back those two efforts?","Thomas Okray - Advance Auto Parts, Inc.","Yeah. I don't know if I would say dial back. I would just say be more cautious in terms of how we do it. I mean, a lot of this transformation, we're learning. We got a number of irons in the fire. We've got a tremendous amount of opportunity. But we're not going to hurt the customer. So, we're not ashamed to say that a lot of this is trial and error, and we're going to continue to fine-tune. So, I think, the opportunity still exists. It's a matter of how we go after the opportunity and do we have the proper foundation in the business right to be able to capitalize on that opportunity.","Dan R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Second question. On the goal of eventually $1 billion of inventory take-outs. The concern that investors are having is that the initial $140 million reduction has been very painful on both gross margin rate, as well as negative impact on same-store sales. And I would assume the next $860 million of inventory take-out could be even more painful. Your thoughts on those two headwinds about reducing inventories?","Thomas Okray - Advance Auto Parts, Inc.","Yeah. Well...","Dan R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Yeah.","Thomas Okray - Advance Auto Parts, Inc.","Yeah, I mean, it's certainly challenging taking inventory out at that level, optimizing it. But we're finding a tremendous amount of opportunity to not only draw down the inventory, but get a better assortment. Again, end-to-end supply chain is a big part of this where we have four different supply chains, which means we have duplicative inventory. A big part of this is getting our turns up and going. We were at 1.24 turns, we need to get those turns higher, which speaks to a better assortment, better execution in the stores, higher UPT. Another tranche of that is payables. We need to do \u2013 continue to do a good job in making sure that our payables structure is right. So, while it's challenging, it's an industry benchmark to be up over 100%. With our mix, we think we can be in the high 90%s.","Dan R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","And the final question that I have is with the change in the field organization. I believe that the number of stores that report to each district manager is up to about 15 stores. And your competitors tend to limit that ratio to about 10 stores per DM. If you could discuss why you're confident you can maintain the appropriate level of execution at the store level, given the district manager responsibility is going to be so much greater than they were before?","Thomas R. Greco - Advance Auto Parts, Inc.","Yeah, Dan, that's a good question. Coming from my previous life, I heard that there's no way we could change the district spans higher than 10 or 11 to 1 for about 20 years. And when we made the change, we actually changed the work, as I said earlier, by giving them the tools, technology that they need to do their job better. So that's really the goal here. You have to change the work. You can't just change the spans without changing the work. And I'm absolutely confident that we'll be able to execute against that change. I'm not concerned about it.","Dan R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Carolina Jolly with Gabelli. Please proceed.","A. Carolina Jolly - Gabelli & Company","Oh, great. Thanks for fitting me in. Just two very brief questions, one being, did you see any differences in how the do-it-for-me and do-it-yourself segments performed? And then second, just with some of the new competitors talking about entering the market or entering the Northeast, have you seen any increase in competition in any regions?","Thomas R. Greco - Advance Auto Parts, Inc.","First of all, on DIY\/DIFM, it was a volatile quarter, let me just say. I mean, we had \u2013 with the hurricanes, you have the panic buying in DIY. You have professional garages that are closed for weeks, literally, on end in some cases. In DIFM, we've got a great business down in Puerto Rico and St. Thomas, and our people down there just moved mountains to get the business back on track and really doing extraordinary things to get our business back up and running. So, pretty volatile.","I think, overall, our professional business outperformed DIY, which has been the case for a period of time for us. In terms of the Northeast, we welcome competition. We thrive on competition. We want to perform for our customers. We put our customer front and center. We're going to make sure that we're delighting our customers. And our Northeast business, we like where we're set up there. We've been able to \u2013 similar to what I said earlier, we've got one leader overseeing the Northeast now that reports into Mike Creedon, our Division President, who knows the area extremely well. We've seen entrants come in there, and that makes us better. So, our intention is to continue to win. That's a very important geography for us. And, we're going to continue to focus on delighting our customers in the Northeast and everywhere else.","A. Carolina Jolly - Gabelli & Company","All right. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session for today. So now it's my pleasure to hand the conference back over to Mr. Tom Greco, President and Chief Executive Officer, for some closing comments and remarks. Sir?","Thomas R.

Before we begin, Elisabeth Eisleben, Vice President, Investor Relations will make a brief statement concerning forward-looking statements that will be discussed on this call.","Elisabeth Eisleben","Good morning and thank you for joining us to discuss our first quarter 2019 results. I\u2019m joined by Tom Greco, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jeff Shepherd, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Following their prepared remarks, we will turn our attention to answering your questions.","Before we begin, please be advised that our comments today may include forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. While actual results may differ materially from those projected in such statements due to a number of risks and uncertainties, which are described in the Risk Factors section in the company\u2019s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, we maintain no duty to update forward-looking statements made. Additionally, our comments today include certain non-GAAP financial measures. We believe providing these measures helps investors gain a more complete understanding of our results and is consistent with how management views our financial results.","Please refer to our quarterly press release and accompanying financial statements issued today for additional detail regarding the forward-looking statements and reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures referenced in today\u2019s call. The content of this call will be governed by the information contained in our earnings release and related financial statements.","Now let me turn the call over to Tom Greco.","Tom Greco","Thanks, Elizabeth. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today as we review our first quarter 2019. I'd like to begin with recognizing our more than 70,000 dedicated advanced team members in our superb network of Carquest Independents. Their unwavering commitment to say yes to our customers enabled Advance to deliver progress in Q1, while making necessary investments to solidify the achievement of our long-term strategic goals.","In the first quarter, net sales increased 2.7% to $3 billion and comparable store sales were also up 2.7%. Our adjusted operating income margin of 8.3% increased 46 basis points compared to the prior year quarter. And our adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 17.1% to $2.46. In a few moments, Jeff will speak to the details of our financial results. However, I wanted to share some highlights from our Q1 performance first.","In the first quarter, we delivered broad based positive comp sales with the highest growth coming from our Midwest, Mid-Atlantic, Appalachian, Carolinas and Central regions. From a category perspective, we saw strong growth embraced motor oil and batteries. In the first quarter, we experienced some weather-related volatility, primarily in the DIY segment. This is not unusual in this timeframe. At the same time, we're pleased that our comparable store sales were positive in both DIY retail and Professional in Q1. In addition, our e-commerce team delivered meaningful growth throughout the quarter. We achieved this while delivering our fourth consecutive quarter of positive comp sales and an improvement on our 2-year stack versus Q4.","Our Professional business was strong throughout the quarter. We believe that improving industry fundamentals are benefiting our Professional business. We're seeing increased adoption and utilization of our unified front-end portal MyAdvance, with our Professional customers, which we expect will drive meaningful growth for both existing and new customers. As a reminder, MyAdvance is a one-stop shop of our full suite of tools for Professional customers to build their business, including our new enterprise catalog, AdvancedPro. AdvancedPro is now been extended to fully support our Carquest locations, bringing all the benefits of AdvancedPro to more Professional customers as we've now enabled our independence to leverage many of the catalog features we've rolled out in our company owned stores.","Additionally, we recently expanded our Technet program. Technet is a business solutions partnership program designed to help independently owned repair facilities grow their business and develop customer loyalty, while maintaining their own identities and serving their local communities. The enhancements will help us grow this network of more than 9,800 Technet shops across the U.S. and Canada. The enhancements were created with direct input and request from existing Technet partners. We're committed to being the trusted first call for all of our customers and continue to leverage feedback from our Professional field team, Carquest independence and Technet customers to ensure they have the tools they need to succeed.","In addition to investments we're making for Professional customers, we're also cognizant of how DIY customer shopping patterns are evolving. We invested in key DIY platforms in Q1, including moving key capabilities to the cloud, enhancing our customers' digital experience, increasing site speed and improving shipping capabilities. We also made several backend investments such as updating skew availability and accessibility on our website.","On the marketing side, we're making progress on elevating the Advance brand and are pleased with the rollout of our new campaign, Think Ahead, Think Advance. Since launching the campaign, we've seen an increase in both purchase consideration and increases in website traffic with year-on-year increases outpacing the vast majority of all retailers. Importantly, we've also seen continuous improvement in the overall awareness and brand recognition of Advance through recent brand tracker surveys, which are the highest we've seen since we began tracking these metrics in the first quarter of 2017. In fact, our top of mind awareness scores improved both sequentially and year-over-year. This improvement is a direct result of our strategic focus on our omnichannel and an ongoing investment priority of our transformation.","Finally, to round out our top line growth initiatives, we're rolling out new tools for our frontline team members to make their daily tasks easier and allow them to focus on what really matters, serving and delighting our customers.","One of our most important initiatives is our NextGen store network, updating outdated technology throughout our stores. Several of our legacy systems and capabilities create delays and frustration for our frontline team members when they're not able to easily view or rapidly toggle between necessary tools such as our catalog, delivery dashboards and training modules. Our NextGen network significantly increases speed and reliability, including a new connected phone system that allows us to serve customers better than ever. As one example, our team members can look up parts much faster with an average 85% improvement in the speed of catalog look-ups, ultimately providing faster and more reliable service for our customers.","Our NextGen network is an example of our focus on reducing non-value-added tasks. Unfortunately, our team members were spending an inordinate amount of time on these tasks, which takes them away from customer facing value-added work. We're working to reduce these tasks throughout the enterprise. And as an example, in our stores, we recently launched MyDay, a tool that groups several modules to manage and direct the administrative and back-office work in our stores.","Since early in Q1, RGM's report that they're reducing administrative work hours and can dedicate more time to customer facing sales and team member training in their stores. We expect these investments will not only improve productivity in our stores, and our customer support centers, we're also confident these initiatives will reduce turnover rates as we make it easier for all our team members to do their job.","We continue to make excellent progress on improved retention. And in the first quarter, we reduced turnover by approximately 15% amongst our core four frontline team members. Our goal in 2019 is to reduce turnover in each of our core four frontline roles for the third consecutive year as Advance builds a reputation of being the very best place to work for great parts of people.","As we drive sales at or above the industry's average, we're equally focused on our unique opportunity to expand margins in four key areas. First, in terms of improving sales and profit per store and our footprint optimization strategy, we remain consistent in our approach to store closes and consolidations in the first quarter. In line with this commitment, during the quarter, we closed and consolidated 38 stores, while reducing the cost of our overall rent obligation as we right size our asset base. With our improved approach to store closures and consolidations, our overall rate of Professional sales retention has consistently exceeded both historical and planned retention. And our field team is doing great work for retain top talent, while working with our large network of stores to place team members. We've also had some significant wins on lease negotiations and had been successful in meaningfully reducing our lease liabilities. All of these factors continued contributing to improve cash flow for AAP.","In parallel, we also continue to look market-by-market for opportunities to drive growth. We're pleased with our execution of openings during the quarter, which included three new retail stores and three Worldpac branches. We're also very excited to welcome 20 new independently owned Carquest locations that joined the Advance family in the first quarter. We'll continue to look for opportunities to optimize our footprint and drive our sales and profit per store to targeted levels. Second, in terms of supply chain, we're focused on the long-term optimization of our distribution center footprint as we improve execution day-in and day-out.","With respect to Q1, we made progress on our critical cross banner replenishment initiative, which will enable us to shift parts from our legacy red DCs to legacy blue stores, and similarly with our blue DCs and red stores. This is a significant unlock that will reduce stem miles and improve customer service. Once fully implemented, we expect to improve product availability, drive inventory turns and deliver significant cost productivity.","In terms of execution, improving performance is primarily focused on standardization. And what we described as running common in terms of processes across all DCs for a variety of reasons including systems, we do not do this today. I remain confident in the supply chain team's ability to transform and integrate our supply chain, while improving execution in 2019.","Our third margin expansion opportunity is category management, where we're making progress in our ongoing material cost optimization efforts, development of private label and strategic pricing.","Finally, we remain focused on every single line within SG&A. Once again, leveraging store labor amid wage inflation, driving reductions in rent through our store footprint optimization efforts, while reducing insurance and workers' comp-related costs with our dedicated focus on the safety of our team members.","In terms of safety, we're seeing meaningful improvements in our incident rate, which is translating to the P&L. We're committed to further improvement as we continue executing on our detailed health and safety agenda.","Overall, our operating margins improved again this quarter. That's said, we know we still have a material opportunity ahead and continue to focus on ensuring the customer is first in everything we do. With this disciplined execution, we're confident we'll drive revenue growth and margin expansion.","Before turning over to Jeff, I want to thank him for his commitment to ensuring the financial success of Advance by serving in dual roles over the past year while we conducted an extensive search for the best candidate to succeed him in his Controller and Chief Accounting Officer role.","After a thorough search, I'm pleased to announce that Andrew Page joined the Advance team as our Senior Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer last week. Andrew brings over 25 years of broad based accounting experience with him, most recently as Senior Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer for Under Armour, and we're thrilled to have him on the Advance team.","With that, I'll turn it over to Jeff for details on our financial performance.","Jeff Shepherd","Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. I want to begin by welcoming Andrew to the Advance team. I'm confident that his experience will be a great addition to our finance organization, and help deliver our finance vision to drive customer and shareholder value through a world-class finance team. I'd also like to thank the entire Advance team for their continued efforts in Q1, which enabled another quarter of positive results.","In Q1, our adjusted gross profit was $1.3 billion, an increase of 3.6% from the prior year quarter. On a rate basis, our adjusted gross profit margin of 44.6% improved by 37 basis points from the prior year quarter, driven by improved pricing that more than offset costs headwinds we're incurring together with continued improvement in our industry management throughout the enterprise. These gross margin benefits were partially offset by planned investments and supply chain wages as we're focused on reducing turnover and improving execution throughout our distribution centers.","In addition, our margin expansion was partially offset by an increase in strength as our distribution centers have made significant progress in backlog tasks. Despite the headwinds, I'm confident our actions are building a foundation for much improved DC performance. The improved reclamation process will improve our level of service and inventory accuracy.","Related to improving inventory assortment and availability, we continued the deployment of our top 25 categories using dynamic assortment in the first quarter. We've seen a meaningful increase in incremental sales since the initial launch, and we continue to rollout this program. We plan to complete the rollout to all stores by the end of 2019 and we'll expand the categories included.","Our adjusted SG&A was $1.1 billion in the first quarter, an increase of $26 million year-over-year. The primary drivers of this increase were due to minimum wage and planned merit increases, professional services related to our IP and e-commerce investments and a year-over-year increase in fuel and transportation expenses related to utilization of our cross-banner visibility. However, on a rate basis, our adjusted SG&A improved by eight basis points compared to the prior year quarter to 36.4%. We're once again able to leverage store labor as a percent of net sales in Q1. Additionally, as safety continues to be a top priority for Advance, I'm pleased with the continued expense reduction directly correlated to our lower incidence rates and claims.","Adjusted operating income in Q1 was $243.6 million, an 8.7% increase from Q1 2018. Our adjusted operating income margin increased 46 basis points to 8.3% in the quarter. Adjusted EPS for the quarter increased 17% to $2.46. This excludes the one-time cost related to the early redemption of our bonds that would have come due in 2020.","In terms of capital spending, we invested $61 million in capital projects in Q1 compared to $34 million in the same period of the prior year. Our largest investments were information technology-related as we remain focused on the complete back-office integration throughout Advance. Related to our capital spending, the investments made have had corresponding operating expenses that are in line with our expectations in the quarter. We anticipate that we will continue to ramp up capital investments throughout 2019 focusing on information technology, supply chain and e-commerce.","As part of our ongoing efforts of managing our working capital, we continue to make progress on our AP ratio. Notably, our AP ratio for the quarter was 74%, an increase of approximately 550 basis points compared to the prior year quarter. This improvement together with our disciplined working capital improvement helped enable another strong quarter of free cash flow growth. In Q1, our free cash flow was $143 million, which increased nearly 20% compared to the prior year quarter. As we've previously discussed during our call in February, in the quarter we completed the early redemption of our $300 million bonds due in May of 2020. In line with our financial priorities, we are pleased that our leverage ratio of 2.1x is now at the lowest point since the GPI acquisition.","Additionally, through our focus on cash flow and disciplined approach to capital allocation, we've returned over $130 million in share repurchases and dividends during the quarter. Our team's unrelenting focus has enabled a solid balance sheet that provides us financial flexibility and security. I'm confident our ability to generate meaningful cash flow combined with the strength of our balance sheet will differentiate Advance and create financial stability regardless of economic trends that may impact the industry. We believe that the fundamentals we set in place for the quarter are crucial, and we will continue to focus on meeting our goals for the balance of 2019.","With that, let's open it up to addressing your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Michael Lasser of UBS. Your line is now open.","Michael Lasser","Tom your comparisons are going to get a lot tougher in the next couple of quarters, can you just go through the two years' stack, adjust you some negative comp? How are you going to be able to sustain this flow to mid-term comp rates during the last quarter?","Tom Greco","We feel pretty good about where we are situated for the year. The input metrics that we track to drive comp improvement are working well for us. We look at them every single week and in some cases daily. So when we look at UPT, our primary e-com metrics, our loyalty program, which is Speed Perks. We're excited about some refinements we've made there that we're rolling out. On the Pro side, dynamic assortment is helping with our stock rate and close rate. So we really track the input metrics. And as we see those input metrics translate to sales improvement, we're confident that we continue to build on the 2-year stack that we put up in the first quarter. And that's kind of how we plan the year. Obviously, we're starting to lap growth. And we're excited about that. We want to continue to drive growth and have comp sales at or above the industry average. And on overall, we're pleased with the fact that both Pro and DIY grew in the first quarter. And that's the goal for the rest of the year.","Michael Lasser","That's helpful. My follow-up question is, if you keep the gross margin enhancement in the first quarter but pace of the expansion moderated over the last two quarters. That coupled with one of your competitors' reporting a similar trend yesterday has started to raise the question, is the auto part retail sector [indiscernible] gross margin? Can you comment specifically on that topic? And then what's the outlook for Advance gross margin for the next quarter?","Tom Greco","We've had a number of initiatives that we've had in place for a while. Our material costs optimization is something that's ongoing. We're always looking for ways to minimize costs. We're working very collaboratively with our supply partners in terms of minimizing those costs. And we obviously saw some evidence of that this quarter. We think that can continue. We work with them day-in and day-out. We've been through the various categories in AAP CQ. And we're continuing to do that as we work through with AI and Worldpac. So we look at that, obviously, our -- when we look at our assortment, we look at private label, that's another area that we're addressing. So for us in particular, we think we have a number of areas that we can focus on to continue to drive costs down and keep our margins whether they're at or better.","Michael Lasser","So just to clarify, we shouldn't assume that price transparency is starting to creep in the industry. Everyone's having a -- promote a little bit more to drive sales?","Tom Greco","I wouldn't necessarily assume that Michael. We've been consistent in terms of how we look at the business that really, especially on the Professional side, product availability is king. And then you've obviously got other factors in there, the relationship we have with our customers, obviously, you've got to be competitive on price, but yes, there are other leavers that are more important. So we're looking at pricing very closely in addition to adjust that. I mean the material cost optimization work is excellent that Mike Broderick and his team are leading. We do feel we have a disproportionate opportunity to grow our private label business relative to others maybe. We have a lower starting point. But we've got to look strategically across our business at pricing and where it makes sense we're going to be more intense and more competitive, and one of the places we see opportunities to expand margin. So we've got a tremendous opportunity to grow gross margins and that's a big part of our long-term plan.","Operator","And our next question comes from Chris Horvers of JP Morgan. Your line is now open.","Chris Horvers","A couple questions. So on the investment side, can talk about how much investments were put in the first quarter? I think you talked about roughly 100 basis points of investment pressure over the year. How much did you put it in the first quarter? And then, laterally, can you also talk about how you think about the growth rate of SG&A dollars or perhaps leverage over the balance of the years or the cadence? How you're thinking about that?","Jeff Shepherd","Yes. Sure. As it relates to the investments, Chris, as a reminder, we indicated the $80 million to $120 million of what we're calling OpEx investments back into the business. And that's a combination of technology-related people and marketing. And we're very much on track. We've reinvested that and it's going to continue to ramp during the year. But we've very much in line with that guidance that we provided you.","Chris Horvers","And then in terms of like how you think about just the overall say SG&A leverage? I think on the last call you talked about sort of steady improvement over the year from a leverage perspective on SG&A?","Jeff Shepherd","If you remember, we talked about our SG&A to be consistent with what we saw in 2018. We've finished the year with 36.3%. And we anticipate we'll be in line with that in 2019.","Chris Horvers","And then, just broadly, you've talked about improvement into your stacks and the comp, DIY and commercial up. How did the stacks say shake out on the DIY and commercial front? And you didn't mention Northeast has an outperforming region. Was that an area that you saw more of sort of underperformance relatively on the DIY side?","Jeff Shepherd","Well, we called out the top performing regions, we have 12 of them. And honestly, we grew everywhere. We're happy with our overall comp performance. The Northeast was a little bit behind, not significantly behind actually was close to being in the top five, if you will, Chris. But overall, we continue to be happy with our business up there.","Chris Horvers","And then the DIY versus commercial, any comments on stacks in the first quarter relative to 4Q?","Jeff Shepherd","Yes, both of them grew on a 2-year stack basis. And as we said, both DIY and Pro grew. Pro outperformed DIY by a little bit. I mean, this has been a couple quarters in a row where we've been relatively close. There isn't a huge outperformance in aggregate. The Professional business coming together under Bob Cushing. We're kind of packaging our entire lineup under the Professional banner, what do we call Advance Professional. And then, obviously DIY omnichannel where we're integrating the online experience with the in-store experience, and that's performing well. So relatively close, but Professional outperformed DIY in the quarter.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Bret Jordan at Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Bret Jordan","Could you give us an update as to where we are on the Walmart partnership and the omnichannel initiative?","Tom Greco","Sure. We're very excited about this one Bret. We're very much on track with what we talked about. We're building an automotive specialty store on walmart.com, where our customers will have access to our parts, accessories, maintenance items, et cetera in addition to Walmart's other offerings. And we're really working together on delivering a differentiated experience. We believe we can bring speed, convenience and trusted advice to the large number of DIY customers who are already going to walmart.com every day. We're on track to get started in the front half. We\u2019ll build the capabilities for the year. I don't expect this to be a big factor in the second half because we want to make sure that the customer proposition is absolutely best-in-class at each stage of our rollout. We need on this every week. And it's something that we're very aligned with the Walmart team on. So going well and more to come.","Bret Jordan","And a follow-up as far as the progress and closing some distribution infrastructure, any experience that you've had as far as converting systems? And maybe slow rates in stores where you're seeing some DC shut downs?","Tom Greco","Yes. We've -- I think we've hardened that process Bret. We've now closed three buildings. We're now looking at how we can further optimize our existing DCs. And that includes our cross manner replenishment initiative, which we spoken about. We're now making daily replenishment deliveries to a group of Carquest stores from an advanced DC. And within this pilot, we're still in the learning phase and we expect to be completed that by the summer. Separately, we've got a pilot that's replenishing an Advance store from a Carquest DC. So the plan here is to take what we've learned from these pilots and really scale them to other DC store combinations later in the year and into 2020. So we're getting the process down. When we point a store at a new distribution center, we're making sure that we don't lose any momentum. And the intent there is to do it in such a way that the catching DC is ready to go when we point that store to catching DC. So we haven't seen any deterioration in fill rates. I mean, we've finished up the three, I think we finished up the most recent one in the first quarter this year, and we're excited about it. There's a tremendous opportunity for us to take cost out with this initiative.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Mike Baker at Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Michael Baker","I just wanted to ask you about trends throughout the first quarter. Were you impacted by tax refunds at all? How did that impact February and what has happened since then? This is particularly a long quarter for you guys. And I guess you mentioned the weather impacts. So I'm wondering if you could quantify that.","Tom Greco","Yes. First of all, Mike, on tax refunds, we looked at the scans by week. We get the syndicated data from NPD. And we did see a bit of a lag there, but it did come back as the quarter ended. So it really wasn't a factor for us at all. And whether it was volatile it always is in the first quarter, I would say that, generally some of these seasons straddle quarters for us, whether it's winter between Q4 and Q1, or even now, as you think about the spring selling season, it was a little warmer in April this year than it was last year. It's been a little cooler to start off May. So the spring selling season has been somewhat elongated in that regard. But I wouldn't say there was any material impact on the first quarter results for us.","Michael Baker","And then, I guess related to that and really to follow-up on Chris' question. So you comp at 2.7, which is above your full year guidance of 1 to 2.5. So that you do suggest that you decelerate through the year or this upside to that guidance. So in your opinion, which is more likely? And do you expect to come positively in all four quarters?","Tom Greco","That -- certainly the plan is to come positively in all four quarters. We do have more difficult laps in the back half of the year. We're confident in our full year guide. Our goal, obviously, is to be at or above the industry average. So clearly, we're focused on beating the number. But that said, we're sticking with our full year guide and we're confident we'll achieve that.","Michael Baker","And one more related to that. Was the first quarter 2.7, how was that in line with your internal plan?","Tom Greco","Yes. It was slightly lower than our internal plan for the quarter. But as we look at the full year, we did front-end load the plan that's what we like to do here and make sure that we make it difficult to start the year, and we remain confident in the full year guide.","Operator","And our next question comes from Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities. Your line is now open.","Seth Basham","My question is around cross-banner replenishment. You gave a little bit more color. But I was wondering if you could be more specific as when you expect to have the chain up running fully on cross-banner replenishment. Is it 2020 or 2021?","Tom Greco","Very exciting initiative for us. I appreciate the question. We're using Ribbons Sloan as leading this work. We've got some special software that we're using. It allows us to be much more freight logical in our design of our system. We have all the assets we need to succeed. We've got 50 plus distribution centers, as you know. And many of them are positioned in urban markets like Chicago and Dallas et cetera. And they operate in a silo today. So we'll be able to use those DCs very differently. You think about Dallas, Texas, we've got a blue DC sitting in Dallas. We've got a whole bunch of stores there, but we don't ship them from Dallas. We ship them from Houston actually. So as we stand all this up, it's going to really help our -- not just our costs, but our availability and our speed to get product to our stores. The plan is to get at these DC store combinations in the back half of this year. We see it continuing through '20. It might bleed into the front half of '21. We're going to be very careful about this change, obviously, as we have been with our DC closures to date. We want to make sure that we're executing flawlessly and we're not disrupting the customer. So the plan is to essentially start the ball rolling in the back half of this year. Next year will be a busy year as we transfer stores to new DCs. And again, it might drift into the front half of '21, but we will be realizing the full benefit of these savings and the availability improvements by that timeframe.","Seth Basham","And then secondly, a follow-up just around gross margins this quarter. Jeff, was there any LIFO benefit or charge this quarter?","Jeff Shepherd","Yes, there was a LIFO charge this quarter of $26 million. That was largely -- has more than offset by changes in our supply chain costs that we were capitalizing on the balance sheet. So what we call our inventory related costs were de minimis this quarter. And that's consistent with the year-over-year quarter as well.","Seth Basham","Okay. A little bit more color around the adjustment you made on gross margin this quarter without period adjustments?","Jeff Shepherd","Yes. Sure. That was something as we were closing our books, we came across it. It really relates to prior years as we were going through and looking at some of the processes we've had around matching some of our invoices. It was a lot of really small invoices that have added up over the years, should have run through the inventories as far back as 2014. So none of that relates to 2019, which is why we wanted to call it up separately.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Simeon Gutman of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Simeon Gutman","My question, it's sort of a follow-up on a few questions regarding the rest of the year in sales. So you were outperforming the peer group for a bunch of quarters. Now it's somewhat underperformed in the first quarter. You do have tougher comparisons now on the back half. So can I ask it in this way, if you look at the initiatives around sales for this year versus what the ones that were in place last year? Are they more incremental? Are they more marginal? Or are any of initiatives you are working on should result in like a step change to the sales over time? Or thinking about distribution longer term that's the next layer that's going to unlock better throughput?","Tom Greco","That's a great question, Simeon. I mean, I think, look, we're obviously very cognizant of where we're situated. We're pleased that we're competing in a very healthy industry that's growing. That's something you're hearing from everyone, very excited about the prospects for '19 and beyond as vehicles in the sweet spot continues to grow. Our agenda is a complex one as you know. I mean, we're primarily focused on delighting our customers and improving execution and drive sales growth, but we're also very focused on delivering margin expansion, profitability and cash flow. So we're taking a balanced approach to executing our strategy. We're going to continue to drive at the initiatives that I spoke about earlier to drive more top line. Of course, we'd like to have more sales, and we want to be gaining share, and we're balancing that with the need to deliver the P&L overall. I think in terms of specific initiatives, I'm probably most excited about the launch of our Speed Perks loyalty program in the back half of this year. That should help us with DIY significantly. We're focused on our most loyal customers. We've had a pilot market in place for a couple of periods now that we're beginning to scale. We see some big upside there. Obviously, online continues to perform extremely well. And I think, Bob Cushing, on the Professional side, we're seeing significant momentum in our 2-year stacks there as we kind of package together our overall offering. You've got across cross-banner visibility now in place. MyAdvance is working well for us. We're seeing increased adoption of our AdvancedPro catalog, more online ordering. So there is a lot going on. And we're trying to balance everything that we're doing in a way that we continue to execute flawlessly.","Simeon Gutman","My follow-up is on distribution. You just laid out the timeframe for, I guess, progress overtime and some of the big changes. You increase pay, you mentioned that last quarter. Can you talk about -- I don't think it would have the same impact that if you increase pay at a store, you might see better productivity. Can you talk about what that changes meaning to the distribution center, I guess it maybe through turnover and productivity improvement from those changes alone?","Tom Greco","Yes, for sure. First of all, there's nothing more important than our team members. I want to emphasize that to our success. We're focused on attracting the very best people that we can. And we knew there was going to be higher wages this year in 2019. We reviewed our exposure to each DMA. I think, as you know Simeon, we've made a big investment in our frontline team members in the store -- stores themselves through our unique fuel frontline stock ownership program was now in its third full year. We also substantially improved our 401(k) platform that is available to everyone. So we're making sure that we're helping our team members with even retirement planning, if you will. In the DCs, Reuben felt pretty strongly that a wage increase in the DCs would help reduce turnover. And I've been quite surprised that how rapidly that's impacted our turnover in the DCs. We've seen a pretty significant drop very quickly. And it has helped us. I mean, it's helped us with the fill rates, the reliability, the accuracy. And also, we've taken several days off our reclamation in the DCs. So I think overall, it's helping on our execution. And I know Reuben is very committed to standardization and really getting much more commonality across our buildings. And I think that will help us also. So clearly, when you make a wage investment, there has to be an output metric that you can attribute to the investment you're making in wages. And I think we're connecting those dots pretty well.","Operator","And our next question comes from Scot Ciccarelli of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Scot Ciccarelli","So I know it's an ongoing process, but can you guys update us kind of where you are in the process of renegotiating terms and pricing with your vendors?","Tom Greco","First of all Scott, I think it's really an iterative process, we're never going to be done. But when we talked about sort of the first round, we were specifically focused on AAP\/CQ. We're about 90% there where we've gone through the major categories, we're wrapping that up. But again, it doesn't stop. We're going to go back and we're going to be looking at Worldpac and we're looking at some of the categories that started over a year ago. And so it's going to be an ongoing process. Like I said earlier, we're working very collaboratively with our supplier partners. And so we expect to continue this process as we look for margin improvement, and we look for strong relationship with our vendors.","Scot Ciccarelli","And then a follow-up, can you also provide -- I know you talked a bit about cross-banner, product sales and how that distribution back-end is changing. Is it possible to provide some color or range, however you want to describe it regarding how you think about the contribution margin performance and how that will change as you guys try to optimize the back-end?","Tom Greco","Can you expand on that a little bit, Scot. Let me try to understand your question.","Scot Ciccarelli","Yes, Tom, specifically, on the cross-banner sales -- cross-banner product sales, my understanding has been that your profit margins on the sales had been relatively had been relatively modest. And as you guys optimize the supply chain and delivery and distribution part of it, there's an opportunity set for those margins to expand. And if you can just kind of help us frame it some way, I think that might be helpful for the group.","Tom Greco","Sure. Well, for sure we're starting to make progress on that one. We weren't clear on what the impact across banner visibility was going to be when we first rolled that out. I mean, you're making Worldpac parts visible to our AdvancedPro, our Advance customers in that respect and vice versa et cetera. So now we've got a pretty good handle on what are the brands that our customers weren't able to get before, but now that they can see a broader array of parts they're now able to get. So we've been able to map that out. And now we've had meetings DMA-by-DMA that Reuben is leading to ensure that we're essentially moving the parts around in-market as efficiently as possible. We start to lap this, I think in the second quarter. We did see our expenses, our transportation in-market fleet expenses came down a little bit in the first quarter from where they've been. So that optimization work is happening. And I think, as we get into the second and third quarter, I think it'll be -- we'll be in a position to start actually potentially saving some money in those lines.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Chris Bottiglieri of Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.","Chris Bottiglieri","First one is just on leverage. It looks like given the lease accounting changes that you adopted, your leverage metric decreased about 0.5 turn from that change. So what does, I guess figure out if that's the way the rating agencies are looking at it and credit investors. And then like given the methodology change, should we still rely on the historical 2.5x to 3x leverage under this new methodology or has that also changed?","Tom Greco","Yes. So obviously I can't speak for the rating agencies or how they're going to look at this. When we looked at it, the six times rent expense was really a proxy for what we thought an obligation would be. With the new lease accounting standard, we now have that on balance sheet, we have to quantify in accordance with a methodology that should be used consistently across the industry. So we just thought it was a better indicator of what our true obligation was. Thought to be clear and to your point, the old model, if you want to use the six times rent expense, you're right, it would be at 2.6. So we're still very close to our stated objective of 2.5. But we do think the new methodology is better because it's a true reflection of what that obligation is. And you can clearly see that on our balance sheet.","Chris Bottiglieri","And then big picture question on the supply chain. You had AutoZone yesterday, raised their Mega Hub strategy to 60 to 90 hubs. O'Reilly disclosed for the first time they secretly had, 80 super hubs. A while back, you guys had been experimenting with -- figure to recall super hubs or something to that effect. Just curious where you stand today on those? And if you think your current distribution infrastructure is adequate to compete in today's evolving commercial landscape? Thank you.","Tom Greco","Yes. Sure. First of all, I think, honestly, everybody defines these things a little bit differently. The way we look at it as we have 50 million square feet of buildings, and we're going to put the most optimal parts in the closest to the customer locations we can. And that's the exercise that we're going through. I mean, you think about -- we have a Carquest DC that has a lot of parts in it. It's only servicing the blue network today. I think we're in a very different starting point than some of our industry peers. And we're looking at optimizing those assets and making sure that we're connecting -- basically the customer back work that we're doing, which is to really understand on the professional side, job-by-job. What are the requirements for the parts that they need, which ones require rapid delivery, which ones may be? There might be a more of a willingness to wait, if you will. So it's using all of our asset base and working back. I think in that respect, we're taking the assets that we have and optimizing those. And there's plenty of room for us to improve the cost structure of the company as we do that.","Chris Bottiglieri","And I just like kind of follow-up there. I think earlier in the call you had mentioned looking -- that Bob was looking to or Reuben or other looking to standardize like the physical laying out of the DCs. As I've understand the Carquest DCs were lot smaller in square footprint much more of that than the traditional legacy, call it like DIY DCs or how you want to frame those. So I want to get a sense for to what extent you're able to standardize the entirety of your supply chain? And how those two legacy infrastructures will complement each other? Thank you.","Tom Greco","I mean, I think the -- Reuben's in really an execution mode on supply chain. I think you start with just improving basic execution and we talked about running comment. This is a very basic supply chain concept. But for a variety of reasons, mostly systems-related, we weren't actually doing this, so getting to a common platform. Even though the building might be different in size and shape, you can get to common methods throughout the building, right? That's a very important process for us. I talked about the DC optimization and freight logical. I think the other piece that we were working on is investing in a single wealth management system to replace legacy systems within Advance and Carquest. And this will significantly improve what we call labor management standardization, or LMS. So that's an important priority for us with Reuben. We believe we can get much more common in terms of the processes. You think about people, process, technology, people making investments in the people that we have to make sure that we've got the best people working in our DCs. We're routinizing the processes that they have to make their jobs easier, and then we're supporting with technology. So that's really his agenda in that regard. And he's making a lot of progress. He's building a great team. And we're excited about the prospects for supply chain, not just in terms of cost optimization, but in terms of availability.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Elizabeth Suzuki with Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Elizabeth Suzuki","This may have been asked already, but I just wanted to touch on it. Has there been any material impact on the business or the industry from the step up in tariffs? And what have you guys seen in inflation over the last couple of quarters?","Jeff Shepherd","So in terms of tariffs, this is something we've been analyzing for a while, both the tariff that already have taken place last year as well as the potential impact. And we feel like we've taken the necessary steps to mitigate it. But a couple of things, relative -- in relative terms, our industry has less exposure to tariffs than most other retail sectors. Obviously, I can't speak for everyone in our industry, but for us, the categories that are impacted are less than 10% of our total direct imports. As it relates to indirect imports, it's a little more difficult, but we think it's in that same range about 10%, so a total of 20%. To-date, we've been able to pass on the impact of tariffs. Given the key categories that have been impacted to-date, we haven't seen a material change in unit performance, and that's going back to the tariffs that took place in 2018. And then, we've taken several steps to mitigate the impact, including sourcing refinements and working collaboratively with our suppliers. And they are equally motivated to mitigate the impact of the tariff. We feel like we're positioned competitively as our industry peers are generally in the same position. We've managed through the first round. But without a doubt, the 25% of tariff for this round is a meaningful increase passed on to our customers. But the industry historically has been able to pass on these increases, particularly on the Pro side where the cost is embedded in the cost of the job. DIY, there's obviously a little more risk, but we feel like we've done everything we can to mitigate the impact, and we'll continue to monitor this very closely.","Elizabeth Suzuki","Okay. And is there any impact from inflation to-date or in the last quarter that you can break out for us?","Jeff Shepherd","We've seen a little bit of inflation. Obviously labor rates, we continue to see there has been some cost increases, but it's been in line with our expectations. Kind of that 2% to 3% range is what we've been seeing, so nothing out of the ordinary, I would say.","Elizabeth Suzuki","Okay. But in terms of the contribution of comp in the quarter, of that 2.7%, was there any SKU for SKU increase in price?","Jeff Shepherd","Yes. I mean, we did take some pricing actions again to offset -- remember, we've got the tariffs that took place in the fourth quarter, so we had cost headwinds in the quarter, but that was more than offset by the pricing and some of our MCL efforts. But, yeah, we did have some price, but again nothing significant and obviously didn't have an impact on rate.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael Montani of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","Michael Montani","Just wanted to build on the last question a little bit. If you were to assume the next $300 billion plus of imported goods were to get tariffs, would that basically have the effect of doubling the 20% exposure that you all have had from Section 301? Or how should we think about the potential exposure?","Tom Greco","It's Tom, Michael. No, I mean, when we look at it, we look at the whole -- all of the list, one, two, three, everything that's in there. And that's the number we gave. So -- and just a little more color when Jeff was talking about. I mean, we obviously have been tracking list one, list two, list three. So those things that have been impacted, we haven't seen a meaningful change in unit movement. Others have been around this industry a lot longer than I have, but they've said consistently, you've heard that we don't expect this to have an impact. We're very cognizant, 25% is a big number, but we haven't seen an impact to -date. So that's obviously something we have to monitor very closely.","Michael Montani","Okay. And then, within the comps, so the 2.7 that you reported, can you give some incremental color around what the ticket did versus the traffic in the quarter and how that compares to trend?","Tom Greco","Yes, I mean, it depends on the business, of course. But consistent with previous quarters, we are seeing DIY retail continues to be challenged on traffic. And that's something that we're very focused on. We've launched a new advertising campaign. We're seeing improved awareness, top-of-mind aided awareness, unaided awareness, all improving. So we feel like we're making progress there. But unfortunately, Michael, that's still a negative number. And then obviously average ticket has been able to offset that, e-commerce is strong on both ends, professional stronger on both, but DIY retail transactions is the one that we remain concerned about. We measure e-commerce transactions, whether it's buy online, pick up and store or ship to home. So we put the transactions for DIY e-com inside the e-com number. So the DIY retail transactions are pure -- somebody walking in the swinging doors.","Michael Montani","And just the last one from me was around leverage point. So, given the investments of $80 million to $120 million, and there's obviously discrete offsets that you have in the cost structure as well. What kind of comps would you all need to kind of lever SG&A into the back half of the year? And maybe just bigger picture, you could give us an update on some of the gross cost savings opportunities over the years, there has been different years, $0.5 billion, $750 million plus, what kind of a bucket have you realized so far out of that and how much remains to go?","Tom Greco","Sure. Well, I think, on the comps, I mean, we obviously constructed our plan to deliver on the guidance we provided. So, we gave a guide on sales, we gave a guide on margin expansion and embedded in that margin expansion obviously we're focused on making the investments that we feel we need to in order to drive the long-term growth of the company, which is in four big areas. And we've talked about that. The opportunity that we have is substantial. I think we're quite unique in terms of our overall margin expansion opportunity. I mean, we're growing our sales and at the same time, we believe we can drive our margins significantly higher. And that's going to come from improved sales and profit per store, which is a big opportunity for us. Supply chain, which we've spoken about, improved category management of the different categories we have and then reduction in SG&A. When you put all that together, we believe we can close the gap we have with our industry peers pretty significantly over the next several years, and we're going to try and get to our stated goal of mid-teens as rapidly as we can. So that's kind of where it is. We've talked about 2019 and 2020 having some pretty big investments in order to set up our technology platforms to enable that longer-term outcome. At the same time, we're on track with those initiatives, and achieving the milestones we need to do to get there.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Daniel Imbro of Stephens Incorporated. Your line is now open.","Daniel Imbro","Tom, a bit of a follow-up actually on the last few questions. And in the prepared remarks, we've talked a lot about in-store technology as well as some DC technological investments you're making. Can you just help us think about a time frame? I think you just referenced a minute ago, but when we should begin to see some of those benefits showing up on the P&L, whether that's through higher sales numbers or through some cost efficiencies in the stores, so what kind of timeframe should we be thinking about before we start seeing the benefits there?","Tom Greco","Yes, goo question, Daniel. I mean, first of all, it varies widely unfortunately. I'll try and give you a bit of color. When you talk about the technology and e-commerce investments that we're making, it's by far the biggest part of the OpEx investments over half. We've really changed the investment profile of the company when we think about OpEx or CapEx. We use to invest primarily in new stores, and now we've shifted that investment profile to much more technology and e-commerce space. So when you're talking about when will we see payback? Well, you talked about integration-related items, so getting to a single payroll system. Okay, getting to a single back-office system, getting to a single warehouse management system, all of those are in flight, we should start to realize the SG&A benefits associated with those starting next year and then mostly as we get into '21. Because you have to -- the problem here Daniel is, you have to keep the old system operating as you basically sunset -- sorry, as you stand up the new system. And in some cases, we're moving our platforms to the cloud, et cetera. So it's a little bit complicated there, but we have very high level of confidence that we can take the commensurate cost out at some point in time in the future. In addition, we're making big bets in the e-commerce area. So there, you're starting to see more early returns. So, we're getting high growth there. We're getting more people to our website. We're driving more top line growth. That's an important part of our overall sales and profit per store input. So that's a bit of a different piece of it. Finally, we're currently installing a next generation store network across the entire chain. And I can't tell you how excited our team members are about this. I mean, Sri Donthi, who is our Chief Technology Officer, has rolled this out. We're going in store by store and replacing a very slow legacy system with a much more rapid, much more connected, much more modern point-of-sale system catalog and phone, and it's having great success out of the gate. We've done several hundred stores already. We plan to complete that project this year. I would expect that to start realizing benefits now in the current stores. Obviously -- until we get to 4,000 plus, we will get the full benefit, but next year, we'll get the full benefit of that. So, it depends on what you're talking about in terms of these technology platforms. But the idea is to really differentiate ourselves versus our competition with our online experience, be that in Professional or in DIY, to make the job easier for our team members in the stores or distribution centers, and of course to integrate the company, which is long overdue and something that we're very focused on.","Daniel Imbro","And then a quick follow-up, Jeff. Just on capital allocation, under the new leverage you noted kind of a multi-year low. But looking at the cash flow statement, I don't think you guys repurchased any shares since the 4Q report. So I was just wondering if you could update us on your thinking about capital allocation from here as you invest in all these technological and different opportunities, but free cash flow should be improving from here. So, any update on that front?","Jeff Shepherd","Yes, sure. And just as a reminder, our capital allocation priorities as we want to maintain our investment grade rating, reinvest in the business and then return excess cash to our shareholders. Couple of things just on the cash return front, we did two things this quarter. First, we did repurchase $127 million worth of stock in the first quarter. We don't have anything else planned right now for the rest of the year, but we continue to look at that, that's obviously very fluid and we will be opportunistic with that, but there is currently no plans right now. We did buyback debt in the first quarter. So that was another $300 million of debt that we retired early which would come due next year. And we're very much on track with our investments that we've been talking about and we feel confident that we're going to be well within the range of the guidance that we provided last quarter. So we feel like we're doing all of the things that are consistent with our capital allocation priorities, and we're very much on track with everything that we've indicated.","Operator","Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Tom Greco for any closing remarks.","Tom Greco","Well, thanks to all of you for joining us this morning. A couple of quick comments in closing. My team and I look forward to kicking off our second annual American Heart Association fundraising campaign throughout the stores next week. And the AHA, as many of you know, is an organization that's extremely important to all of us. And well, I'm proud of the fundraising accomplishments we had last year. We're looking forward to exceeding our campaign goals this year. So look forward in our stores, heart diseases, the number one killer of Americans, and all of us at Advance are committed to help change that statistic.","And before I conclude, I want to take a moment to express our sincere gratitude to all our nation's heroes who have served, especially those men and women we honor this Memorial Day weekend who paid the ultimate sacrifice for our country. I wish you all a safe, healthy and happy holiday weekend, and we look forward to discussing our second quarter results with you in August.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference.

Before we begin, Elisabeth Eisleben, Vice President, Investor Relations will make a brief statement concerning forward-looking statements that will be discussed on this call.","Elisabeth Eisleben","Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss our third quarter 2018 results. I\u2019m joined by Tom Greco, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Jeff Shepherd, our Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer; Bob Cushing, our Executive Vice President of Professional; and Mike Broderick, our Executive Vice President, Merchandising and Store Operations Support. Following their prepared remarks, we will turn our attention to answering your questions.","Before we begin, please be advised that our comments today may include forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. While actual results may differ materially from those projected in such statements due to a number of risks and uncertainties, which are described in a Risk Factors section in the company\u2019s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, we maintain no duty to update forward-looking statements made.","Additionally, our comments today include certain non-GAAP financial measures.

The content of this call will be governed by the information contained in our earnings release and related financial statements.","Now, let me turn the call over to Tom Greco.","Tom Greco","Thanks, Elizabeth, and good morning. First, I\u2019d like to thank the entire Advance team and our network of Carquest Independent for a strong quarter, characterized by progress on virtually every financial and marketplace metric. It\u2019s because of their dedication and unrelenting focus on the customer that we were able to deliver our strongest comparable sales growth in nearly eight years, which in turn led to improved market share performance. It\u2019s clear that our transformation actions are beginning to take hold, driving meaningful improvements in execution, enabling us to earn more business with our valued customers.","In the third quarter, net sales increased by 4.3% to $2.3 billion and comp sales were up 4.6%. Our adjusted operating income margin of 8.5% increased 62 basis points compared to the prior year quarter. And our adjusted earnings per share increased 32.2% to $1.89.","Year-to-date, our free cash flow was $576 million, an increase of $336 million year-over-year, as we continue to drive disciplined cash management practices throughout the organization. Our sales performance in the quarter is a testament to the hard work of our entire team, truly living our cultural belief and executing on our mission, Passion for Customers, Passion for Yes!","Not only did we deliver the strongest comparable sales growth since 2010, our absolute growth in the quarter was above the industry average, driven by increased units per transaction and average ticket value. Importantly, we strengthened our customer value proposition and delivered balanced, consistent growth throughout Q3 in both our DIY omni-channel and professional businesses.","From a geographic perspective, we saw improvement across all 12 regions. Our Southeast, Midwest, Appalachia, Northeast, and Mid-Atlantic regions led the way. From a category perspective, we saw increased sales across nearly every category with the strongest growth in brakes, batteries, and optics, where we delivered high single-digit growth. Without a doubt, we\u2019re seeing better coordination and planning across our merchandising, marketing and field operations teams, which is also contributing to our momentum.","Finally, we\u2019re leveraging supplier partnerships and improved analytical capabilities to ensure we have the right inventory, in the right locations, at the right time. This is a work-in-progress and we still have significant opportunity, but we believe that the improvements made so far are helping our improved execution.","Going a little deeper in Professional, we saw improved performance across every AAP banner in the U.S., including Advance, Worldpac, Autopart International and importantly both Carquest Corporate and Independent stores. Our customers want choices, and thanks to cross-banner visibility, we\u2019re doing a much better job of leveraging AAP\u2019s industry leading assortment of brands to ensure our pro customers have the options they desire to meet the needs of their customers.","Through continued focus on our customer value proposition and direct feedback from our professional customers, we recently launched myadvance.com. This is an interactive, easy to use, mobile friendly platform where we\u2019ve combined multiple online tools and capabilities into one place, including our Advance Pro online ordering platform.","On myadvance.com, professional customers can access industry-leading cross-banner assortment as well as best-in-class shop services and solutions such as an expert corner featuring content rich training and shop business solution advice from automotive aftermarket industry leaders. These initiatives are driving incremental growth for our Professional business.","We\u2019re equally excited about the growth within our DIY omni-channel business. In Q3, we saw increases in both DIY retail and DIY online, marking the second consecutive quarter with sales growth in both. We launched our new advertising campaign, Think Ahead. Think Advance, and it\u2019s off to a great start. We continue to invest in e-commerce, where enhancements we made to our website improved the customer experience, including reduced page load times and additional personalization modules.","In addition, well today, the majority of our online orders are, buy online pickup in store, we\u2019ve made progress on our ship to home capabilities. Overall, our investments drove strong double-digit revenue growth in Q3. While we are pleased that our improving execution is driving topline strength, we remain focused on controlling expenses across the organization. I was delighted with our store team\u2019s ability to once again, leverage additional customer service hours through increased sales in the third quarter.","In addition, we\u2019re seeing a noticeable shift in culture as safety has become a critical focus throughout Advance. Importantly, our progress on safety initiatives enabled a reduction in liability and vehicle claims in the quarter and we expect to see further benefits as a result of our safety initiatives. Our investment in this critical area has paid off quickly and I\u2019m confident we\u2019re developing a true safety culture with heightened attention on team member safety throughout Advance.","Unfortunately, we did have team members and customers affected by the recent hurricanes. Our thoughts are with them as they work towards cleaning up after the damage. I\u2019m personally thankful for our entire organization and their willingness to step up financially, while giving their time to help their fellow team members and communities. We remain committed to standing ready and working together as one team, leading by example and showing the true spirit of Advance.","As you\u2019ll hear from Jeff on our financial performance and updated expectations for the balance of the year, we\u2019re confident in our ability to maintain momentum into Q4. We remain laser focused on cost control to offset expense headwinds. As discussed last quarter, higher bonus for our team will impact our Q4 SG&A versus prior year, and obviously, we\u2019re performing much better than last year.","In line with our long-term strategic objectives and building a best-in-class omni-channel experience for our customers, last month we announced an exciting partnership with Walmart. With up to 100 million unique visitors to walmart.com every month, this partnership will enable us to reach a much broader group of DIY customers and help drive market share growth. We\u2019re thrilled to begin the rollout of this partnership in the first half of 2019, when we\u2019ll be able to offer our extensive product offering and trusted advice with an increased number of DIY customers.","We also made progress on our end-to-end supply chain efforts in Q3. I\u2019m pleased with our team\u2019s execution throughout the year and we\u2019re on track for closing our Gallman and San Antonio distribution centers by year-end. In addition, we announced the closure of a third DC in Columbia, South Carolina, which we expect to close in the first half of 2019.","Consistent with our supply chain efforts, we remain focused on our store footprint optimization, and year-to-date, we\u2019ve closed and consolidated 81 stores. We\u2019re approaching store closings very differently this year, and as a result, we\u2019re seeing significant improvements in key employee and business retention. In addition to the notable improvements I discussed earlier related to safety within Advance, I\u2019m also pleased with the positive improvements we\u2019re seeing in our focused HR initiatives. We\u2019ve meaningfully reduced turnover in the past two years and a recent review of our 2018 HART [ph] Health results continue to highlight positive trends versus prior years. We remain committed to the growth and development of our team while providing competitive compensation packages and best-in-class training to ensure we\u2019re able to recruit and retain the best talent at Advance.","Finally, while we\u2019ll provide 2019 guidance when we report Q4 results, we are nearing the completion of our annual operating plan and longer-term strategic business plan update, and remain encouraged by the macro indicators we see for 2019. Notably, after three consecutive years of declines, the number of vehicles greater than seven years old is expected to grow in 2019 for the first time since 2015. This group of vehicles is one of the largest demand drivers in our industry, and we\u2019re confident this will enable continued industry momentum. In fact, forecast for the next five years show growth in the number of vehicles seven years and older and we expect this vehicle population will be roughly 10% higher in 2023 than it is today.","Back to 2019, with GDP growth forecasted to be up 2.8% and total miles driven expected to be up 1.8% based on the Federal Highway Administration\u2019s 2019 outlook, we\u2019re excited about continued growth potential in the automotive aftermarket in 2019. Importantly, we\u2019re also confident in our ability to improve market share performance. We look forward to sharing our 2019 performance expectations with you in February.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Jeff for details on our financial performance and outlook for the remainder of the year.","Jeff Shepherd","Thanks, Tom, and good morning everyone. I\u2019m pleased to report further improvement in the execution across Advance which enabled our success in the third quarter, while building on our capabilities to ensure future success.","In the third quarter, our adjusted gross profit was $1 billion, an increase of 6.3% from the prior year quarter. On a rate basis, our adjusted gross profit margin of 44.3% improved by 86 basis points from the prior year quarter. Drivers of this improvement include product mix in addition to benefits from our inventory efforts over the past several quarters.","Historically, we looked at inventory at a localized level, which led to purchasing inventory in certain parts of our network despite having that inventory elsewhere in the network. This year we\u2019ve been far more disciplined in our approach to sourcing and utilizing on-hand inventory. In addition, we saw margin benefits from continued material cost optimization efforts, which positively impacted gross margin in Q3.","Consistent with prior quarters, these cost benefits were partially offset by both planned and unplanned supply chain expenses, which reduced our gross margin by 39 basis points. As expected, the two new distribution centers that opened last year raised our cost base in the quarter versus prior year and negatively impacted our margin. Additionally, we continue to see transportation and fuel cost inflation higher than the third quarter of 2017 and what was originally forecasted.","In terms of tariffs, we\u2019ve seen minimal impact related to the first two rounds that have gone into effect. Importantly, through successful actions, we\u2019ve been able to pass cost increases through price. We remain diligent in our effort working with our supplier partners to mitigate cost increases where possible. We\u2019re confident that in line with historical pricing trends, our industry will continue to pass along future tariffs or other inflationary cost increases through pricing actions.","Moving to SG&A, our adjusted SG&A was $814 million in the third quarter, an increase of $38 million year-over-year. As a percentage of net sales, our adjusted SG&A increased by 23 basis points to 35.8%. This was primarily due to higher bonus, as we discussed last quarter and increased medical expenses as a result of higher average dollars per claim, which negatively impacted our margin in the third quarter.","As Tom mentioned, we leverage customer service hours in the stores, offsetting some labor-related headwinds. Overall labor-related expenses negatively impacted our adjusted SG&A as a percentage of net sales by 41 basis points. We expect the bonus headwind will continue through the fourth quarter as our incentive compensation for both corporate and field teams was much lower last year.","Separately, while we\u2019re pleased with the topline results from cross-banner visibility, we have significant opportunities to reduce our end market and last mile delivery costs for these additional sales. It\u2019s far more important in the short-term to ensure we are utilizing this capability to satisfy the customer and get the right part, to the right place, at the right time.","As we move forward, we have plans to streamline these initiatives to remove excess costs. However, this negatively impacted our SG&A as a percentage of sales in Q3. We remain focused on ensuring the parts are delivered in a timely manner, while we work to optimize our last mile delivery costs over time.","SG&A headwinds were partially offset by lower insurance expenses, which improved by 37 basis points and we continue to focus on safety throughout Advance. Regarding adjusted operating income, we delivered adjusted operating income of $194 million in the quarter, a 12.5% improvement versus the prior year. Our adjusted operating margin increased 62 basis points to 8.5% in the quarter.","We remain steadfast in our approach to managing cash and delivering on our capital allocation priorities. Through the first three quarters of 2018, our operating cash flow increased $280 million to $682 million and free cash flow more than doubled to $576 million compared to the same period of 2017. Through our focus on cash flow and payment terms, our AP ratio increased over 72% in the third quarter.","I\u2019m pleased with our progress to date and confident we will deliver continued growth in these areas. As I discussed earlier, we have made significant progress in our inventory efforts and our ability to reposition inventory throughout our network and that is helping us say yes to the customer more often, and increase inventory turns.","With that said, we continue to focus on optimizing our inventory over the next several years, while improving the assortment across the enterprise. As discussed last quarter, given the higher demand environment and working to optimize existing inventory without disrupting the customer, we expect we will end the year with slightly increased inventory on a year-over-year basis.","Moving to capital investments, our CapEx spend in the quarter increased $4 million to $43 million compared to the prior year. In the quarter, our largest projects were related to IT, supply chain, and new Worldpac branches. In line with our financial priorities to invest in the business, maintain an investment grade rating, and returning capital shareholders, we previously announced our expectation to return $100 million to $200 million for our shareholders through share repurchases in the second half of 2018. During the third quarter, we were able to repurchase $120 million worth of Advance stock.","As Tom said earlier, we\u2019re pleased with the continued improvements in industry demand and operational improvement throughout the enterprise. We are confident we\u2019re taking the necessary actions to improve market share and deliver meaningful progress toward closing the competitive performance gap.","Based on our results in the first three quarters of 2018 and our expectation that current trends continue through the balance of the year, we\u2019re pleased to update our full year guidance expectations. We\u2019re increasing our net sales outlook from a range of $9.3 billion to $9.5 billion to a new range of $9.55 billion to $9.6 billion. Our comparable store sales guidance is also increasing from a range of flat to up 1.5% and is now expected to be up 2% to 2.5%.","In addition, we\u2019re raising the low end of our adjusted operating income margin by 10 basis points to 7.6%. While we remain disciplined in our approach to offset planned and unplanned cost headwinds, we also feel it\u2019s best to remain prudent in our expectations for the year in terms of our OI margin rate. Therefore, we\u2019re maintaining the high end of our previously provided adjusted operating income margin range at 7.8%.","As we said in our Q2 earnings call, the incremental sales we\u2019re driving in the back half enables us to invest in information technology, e-commerce and Worldpac branches in the fourth quarter to unlock longer-term growth and margin expansion. Due to adjustments in timing expectations coupled with our continued discipline around our capital expenditure process, we expect spending toward the lower end of our previously provided full year CapEx range.","In terms of free cash flow, we\u2019re pleased with the improvement in the first three quarters of 2018, and as a result, we\u2019re increasing our outlook from a minimum of $500 million for the full year to a range of $625 million to $675 million. I\u2019m pleased with the strength we have seen this year and I\u2019m confident the focus and discipline across Advance will enable further growth in the fourth quarter and beyond.","With that, let\u2019s open up to addressing your questions, operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Thank you. And our first question will come from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Your line is open.","Michael Lasser","Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. Jeff just mentioned that you are reinvesting some of the sales upside in the fourth quarter and that\u2019s not \u2013 and that\u2019s why your implied fourth quarter margins are where they are. Is it also due to some of the incentive comp as well and when can we expect to see a return on those investments? So just, provides us just the shape of how the margins are going to unfold for \u2013 from here because the consensus forecast for next year implies that margins take a sizable step up? Thank you.","Tom Greco","Hey, good morning, Michael. First of all, there is a couple of factors that are going to limit the margin upside in the fourth quarter. I think we\u2019ve talked about most of these, but the first one is higher than planned inflation in fuel and transportation. We\u2019ve also got the cross-banner visibility which is causing a couple of which is \u2013 those are some incremental costs associated with cross-banner visibility. Eventually we\u2019ll optimize those. You mentioned the incentive compensation.","And then finally, we\u2019re making some investments in the quarter to drive real long-term growth and margin expansion and very much in line with what we communicated previously, we\u2019re investing in marketing and e-commerce. As you know, we launched a new campaign in the third quarter; Think Ahead. Think Advance. It\u2019s off to a great start. We want to keep driving that messaging out there in terms of an omni-channel media campaign and we\u2019re investing in e-commerce fulfillment and engagement. So, really marketing e-commerce is a big area.","Secondly, in terms of technology, we\u2019re beginning to implement a number of large projects to really simplify the business and integrate it and you mentioned, when we expect the return, these are pretty exciting projects, which we are very confident are going to provide a return on investment. We\u2019re standing up work day in the first quarter, moving from multiple payroll systems to one. We kicked off our ERP to simplify our accounting processes across the company. And we\u2019re also investing in our store network. We\u2019re putting in a 4G network for the stores to really enable our team members to better serve the customers. So, some pretty exciting investments inside of technology and obviously once those are made, eventually they roll off and there\u2019s a very good return on those. And then finally, we talked about Worldpac branches in the fourth quarter as well.","So, in summary, we really like the top line momentum that we\u2019re having. We\u2019re encouraged with the fact that we\u2019re leveraging the costs that are going to be ongoing within our P&L, be that customer service hours in the store and other costs and we\u2019re very confident in the long-term margin opportunity we\u2019ve talked about in the past is available. But we have to make the right investments along the way and we\u2019ll take those costs out when we change the work and improve the efficiency throughout the organization.","Michael Lasser","And Tom, if I could just tie together some of the things you\u2019ve said, A; you pointed out that you think the industry environment heading into next year will be favorable, and B; you\u2019re experiencing some transitional costs this year for things like incentive comp and some of the investment, plus you\u2019re going to experience some savings as you consolidate your distribution centers. So just directionally, next year should be back that your margin should inflect higher?","Tom Greco","We definitely expect to expand margins next year and we\u2019ll update you in February post our call.","Michael Lasser","Thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Bret Jordan","Hey, good morning guys.","Tom Greco","Good morning, Bret.","Bret Jordan","And I guess, looking at the AP to inventory, little over 72%; where do you think, now that you sort of had a little bit more time to look at it, you think you can take that number to?","Jeff Shepherd","Well, as we\u2019ve said, Bret, in the past, we think over time we can get it into the low-to-mid 90%s. We\u2019ve got a lot of upside potential there, as you\u2019re seeing throughout the quarter and we think that\u2019s going to continue to unlock as we solve for the inventory and looking at it at an enterprise level and really getting it to flow through as the negotiations continue with our vendors, and we get the right terms in place for the payment of the payables. That\u2019s all beginning to unlock. It\u2019s something that takes time. We\u2019ve talked about lapping existing terms. We\u2019ve talked about the existing inventory flowing through, but we\u2019re seeing those unlock. You\u2019re seeing it here in the first three quarters of 2018. We\u2019re very confident that\u2019s going to continue into the future.","Bret Jordan","Okay. And then one question on the walmart.com relationship, could you talk about the breadth of inventory that you\u2019re going to be showing through the Walmart website? I mean obviously you\u2019re not going to have commodity overlapping, but maybe a perspective number of SKUs that you may be offering there?","Tom Greco","Yes, we\u2019re not disclosing that Bret, but we\u2019re pretty excited about the Walmart partnership. I mean, we\u2019ve always built out our value proposition here to compete on availability, speed and convenience, trusted advice. So essentially, this gives us an opportunity to extend that value proposition to many more customers. And in terms of your direct question on the assortment piece, people can obviously go on walmart.com and view products that they can have shipped to home or potentially pickup in an Advance store and have many more fulfillment options they have today on walmart.com. So in terms of the specific assortment, we\u2019re not breaking that out, but we\u2019re pretty excited about the partnership and we\u2019re working through our plans right now.","Bret Jordan","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Horvers with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Chris Horvers","Thanks, good morning guys.","Jeff Shepherd","Good morning.","Tom Greco","Good morning.","Chris Horvers","The EBITDA is starting to grow nicely here. I think we\u2019re projecting over $900 million of cash at the end of the year here with the inventory and the AP to inventory. So can you talk about how you\u2019re thinking about deploying that cash? I know you said a $100 million to $200 million here for the back half of the year. You got $120 million done. Is there an opportunity to take that buyback higher and then how do you think about long term, what are your views around unlocking the balance sheet?","Jeff Shepherd","Yes. Overall, our capital allocation priorities haven\u2019t changed. We want to maintain that investment grade rating, reinvest in high quality projects in the business. Tom mentioned a few of those that we\u2019re \u2013 we\u2019ve already launched and we\u2019re focusing on right now. There\u2019s certainly more work to do there, and then returning excess cash to shareholders. So those \u2013 those haven\u2019t changed. We\u2019re not changing anything in terms of our buyback. We\u2019re still in that the range of $100 million to $200 million. As we go into 2019, as Tom said, we\u2019ll have the AOP for you in February and then we\u2019ll talk about a little bit into the future more post that earnings call.","Chris Horvers","Understood. And then, is there \u2013 I guess as a follow-up to that, is there a certain level of sort of minimum cash that you\u2019re targeting internally and if I look back historically, it\u2019s sort of like \u2013 the cash is low at sort of $60 million, $60 million to $100 million. Is that a good guide as you look out to the future because it\u2019s not like this \u2013 the base of the business has grown all that much since then?","Jeff Shepherd","Yes, that\u2019s a decent guide. I think we\u2019ve got some opportunities with the cash that we have on hand. Like I said though, we\u2019re going to be very disciplined in how we approach this. We\u2019ve had a very significant change in how we do our capital allocation, specifically around CapEx. Very formalized committee, we look at the role of every single project. We\u2019re making sure we\u2019re getting the right return for our shareholders.","Chris Horvers","Understood. And then, the last question is, maybe some early thoughts from Reuben in terms of, now that he\u2019s had a little bit of time looking at the supply chain \u2013 looking at supply chain plans; any thoughts around sort of the assets that you hold from a buildings perspective versus the technology enablers that you need to unlock the long-term margin story?","Tom Greco","Sure. Well, first of all, Reuben has really been an exciting addition to the team. He is bringing a completely new dimension to our thinking. not just within supply chain, but much more broadly given his substantial omni-channel experience with Walgreens, previously. I think the first priority is the one that we know is a big opportunity here, which is to dramatically improve the execution within our supply chain. And we\u2019re talking about basic blocking and tackling here, Chris. I think we\u2019ve made a lot of progress on the store front, improving units per transaction, scheduling on the weekend, improving our close rate. I don\u2019t think the supply chain has come along as quickly and he certainly has jumped in with that perspective as well. So he\u2019s very focused on improving basic execution in the supply chain.","As it pertains to the longer-term supply chain agenda, he was intimately involved in that agenda and the construction of it. So he is very familiar with the DC optimization, that\u2019s going on, the store optimization, the end market optimization. He\u2019s very aligned with that. I think the one thing that you\u2019ll see an elevation on is the execution metrics within the supply chain. But, no student body left or anything like that, but just an elevated focus on execution and continuing to help us think through how to take full advantage of the big asset \u2013 the significant asset base that we have and leveraging them better.","Chris Horvers","Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Seth Sigman with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Seth Sigman","Thanks, good morning guys, nice quarter. My question is primarily on the gross margin. Obviously it was a little bit better than we expected and it\u2019s ahead of the second quarter trend. You discussed some of the headwinds including supply chain, but results do seem to imply a pretty significant acceleration in some of the positive offsets. So, I\u2019m just wondering, any more color on the components that may have driven that acceleration in those positive offsets? Thanks.","Jeff Shepherd","Yes, sure. Let me just kind of walk through it and just give you some color in addition to the supply chain that you mentioned and that we talked about in our prepared remarks. Yes, we did have some additional headwinds in commodities and tariffs. Now tariffs were pretty immaterial in the quarter, but just grouping those together, those were completely offset by MCO and pricing actions. So we were able to cover those inflationary headwinds through those actions.","In addition, we had continued productivity efforts around shrink, defective, and slow-moving inventory; and these are really the catalyst for the improvement in our GM rate expansion. So managing the shrink, managing the effective process which is something we\u2019ve been working on all year in addition to the slow moving, which is really the result of looking at our inventory at a more macro level. So those are the primary drivers of our gross margin expansion, and we think we can continue to build on that. And we also had positive product mix as well. So the combination of all those are really the drivers.","Seth Sigman","Okay, great. And then specifically on the supply chain side, I think you are lapping some higher cost from last year. I realize there are external pressures that may be new. But just, how are you thinking about that as you move into the fourth quarter and into 2019?","Tom Greco","Sure. So you\u2019re right. As it relates specifically to supply chain, we are still lapping the start-up of the Nashville and Houston distribution centers. And that was about half, actually the majority was the inflationary pressures that we just saw in transportation and fuel costs. So that was the big driver. We\u2019re still going to see some of that start-up cost in the fourth quarter, that\u2019s going to start to diminish here in the fourth quarter and then we should essentially fully lap it starting in 2019. So I think that\u2019s the way you can kind of think through that.","Seth Sigman","Great, thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Simeon Gutman","Good morning. Tom, my first question, on third quarter, if you can isolate markets where maybe the weather helped more than others? Curious to get your opinion, how much of the improvement was the backdrop demand getting better versus some of the internal changes you mentioned, I think the assortment helping as well?","Tom Greco","Sure. Well, first of all, we feel great about both the industry performance in the quarter and our competitive progress. So, if you think about the industry, we would put that number at about a 150 basis points to 200 basis points depending how you look at it, Simeon. I mean you\u2019ve got growing GDP, reduced unemployment, and really exciting for the automotive aftermarket, you\u2019ve got an improving year-over-year trend in terms of vehicles in the sweet spot.","And as I said in my prepared remarks, that\u2019s a trend that\u2019s going to keep ongoing. In fact the vehicles seven years and older are expected to grow for the next five years in a row and having declined for the previous three years. So that\u2019s a pretty big swing and bodes well for the future for the entire industry. I think, I would also attribute some of our improvement in the quarter to the geographic footprint we have. I would say we disproportionately suffered last year by having stores in the Northeast and the North Central part of the country. I think this year we disproportionately benefited. So call like zero to 50, I think somewhere around 200 basis points, you\u2019d say is kind of industry plus geographic footprint.","We improved about 400 points versus the year ago performance in 2017 on a year-to-date basis. So a 400 point improvement is compared to the industry at 200 basis points, so I would call the \u2013 our improvement around 200 points attributable to the initiatives we have out there. And that would include things like cross-banner visibility in professional and accelerating trends in our DIY business, driven by better execution in the stores and our omni-channel effort. So bottom line, we\u2019re really pleased with the improvement in the industry. We\u2019re excited about next year and also the competitive progress that we\u2019re making. So both of those were factors and I think we split them about equally.","Simeon Gutman","Okay. And on margins, you are making progress against the gap versus your peers. Can you assess what you think \u2013 again, what\u2019s the biggest opportunity within the gap? Is it too many touches of product, too much fixed cost and is the \u2013 answer that you have today, is it any different than when you looked at this 1.5 years, two years ago?","Tom Greco","Yes, it really isn\u2019t. I mean I think, first of all, we absolutely believe we can achieve the long-term margin goals that we\u2019ve set. We\u2019re finalizing our strategic plan right now. We shared an update with our board recently. If you consider our margin of \u2013 2017 of 7.3% and you compare it to our primary competitors year-end margins in 2017, we think about 60% to 70% of that absolute gap is addressable with the balance being structural.","So we\u2019ve got a couple of areas that we\u2019re very focused on. There is four key areas. We\u2019ve got work streams against each one of those work streams, and we\u2019re really fine-tuning the choices that we have to make to really balance the addressable margin expansion opportunities with the equally large share growth opportunities that we have. So, very excited about our ability to drive shareholder value through a combination of topline growth, market \u2013 sorry, margin expansion, and free cash flow improvement. So, we think we can do both of those, gain share and expand margins with the balance ramp up over time.","Simeon Gutman","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with RBC. Your line is open.","Scot Ciccarelli","Good morning, guys, Scot Ciccarelli.","Tom Greco","Hey, Scot.","Scot Ciccarelli","Good, hi. Clearly you guys have made a lot of changes to the business. I\u2019m sure there is some difficulty in trying to isolate, but it can be coincidental, Tom, that comp trends have started to improve pretty meaningfully since you rolled out cross-banner visibility. So, I was wondering if you might be able to help quantify, specifically, what the topline impact has been from cross-banner visibility. And then related to that, how much of a margin drag that has been, even though you\u2019re trying to optimize it. Obviously it\u2019s not optimized at this stage. Thanks.","Tom Greco","Yes, I\u2019ll give you a perspective on the second part of your question, then I\u2019ll flip it over to Bob to talk about how cross-banner is impacting the topline. On the margin drag, for sure, we knew that as we roll this out, we were going to have to deliver parts to places that hadn\u2019t been planned before and we want to make sure that we know what the implications of cross-banner are before we start turning our system inside out to start optimizing.","And so we\u2019ve got a better idea of what that looks like now, Scot, and we\u2019re starting to look at each DMA because the impact of cross-banner varies pretty widely across the country, based on the penetration that we have, our store density, the prevalence of Worldpac, and we will absolutely optimize that overtime. So I\u2019ll flip it over to Bob, and he can talk about how it\u2019s impacting the topline.","Bob Cushing","Thanks. So, certainly from the cross-banner visibility in all markets, saying yes to our customers certainly with our industry-leading portfolio of brands, again, that ties right into the other technology that we\u2019ve developed as you know, Advance Pro, what we\u2019re seeing there, of course, this is our new B2B platform. We\u2019re seeing higher transaction rates, higher order value, higher conversion and that\u2019s basically the result of also not only the technology and futures benefits in there, but certainly on the cross-banner side.","But we\u2019re seeing tremendous increase from the standpoint of our customer\u2019s adoption of it and of course, importantly, most recently, when we look at MyAdvance, the new single sign-on portal that we put out there. Again, the ease of doing business; has full access to cross-banner across all banners. So, from our vantage point, cross-banner basically is informing us on the assortment side of it and we\u2019re building that assortment strategy down to the market by market at the store level, which is also, again, driving more cross-banner access. So, overall, we\u2019re seeing tremendous amount of improvement and basically saying yes to our customer, day in and day out; and there\u2019s more to come on that.","Tom Greco","Yes, one additional \u2013 I\u2019ll add here, Scot, that your question raises every single banner inside the Company grew in the quarter and so I think they\u2019re all benefiting. So you think about Advance Stores, Carquest stores, Worldpac, Autopart International, our Independent\u2019s had a great quarter. So every banner has access to cross-banner now and it\u2019s really helping us leverage the breadth of our assortment across the enterprise.","Scot Ciccarelli","And again, I know it\u2019s not exact science, but is there a way to kind of put a number on the impact that it\u2019s had?","Tom Greco","Well, again, we spoke to about 200 points. We believe our initiatives are driving progress. We also believe our DIY omni-channel efforts are giving us incremental growth. So, we had kind of an evenly split improvement year-on-year in those \u2013 between DIY and Pro. So I mean you can do the math. I mean we\u2019ve got a number on cross-banner, it\u2019s a significant number, and you\u2019re right, it has been a big impetus to our improvement. So you can do the math of the 200 basis points that\u2019s attributable to our own performance.","Scot Ciccarelli","Got it, thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kate McShane with Citi. Your line is open.","Kate McShane","Hi, thanks for taking my question. My questions go back to the supply chain as well. We just wondered if you could walk us through what you are seeing with the store rationalization, what are some of the metrics of the stores that have been closed and how much you think it\u2019s impacting margins?","Tom Greco","Sure. Good question, Kate. We\u2019ve been really excited about the improvement we\u2019re making there. We were 81 stores, right \u2013 we\u2019re up to about 81 stores on a year-to-date basis that we\u2019ve closed. We\u2019re measuring very carefully that obviously the transfer of sales, I mean that\u2019s the big question, right, we\u2019ve got a lot of stores, I think about 400 plus that are within a 1.5 mile of each other.","And when we close a store, we obviously don\u2019t want to lose the sales, we just want to transfer the sales to one of the other Advance banners. And to the earlier question, cross-banner is helping us with that because Worldpac plays a role and obviously the other Advance and Carquest stores play a role in essentially capturing the sales that that store that was closed had previously.","So, we measure the sales transfer. Obviously, the sales transfer on Professional is easier to get after than the sales transfer on DIY, although through omni-channel efforts, we can get at the DIY sales also. And then the other thing that we measure is the employees and we make sure that we are able to retain the very best parts, people that we can when we make that change.","So we feel really good about the improvement we\u2019ve made in our team. We\u2019re seeing turnover levels stabilize. They are down significantly from where they were two years ago. So when we close a store, we don\u2019t want to lose the key people that have a connection with our customers in that store, and we\u2019ve done a much better job retaining those employees than we did in the past.","And then the third thing is the lease obligation. We want to make sure we minimize any costs in closing down the store where there might be an outstanding lease obligation. But each of those three metrics is very positive and we feel very good about our ability to drive cash flow with this initiative over time. So those are the key things we look at.","Kate McShane","That\u2019s helpful. And then, if I could just ask a follow-up question, do you have \u2013 is there a way to quantify what you think that transfer rate is at this time?","Tom Greco","Yes, we don\u2019t break that out, but we\u2019re definitely exceeding the levels that we had planned and we\u2019re far above what we\u2019d had in the past. We want to make sure that we\u2019re looking at stores where we can actually transfer the sales. I mean if you\u2019re talking about \u2013 think about a store that\u2019s in rural America where we may not have a store within 10 miles of it. We\u2019ve kind of learned from experience at closing that store, we can\u2019t expect those sales to show up and you know for the home team.","So we\u2019re making sure that when we close a store, it is transferable and we measure the cash flow outlook for that area, not just for the store, for that area over the next several years to make sure that we\u2019re very much cash flow positive, because as we reduce the cost in that area, less rent, less in-store costs, less inventory, all of those things, we\u2019re still driving cash flow and that\u2019s the metric we look at to make the decision to close or not.","Kate McShane","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt McClintock with Barclays. Your line is open.","Matt McClintock","Hi, Yes, good morning everyone.","Tom Greco","Good morning.","Matt McClintock","I have two quick ones and then I\u2019ll let you go. The first one is just, on Walmart, can you kind of give me an idea of the customer overlap between advance.com and walmart.com for DIY. And I\u2019m just trying to understand why a customer would shop Walmart versus Advance. Is that entirely incremental or new \u2013 new customer. Thanks.","Tom Greco","Sure. First of all, the consumer profile for the Walmart shopper and the Advance DIY customer is extremely similar. So they are right on top of each other Matt, so that was obviously some work we had done. We looked at different alternatives with respect to building a strategic partnership where our set of skills and assets could be complementary to someone else. And with Walmart having a substantial omni-channel effort out there, the most retail traffic in the nation, all of those things boded very well.","We absolutely believe there is incremental sales out there for us. You think about a 100 million people coming to that website every four weeks at Walmart. We have not disclosed how many people come to our website every four weeks but it is under a 100 million. So there is going to be some people that go to that Walmart website that have not come to the Advance website and Walmart has been a terrific partner on this.","We\u2019re going to have an Advance store-within-a-store on their website. We think it helps build our brand and awareness. And it really helps Walmart with some category expertise that we believe that together, we can drive a lot of \u2013 a lot of incremental sales with. So very excited about the partnership and very much aligned consumer lap \u2013 overlap rather, sorry.","Matt McClintock","Thanks for that Tom. And then my second question is, you did a great job of explaining the macro underpinnings \u2013 the positive macro underpinnings for the \u2013 for the industry over the next couple of years, and clearly you\u2019ve taken market share this year, which was pretty impressive. I\u2019m just wondering with the pull forward of some of those investments that you\u2019re talking about, launching a new marketing campaign, et cetera, are you starting to put your foot down on the pedal in terms of being more aggressive with going after market share. Thanks.","Tom Greco","Well, we definitely feel much better about the customer experience when they come into our store. As they say, you don\u2019t invite somebody over for dinner at your house unless it\u2019s all clean and in a great spot and we wanted to make sure we were executing well and I will tell you that our field team is executing better than they ever have. We had to restructure last year, as you know. WE went to two divisions and 12 regions. We\u2019ve got a terrific group of leaders out there. They are now entering their second year. They are very disciplined in their approach to drive the business.","So now, when a customer comes into our store, they\u2019re going to have a much better experience than they had a year ago. We\u2019re seeing that in metrics like net promoter score, in the number of times we greet our customers, all of the things that we measure on our mystery shop profile are much better. So you feel good about putting advertising on the air to invite people in. So I think that\u2019s the difference. So to that extent, we are going to invest in our omni-channel media efforts, because we believe we\u2019ve got a great proposition for our customers to come and visit us for.","Matt McClintock","Appreciate the color. Best of luck.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dan Wewer with Raymond James. Your line is open.","Dan Wewer","Thanks. Tom, you had mentioned there is still 400 Advance and Carquest stores that are within 1.5 mile of each other, what is your best estimate on those 400, how many can be consolidated? And then also, curious, with the decision to resume the share buybacks, how do you balance that against the opportunities to start opening new stores, particularly out West, where you probably need more stores?","Tom Greco","Yes. Well, first of all, Dan, we definitely will continue to optimize the footprint. I mean if you \u2013 if you guys know the average sales per store that we have, if you contrast that to our primary competitors, they do a much better job on average sales per store. So part of that is, we\u2019ve got what you just described, stores that are really competing with each other for sales and where we see that, as I mentioned earlier, we\u2019re going to continue to optimize our footprint.","As we constructed our five-year plan, we looked out over five years in every DMA in the country. And as we do that, you\u2019re considering a whole bunch of variables, but the net of it is, when you\u2019ve got a given market, you figure out how are you going to grow the business in that market and how are you going to optimize your cost in that market and because our footprint is somewhat varied, to your question about the West, across the country, our approach to each of these markets is going to be different.","And so where we\u2019ve got a very concentrated footprint, a lot of density, that\u2019s where you\u2019ll see some of the optimization efforts that you asked about and where we\u2019ve got a lack of a footprint, which as you\u2019ve mentioned in the west, we are much less penetrated. We\u2019re going to take a very different approach to those markets.","So we are opening Worldpac branches, as we mentioned. We\u2019re making sure that we are going to be consistently, reliably, driving comp sales with the stores we have first and where we have markets that are demonstrating that consistently, reliably, predictably, we will look at, at some openings. But the bulk of our investment at this stage is in the \u2013 our CapEx investment is in e-commerce and in technology.","And where we have opportunities to expand our footprint, we will. But I think, you see a different CapEx profile from us than you\u2019ve seen in the past where we were opening DCs and stores throughout the country. We\u2019ve shifted that profile and dramatically stepped up our investment on e-commerce and technology and we believe it\u2019s paying off.","Dan Wewer","And then, just a quick question about supply chain changes going forward, not to geek out this too much, but when you look at the three facilities that you\u2019re closing in Texas, South Carolina, and Mississippi, will the Carquest and Advance stores in those territories, base now supplied by a common facility?","Tom Greco","Well, first of all, we\u2019re pretty excited. Our new Chief Technology Officer has come in and really helped accelerate a lot of the tech plans that we have inside the Company. And obviously, cross-banner replenishment is a big opportunity for us.","I mean we\u2019re sitting here in Raleigh, North Carolina adjacent to a distribution center that today cannot ship to the Advance stores in this geography. Those stores actually source product from another so-called a red or Advance distribution center several hundred miles away.","So, we are building the capability to cross-banner replenish and of course that\u2019s going to take stem miles out and obviously improve the speed to get parts to our \u2013 to our stores. So that\u2019s an active project and we expect to deliver against that sometime in the latter half of 2019.","Dan Wewer","But these three facilities that you\u2019ve announced that you\u2019re closing, they\u2019re still just going be shipping to either an Advance or a Carquest banner, but not both?","Tom Greco","Well the three facilities we\u2019re closing are being closed. I want to make sure I understand your question.","Dan Wewer","Yeah, just curious as to which facilities are going to pick the slack?","Tom Greco","Okay. Yes, well today, because the ones we don\u2019t have cross-banner replenishment capability, we have to essentially point the stores at another comparable distribution center. So in the case of Gallman, Mississippi, which was an Advance DC, we had to point the stores at Houston and Nashville, which are also Advance DCs. In the future, as we optimize the DC footprint, we\u2019ll have the ability to do a much more effective design in terms of how do we optimize the distribution center network and DC to store stem miles.","Dan Wewer","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Baker with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Mike Baker","Hi, can you guys hear me OK?","Tom Greco","We can hear you, Mike. Yes.","Mike Baker","Great. I wanted to ask you, you\u2019ve said you have confidence in the fourth quarter that you continue the current trends. Is that in reference to the trends in the third quarter or year-to-date? And I guess even more fine, can you give us any color on how the third quarter progressed by period?","Tom Greco","Yes, the third quarter was fairly evenly distributed, Mike. We are very excited about the way it started and we\u2019re excited about the way it finished. So I mean it was a pretty strong quarter across the board, and again, as I mentioned in all of the banners. And we are pleased with the way Q4 has started out. So we\u2019re obviously not giving specific numbers on the fourth quarter. We gave you a formulary number and that implies a number, but we think the sales number that we have in the fourth quarter is one we can achieve.","Mike Baker","And to follow-up on that, you had said that the operating income or operating margin \u2013 implied operating margin guidance for the fourth quarter was prudent, in your words. Would you say that the same-store sales expectation is similarly prudent?","Tom Greco","Yes.","Mike Baker","Okay, I appreciate the color. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Greg Melich with MoffettNathanson. Your line is open.","Greg Melich","Hi, thanks guys, and congrats on the quarter. I do want to follow up on the improvement, Tom, you laid it out nicely. What was the breakdown of traffic on that? In other words, if we did a 4.3% comp, was traffic positive or transaction counts. And then, I had a follow-up on the transformation actions.","Tom Greco","Sure, Greg. So on transactions, Bob did a great job describing earlier, we saw a nice uptick in transactions on the Pro side and we also saw average ticket up on the Pro side. So a lot of the good work, Mike Broderick has been doing with the category teams, the merchant teams has really helped us on really both sides of the business, but we are seeing growth in some categories that we haven\u2019t seen growth in for quite some time. And that is helping us on the transaction front, but both of them improved on Pro.","On DIY, we measure DIY omni-channel, so we measure transactions across both e-commerce and retail. We obviously saw an improvement in our retail transactions and our online transactions continue to be up significantly. Our online business has continued to flourish. If you look back at some of the published reports on omni-channel, you\u2019ll see that the three months ending September 30, our online traffic was up 82%, which was right at the very top of 40 retail companies.","So obviously that\u2019s translating to incremental transactions and in terms of our DIY online business. Average ticket was up pretty significantly in DIY, partly because the online business is growing faster than the retail business. But overall, we\u2019re very pleased with both transactions and tickets in the quarter.","Greg Melich","And so, just to make sure I clear that. For the whole company, transaction counts were up, but they were up in Pro more than in DIY. And they might have still been down a little bit, if you look at it holistically. Is that a fair?","Tom Greco","Yes, overall up, DIY\u2026","Greg Melich","Right. Overall up, DIY much better than \u2013 DIY worse than Pro which really improved a lot.","Tom Greco","That\u2019s right, yes, DIY retail was the one.","Greg Melich","Yes, DIY retail.","Tom Greco","Yes, yes.","Greg Melich","Yes, got it. Okay. And then second was on transformation costs, just because I know \u2013 thank you for continuing to break those out, it looks like they\u2019re running around a $100 million a year, if you take out the amortization. One, just want to make sure that I\u2019m thinking about that correctly and assuming those \u2013 you\u2019ve mentioned that they\u2019ll go on still for some years, should we think of this year\u2019s transformation costs as a above trend or that $100 million a year should start to fade, and when should we expect that?","Jeff Shepherd","Yes. No, I think, for the year, you\u2019re right. We gave you a range of $140 million to $180 million and we do think we\u2019re going to come in to the low end of that range. So if you back out the amortization which is about $40 million, we would be trending at about $100 million for the year. We think over time that\u2019s going to diminish. It\u2019s going to take some time to do that. But we think on a year-over-year basis, we\u2019re going to start to see reductions in that $100 million.","Greg Melich","Got it. Thanks a lot. Good luck guys.","Tom Greco","Thanks, Greg.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Elizabeth Suzuki with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Jason Haas","Hi, this is Jason Haas on for Liz Suzuki, thank you for taking my question. I was curious if you could provide any color on how the economics of the Walmart partnership would work?","Tom Greco","Yes, we\u2019re not breaking that out Jason. And again, we\u2019re pretty excited about what we\u2019re going to be doing with Walmart. It\u2019s a pretty unique partnership, but we\u2019re not going to break out the economics.","Jason Haas","Okay. And then, any color on when that would come in? I know you said the first half of 2019, but \u2013 yes, just any more color in terms of the timing on that?","Tom Greco","Sure. It\u2019s a phased approach. I mean this is one of those things that there is \u2013 some parts of it are easier than other and I\u2019m not going to get into the specifics of the Gantt chart, if you will. But I can tell you that we\u2019ll be rolling out in the first half of the year with part of what we\u2019re going to be doing with them. Other parts of it have to be tested and validated. We have to make sure that we\u2019re delighting the customer.","The beautiful thing about the arrangement with Walmart is both of us are very focused on the customer experience and we want to make sure that our customers and the customer \u2013 Walmart\u2019s customers are really excited about what we have to offer. So as we roll out the parts that are a little more complicated and have a little bit of complexity to them that we\u2019re validating that that proposition is absolutely where it needs to be before we scale it. So you\u2019ll see part of it rollout in the front half of 2019. It is a multi-year partnership, so we want to make sure, we get it right. So that\u2019s the answer.","Jason Haas","Great, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.","Brian Nagel","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question, nice quarter.","Tom Greco","Thank you.","Brian Nagel","So I also wanted to ask quickly on Walmart, I mean recognizing it\u2019s early and I know you\u2019re not providing a lot of details this point, but any initial thoughts on pricing between what you do in your stores, on your website, and what will be done on Walmart? And then the second question, does this relationship with \u2013 that you have with Walmart now, does it at all impact your plans for your own site? I mean does it just replace your own site or is this simply an addition to what you\u2019re already doing online?","Tom Greco","Well, first of all, Brian, we see this as an opportunity to extend the fundamental DIY value proposition we have to more customers. And our value proposition has always been the best parts in the industry, the best assortment in the industry, speed and convenience, you think about pulling into an Advance store, you can get in and out of an Advance store, we have free services, we\u2019ll charge your battery, we\u2019ll change your windshield wipers for free. We have a number of speed-related and convenience-related benefits we offer to customers.","And then trusted advice, I mean we\u2019re investing in the training of our people. Bob\u2019s really done a lot of work with Mike Broderick on the Carquest Technical Institute and how we train, not just our own team members, but our customers. So it\u2019s an extension of that value proposition to Walmart.","In terms of pricing, we control our pricing. So we\u2019re going to offer a price, and we are able to get the sale on the Walmart \u2013 through the Walmart website, we\u2019ll get the sale, if we don\u2019t, we don\u2019t. But it is an arrangement where we control our own pricing for the website. As it pertains to our own site and our own online experience, we\u2019re doubling down on our own site.","We\u2019ve made tremendous progress. We meet literally every week on that topic and we\u2019re strengthening every aspect of our online experience and we\u2019re going to continue to do that aggressively. We believe it\u2019s extremely important to the long-term success of the Company, and the fact that we partner with Walmart has \u2013 there is really no impact on the fact that \u2013 and what we\u2019re doing with our own site other than we\u2019re going to continue to strengthen it. And we\u2019re going to learn from Walmart in terms of how to strengthen it better than we have in the past. So there\u2019s no plans to slow anything down on our own website, if anything, we\u2019re actually accelerating it.","Brian Nagel","Got it, that\u2019s very helpful. And then, if I could just follow-up with another kind of bigger picture question. Clearly your results have accelerated a lot, that has to do with internal initiatives, which you\u2019ve also highlighted an improving demand backdrop. Your competitors have done the same.","As you look at data, as you look at the \u2013 sort of say the \u2013 I guess the buying patterns of your customers, whether they\u2019d be DIY or commercial, is \u2013 are there signals that what\u2019s happening now is truly a resurgence in demand or is there \u2013 is there a pent-up aspect to it, just given we had several quarters of weaker trends, whether that\u2019d be due to weather or just some of the car park issues?","Tom Greco","Yes, I\u2019ll let Mike Broderick speak to that a little bit, I think that there is no question that vehicles in the sweet spot is a driver of demand. I mean we\u2019ve stepped back and look over really the last 16 years on what are the things that correlate to demand the most? It\u2019s GDP, well the GDPs improving, that\u2019s great news.","It\u2019s the car park, well we expect the car park to improve. It\u2019s vehicle miles driven, that\u2019s been improving up above 1%. The one that has swung, to your question, is this vehicles in the sweet spot, that was declining. Now it\u2019s starting to turn. We knew that turn was coming and it\u2019s going to turn for the next five years in a row.","We think the vehicles seven years and over, which is obviously where you have high levels of repairs, the cars are off warranty, those vehicles are going to need to be repaired and that vehicle population is going to be up 10% five years from now. So the unit growth in vehicles in the sweet spot is a significant driver of demand. Mike, do you want to add?","Mike Broderick","No that\u2019s a \u2013 you\u2019ve said a lot. But if you go deeper into the categories, we looked at discretionary and non-discretionary categories and they\u2019re both up, which actually really bodes well for our industry as well as Advance Auto Parts, and that\u2019s kind of how we focus. We want both a very balanced approach across all four channels and we\u2019re literally looking at it by category to make sure that we\u2019re getting our fair share of the growth.","Brian Nagel","Thank you. Nice quarter again.","Jeff Shepherd","Thanks.","Tom Greco","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Bottiglieri with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.","Chris Bottiglieri","Hi, thanks for taking the question. Just hoping to dimensionalize DIY comps, I know you kind of looked at this earlier, but if we take that 100 basis point benefit seems to imply little less than half your sales, that\u2019s two points of growth to DIY specifically. So I guess my question is, if you exclude the online sales, are the non-online DIY comp still positive at this point?","Tom Greco","Yes.","Chris Bottiglieri","They are? Okay, and then, is there a way to frame the online opportunity from here? I guess, putting aside the Walmart arrangement, when you lap this level of online traffic growth, do you think there\u2019s another leg up? Like, how are you thinking about this long-term?","Tom Greco","We definitely see a leg up Chris, I mean we\u2019re seeing a significant growth in online and across the universe right. But within our own category, we\u2019ve got a number that we see that the size of the category will be five years out. We feel we can continue to drive not just the ship-to-home business, but the buy online pickup and store business where we can really leverage our asset base as others are doing.","So we\u2019re really investing in online capabilities, both desktop and mobile, making sure our team members are engaged. We do compensate our team members for online business, so they\u2019re excited about building a relationship with the customer. We\u2019re strengthening our loyalty program, which has implications for online. So there\u2019s a whole bunch of elements that are coming together as we build out our customer experience. But I think over 70% now, it keeps going up by the way, of the transactions that we have within DIY start with online, Okay.","Whether that\u2019s a search \u2013 a mobile search for a part or some type of search for a store or something like that and we see that continuing to go up. So it\u2019s not just about, hey, I want somebody to buy something online. We want to strengthen the online experience overall because we also believe that that halos over to our retail in-store experience.","Chris Bottiglieri","Got you. And then, as you think about kind of the productivity in store, how do you kind of \u2013 what are some the efforts you\u2019re doing to maybe optimize labor as more of this, I guess, more of the transactional element shifts online?","Tom Greco","Well, we\u2019re obviously very focused on that. I mean, everyone is talking about wage inflation and certainly we\u2019re seeing that across our business whether it\u2019s in our stores or our distribution centers, for that matter. But we have, I guess, a bit of a different starting point, Chris. I think we have much more opportunity to improve. I think our field leaders have done a much better job managing full time\/part time mix, which is a key driver of that cost per hour, if you will, so that\u2019s an active project.","We\u2019ve done a lot of work on ABC costing, up and down the store in terms of what does each piece of our in-store environment, what is it costing us to do everything in there and how do we change the work, so to speak, to improve the cost profile of the store. As you see more orders coming in online in terms of DIY that obviously can save time, instead of having to engage with a customer for 10 or 15 minutes to the extent that we\u2019ve got a very strong platform online, that gives the customer the education they need and the information they need to make decisions, some of them just want to come in and out.","So, I mean we\u2019re routinizing that buy online pickup in-store experience with our store team members, making it very easy for the customer to come in and get their part and leave. So that part \u2013 those things are natural tailwind, similarly on the professional side, as Bob builds out our MyAdvance, he talked about it earlier, more and more customer shifting to buy online off of MyAdvance our Advance Pro, now they\u2019re no longer speaking to someone on the phone as they do \u2013 many of them do today and we\u2019re seeing that tick up each week. So to the extent that you really build an omni-channel experience that is world-class for your customers, it actually can help you with the labor cost over time.","Chris Bottiglieri","Makes a lot sense. Thanks for the help.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities. Your line is open.","Seth Basham","Thanks a lot and good morning. My first question is on e-commerce as well, you mentioned some fulfillment engagement investments that might weigh on operating margins in the fourth quarter. Can you provide a little bit more color as to what you\u2019re investing in now relative to what you\u2019ve done year-to-date?","Tom Greco","Sure. I mean we want to make sure that we\u2019re optimized their stuff and I would just tell you we\u2019re not optimized. I mean we\u2019re not shipping from as many buildings as we will ultimately do. We\u2019ve got many buildings across the country. As you know, we\u2019ve got 50 million square feet of assets. And as Reuben has come in, we\u2019re essentially updating that fulfillment part of our agenda, how do we ship more efficiently? When we ship to home? How do we make it much more easy for the customer to access parts? And how do we make it easier for our team members to get parts on the buy online pickup at the store dimension?","So, honestly, there is a lot of work to be done there and a lot of opportunity for further optimization. But right now we\u2019re building the engagement part of it out pretty aggressively as you know and that\u2019s driven a lot of traffic to our website. We are not going to slow down that piece of it because it\u2019s costing us too much in the short term, because we know we can ultimately optimize those costs.","It\u2019s just a matter of some of the things that came up earlier, you know, being able to ship from more buildings, cross-banner replenishment, cross-banner visibility, all of those things will ultimately make it much more efficient for us to do what we have to do. But right now we\u2019re focused on delighting the customer and that\u2019s helping drive our top line.","Seth Basham","Got it. And would you say that in terms of the pressure on operating margins in the fourth quarter from these investments, will they be higher than they\u2019ve been in recent quarters?","Tom Greco","I think overall they\u2019re in line with where they were in absolute terms or not all that different. To be honest, we just have a \u2013 we have a lower top line number in the quarter and that, as a percent of sales, has an impact, right, but the absolute number is not that much. I will say that the technology investments attract OpEx right away that we\u2019re making. When we make a CapEx investment on the technology side, it attracts OpEx right out of the gate, and that\u2019s part of the headwind.","Seth Basham","Fair Enough. And my follow-up question is around tariffs. Can you remind us what the mix of COGS you have exposed to the Chinese tariffs is right now and how much you expect to be able to pass along in terms of price relative to other mitigation strategies from the tariffs, particularly as we see a 25% scenario unfold?","Mike Broderick","Seth, this Mike Broderick. Good morning. We are looking at 50-50 from a direct versus non-direct. So that\u2019s kind of the number we\u2019re looking at and obviously what we do to mitigate starts with the customer, we actually review all four channels, both Pro, DIY, e-com and our Independents, making sure that we\u2019re relevant, we actually then price match versus our traditional and non-traditional customers. The last thing that we do is actually put pricing to the market only if we have to.","Seth Basham","And that 50-50 direct indirect that\u2019s off of a percentage of COGS, total of \u2013 of what?","Mike Broderick","Yes. So, I would say that of our total COGS for the year, we\u2019re looking at about $4.5 million.","Seth Basham","Okay. Alright, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Imbro with Stephens, Inc. Your line is open.","Daniel Imbro","Yes. Thanks, good morning. Just had a few follow-ups on the e-commerce front, you guys mentioned that over half of your online sales are still picked up in the store, but ship to home is obviously growing? How do you think that trends over time? Do you think we see further shift toward ship to home or do you think longer term that the service levels in the store keep a majority of online orders being picked up in the store?","Tom Greco","First of all, we modeled ship to home to grow faster, that\u2019s what we expect. That said, that\u2019s at an aggregate level. As we start to market pickup today which is \u2013 which is a great benefit for the customer, rather than having to wait a day to have something shipped home, you can get to one of our stores in literally 30 minutes and pick-up the parts. So we\u2019re going to start to market that a little bit more, Daniel. We think our own performance can continue to improve on the buy online pickup in store, which we\u2019re going to brand pickup today. So that whole opportunity and improving the online experience from the mobile phone right into our stores is a big opportunity for Advance. But at the industry level, we would expect ship to home to grow faster.","Daniel Imbro","That\u2019s helpful. And then, a quick follow-up on the Walmart partnership. Specifically, how do you guys think about potential inventory impacts? To my understanding, customer could pick up at an AAP store or a Walmart store, but how do you plan on stocking that inventory? Will it be stocked at a Walmart or will you have to increase inventory on hand at a DC to fulfill those orders? Thanks.","Tom Greco","Well, we\u2019ve obviously got a lot to learn through this arrangement with Walmart, and as I said earlier, some things are easier to do than others. So again, we\u2019re going to make sure that we delight the customer with this. That\u2019s very important to the Walmart team, it\u2019s very important to us. So as we go through this, obviously pickup today, order at Advance, which is generated through the Walmart website is easier for us to manage. But keep in mind we\u2019ve got thousands of delivery vehicles.","So, our ability to essentially provide same-day service to Walmart stores, if they \u2013 the customer decides they want to pick it up at a Walmart stores, we can enable that. We just need to get that right, ensure that the operating procedures are standardized. But all of \u2013 the omni-channel experience that we\u2019re cultivating is all centered around the customer and making it easier for the customer. So we\u2019ve got to make sure when that customer has the experience they\u2019re absolutely thrilled with it.","Daniel Imbro","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. I\u2019m showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back to Tom Greco for closing remarks.","Tom Greco","Well, thanks again for joining us today. We\u2019re really pleased with the traction we gained in the quarter and we\u2019re confident in our ability to execute our strategic objectives going forward. I want to, once again, thank all of our dedicated team members and our independent partners, for their focus on operational excellence and passion for customer\u2019s every day. We remain disciplined in our approach to ensure we\u2019re implementing changes that enable the long-term success of Advance and deliver sustainable value and growth for our shareholders.","We still have a lot of work to do and we remain focused on capturing the opportunity ahead. Before I conclude, with the celebration of Veterans Day this week, we\u2019d like to express our sincere appreciation for all the members of our military for their service, including over 6,000 Advance team members. We\u2019re incredibly proud of the work we\u2019ve done at Advance in support of our veterans and we remain committed to continue support of organizations such as Building Homes for Heroes who help improve the lives of our brave service men and women throughout the country. We look forward to discussing our fourth quarter results and 2019 outlook with you in February.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude the program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day."],"804":["Advance Auto Parts (NYSE:AAP) Q3 2012 Earnings Call November  8, 2012 10:00 AM ET","Executives","Joshua Moore","Darren R.

[Operator Instructions]  And today's call is being recorded. Before we begin, Joshua Moore, Director of Finance and Investor Relations, will make a brief statement concerning forward-looking statements that will be made on this call.","Joshua Moore","Good morning, and thank you for joining us on today's call.

To be notified of the future dates of our earnings reports, you can sign up through the Investor Relations section of our website.","Finally, a replay of this call will be available on our website for 1 year. Now let me turn the call over to Darren Jackson, our President and Chief Executive Officer. Darren?","Darren R. Jackson","Thank you, Joshua. Good morning, everyone. Thanks, for joining us, and welcome to our third quarter conference call. Before I begin, I'd like to thank our 54,000 team members for their hard work and focus on delivering great customer service. Their determination provided us much-needed momentum during the quarter.","As you've seen in our earnings release and as we indicated in our prerelease last month, our business and industry continues to face weak consumer demand in both DIY and Commercial. Additionally, we continue to be impacted by varied geographic performance with softer sales performance in our cold weather markets. Consumers still face high gas prices, which increased $0.49 a gallon since July and averaged $3.73 a gallon during the quarter. We believe this volatility in higher fuel costs definitely played a role in consumer behavior and spending in the quarter.","As we stated in our second quarter call, we anticipated that the market would be challenging and that demand would continue to be weak. However, our focus has been to improve our sales trajectory in the face of near-term decelerating trends in our industry. As a result of these efforts, our comparable store sales accelerated nearly 100 basis points from the second quarter to the third. Our quarter-over-quarter improvement was principally driven by our Commercial Business, with accelerating comp sales growth each period during the quarter for our Advance stores.","Our Commercial business had improving trends in both transactions and ticket. Our third quarter transaction growth sequentially improved throughout the quarter. While our average ticket in Commercials still faced declines year-over-year, the decline was more moderate versus our second quarter. Similar to our second quarter, the average ticket decline was principally driven by a mix of products sold, namely, the impact of weaker maintenance category sales and higher promotions. Further impacting the average ticket has been lower inflation in some key seasonal categories, like AC in the absence of escalating oil prices.","From a geographical perspective, we continue to see weakness and volatility in our cold weather markets, especially in the Great Lakes and the Northeast regions. Our performance in those 2 markets continues to be impacted by the lingering effects of last year's warmer weather -- let's say, this year's warmer weather. Our comparable store sales declines continue to trail our total company average by several hundred basis points. However, we've seen our comps accelerate in the Northeast roughly 300 basis points from the second quarter and by nearly 130 basis points in the Great Lakes. This is very encouraging and is a testament to the will and determination of our teams operating in those areas.","We continue to post positive comps in our Western markets, where we only have 10% of our store base. Despite the improvements in our business during the quarter, our comp store sales decreased 1.8%. We believe that the industry will remain soft for the balance of the year. However, we believe we will continue to carry our momentum from the third quarter into Q4, provided we see a reasonable bounce back from the effects of Hurricane Sandy.","The improvements we've made in the second quarter came with a cost. Our result to work to deliver higher results than our trends suggested as we exited Q2 compelled us to increase the customer facing and traffic-driving elements in our business. This included increased labor and advertising expense, as well as more targeted promotions. Our increase in labor was focused on providing better service levels to our Commercial customers and coverage during the weekends were we have significant opportunity to better serve our customers. We invested in labor to position us to get back to positive comps.","Our advertising spend was focused on driving our battery business in anticipation of increased demand as a result of record heat this summer, which we expect to be a catalyst for demand over the next 6 months. Our battery sales performance was very strong, with roughly 200 basis points of comp acceleration from Q2 to Q3.","As a result of increased spending to improve our trends, our operating income decreased $27.5 million to $150.4 million. Clearly, this was lower than we planned. As our full year outlook suggests, we will adjust our costs in the fourth quarter to more closely align with the previous planned spend profile.","As I previously mentioned, we made specific investments in the quarter to position us to capitalize on the underlying fundamentals of our industry, which remained positive. Our focus will continue to be to provide our customers with reliable service, increased delivery speed and superior availability, which has propelled our Commercial gain and is critical to our DIY success. Our investments and priorities have been centered on those outcomes. Our progress on our initiatives this year will provide us with momentum for the future. The mission-critical outcomes in the third quarter included completing the in-sourcing of our commercial credit program, shipping from our new distribution center of Remington, Indiana and the expansion into the boroughs of New York.","In closing, I want to share a story about Jim Nevins [ph], a commercial parts pro in Dacula, Georgia. Jim is a shining example of how we're striving to consistently deliver fast reliable service to our Commercial customers. Jim is more than just dedicated. He truly takes ownership and is fully invested in helping his customers be successful. Having managed a shop himself, he understands that relationships create a 2-way street. His general manager says that Jim creates true value for his customers and for the advanced brand. He sees no obstacles when locating what his customers need. He only sees challenges. Jim not only finds satisfaction from accomplishing the feat at hand, he finds an even greater reward when he knows that he has solved someone's problem and has helped that individual to be successful. He uses every resource available from the Internet to local suppliers to make sure our customers are satisfied. Jim's customers know the quality of his service and his ability to find anything they need. Jim's dedication to Advance and to his customers is truly inspiring. His drive and unwillingness to accept failure differentiates his level of service from the competition. Jim, thanks, and keep up the great work.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin Freeland, our Chief Operating Officer. Kevin?","Kevin P. Freeland","Thanks, Darren, and good morning. I'd also like to thank the team for their hard work in the third quarter. I'll provide updates on the work that occurred during the quarter as well as update you on our initiatives to support our superior availability strategy and new store growth.","Despite the current softness in some of our major markets we operate in, we continue to focus on providing our customers with the best end market availability and consistency of service, both in order accuracy and delivery speed. As I'll share with you, our focus continues to be on the expansion of our hub network, the continuous upgrade of our parts in our non-hub stores, the opening of our new DC and the implementation of our daily replenishment capability, and the continued growth and rollout of our B2C and B2B e-commerce platforms, commercial diagnostic tool and our electronics part catalog.","During the quarter, we continue to expand our hub network through new store expansion in the upgraded existing stores, which are strategically positioned to operate as a hub. Our focus continues to be on strengthening our availability of both maintenance and failure parts, as demand for these products will increase as the average age of vehicle increases. During the quarter, we added 8 additional hub stores, bringing our hub store count to 328 versus 288 at the end of the third quarter last year. We also upgraded inventory at 363 non-hub stores during the quarter.","As scheduled, we've begun our first outbound shipments in September from our new distribution center in Remington, Indiana. As I mentioned before, we're very excited about this new facility as it will be used for a model for our future in terms of automation, which will greatly improve our productivity and allow us to replenish our stores daily. This new facility will ship product to our stores in phases, ramping up to over 400 stores next year and provide daily replenishment to over 200 stores. The initial results at Remington have been good, and we're achieving our rollout plans. Although we're very early in the process, we're extremely excited about the prospects and will continue to work aggressively to ensure we get the planned benefits.","As a result of these upgrades and opening of our new distribution center, our total inventory increased 4% to roughly $2.2 billion. We anticipate our total inventory will continue to grow over time as we focus on increasing the breadth of our parts assortment and improving our positioning with larger Commercial customers.","At the same time, we continue to work aggressively to free up capital to fund other parts of our business through our supply chain financing program. As a result of that work, we continue to expand our accounts payable to inventory ratio, which increased roughly 803 basis points from 75.2% at the end of the third quarter last year to 83.2% this year. As a direct result, we've reduced our own inventory by nearly 30%, a decrease of $155.5 million from $523.7 million to $368.2 million.","Turning to e-commerce. We continue to focus on growing our business through expanded penetration of our B2B capabilities to our Commercial customers. We've rolled out our B2B online ordering capabilities, and we expect to continue to increase the B2B penetration over time. This will allow us to increase both the frequency and retention rate of our Commercial customers who utilize this capability. Additionally, we continue to broaden our ability to provide more value-added services to our Commercial customers through MotoLogic, our shop diagnostic capability and DriverSide, which allows us to provide services aimed at helping our Commercial -- our customers grow their business. These capabilities will allow us to be a much stronger partner for our customers and make it easier and more compelling to them to do business with us.","Finally, with respect to e-commerce, we continue to make great progress with our B2C site, and I'm proud to announce that we now have the #1 multichannel site in the markets we serve. This is a great feat and reflective of the team's hard work and strength of our brand and online capability. We will continue to enhance our mobile commerce business and increase the level of convenience for our DIY customers.","We continue to focus on our new store opening strategy with an emphasis of building out more commercially oriented stores and expanding in markets within our current footprint that remain under penetrated. During the third quarter, we opened 35 stores, including 7 Autopart International stores. Year-to-date, we've opened 70 stores, including 13 Autopart International stores and closed 5. As of October 6, 2012, our total store count was 3,727, including 210 Autopart International stores. Our class of new stores continues to perform very well and is proving to be our most successful class in terms of sales productivity and the pace of their weekly sales ramp. Additionally, we began opening our first stores within New York City and anticipate opening roughly 18 stores in New York City this year. The entry into this very large market is an important milestone for us. For the year, we remain on pace to open approximately 120 to 140 stores, including the expected addition of roughly 65 stores in Q4 and are building our pipeline that allow us to open approximately 180 to 200 stores next year.","Finally, we focused on reversing our decelerating sales trends, and as a result, strengthened our competitive pricing position and increased our promotional activity during the quarter. However, our gross profit rate increased 31 basis points to 49.8% versus 49.5% during the third quarter of 2011. The increase was driven by our continued efforts to improve our shrink, cost deflation and supply chain efficiencies, partially offset by increased promotional activity during the quarter. Year-to-date, our growth -- gross profit rate was 49.9%, which is essentially flat during the same period in fiscal 2011. We will still remain on track to modestly improve our gross profit rate for the year.","Now let me turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Norona, to review our financial results in more detail.","Michael A. Norona","Thanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start by thanking all of our talented and dedicated team members for their commitment to serving our customers as we navigated through a challenging third quarter.","I plan to cover the following topics with you this morning. One, provide some financial highlights from our third quarter of 2012; two, put our third quarter and year-to-date results into context with our expectations and key financial dimensions we use to measure our performance; and three, share with you what we see for the remainder of 2012 and insights into how we are thinking about 2013.","As we shared in our October 22 prerelease of our preliminary financial results, our third quarter performance continued to reflect ongoing softness in our colder winter markets driven by the lingering impact of this year's milder winter. In addition, our tough economic environment continues to impact consumer demand for auto parts as evidenced by softness in both our maintenance and failure categories.","While sales trends improved from our second to third quarter, we did not achieve our profitability expectations. Our profitability shortfall was driven by deliberate decisions to improve sales trends and position the business to capitalize on the solid industry fundamentals we see. We targeted areas such as store labor and seasonal advertising to get back to positive comps sales growth and improve our market share. We also stayed the course with our planned investments in areas such as Remington DC and commercial credit in-sourcing launches, inventory upgrades and more aggressive store opening plans, including our new market entry into New York City, which is part of our new store opening plan in the fourth quarter.","While we did not achieve internal expectations, we were encouraged by our sales improvement from our second to third quarter, primarily driven by improvements in our Commercial comps and the fact that we were able to accelerate our sales performance, while the industry decelerated from the second to third quarter. Our decision to trade off profitability in the short term is driven by our confidence in the industry fundamentals and ensuring we position the company for 2013 with momentum as we expect a more normal winter.","Third quarter sales decreased 0.5% to nearly $1.5 billion, driven by our comp store sales decrease of 1.8%, partially offset by the net addition of 82 new stores over the past 12 months. Year-to-date, our total sales increased 0.7% to $4.9 billion, and our","Comp store sales decreased 0.5%.","As Kevin mentioned, our third quarter gross profit rate increased 31 basis points to 49.8% versus 49.5% in the third quarter of 2011. The increase was primarily driven by improvements in shrink, cost deflation and supply chain expenses due to labor productivity, partially offset by an increase in promotional activity. Year-to-date, our Commercial mix represented 38.2% of our 2012 sales versus 37.1% in Q3 of 2011. Year-to-date, our gross profit rate is flat to last year.","Our SG&A rate of 39.4% increased 213 basis points versus the third quarter of 2011, primarily due to increased spending on in-store labor and advertising and expense deleverage as a result of our 1.8% comp store sales decline. Year-to-date, our SG&A rate increased 25 basis points to 38.8% versus 38.5% over the same period last year. I outlined the principal drivers of the SG&A change earlier in my comments.","All in, our third quarter operating income dollars decreased 15.4%, and our operating income rate decreased 182 basis points to 10.3%. Our diluted EPS decreased 14.2% to $1.21 versus $1.41 last year. Year-to-date, our operating income dollars decreased 1.6% to $544.1 million, and our diluted EPS increased 3.6% to $4.34.","Year-to-date, free cash flow was $298.6 million, down $56.2 million over the same period last year. The largest driver of the decrease in free cash flow was an increase in our accounts receivable as a result of our in-sourcing of our commercial credit program. As Kevin mentioned, our owned inventory decreased 29.7% from third quarter 2011, driven by our continued efforts to increase our accounts payable inventory ratio, which now stands at 83.2% versus 75.2% in the third quarter of 2011.","At the end of the third quarter, we had $479.4 million in cash and $600.2 million of long-term debt on our balance sheet. Our adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2.2x, which is well below our previously stated ceiling of 2.5x. Our average diluted share count was 74.1 million shares at the end of the third quarter.","As we've mentioned, our industry continues to face weaker consumer demand and softness in the colder weather markets, both of which are impacting our results and contributing to the overall industry deceleration. However, we believe these dynamics are not indicative of a longer-term market slowdown. Specifically, the deferred maintenance reached a record $68 billion according to the most recent industry data. We believe the industry fundamentals remains solid and are encouraged by our team's ability to improve our sales trends from the second quarter. We continue to measure our performance through the financial dimensions of growth, profit and value creation. As we have consistently communicated, we prioritized growth as our primary use of capital to increase shareholder value, which includes investing in strategic initiatives to improve our performance and looking for future growth opportunities. Accordingly, there will be periods of time when we preserve capital as we assess sales growth opportunities to create value for our business and shareholders.","Over the past few quarters, we have been assessing some sales growth opportunities. At the end of our third quarter, we had roughly $500 million left under our share repurchase authorization, and we plan to continue our historical practice of opportunistically repurchasing shares in a disciplined manner over time.","Turning to profit. We remain committed to improving our profitability, which requires both delivering on our sales growth goals, primarily driven by Commercial, and continuing on our journey to develop a more cost competitive operating model. Improving our profitability requires that we do both. Given the softness in our top line and our deliberate decisions to increase customer traffic with increased advertising and labor, in the short term, our profitability growth has been constrained. We are not satisfied with these results and remain committed to improving our profit model by continuing to invest in both Commercial and availability to drive the top line, while more effectively managing our cost structure.","As we looked at value creation, we continue to maintain our disciplined approach to capital, which is reflected in our return on invested capital of 18.9%. ROIC increased modestly from our third quarter last year, driven by efforts to decrease our owned inventory, despite increasing our average inventory per store. Our AP ratio at the end of the third quarter was a record 83.2%, and we remain focused on achieving an AP ratio of 100% over time.","Turning to the balance of the year. We anticipate that the environment will continue to be challenging with our cold weather markets still underperforming our total company average comp store sales by several hundred basis points. Additionally, I would like to remind you that our fourth quarter is our lowest volume and most volatile quarter, as we compete with holiday shopping season and lower demand for parts. We continue to expect our annual comp store sales to be slightly down for 2012 and anticipate that our gross profit rate will improve modestly for the full year. While we expect to see a more normal winter, this will show up in the first half of next year, and therefore, we expect our cost to deleverage during our fourth quarter given the expected sales decline.","We will continue to adjust our variable costs to business trends, but plan to invest in our strategic areas, such as Commercial and availability to our previously planned levels, so we position ourselves with momentum for 2013.","As a result, we continue to expect our SG&A per store to be down 1% to 2% for 2012. As a result of our third quarter earnings performance and what we see for the fourth quarter, we anticipate our annual 2012 EPS to be in the range of $5.05 to $5.15 per share.","As we look to 2013, we will continue to build on our growth and profit successes over the past 5 years. We expect industry dynamics to remain favorable as a result of the continued increase in the average age of vehicles and the continued increase in the number of vehicles greater than 7 years old. We anticipate a return to more normal weather patterns and expect our top line growth to be driven by stronger Commercial comps, continued improvements in our availability and an accelerated pace of new store growth in the range of 180 to 200 stores. We expect to improve our profitability, driven by a modest improvement in our gross profit rate and through reductions in our SG&A through our continued focus on building a more competitive cost structure and by leveraging a better top line. We will provide a more detailed 2013 annual outlook on our fourth quarter earnings call.","In closing, we were disappointed we did not deliver the financial results we expected in our third quarter. We are also realistic about the challenging environment and the short-term impact it is having on our business. We believe the current industry softness will continue to put short-term pressure on our fourth quarter earnings. We remain committed and focused on our strategies, and we have confidence in our team's ability to improve our performance. As they have shown many times, when faced with adversity, they always respond with character, resiliency and a competitive spirit.","Before I turn the call over for Q&A, I'd like to make one final comment. I am sure you have seen recent press reports about our company. I would like to repeat Joshua's comments and remind you that it is our company policy to not comment on rumors and\/or speculation. And we will continue to follow that policy as we address your questions. We will be happy to answer your questions regarding our business operations, strategic initiatives and financial results. Operator, we are now ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from Greg Melich with ISI Group.","Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I believe in your comments there, and you mentioned that you expect to carry momentum from the third quarter into fourth quarter. When you talk about that, is that something that you've seen already? And when you think about momentum, is that the sort of 100 bp improvement that you saw from the third quarter to second quarter?","Michael A. Norona","Yes, Greg. You were cutting in and out. I think what your question was our comment on business as we went throughout the third quarter, as we saw sequential improvement each period in our Advance stores, particularly in our Commercial business. And our glimpse coming into the quarter as we expected that to happen, I said in my prepared remarks, inevitably, Hurricane Sandy, which impacted about 400 stores, now we're up and running in all but 2 today, certainly gave us a little bit of a setback. What we've seen before is that as FEMA money comes in and insurance money comes in, that tends to bounce back. Now the Northeaster was a little bumpy, too. So we think if that settles out, those trends will continue throughout the fourth quarter.","Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","And I'm very hopeful this is better.","Michael A. Norona","Yes.","Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","So that when you talk about momentum, you're talking about that 100 bp improvement that you saw in the third quarter. You think you can have a similar improvement into the fourth?","Michael A. Norona","Yes, we didn't quantify it exactly 100 basis points. But what you should have taken away from it is that period in, period out, we're seeing improvement in each period. And as we entered, we would expect that to occur in the fourth quarter, too. Whether it turns out to be 100 basis points, we'll see at the end of the third quarter.","Operator","Our next question is from Dan Wewer with Raymond James.","Daniel R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Darren, over the years, you and other CEOs in your industry, have talked about the rational competitive environment. And the fact that promotional pricing doesn't drive demand for auto parts, that's driven by failure rates. Curious as to why you now think that promotional pricing could make a change in demand, and whether the elasticity turned out to be what you thought it would be?","Kevin P. Freeland","Yes, Dan. This is Kevin. Essentially, as we were trying to improve performance, we were looking at various elements of our business that do, in fact, respond to price. We have a fairly material direct mail program, and the offers that are in those programs vary from period to period based on expectations. And we took a more aggressive posture in the quarter and got material results or noticeable results. And is that what the general DIY consumer reacts to? No. But there are price sensitive or price-conscious customers that do respond, and we are able to tailor the mailings accordingly. On the Commercial side, again, it's -- if you look at the customer response, price does not show up at the top of the list. But there is some level, especially on the chemicals business that we provide in or shop supplies, other than the fact, our -- have always been relatively promotional. And we leaned into some of those areas. I don't know that our general belief on the industry has changed. But in an effort to essentially turn the business around, we adopted a posture in the quarter that's leaned more into some of those categories.","Darren R. Jackson","Yes, Dan. Maybe to build on Kevin's point. I would say that part of our research tells us today when we look back 5 years ago, I think it was roughly 20% of our DIY customers started out online in terms of their shopping experience. Today, what it tells us in more recent research is 55% to 60% of those customers are really starting out -- starting online to understand parts availability, price, location. And in that same research 5 years ago, price was still in the top 5, but it might have been #5. Today, price has moved to #1. And so that doesn't necessarily mean we put everything on sale. But I think we're more targeted, as Mike said in his prepared remarks. Deferred maintenance, we were at AAPEX last week, and it was ASA said that number had risen to a record level of $68 billion now. What it says to me is that we have maintenance building. And to Kevin's point, this quarter, we targeted things like batteries. It's intuitive, given the heat that we had over the summer and even in the quarter. As we go into the fourth quarter and the first half of next year, increasing our awareness, not necessarily taking down the price, is going to be critical in terms of driving out some of that future traffic in the business. And also targeting certain parts of the business, as Kevin said before, in those deferred maintenance categories just spurs some demand. So it's not a fundamental shift. But I think it is a recognition that we have maintenance building in the system, and we want to be on the front end of some of that awareness and traffic driving.","Daniel R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","And just as a follow-up. We estimate during the quarter that Advance needed about a 3.9% comp sales gain for the company to maintain a flat expense rate. And the hurdle point is the highest since the first quarter of 2011. The past year, you've indicated that the next 200 basis points of operating margin improvement for Advance would come from expense leverage. Do you still think that's the case? Or are we going to be coming -- and a lot more reliant now on sales growth rather than expense cuts to drive future margin -- operating margin gains?","Michael A. Norona","Hey, Dan. It's Mike. I think it's both. So first of all, obviously, our goal is to continue to grow our business. So when you grow your business, you're able to leverage that top line. So that will always be a priority of ours. You need to look within the components of what happened in our SG&A. Actually, our SG&A per store fell 1.7% on a trailing 12-month basis. And if I gave you the breakout of the components, I think it will be easier for you to understand. So 25% of that basis points deleverage was just from fixed costs deleverage of things like rent and depreciation, the fixed cost structure. 25% was from us growing our stores. So obviously, we opened up 35 stores. We're going to have one of our largest store openings in the fourth quarter this -- as we look to the fourth quarter, about 65 stores. And then another 25% of that deleverage was caused by us maintaining our investment profile Remington, our credit in-sourcing that Darren talked about, our hubs, our inventory upgrades as we position ourselves for the future. Because we believe the fundamentals are good [indiscernible] We get a more normalized winter, we would expect the business to come back, our east business to rebound. And then the last 25%, and I said it in our remarks, is deliberate decisions we made to actually change the trajectory of our sales. So if you look at our sales from Q2 to Q3, they actually accelerated in terms of they got better, a minus 2.7 to minus 1.8. If you actually look at the industry, the industry got a little bit worse. So we invested a little bit more dollars in labor as Kevin said, seasonal advertising. And we think we changed the trajectory to the industry, but our view hasn't changed. Obviously, we need to improve our profit model, but that will be both on the top line and the bottom line.","Operator","Our next question is from Matt Fassler with Goldman Sachs.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","My question -- my first question, my follow-up relate to your spending. So you put a lot of money back into the business here in the third quarter. If you look at the incremental spending relative to initial Street expectations and our own and you look at the incremental sales to emerge relative to expectations relative to last quarter, I guess those sales are pretty costly to come by. And obviously, it's not the optimal environment to reap a return on that investment. How do you think about the financial return on this reinvestment of the business and marketing and labor, et cetera? What are the parameters that you used to decide whether, frankly, they're justified? And then the follow-up question just to get it in, your spending per store this quarter was up about 3%. Obviously, that's different from the trajectory that you're implying for the rest of the year, and presumably, for your algorithm going forward. So how should we contextualize that spending level?","Darren R. Jackson","Yes, Matt. I'll give you kind of high level, and Mike will give you some of the details. So when we went in to this quarter, a way to contextualize it is we came out at Q2 a minus 2.7 comp. I think we said to everyone on the call that what we're going to focus on, if you think about a Commercial business, in particular, is our in-store labor. I think for the quarter, our comp labor hours were up a little over 1%, and those related to service levels. And when I look at our comp stores and comp transactions in our Commercial Business, again, they were up low-single digit. It's actually improved off of the Q2 trends. And that's actually us doing more business, building relationships with those commercial shops. And those things, I don't think get measured in the period or they get measured necessarily in the quarter because those commercial shops are going to start doing business again in terms of that $68 billion. In order to get that done, we get 338 upgrades in the quarter is my recollection in terms of inventory added to our hub stores. In particular, took advantage of the 22 stores that we didn't plan to acquire in New York in the quarter as well and opened Remington, which put some pressure on those numbers. And for our business, the way I thought about it is that absent making those investments, one can make an argument instead of doing a minus 2.7 comp, trajectory would have taken you to a minus 4. So there is almost a 220 basis points pickup in terms of comp store sales trend relative to the trends that were out there. And so part of the business, I would say, you got to make a choice as to how you want to get that profitability and rebuild momentum. I fundamentally believe that part of the decision we made, if you go back a year ago, I think we had our best expense leverage numbers since we were here in Q3. So I made a choice, and I made the choice to reestablish sales momentum. I made a choice in terms of the advertising, principally around battery and failure parts. Because it's going to come. I mean I said this on the last conference call, in 2008, we are in a similar third quarter situation, and we were all wondering why the business went flat. And then 2 quarters later, we were all high fiving because the comps were approaching numbers that were closer to 10. And I think that's how this business can turn on and turn off over time. I think the key is to be positioned for when it's going to turn on again, because the reality is those cars are still old. It's the categories in maintenance, which are giving us fits at this moment in time. But eventually, maintenance becomes failure if you don't take care of it. And so that's what we saw in the quarter in terms of how we think about it. Those things will pay back over time for sure. It's just it may not necessarily pay back in a 90-day window.","Michael A. Norona","Yes, and Matt, your comment, we don't comment about SG&A within the quarter. Obviously, we report out on it, but we don't think about it that way. And the reason is so when I broke out previously in the last question, the breakout of our SG&A. So when the sales come back, that fixed costs deleverage will take care of itself. The 25% of that deleverage the came from stores, as Darren says I mean we're investing in stores today that are going to pay as we look out into the future. So we haven't seen any returns from those stores. And then the -- our investment profile in Remington, I mean Kevin has talked about this. It's in our remarks. I mean it's one of the most exciting things we got going in our company, this daily replenishment capability we have. Again, we haven't seen any of the benefits of that, our in-Store credits, our hubs, our inventory upgrades. So 3 quarters of deleverage is all kind of -- it will either take care of itself or it will pay back in the future. And I think Darren talked about the last 25% where the deliberate decisions we made, we think we changed the trajectory of the business and built some momentum.","Operator","Our next question is from Gary Balter with Credit Suisse.","Gary Balter - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just following up a little bit on that. It seems like there was a little bit of a change where last year, you were more focused on the expense savings. And then somewhere along the way, Darren, you looked or the whole company looked and said, \"Hey, we need to make these investments because there's all this  deferred maintenance and there's all this opportunity.\" And you obviously have the investment in Remington and now more SG&A to set yourself up for the future. What caused the change? Like what was the strategic decision that kind of say, \"Hey, we're -- maybe, we're being too tight on expenses.\" Or how did you change? Could you walk us through kind of how you're thinking?","Darren R. Jackson","Yes, Gary. So over the last 4 years, as you followed the story in terms of our transition to a 50-50 model Commercial and DIY, routinely, we used to speak about it in terms of the table stakes in the industry, which was first getting the right brands in our store, getting the parts pros, getting the trucks, building a sales force and even getting a website up and being able to do business in terms of B2B business. And call that the table stakes here of our business. Today, we have more, I would say, insight and clarity as to the next step of our journey. That step of our journey took us from roughly 400,000 a program to 640,000 a program. But we can see, and we've talked about this before is we probably got about 1.2 million of potential that sits around our stores today in terms of Commercial potential. And that 1.2 million, we're going to have to be more focused in terms of the customers that we go after. And there's no doubt given parts proliferation, and you just take import parts, for example, it's going to require more investments in those SKUs. And those customers are, quite frankly, they have more choices. There's more competition in the space. That's not a surprise. So what we're going to have to do is invest in things like commercial credit. We always knew that we would have to make that investment. As Mike said earlier, that's a 50% penetration business for us today. Most in the industry are closer to 90%. We find in order to do business with a larger garages, and that's the majority of the business we do today, we're going to have to target our capabilities, hence bring in-sourcing of credit. Remington, which we just opened, that facility sat vacant. It was built before this management team got there. Through productivity, we were able to keep it vacant. So when we actually had to finish completing it, we saw opportunities given tests that we were doing in daily replenishment to actually put a daily replenishment capability. And we think that will allow us to better serve those larger garages going forward. The other thing that we talked about in terms of targeting our capabilities going forward is that we spent probably a modest amount of time, Gary, in terms of the national and some of the regional accounts. As we position for the future, our first step was take your the customers closest to our store. The next step of our journey is that we, unlike some of our competitors, we don't have a heavy-duty business. We don't have a fleet business. We don't a government business, and we're probably underdeveloped a little bit in terms of national regional accounts. And we're beginning to put a focus in those areas. And as a part of that focus, that is going to have to require us to thoughtfully -- because despite all of that investment in capabilities, as Mike said, we're still going to be down nearly 2% in terms of SG&A per store. But we're funneling where we are investing to position us, how do we get from 640 a program closer to that $1 million a program going forward? And I think when you -- businesses that they don't grow in a linear fashion. I think you have to step through them, as we did. Our first 10 years were $1 billion. The last 4 years, we added another $1 billion. That next $1 billion that comes after that is going to be targeting that against different segments of business and different customers that quite frankly have higher standards.","Michael A. Norona","Hey, Gary, just to put some numbers to what Darren just said. First of all, I'll start by saying we have not changed our focus on improving our profit model and building a more cost-competitive structure. And if you actually look at our SG&A per store, it's down on a trailing 12 months to $659,000 per store, which is equivalent to where we were in about second quarter of 2010. So what that means is -- and we've built a lot of capabilities. And what we've done is we've moved a lot of SG&A. What you can't see the SG&A we moved out and replaced it with things like Remington, inventory upgrades, hubs and things like that, so -- but our focus, I want to make sure what you take away from us is our focus has not changed. And what's probably happening is when your comps are negative, it just puts more magnification on the SG&A. But looking at that trailing 12 months, I think, is an important number.","Gary Balter - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just as a follow-up on Remington or the ones that follow Remington. Because I know Kevin made a comment at AAPEX that you plan to build up a distribution center, the distribution facilities. Can you talk about what's coming after Remington and what the cost of those facilities are?","Kevin P. Freeland","Yes, Gary, this is Kevin. We -- essentially, we're looking at facilities that we have today, which what we had with -- as Darren said, Remington was not a building that we built for this purpose. It was a building that was essentially not needed. It was built in advance of need based on essentially engineered standards that we had put in the existing fleet of DCs that bought us far more time than the previous management would have had -- would have believed. So we're leveraging an existing building. We have 8 other primary distribution centers at this point, and a lot of our focus at this point is there, and essentially taking what we have built in the model from Remington, which was fairly expensive for 2 reasons. There was a great deal of assistance that we needed to figure out how to pull that facility together. We went from a relatively low level of automation to a high level of automation, changed out the -- both the warehouse management system and based on the automation, the warehouse control system. And so what we're looking at today is how can we leverage all of those investments with the fixed-costs structure that we have, with the supply chain that is essentially still using those legacy methods.","Operator","Our next question is from Mike Baker with Deutsche Bank.","Michael Baker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","A couple on the sales trajectory. I guess I was surprised. I think you said that the colder weather markets were still about 200 basis points worse than chain average, even though I think it's starting to get cold out. So I'm wondering if that's surprising,  on the other hand, it's encouraging because you are seeing better comp trends overall. So where are you seeing those better comp trends, if not in the cold weather markets?","Darren R. Jackson","Yes, well, just to reiterate what we said in the prepared comments. So the northeast, where we have a dominant store footprint, those trends improved nearly 300 basis points in the quarter. In the Great Lakes region, I think we improved 130-some-odd basis points in the quarter. So as you said, we were some of the big movers that moved the trends in the quarter, it's going to be in those. Now we still have markets where, quite frankly, west of the Mississippi. We've got markets that were mid-single digit markets for us and regions for us. We said in our prepared comments the west, as you hike on down towards Texas, that was a good market for us. Even the Southeast, particularly in the Commercial business, was mid-single digits strong for us. But I think the larger picture, when you hear about our optimism in terms of as we look out, what we see are these regions of the country where they tend to be performing very well, and then we see other regions, whether it's the Northeast, we see them starting to point in the right direction. It might be getting cold out. We're selling a few more batteries, Great Lakes, similarly, the Plains, we didn't -- the Plains has been challenging, too. It's another cold weather market out there as well. So our view is, is that cold weather starts to come through and we talk about it in our battery comments, we saw our battery business, which is failure cold weather related, we saw those improve Q2 to Q3, 200 plus basis points in terms of comp sales trends. So I think those are all indicative that when we actually do get to turn the starters, the alternators, the antifreeze and all that tend to work in unison. The other thing that's occurring, too, is we are starting to anniversary some of those year-ago trends in terms of escalating oil prices on the oil price -- on the oil change specials. So it did give us a little bit of relief in the ticket this quarter. And so I think those all position us as we get to more normalized weather trends as we look out.","Michael Baker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And so I guess if I could follow-up on that. If you were to adjust those cold weather markets, which were a couple of hundred basis points, worse than the chain, correct me if I'm wrong, but your comps would still be in the flattish area? Maybe up slightly or down slightly, which is down from where you were a couple of years ago even as the economy seem to be better than it was a couple of years ago. Is there something in terms of the aging of the vehicles, maybe sort of aging out of the sweet spot or cars that can be sold that people are opting for younger cars? Anything along those lines that you think could be impacting your business from a sort of multiyear perspective?","Darren R. Jackson","Well, we can all speculate as to what it is. I think the average age of vehicles last year to this year, even 2 years ago, was moved up 6 months. So you look in the larger scheme of things, and you say, is it really going to change because it's moved 6 months? I think new cars SAARs this year at 14.9 million will scrap roughly 13 million vehicles. Just doesn't seem large enough in order to move the iceberg. I think we said this time and time again on these calls is that, it's probably, from our vantage point, as we look at gasoline prices, and again you have to go back to '08, '09 and '10, when we saw that significant move down in terms of gas in the '09 and '10 period, I think we averaged about $2.42 a gallon. I think what happened is that we've freed up some discretionary income. That discretionary income, we could also see -- at that point, we had reached somewhat of a peak in deferred maintenance. It got spent on the car. We get some gas price relief, and I'm reluctant to say we will because it's -- we're no good in predicting it. We thought we'd have relief in the back half of this year, and we're $0.04 higher in the third quarter this year than we were 1 year ago. Now we dropped about $0.20 a gallon in the last several weeks. If we can sustain those levels, I suspect we'll take a relatively constrained consumer still at that lower income levels and give them an opportunity to spend some of those dollars back on their car, because what we can see in deferred maintenance levels is they've reached a all-time high in terms of the numbers that came out last week.","Michael A. Norona","And I would just add one thing to what Darren said is what you're hearing from Darren is confidence and belief in the industry fundamentals. I'm not sure if you were also trying to get your question when you compare that. I mean in '09 and '10, we saw some uncharacteristically large growth in the industry from historical levels. So maybe what you see is a little bit of the industry, from a DIY perspective and in the Commercial, reverting back to historical growth levels, which are still good growth levels but they're just not at the same level as they were.","Kevin P. Freeland","Yes, Mike, this is Kevin. We religiously track the mean time to failure of every component of every car by major manufacturer. And we clearly are seeing a later point in the vehicle at which key components fail. And it's just a testament to the quality of the vehicles that are on the road. We also see a high age, average age of vehicle, high average mileage per car. And essentially, cars are lasting longer than they did in the past. But the parts ultimately fail. And so essentially, what is built into the trends of the industry is yes, and actually, there's been quite a bit written on the sweet spot. There is a -- there are fewer cars in the sweet spot today than in the past, but the sweet spot appears to have moved. The car, essentially, retains its usability longer than it did in the past, and the sweet spot with which customers repair their vehicle is just occurring later in the life of the car.","Operator","Our final question today is from David Gober with Morgan Stanley.","David Gober - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So Mike, I just wanted to touch on the commentary around potential strategies to accelerate sales growth. I know you guys have talked about a couple of things, and I was just wondering if you could maybe bucket a couple of the other potential uses of capital. Because obviously, capital allocation has been a big topic of conversation. But when we look at potential uses, you talk about the acceleration in store footprint, the acceleration in building out the DC infrastructure. What are the other types of investments that you're thinking of and how can we kind of think about that process?","Michael A. Norona","Yes. So as we think about our capital, and as we have consistently shared, we always prioritize growth, both organic and inorganic. So when you think of organic, our new stores are probably one of the biggest uses that we have had on capital, and we will continue to have in the future. So obviously, that's a big area. And one of the things that we shared in our comments is that we purchased during the quarter 21 previous [indiscernible] stores, so that will be part of our new store growth. So that will be an example of something organically. It's been well known that there's been a large number of small and large sales growth opportunities on industry this year. We don't comment on those. And what we do is as we look at our capital allocation and look at different sales growth opportunities, kind of the way we think about it is, is there an opportunity to expand our footprint? Is there an opportunity to support our strategic growth direction, particularly in the area of Commercial? And then is there a way in which we can leverage all the capabilities we built out? So that's kind of the frames we look at these things through. And what we did give you is we just gave you a little perspective that the company -- and I think Darren has consistently said this is a growth story, and we're always looking for things to grow our business and that fit with our business. But we don't talk about specific things we look at. But that's kind of a frame as to how we think about growth opportunities, both organically and inorganically.","David Gober - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","That's very helpful. And I guess more of a, as a detailed somewhat near-term question on the impact of Hurricane Sandy. Darren, I know you mentioned the number of stores that were closed at one period. But just wondering if you can kind of refresh our memory in terms of how that -- how you think that impacts results over the next couple of quarters. Is there typically a pickup in business, given that you guys obviously, do you have a fairly high concentration in some of the areas that were impacted by the storm? And I guess how does that kind of balance the near-term -- maybe a drop for some period of time versus a pickup thereafter?","Darren R. Jackson","Yes. Well, there's 2 things that occur. As you come in to, whether it was Irene, Andrew, whatever, you see a little bit of a buildup before the storm, so lots of batteries, gas cans go out the door before. There is a lull for a period of time. And it really is connected to FEMA dollars, insurance dollars and the amount of devastation in terms of being able to get to our stores. As we highlighted, there were 400 stores. Of those, the good news is all but 2 are opened today. And there was no loss of life for team members or family in those storms. There will be a delayed period based on when those dollars start flowing back into the system. We would expect, as we approach quarter's end, that we'll see more of those flow into the system. The question will be, do they spend it on Christmas, or do they spend it on their car? But inevitably, those storms do create more wear and tear on the vehicle. And so it's again, a question of not if, it's a question of when. And if the when doesn't happen within the fourth quarter, it will spill over into the first quarter of next year. So that's what we would expect based upon prior patterns of these storms in the past.","Operator","I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Joshua Moore for any final comments.","Joshua Moore","Thank you, Wendy, and thanks to our audience for participating in our third quarter earnings conference call.

Tom.","Thomas R. Greco - Advance Auto Parts, Inc.","Thanks, Zaheed. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our fourth quarter conference call. I'd like to begin by acknowledging all of our team members and independent owners across the broader AAP family as our initiatives to improve top line performance drove meaningful progress in Q4.","As we closed out our fiscal year we accelerated growth, building momentum from the previous quarter, and delivering comp sales growth of 3.1%; our strongest quarterly comp performance in the 12 quarters post the GPI acquisition. We're taking decisive actions to improve performance and better serve our customers, and I'm confident we're on the right track.","Before I review the drivers of our comp sales acceleration, it's important to note that our Q4 sales performance benefited from the year-over-year holiday shift as New Year's Day moved from Q4 in the previous year to Q1 of this year. We also had a very strong finish to the quarter as a result of exceptional winter-related demand in December. These factors had a positive impact on the end of year performance in Q4 and will have a negative impact on the beginning of the year performance in Q1 of this year.","Net, it will be important to look at our business across Q4 and Q1 combined to get a true picture of our sales growth improvement. Regardless, we're very pleased with our improving comp sales performance, specifically the acceleration of sales growth we've achieved over the past two quarters is attributable to three primary areas of focus.","First, we've been very clear up and down the organization that everyone's number one priority is caring for the customer which drives top line sales growth. Across all of our businesses, we're seeing adoption of this mindset.","Second, we're driving positive results from sustained investments in availability, customer service, and frontline incentives. These investments strengthened our execution and positioned our teams to serve our customers more predictably, more reliably, and more consistently. This is driving improved performance in both transactions and ticket on both sides of our business. We're also driving higher levels of customer engagement and lower levels of turnover across the board. In fact, we're now experiencing the lowest frontline turnover levels we've seen in years.","Third, we're delivering improved levels of execution throughout our supply chain. This includes higher fill rates from DCs, better in stock rates in stores, and reduced order-to-delivery time to customers. All of these ladders up to providing a superior experience for our customers. And relative to where we were, these improvements are translating to accelerated growth.","In fact, all of our businesses had strong sales performance in the fourth quarter: Advance, Carquest; Autopart International, our independent network; WORLDPAC; and our Canadian business. In the US, we saw sequential comp sales improvement in every one of our regions, with the Northeast and Great Lakes delivering the largest improvement. We completed our transition from 5x to 3x delivery frequency in these markets, and more reliable fill rates improved store-level service.","We'd like to highlight that our Carquest independent network had a terrific Q4. We have a re-invigorated focus on this vitally-important part of our business comprised of approximately 1,250 stores and teams of dedicated professionals. In most of these independent stores, there are literally decades of experience in auto parts sales and service. We're leveraging this institutional knowledge much better than we have in the past, and our renewed focus on the independent team resulted in our strongest quarter for this group since the GPI acquisition.","Based on the productive conversations we've been having with our independent advisory council recently, we firmly believe there is still plenty of upside ahead for us. As we strengthen the partnership with our independent operators, we expect that both they and we will accelerate our success.","As we said repeatedly, our first priority was to sharpen our focus on the customer and the drivers of customer satisfaction. We focused on, and will stay focused on, those customer metrics which drive top line improvement. We're extremely pleased that actions to improve the customer experience are delivering results in the top line and driving positive comps sooner than expected.","Over time, you'll see progress in bottom line profitability margins. This was always the plan, and continues to be the plan. Improving the bottom line profitability is highly visible and completely within our control.","Turning to operating income, our performance reflects some deliberate choices along with clear opportunities for improvement. We chose to sell down inventory in order to optimize our inventory mix and improve working capital. We invested to better serve our customer. These two decisions drove over two-thirds of our adjusted operating margin deterioration versus the prior year.","Finally, we continued to identify opportunities for improvement in cost management. The end result of these three factors resulted in an adjusted operating margin rate of 6% and adjusted EPS of $1. Allow me to go deeper on each element.","First, as expected, we took planned and proactive steps to reduce inventory levels. In doing so, previously capitalized supply chain costs flow through the income statement as an expense and reduce our margin, but not impacting our cash flow in the quarter. This is a direct result of the planned reduction in inventory levels. This is absolutely the right thing to do for our business. Over the long-term, reducing inventory is a large cash flow driver. Therefore, we plan to continue to our inventory optimization work in the same thoughtful and deliberate manner without disrupting customers.","Secondly, also as planned, an important priority for us in Q4 was to make incremental investments to better serve our customers and accelerate top line momentum to regain market share. This included investments in parts availability, customer service, and frontline incentives. These investments will pay dividends over the long-term as we're already seeing dramatic improvements in customer service metrics, increased sales, and reduced turnover.","Finally, a little less than one-third of our margin contraction is attributable to the fact that we're still in the very early stages of our transformation. At this point, cost visibility and our expectation for cost management are still not where they need to be throughout the organization. As a result, we had performance opportunities on some cost lines in Q4. These cost shortfalls are completely unacceptable; I know that and my team knows that. We also know exactly where these shortfalls are, and we have a plan to fix each one of them.","Going forward, we've constructed a robust five-year productivity pipeline, and sequenced it across the five-year strategic plan horizon. Our actions, by design, are not yet positively impacting short-term cost performance across our P&L both in cost of goods and SG&A. Our productivity plan is to permanently reduce cost in our systems with actions we know are sustainable, and do not impact our customers. Our productivity pipeline is material and thoughtful in order to drive long-term value creation that is sustainable. To reiterate, our first priority is caring for the customer.","When we improve margins, we will do so the right way in the best interest of the business. We're determined to permanently and properly remove waste in our system that will allow us to further invest in our valued customers while expanding margins over the long-term. In summary, we're pleased with our top line sales performance in Q4.","Jump-starting the top line was our first priority in the transformation journey, and we're ahead of where we expect it at this point. Without question, accelerating growth and regaining momentum with our customers is an important first step towards driving sustainable long-term performance improvement.","With regards to flow through, we knew our transformation was not going to be perfectly linear. We remain confident in the long-term opportunity as we build new muscles to drive productivity and accelerate margin expansion. I've said from the beginning that turning this business around would be a marathon, not a sprint. Over time, we absolutely will balance top and bottom line performance.","Now, let's talk about 2017. We're excited about 2017 for a number of reasons. As we shared with you in November, we have a very clear and cohesive strategy. Our aligned and fully-integrated five-year plan is enabling us to execute a focused agenda to drive change and to improve performance. As we shared at our Investor Day, our strategy has four major growth planks: first, supply chain; second, professional; third, DIY; and fourth, productivity. We're going to be relentlessly focused on these growth planks over the next five years and beyond. Allow me to provide a brief update on each.","First, supply chain. We're re-inventing our supply chain with a laser focus on improving availability as it's the most important thing our customers want from us; to get the right part in the right place at the right time. As shared previously, we implemented a number of lead markets in the back half of 2016 where we tested different ways of positioning inventory, different ways of assorting parts, and different ways of delivering throughout our network.","We're excited about the performance from these lead markets, highlighted by improved availability. This translated to meaningful sales lifts, higher levels of customer satisfaction, and lower levels of inventory. As a result of these lead market successes, we're rolling out the key elements of this plan across the country later this year and into 2018. We expect the improved availability we saw in the lead markets to drive incremental sales in new markets where it's implemented.","Secondly, on the professional side of the business, we feel terrific about our parts assortment which our customers tell us is the most comprehensive and attractive lineup in the business. Under Bob Cushing's leadership, we're ramping up sales and customer service capabilities. This is enabling us to regain first-call status with many professional customers. We're packaging up all of AAP's assets in one place for professional customers. This includes market differentiators like our TECHNET program along with the Carquest and WORLDPAC Training Institutes. Bob's also leveraging best practices and technology platforms across all of AAP's professional businesses to simplify things for our customers. Finding ways to drive sales and profits for our professional customers is job one here, and we're making terrific progress.","Third, in DIY, we're focused on delighting DIYers at every single touchpoint. We're hard at work to strengthen our Speed Perks program, and build stronger loyalty. We've also initiated lead markets for DIY designed to improve the customer experience in the store, online, and overall. This includes more focused and enhanced training along with investments in mobile and digital to better serve our customers when and where they want to be served. Our customers have been actively telling us we're making progress in DIY as measured by steady, sequential increases in positive feedback from our customers. We track this on our customer service hotline as well as through social media channels.","The improvements we're seeing are quite dramatic. Our team members have always wanted to serve our customers better than we have in the past. Now, we're giving them the tools to do so. In Q4 our DIY initiatives drove sequential growth improvement at the same rate we saw on the professional side of the business.","Finally, Tom Okray and I are extremely energized about the productivity pipeline we've constructed for the future as we remove at least $500 million of unnecessary costs over the strategic business plan horizon. This requires us to thoughtfully change the work. Our approach to cost reduction will be very different than it's been in the past. As we implement our productivity agenda starting this year, it will be done so by materially changing the work, not short-term cost reduction.","In summary, the five-year strategy we shared with you in November is well under way, with 2017 representing year one of our journey. The great news is executing our strategy without frequent shifts in direction is already enabling us to improve execution. We enter 2017 with a relentless focus on a narrow set of relevant metrics, and a goal of delighting our customers at every single touch point. I expect our execution to improve every quarter this year.","Finally, we've done a substantial amount of work on our people strategy in support of our business strategy. The primary goals here include growing talent, building new capabilities, and evolving our culture. We plan to grow talent and build bench with high-performing internal talent and, where needed, by attracting external talent to AAP where we've already had considerable success.","Throughout Advance, we're hard at work at evolving our culture to one which is obsessively focused on the customer, and one which has an exceedingly high level of accountability, ownership, and drive for results up and down the organization. As part of this, we conducted a deep dive on our organizational health to help us understand what we needed to do in order to evolve our culture to be relentlessly focused on the customer. The output of this work has enabled us to provide very clear direction on what we expect from team members in order to achieve a step change in our results.","Our team members are excited about our new cultural beliefs. As examples, be accountable, champion inclusion, and take action to name just a few. Our frontline team members have embraced our cultural beliefs. Now, we need to bring them to life with every customer every day in every store. Once again, I'd like to thank both the AAP team members and our independent partners across North America for raising our game in Q4 by caring for customers first and by stepping up our comp sales growth. While I knew this transformation would take some time, we're encouraged with our progress and confident we'll accelerate performance going forward.","I'll now pass it over to Tom Okray to share financials and walk through our 2017 outlook.","Thomas Okray - Advance Auto Parts, Inc.","Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Total sales for the fourth quarter increased 2.4% to $2.08 billion as compared with total sales during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. The sales increase was driven by comparable store sales growth of 3.1%, inclusive of a positive impact of the year-over-year timing of the holiday shift.","As Tom referred to earlier, our gross profit rate decline of 114 basis points was primarily driven by headwinds associated with reducing inventory levels and our productivity agenda that is still gaining traction.","As planned, our adjusted SG&A rate increased 58 bps year-over-year, driven by continued investments in customer service initiatives related to store labor, frontline incentive compensation and improvements in availability. All in, our fourth quarter adjusted operating income came in at $125.6 million. Adjusted operating margin decreased 172 basis points over the same period last year to 6%.","As Tom referred to earlier, approximately 1\/3 of the adjusted operating margin decrease was related to reducing our inventory levels. Approximately another 1\/3 of the adjusted operating margin decrease was driven by our investments to better serve our customers.","Finally, just less than 1\/3 of the adjusted operating margin decrease was related to performance shortfalls in a few concentrated cost lines. These included items that will not be part of our long-term cost structure. As Tom indicated, we have tremendous visibility on cost performance opportunities and great confidence we will address these shortfalls as we ramp up our productivity pipeline.","Free cash flow for fiscal 2016 was $241.3 million versus $454.9 million last year, primarily driven by the combination of increased (21:45) inventory versus the previous year and lower sales.","Now, turning our attention to the full year outlook for 2017. We expect to deliver comparable store sales in the range of 0% to 2% and an adjusted operating margin increase between 15 basis points to 35 basis points for the year. Notably, our full year adjusted operating margin expansion estimate also includes new inflationary pressures and expected cost increases in 2017 that either did not exist or were not material for us in 2016.","These year-over-year increases are primarily from the salary adjustments due to the adoption of new FLSA regulations and minimum wage increases for our frontline teams as we \u2013 as well as projected higher incentive compensation in 2017, driven by our expectation of improved operating and financial performance.","Moving on, we expect to open between 75 to 85 new stores, inclusive of new WORLDPAC branches, capital spending of approximately $250 million and an effective tax rate between 37.5% and 38%. We are also focused on generating cash flow improvement over 2016 and expect to deliver a minimum of $400 million of free cash in 2017, driven by improvement \u2013 by improved operating performance and a strong focus on working capital, as we take additional steps toward optimizing our inventory and payables.","In summary, we are very pleased with our meaningful top line progress in Q4 and remain confident in our strategy that we shared with you in November.","With that, we'll open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from Simeon Gutman of Morgan Stanley.","Simeon Ari Gutman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks. Good morning. On the \u2013 I thought \u2013 on the Q3 or the call or the meet-and-greet, we talked about gross margin being weighed down similarly by some of the inventory capitalization costs. But I thought the commentary was that Q4 should not be as bad as \u2013 Q4 shouldn't be as bad as Q3. So, is that right? And what changed for Q4?","Thomas R. Greco - Advance Auto Parts, Inc.","Well, first of all, we definitely signaled that it was going to continue to be a drag, Simeon, in the fourth quarter. On the gross margin side, we really look at the total picture, right? We're looking at our operating margin broadly. And with regards to that, as we said in our prepared remarks, over 2\/3 of the overall margin contraction was a function of some deliberate choices we made; first of all, to reduce inventory; and, secondly, to invest in our customers. So, we're really managing the business for the long-term.","On the balance of the shortfall in our overall margin, we're disappointed but not surprised by the fact that we had some cost performance shortfalls. We've got a new muscle to build here on productivity, and we've got to figure out a way to reduce costs thoughtfully over time. So, the net of it is we significantly increased the visibility of these costs in the organization, and we have a plan to fix the performance of the cost. We've provided very clear, relevant metrics to measure performance. We've dramatically increased visibility throughout the organization.","So, I can tell you that the muscle to drive cost out of the organization is being developed. It really hasn't been part of our DNA in the past, and it's going to take some time. So, the new team is running the business very differently than before. The zero-based budgeting process is helping us build a very disciplined productivity pipeline, where we're going to really change the work and permanently remove those costs. So, I have tremendous confidence that we're going to balance the top and bottom line over time, including the gross margin. It's actually the most straightforward aspect of our strategic agenda.","Simeon Ari Gutman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","So, as my follow-up, I'll just make it two parts. So, following up to that answer, does that mean \u2013 does this capitalization expense now roll off? Are we through it and, therefore, we should see that improve, meaning the gross margin rate improve from the global act of that (26:58) headwind?","And then, second part of the follow-up. If you take the 15 basis points to 35 basis points of margin expansion in next year's guidance, is that purely a function of the leverage from the comp ranging 0% to 2% or is there anything contemplated in the timing of \u2013 as you get some of these SGA savings, if that goes better, is that in that guidance range as well?","Thomas Okray - Advance Auto Parts, Inc.","Yeah. Simeon, let me take that one. With respect to the capitalization and supply chain cost, that's going to continue as we right-size and optimize our inventory. Quite frankly, it's the right thing to do for the shareholders, it's the right thing to do for the company and we're going to make that decision every day of the week.","So, it's going to be lumpy over time, but that's something that we need to do as we're building this transformation for the long haul. There's tremendous amount of cash flow opportunity by getting our AP ratio in line, definitely underperforming our peers not where we want to be.","With respect to the guidance, I think it's going to be both of the things that you said. One is it's going to be the top line growth of the 0% to 2%. And as we build this productivity muscle that Tom described, we expect to also see benefits from not only SGA, but also the gross profit line.","Simeon Ari Gutman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Lasser of UBS.","Michael Louis Lasser - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my questions. I guess, what the market wants to see over the long run is that you can generate sales, gross margin expansion, SG&A leverage consistently on a quarter-to-quarter basis. Have you seen anything in the business that would prevent you from doing that over time? And how long do you think it's going to take for you to get to be able to be sustainably producing that algorithm?","Thomas R. Greco - Advance Auto Parts, Inc.","Well, thanks, Michael. First of all, we really are excited about the performance in the fourth quarter on the comp sales. That was the most difficult piece that we had to tackle, was to improve our comp sales performance and start to regain share momentum with our customers. This is a turnaround situation, and we're building new muscles throughout the organization. We've got to build a cohesive strategy that we stick to. We've got to elevate the operating intensity across the organization to drive better execution and to improve cost management. Both of those are extremely important. So, we're building those muscles as we go. Part of that is to get some talent into the organization that can help us with that to build new capabilities. And what you do first, second and third is really important in this type of situation.","So, we've made some conscious choices along the way. But to answer your question directly, I don't see anything getting in the way of what we shared with you in November. We're building momentum on the top line. We see tremendous opportunities to take cost out of the organization. Tom has come in, Tom Okray, and really helped us with thinking through the productivity agenda. We sequenced it over the five years. We're very confident we can take the costs out over time. It's just a matter of sequencing them in the right order.","Michael Louis Lasser - UBS Securities LLC","And my follow-up question is that you gave a lot of moving pieces around the margin during the quarter. You mentioned that 2\/3 of the margin decline was due to inventory disposition and incentive comp increases. Another 1\/3 was due to the early stages of the turnaround. Are those distinct factors, so that accounts for 100% of the margin decline? And maybe another way to say it, would you have levered your 3.1% comp had it not been for those factors?","Thomas R. Greco - Advance Auto Parts, Inc.","Well, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we're not satisfied with the operating leverage by any stretch of the imagination. If you deconstruct it, as I \u2013 as you just articulated, about 2\/3 of it was very planful and thoughtful. We entered the quarter knowing exactly what was going to happen in terms of inventory, knowing exactly what was going to happen in terms of the investments in the customer. And the investments in the customer are obviously pretty broad ranging. We're investing in parts availability. We're investing in our employees. We're investing in delivery. So, all of those things are factors that drove the lion's share of the operating margin contraction.","The other 1\/3 is just this building out this muscle on costs. I mean, we don't have structural impediments to taking costs out of the organization. We just lack overall leadership to really take on these cost issues. We lack the visibility that would normally be in a company that's performing at a really high level, and we lack the action plans that we needed to drive the costs out. I feel very confident that we can address those cost shortfalls that we had in the fourth quarter. It's concentrated in a few areas. It wasn't a huge surprise to us because we're still building out those muscles, but they're not structural and they're just process-driven, basic things that we can tackle over the course of the strategic plan.","Michael Louis Lasser - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you, and good luck.","Thomas R. Greco - Advance Auto Parts, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Forbes of Guggenheim.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC","It's actually John Heinbockel on for Steve. So, Tom, two things. One, if you think about permanently changing work, where do you think the biggest opportunities are? Is it store level? Is it regional level? And what type of tasks would have the greatest potential?","Thomas R. Greco - Advance Auto Parts, Inc.","It's really pretty broad-ranging. I mean, we're looking at \u2013 from a process flow standpoint, I think, in November, we shared the six major cost buckets that we're looking at, how we distribute throughout our distribution center network from DC to store, how we're operating inside of the stores, how we're distributing parts from our stores to our customers. All of those cost lines are integrated. And so, we're looking at how we can build a much more meaningful and impactful way to effectively and more efficiently deliver parts to our customers.","So, we're looking at the processes holistically, and we're looking inside the four walls as well. So, inside of a distribution center, how many times are we touching parts, how many deliveries are we making from a store to customers throughout the week, what's the average size of those deliveries. I mean, there's a number of things that we're working on that are going to address both the holistic approach in terms of our total value chain to the customer and inside each cost area, such as a store, to try and drive costs out.","So, we're looking at it very broadly, and we've got very clear plans. We've sequenced our productivity agenda for 2017 across each period, so we know how the year is going to unfold and we also have a pretty clear idea of how the $500-million-plus that we're going to be removing over the strategic plan horizon is going to unfold. We've got that pretty well \u2013 I think about 80% mapped out at this stage. So, it's pretty comprehensive. We are leveraging zero-based budgeting, which is a very effective tool, and it's really revealed some of the big opportunities that we have inside the company.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC","All right. Then, as a follow-up, I know you've done some consolidation in the field level organizational structure. If you look at it today, are you generally satisfied with where the structure is right now? Or do you anticipate some further changes as we look out over the next year, two, three?","Thomas R. Greco - Advance Auto Parts, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, obviously, we're not going to talk about specific changes we're complementing \u2013 or contemplating inside of the organization. But everything is on the table, okay? We're looking at every aspect of our business as we consider how to work more effectively and efficiently with our organization and with our customers. So, you can draw your own conclusions from that.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Seth Sigman of Credit Suisse.","Seth I. Sigman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thanks. Good morning. Obviously, a lot of good progress in the quarter. And, Tom, you mentioned a number of focus areas that seemed to be helping. As you sort of isolate the core drivers of the improvement across various markets and channels, how would you rank those sources of improvement between the external environment that seemed to get a little bit better late in the quarter in December, as you mentioned, versus some of those specific focus areas?","Thomas R. Greco - Advance Auto Parts, Inc.","Yeah. I want to reiterate. We clearly benefited from the holiday shift and the increased winter-related demand in December. We're going to give some of that back in January and in Q1, which I think you've heard from some others. That said, we're very excited about our progress. I think the organization is really rallying around a care for the customer-first message and that, I think, has been a big driver. I think we're getting an extra level of discretionary effort from our own team members and from our independent operators out there in the marketplace. And the heightened focus on the customer is driving improved execution, and it's contributing meaningfully to the top line.","So, as I think I've said before, we focused the entire field organization on input metrics we hadn't been as focused on, important input metrics like fill rate, like order-to-delivery time. Our turnover is down dramatically. I think that's been a big factor. We're delivering the part faster to the customer. So, I think we are creating somewhat of a virtuous circle here. As we improve our service, we're getting more traction with our customers. So, we're going to continue to be absolutely relentless in ensuring we delight the customer. And when we do, we're confident that we'll grow faster.","Seth I. Sigman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","And then, just given the calendar dynamics you mentioned with Q4 and Q1, in light of that, well, does that imply that Q1 would fall below the 0% to 2% comp range? And I'm just wondering if there's any other considerations as you think about the cadence for comps throughout the year.","Thomas R. Greco - Advance Auto Parts, Inc.","Yeah. I don't \u2013 I'm not going to comment specifically on Q1, but I think it will be important given the dynamics I just mentioned to look at performance over 28 weeks to include Q4 and Q1, just by virtue of what happened at the end of the year. We're not managing this business quarter-to-quarter. We're building a very long-term approach to the business. We're focused on what we control. We're focused on doing what needs to be done today to ensure maximum value creation for the long-term.","Having said that, these kind of short-term, macroeconomic, winter-related shifts that can move volume around from week-to-week and quarter-to-quarter, those aren't things that we're tremendously focused on. We're focused on the long-term.","Seth I. Sigman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. Great. And then, just one quick follow-up. You gave us your long-term productivity improvement target. It sounds like a lot of the planning is done. Just curious, are you able to give us a sense of how much you're targeting for 2017 and what's built into that margin guidance?","Thomas R. Greco - Advance Auto Parts, Inc.","Yeah. Obviously, we gave you $500 million over five years. Just do the math. I mean, we would expect to get at least $100 million into this year, and we're setting our goal higher than that, I can tell you that. So, we're really focused on building this thing out in a way that's sustainable. And as was asked earlier, that involves changing the work fundamentally, which is honestly harder than just, hey, let's just cut a bunch of things, let's cut travel or whatever the case may be. We're building out a productivity muscle that just didn't exist here, and I couldn't be more excited about it.","Seth I. Sigman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. Great. Congrats on the progress.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Horvers of JPMorgan.","Christopher Michael Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks, and good morning. A couple of margin follow-up questions. So, first, on the capitalized inventory costs, I mean, essentially (40:06) understanding that you'll drive working capital through AP to inventory, but do we just have to get to a point where the inventory growth is less than the sales growth and that capitalized inventory pressure should go away? And how should you think \u2013 how should we think about that occurring during the year?","Thomas Okray - Advance Auto Parts, Inc.","Yeah. Chris, how you should think about that is once we stop reducing inventory versus the prior period then we will no longer have this hit to margin. We're not going to get into specifics about how that's going to play out during the year. Just understand that a priority for us is optimizing our inventory, getting our inventory right-sized because it's just so key in taking care of our customer and getting the right part to them in the right time. But obviously, this will not be part of our long-term cost structure going forward.","Christopher Michael Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Understood. And then, on the SGA front, so a couple of things there. Tom, you mentioned at least $100 million this year of cost. As you think about the discrete items in the fourth quarter that you're attacking, do those turn quickly such that you could see an impact to those line items in the first quarter, or does that build out over the year? And then, just broadly, in that $100 million, does it take time to build that muscle out, such that that $100 million sort of \u2013 it grows at an increasing rate over the year?","Thomas R. Greco - Advance Auto Parts, Inc.","Well, we certainly have a plan to layer productivity on top of productivity. That is the plan. And as I said earlier, Chris, I mean we're trying to make sure that this is sustainable. So, to do that, you do have to make changes in fundamental work processes and design it. You've got to manage change. You've got to move it through the year. And it's not just in SG&A. We're doing that throughout each of our cost lines. So, I think you should expect to see it unfold and build momentum as we drive this thing out. That's what I've experienced in the past.","Productivity, when it's \u2013 when the muscle is lacking, as I mentioned earlier, it has to be built up. The visibility has to be high. You've got to put experts in charge of very specific cost line items inside the organization that can drive best practices that can increase the visibility and really put the kind of action plans in place that are going to take it out permanently, and we've just begun to do that starting at the end of the year, beginning of this year, so you can draw your own conclusions from there.","Christopher Michael Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And then, just on the fourth quarter items, were they \u2013 I guess, were those \u2013 can you attack those quickly? Would you consider those discrete to the fourth quarter, or does that require some muscle build-out?","Thomas R. Greco - Advance Auto Parts, Inc.","A little bit of both, to be honest. I think, in some cases, we need to build a new muscle that just doesn't exist today. In other cases, we should be able to attack them fairly quickly. And honestly, part of it was just straight, nonrecurring. But we're not happy with it. We've got to address it quickly, and we're going to attack these costs with a tremendous amount of intensity, and I'm pretty excited about being able to get those out so we can invest in the customer, which is where we want to make our investment choices.","Christopher Michael Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Understood. Best of luck, guys. Thanks.","Thomas R. Greco - Advance Auto Parts, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ben Bienvenu of Stephens, Inc.","Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning. I'm curious. On some of the frontline improvements that you've made, how far along are you in implementing performance-based compensation? And then, ultimately, what balance of fixed versus variable compensation do you expect to roll out? And then, the turnover trend shift that you mentioned says a lot, but I'm curious if you can provide some additional color on what you're hearing from customer-facing employees in response to those changes you're making.","Thomas R. Greco - Advance Auto Parts, Inc.","Okay. Well, a lot there, Ben. I'll try to be concise. I mean, I think, in terms of the performance-based elements of the compensation, we did introduce more performance-based elements into the compensation last year and we had tremendous response from our team members. They like to be measured on how well they're doing versus their peers versus their goal, and that's something that was lacking, to be honest. So, I feel really good about that.","The fixed versus variable, obviously, when you move to \u2013 more to performance, you're moving more towards variable. We're going to continue to look at ways to do that. We're doing that throughout the organization, not just in our frontline team members. We're doing it in our executive population as well. And the turnover numbers that we've seen in the field have dropped dramatically. We're talking about significant reduction in turnover.","And when you're out there with the stores, they're excited. Their CPPs, their commercial account managers, their general managers are really, really excited about the future of the company, and they're much more engaged in the key things that we're trying to drive through the organization.","So, the frontline of our organization, the independent operators that sweat blood in every single day to drive our business are just central to the success of this business and they are the key lynchpin in the turnaround effort. And getting that moving in the right direction was the critical priority for me, and we're going to continue to stay focused on it.","Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.","That's great. Thanks. And then, Tom, in an answer to an earlier question, you had alluded to improving share momentum. Can you comment \u2013 is your sales improvement a function of slowing share loss or winning share? And if it's winning share, where do you think that share is coming from? Is it bigger share of wallet with existing customers, new business? And then, to the extent you can tell, are you winning from independents or larger competitors?","Thomas R. Greco - Advance Auto Parts, Inc.","Yeah. Obviously, difficult for us to say there, Ben, with this industry where you don't have the kind of market share visibility that I'm accustomed to. So, you're sort of reduced to a fairly limited number of sources including when other people report their sales, which is probably the simplest way to look at it. But we do know that we're making a lot of progress on both sides of our business. Sequentially, we improved comparably, DIY and professional. We know how many customers we're selling to every week. We know what our average sale per customer is on the professional side and we know the parallel metrics on DIY, and we are seeing progress on pretty much every one of those metrics.","So, in terms of geographic performance, it's much more difficult for us to measure that but we improved in every geography in the country. And as I said on the prepared remarks, we had a bigger surge in the North East and the Upper Midwest, and part of that I think was related to the winter demand that we've talked about. But overall, we look very closely at each region of the country every single week and we measure their performance against defined metrics on each of the items that I just mentioned.","Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.","Great. Congratulations on the progress, and best of luck.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dan Wewer of Raymond James.","Dan R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thanks. Tom, in light of where the fiscal year 2016 EBIT margin finished, can you help recalibrate your five-year target? Are we still thinking 500 basis points on top of the 9.4%?","Thomas R. Greco - Advance Auto Parts, Inc.","That's correct.","Dan R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","And one reason I'm asking that is, it's just a modest improvement. In FY 2017, that implies about 150 basis point (48:37) and 120 basis point annual increase for the following four years, which looks a bit aggressive.","Thomas R. Greco - Advance Auto Parts, Inc.","Yeah. I'll give this to Tom.","Thomas Okray - Advance Auto Parts, Inc.","Yeah. Well, let me comment on that. I mean, first of all, I haven't said this yet on the call. While we're happy with the progress we made on the top line, from my perspective, the bottom line is totally unacceptable to us and not where we want to be.","With respect to the aggressiveness, when I was on the last earnings call, I'd been in position a couple of weeks. I can tell you that, since I've been here 100 days or so, there's even more opportunity than I had imagined before I started as well as in those first two weeks of time. There is just a tremendous opportunity for productivity and changing the culture here.","The important thing \u2013 I've got the privilege of working with a great CEO and a great board that doesn't want to do this short-term, wants to do it thoughtfully, understands that we cannot hurt the customer by doing this. So, long story short, I don't think it's aggressive at all. If anything, I am very bullish on our productivity agenda. It's just going to take a while to build the muscle, to go in the depth that we need to go in, to get the right level of focus, to get the right bandwidth and leadership. And I am extremely confident that we will be putting big points on the board.","Dan R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","So, you're not backing off of the 500 basis point increase?","Thomas Okray - Advance Auto Parts, Inc.","Oh, it hasn't crossed my mind once.","Dan R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","And then, just kind of related to that, Advance does own a few businesses that have inherently lower EBIT rates think about a WORLDPAC, vast capital term but (50:32) lower operating margin rate. So, when you set forth that goal of a 14% to 15% EBIT rate, you were including the impact of those lower EBIT businesses that you own. Is that correct?","Thomas R. Greco - Advance Auto Parts, Inc.","Yes, absolutely. And I'll let Bob talk a little bit about WORLDPAC and Autopart International. These are great businesses for us. When we look at the overall math of the company, of course, we're going to look at the portfolio of businesses and arrive at that margin increase based on the expected growth rates within each of those businesses so that, ultimately, what you look at from a total AAP standpoint ladders up to that overall margin improvement.","But I'll let Bob talk a little bit about WORLDPAC and AI because he's overseeing all of our professional businesses, and I think it's important for all of you to understand how he's pulling together a much more cohesive strategy on our professional business.","Robert B. Cushing - Advance Auto Parts, Inc.","Thanks, Tom. And so, importantly for ourselves is we're looking at the customer market-by-market, looking at customer segmentation, who's best served to end up servicing that customer, the requirements of that professional customer. Importantly, when you look at the holistic view of this and you look at the brand and product portfolio that's out there, it's industry-leading. So, from our vantage point, we're going to the market to ensure that we provide the professional customer all that they need.","And so, we're building out the technology. We're building out the catalog. We're building out the B2B portal. We're driving all of that technology to make sure that we have all the business use (52:14) the best of all of them coming to the marketplace to create first-call capability across the enterprise. And I think, both \u2013 for all of North America, Tom mentioned earlier, independents are another critical part to all of that. We're working with them as well.","But I think, importantly, we're bringing the best of all the business units together and taking what we know works best. We have a lot of years of legacy experience on a technology front, certainly, on the catalog over 30 years, on the B2B portal with speed dial over 20 years. So, we know what it takes the demand analytics to drive availability into the marketplace. All of that is being brought to the marketplace today, again, to drive first-call capability across the enterprise.","Dan R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Greg Melich of Evercore ISI.","Greg Melich - Evercore Group LLC","Hi. Thanks. I really have two questions. One, just to make sure, on the top line, I'm getting it right. The holiday shift and weather, you have to put the two quarters together. But did you say \u2013 should we just assume the holiday was 100 basis points just a selling day or how should we think about that?","Thomas R. Greco - Advance Auto Parts, Inc.","Good morning, Greg. I'm not going to give any specifics on that but it's a day, (53:32) January 1 moved, as you know, from 2016 into 2017, which means it's a lower sales day. But it's not insignificant when you consider the professional side of the business, so it's a reasonably good-sized number.","Greg Melich - Evercore Group LLC","Okay. So, we'll assume it's a normal selling day. That will be our estimate. But the \u2013 so, bigger picture, what I wanted to talk about was the three buckets of margin that got hit in the quarter just to think about what's sort of ongoing and what isn't. So, if you had 50 bps each, if the inventory, the investments to serve customers which I guess a lot is the incentive and how you're paying people and then the shortfall in execution, it sounds like the first two buckets of that \u2013 well, the part to serve customers will stay with us. The part to inventory will happen again, but we're not sure when it will happen and then the last bit is the stuff that you can really control and fix. Am I interpreting that correctly?","Thomas R. Greco - Advance Auto Parts, Inc.","You're pretty close. I think, first of all, reducing inventory is absolutely the right thing for our business. We have too much, and we have a lot of duplication. So, we're going to do that thoughtfully, Greg. We \u2013 given the turns of our business and I think you know this, I mean, we've got to be really, really thoughtful about how we reduce inventory and do it in a way that doesn't disrupt our customers and our customer service. But we are going to take our inventory down over time. So, you're going to continue to see that one be a drag.","Obviously, part of the math here is, in the fourth quarter, as we were taking our inventory down, it was lapping a period when we were taking our inventory up. So, that dynamic changes over time, but we are going to continue to reduce inventory.","You are correct, we're going to continue to make investments in our customer. In our overall capital capability, as Bob just said, we want to make sure that we're providing world-class service for our customers, for our independent partners, for our team members to go out there and win in the marketplace.","The third bucket, as you indicated, which was about 30% of the overall margin contraction, that bucket is the one that we're attacking with a tremendous amount of energy on the productivity side. And that will definitely not be part of our long-term cost structure. That's where we're going to get the basis point improvement over time, and that's where we're constructing a zero-based budgeting, overall five-year productivity pipeline to take out.","Greg Melich - Evercore Group LLC","That's great. And then, if I could, in terms of them (56:15) converting to free cash flow, how are you guys thinking about the capital structure, whether it's a year, two, three or four out? Do you have a debt-to-EBITDA target you think is right for the business? Or how should we think about what happens with this $400-million-plus free cash flow, are we just paying down debt? What's...(56:31)","Thomas Okray - Advance Auto Parts, Inc.","Yes. Yeah, Greg, I'll take that one. Our first priority is maintaining our leverage ratio of 2.5% \u2013 I mean, 2.5, I'm sorry. That's our number one priority. Second, investing back in the business, primarily investing in the customer. And then, third, as we said back in November, distributing cash to the shareholders with the preference of share buybacks.","Recognizing that this is a fairly general way of portraying this. We're in discussions with our board and expect a more detailed policy coming out later in the year related to the share buybacks and our capital structure.","Greg Melich - Evercore Group LLC","That's great. Good luck.","Thomas Okray - Advance Auto Parts, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scot Ciccarelli of RBC Capital Markets.","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Good morning, guys. Scot Ciccarelli. Tom, you indicated that a lot of your cost improvement should come from materially changing how you do some of your work. I think we all kind of get the zero-based budgeting. But can you provide maybe one specific example of a process change that you're implementing to drive that productivity improvement?","Thomas R. Greco - Advance Auto Parts, Inc.","Sure, Scot. A best example is probably just how we're delivering parts to customers. We don't use a formal transportation management system to deliver parts at the moment, and we're going to. So, that's just a simple change that I think is fairly common within the industry, where you're able to be a lot more thoughtful about miles driven and more efficient with your driver network.","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets LLC","And is that something that should wind up being kind of an interim process, you make some changes and then you continue to roll out those changes? Or is that kind of a one-time step function?","Thomas R. Greco - Advance Auto Parts, Inc.","Well, just \u2013 that example is probably a little bit unique. In some cases, we're going to get some experience before we roll out. Other ones are kind of no-brainers. So, in this case, that one is. So, we're not going to have a lot of testing on something like that. We know that if I drive 50 miles and I drive 40 miles the next time, that's a good thing. So, those are different situations. They're different situations. But we are going to be very thoughtful about those that affect customer service or potentially compensation-related changes. Those are very, very important and ones you want to absolutely get right. And then, there are some others where just a higher level of visibility, a more focused agenda, a leader who's driving it hard can just drive cost out without that type of testing and that kind of thing.","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Got it. All right. Thanks a lot, guys.","Thomas R. Greco - Advance Auto Parts, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Seth Basham of Wedbush Securities.","Seth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Thanks a lot, and good morning. My question is first around the guidance for operating margin improvement in 2017. I wonder if you could provide any more color between gross margin and SG&A leverage. In other words, would you expect any gross margin improvement in 2017?","Thomas Okray - Advance Auto Parts, Inc.","Yeah. Seth, I'm going to go back to what Tom said earlier in the call. Quite frankly, we're just not running the business that way. We're not looking at chunking into gross margin and SG&A. We're looking at productivity agnostically throughout the P&L. And we're more focused on aligning it to the right person in the organization, making sure that it doesn't hurt the customer, making sure that it provides end-to-end synergies. So we're just not looking at it from a gross margin and an SG&A perspective.","Seth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Okay, fair enough. And my second question is thinking about the distribution center structure going forward. Could you provide a progress update on where you are in terms of integrating the Carquest and the Advance DCs?","Thomas R. Greco - Advance Auto Parts, Inc.","Yeah. We've obviously integrated that agenda into our overall strategic plan. We've got a very clear strategy for the next five years. Within the strategy, we've identified what we call Tier 1 priorities as a fairly small list of those that we're executing against. And part of that is to what we formally called as integrated availability \u2013 we're now calling it streamline supply chain \u2013 is very much a part of that agenda and it's sequenced at the appropriate time.","So we're looking at all of the priorities that we have and, again, as I mentioned, what you do first, second, and third is important, so we have to sequence it because there's an organizational capacity question, and we've worked through that sequencing very deliberately. So it's part of the five-year plan, we absolutely see an opportunity to reduce stem miles and simplify things for the organization, and we'll update you on that when we're in a position to have more clarity on it for you","Seth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","All right. Very good. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matt Fassler of Goldman Sachs.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks a lot, and good morning. My primary question relates to incentive compensation structure. If you could just talk about how much more variable if there's a bit of quantified or described that the comp structure is getting \u2013 just as we think about flow through of incremental sales improvement. So was the fourth quarter an aberration in that regard? Or to the extent that you continue to comp at or above the high end of your range, does the SG&A or at least that piece of the SG&A move fairly closely, aligned with the top line?","Thomas R. Greco - Advance Auto Parts, Inc.","Hey. Morning, Matt.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Good morning.","Thomas R. Greco - Advance Auto Parts, Inc.","First of all the \u2013 what we introduced, really, in the back half of the year is \u2013 does give some more variable compensation for our frontline team members which, as I mentioned, we are so excited about. We had tremendous energy from the team to really grasp a hold of that, so it's now part of our base, certainly, in the back half of the year and we have rolled out a variance on it for 2017 which has, again, has been very well-received by our team members and will drive the kind of discretionary effort that is necessary for us to win customers over time.","So we think it's very important, and ultimately having team members who really know our business, who build genuine relationships with their customers, who go the extra mile to get that part to the customer when they need it is an important part of our agenda. And that cultural shift that we're enacting, of accountability, of taking action, of really driving for results is something that the incentive plan is designed to enable, and I believe it's working.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Very helpful. My second question just is another follow-up on the inventory and gross market question, and I know you've gotten a bunch on this. How much is left in the system for you to flush? Is this all aged inventory? In your view, is this an issue that has a finite end date or at least a finite quantity or \u2013 just trying to understand when we work through this because I know you've talked about it for a while, you've driven it for a while, and you guys have been in place for a while to be able to work through this issue. So are we most of the way, some of the way through this as a drag on the margin rate?","Thomas R. Greco - Advance Auto Parts, Inc.","Well, I mean, we're really looking, Matt, differently, I guess, how we approach this question. We work from the customer back; that's how we're approaching it. We need to get the parts we need closer to our customers, which has required a very different set of rules and principles and thinking, and to do that we're looking at our whole network. We're not looking at, well, gee, I've got this many stores; we're saying, well, wait a minute, I have 40 million square feet of buildings throughout this country that I can position inventory and get parts closer to the customer.","So that order-to-delivery time, which is so critical in our business on the professional side of the business, we're taking that number down. It was down substantially in the fourth quarter and we're going to continue to drive that number down into 2017 and beyond because that's how you win business. That's how you do as Bob talked about in terms of driving first-call advantage.","So it is a very holistic approach on the inventory. We're looking at it broadly and, candidly, we don't have inventory in the right place at the moment, and that's what we're continuing to work through over time. We're going to do it thoughtfully and deliberately, and the goal is to get the parts closer to the customers so we can drive more top line.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.","So is the gross margin impact of that then, essentially, the cost of moving that inventory around as opposed to clearing older inventory which sounds like it might have caused the pressure over the past couple of quarters?","Thomas R. Greco - Advance Auto Parts, Inc.","It's really more of the latter, honestly, in the case of the fourth quarter. It really is this move from the balance sheet to the income statement...","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay.","Thomas R. Greco - Advance Auto Parts, Inc.","...by virtue of taking it down on the Advance side of the equation, by the way.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. All right. Thank you guys so much.","Thomas R. Greco - Advance Auto Parts, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Baker of Deutsche Bank.","Michael Baker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks. Two real quick in the interest of time. One, you said you expect better execution each quarter of the year. Does that mean operating margins up each quarter in the year or is it more likely down in the first half, up in the second half in terms of the operating margins?","Thomas R. Greco - Advance Auto Parts, Inc.","Yeah. Michael, we're not going to give specific quarterly looks. But you know what our laps look like, so I'll let you figure that one out.","Michael Baker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. But we can't necessarily take the comment of expect execution to improve every quarter \u2013 better execution doesn't necessarily mean up year-over-year operating profit. Is that fair to say?","Thomas R. Greco - Advance Auto Parts, Inc.","That's fair.","Michael Baker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Second question, you talked about some of the lead markets getting a meaningful sales lift. How many stores are in those lead markets and so then \u2013 can you quantify the sales differential going forward?","Thomas R. Greco - Advance Auto Parts, Inc.","We have a statistically significant number of stores in the lead markets, I can tell you that. We measured it very \u2013 in a very disciplined fashion, and the sales growth is substantial. So a very, very significant amount of growth experienced based on where we were. We're able to drive meaningful sales lift. And we took elements, we had multiple lead markets that we tested, different elements of the plan, and we've packaged up those elements of the plan into a Blue Book that we're rolling out into stores across the country.","Michael Baker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And that roll-out will be complete in 2017?","Thomas R. Greco - Advance Auto Parts, Inc.","It's going to be over, really, over two years. It's not something you can just immediately do because you've got to make sure \u2013 we're not going to take this to a market unless we're absolutely ready to execute it flawlessly which requires us to look at the leadership team, look at the district managers, look at the general managers, making sure that we've got everything that contributes to success in place, then we're going to roll it out.","We obviously have a plan to do that, but we have also have a readiness assessment that has to be done and has to be passed. It's not an automatic that's coming to a market near you; it has to be passed by the leadership team locally in order for them to get that benefit.","Michael Baker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Finally, and I think it says something about your company's specific turnaround, about an hour and 10 minutes in, and Amazon hasn't been mentioned but, I guess, I'll just ask. As you talk to your field leadership and the people in the stores, how big of an issue do they see Amazon? Is that something that store managers are talking to you a lot about or are they focused elsewhere?","Thomas R. Greco - Advance Auto Parts, Inc.","I've asked the question a lot. I've asked it to hundreds of team members when I'm out there. I'm always interested in how we're doing and who's impacting you and if you noticed and that type of thing. I've talked to a lot of professional customers. I've read all the industry work. Whether it's a DIY customer or professional customer, we've done the \u2013 our own version of that to understand what drives choice for them in key situations.","Amazon's not new to auto parts; they've been around for a long time, and when we benchmark our performance, Bob mentioned speed dial earlier versus Amazon in different aspects of our value proposition, there's some things they do better than we do and there's some things that we do better than they do. But I haven't seen an impact. We have not seen an impact of Amazon on our business at the moment, and we don't see material disruption in the near term from online competition. So I will say that with disruption comes opportunity for us.","So we look at these types of situations as ways for us to rethink our business model and how can we capitalize on the growth, which is clearly we're seeing more move to online, and we want to participate vigorously in that growth but we're doing it on our front foot. We're very excited about the opportunity to pick up more of that business. But we haven't seen a material impact on our business at the moment.","Michael Baker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Appreciate the color. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bret Jordan of Jefferies.","Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC","Hey. Good morning, guys.","Thomas R. Greco - Advance Auto Parts, Inc.","Good morning.","Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC","Question on the supply chain question earlier. I guess as far as integrating the IT and coming up with a common catalog, is that \u2013 you mentioned that was a high priority, but is that not necessarily a 2017 priority anymore?","Thomas R. Greco - Advance Auto Parts, Inc.","That common catalog, Bret? I want to make sure I understand your question.","Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC","Basically having access to Advance and Carquest inventory across both distribution networks.","Thomas R. Greco - Advance Auto Parts, Inc.","Yeah, that is what I was talking about earlier. We do have it on the roadmap. The way it was designed originally, we're refining, let's just say. We see an opportunity to get the benefits of an integrated supply chain without necessarily the kind of cost that was originally contemplated in the plan, and we're pretty excited about that.","We want to make sure that our stores have access to the inventory that's closest to them, but we want to do it in a way that is \u2013 that makes sense and without the kind of investment that was originally contemplated. So we're working through that, and more to come.","Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC","Okay. And then a question for Tom on the accounts payable. It's sort of low 70%s and the debt-to-EBITDAR is just over 2.5 times. Is that something you see getting more leverage out of the AAP and getting the leverage on the balance sheet down in the shorter-term or is that something we'd see more in 2018?","Thomas Okray - Advance Auto Parts, Inc.","I'm not going to comment on the timeframe. It's \u2013 all the discussion on the inventory, it's obviously a big area of focus for us. Not happy with the accounts payable ratio of 71.3%; don't like that at all. We're going to work both the numerator and the denominator very hard.","Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC","Is that 2.6 times debt-to-EBITDAR a limiting factor? I mean, I guess your supply chain or the vendor receivable programs are more expensive as your leverage gets up or is that really not impacting the cost of the program yet?","Thomas Okray - Advance Auto Parts, Inc.","No. Really not a factor at this point.","Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Thomas Okray - Advance Auto Parts, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Bottiglieri of Wolfe Research.","Chris Bottiglieri - Wolfe Research LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Couple of clerical questions to start off with. How many DCs to lead the go to the reduce in (1:13:33) the daily delivery frequency? Are you through that yet or is there still more to come?","Thomas R. Greco - Advance Auto Parts, Inc.","We're pretty much done, Chris. We executed that in the third quarter and fourth quarter. We feel really good about it. Our stores are getting better service. Their accuracy is up, the fill rates are up, and primarily, I think you'll recall, that was in the Northeast. So we're done.","Chris Bottiglieri - Wolfe Research LLC","Got you. Okay. And then it's been a while since you commented on this, but to what extent are Super Hubs still a part of your strategy? Can you quantify how many you have today or \u2013 and how those may or may not be working?","Thomas R. Greco - Advance Auto Parts, Inc.","Yeah. Again, we're working a little bit differently than we have in the past, Chris. We're starting with the customer and we're working back. And the deployment strategy of when in doubt build a Super Hub, we're just not doing that anymore because it doesn't necessarily give us what we need to serve the customer better. So we've rethought the supply chain and the fulfillment process from the customer back, and we're looking at it in the context of what we believe is important for our DIYers and what's important for the professional customers, and we're building it out from there.","And, again, it's not just about, gee, I've got this \u2013 I've got a Hub, I've got a Super Hub, I've got stores, I have 40 million square feet of fulfillment centers that I'm going to use to get my inventory positioned properly, and I'm going to get it in a place where I can get it to the customer faster and more accurately and more reliably and predictably than before. So it's a bit of a terminology shift for us. I appreciate that from your side of the desk, but we're really excited about that approach and so are our people.","Chris Bottiglieri - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Cool. And then just one big picture question. It seems like, from my outside perspective, that it seems like a lot of the suppliers in the news more recently. So one, that you had this unique opportunity to come in as a fresh face to the industry and meet with a lot of the suppliers for the first time. How would you characterize overall industry dynamics in relationship between suppliers and retailers?","And then secondly, could it be, anecdotally, tell us on \u2013 in some ways that suppliers are supporting you in your turnaround?","Thomas R. Greco - Advance Auto Parts, Inc.","Well good question. I mean, first of all we are really reliant on our suppliers. They're really partners to us in this journey. Bob can speak to some of the ones that we've forged the strongest partnerships with over the years. But I can tell you all of them want to see AAP do well in the marketplace. I think that's important for them, and it's important for us, and we want to see them do well.","It's really important that their partnership allows us to really drive our agenda. We have a wide range of brands in our house with Bob's leadership of WORLDPAC, with our private label at Autopart International, and with the many branded players that we have. They're critical for our success, so we've been very excited about how engaged they've been as we've built out our journey, and we're going to build on that. I think there's an opportunity for us to forge even deeper relationships with our supplier partners, and you can count on us to do that going forward.","Chris Bottiglieri - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks for the help. Appreciate it.","Operator","Our final question today comes from Carolina Jolly of Gabelli.","A. Carolina Jolly - G.research LLC","Oh, great. Thanks for sticking me in last minute. Just wanted to ask about the do it for me versus do it yourself. I know they performed similarly this quarter. Can you talk about if you've seen any segment kind of performed better relative to self? So any stronger improvement in either segment?","Thomas R. Greco - Advance Auto Parts, Inc.","Sorry. Segment performed better to what? Sorry, Carolina?","A. Carolina Jolly - G.research LLC","Do it yourself (1:17:29). So has either of them kind of \u2013 have you seen accelerated improvement in either of those segments?","Thomas R. Greco - Advance Auto Parts, Inc.","Yes. We saw it in both and it was proportionately similar. We've had really good success, as Bob alluded to in the professional side, regaining momentum with professional customers, picking up more customers, and also selling more to the customers we have on the professional side.","On DIY, honestly, we're \u2013 our team members are really helping us here. They've always wanted to serve our customers better, and we're now giving them the tools to do that. We measure our performance there, obviously, in terms of our customer hotline; we measure it in terms of social media reviews. I can tell you our social media reviews in DIY are up by a factor \u2013 not by percentage terms; they're up by a factor \u2013 and we're really excited about that because our team members are really putting the customer first and they're caring about them, as are our independent partners.","So when we put the customer first on the professional side, we gain more business; and when we do so on the DIY side we earn that extra trip, that extra item in the basket. So we're growing proportionately with the two groups, and both are critical to our long-term success.","A. Carolina Jolly - G.research LLC","Perfect. Thanks.","Operator","At this time there are no further questions. I will turn the call back to our CEO, Tom Greco, for closing comments.","Thomas R. Greco - Advance Auto Parts, Inc.","Well I'd like to thank all of you for joining the call. As we step back and think about 2016, it was a challenging year for Advance. I mean, our team members experienced just a tremendous amount of change last year starting with my appointment in April, but given the level of changes we implemented I'm very encouraged with the overall progress. And I'd like to thank all of our team members and all of our independent partners who care for our customers every day out there in the marketplace. They're putting the first back in customer first, and it was really their dedicated commitment and focus on the customer in the back half of the year that enabled us to deliver a strong finish and a positive top line that improves share.","So going forward, our overarching focus is clear: we're going to put the customer first, we're always going to do that, and our goals remain clear. And we plan to accelerate sales growth to above the industry average, and we're going to close the margin gap versus our competition. So to achieve it, we're evolving the culture of the company to one that's excessively focused on the customer and one with an exceedingly high level of accountability, ownership, and drive for results.","So we're really excited about 2017. We'll be working with a high level of urgency to deliver on our objectives, and we look forward to updating you again on our progress next quarter. And thanks, again, for joining our call.","Operator","That concludes our call today. You may now disconnect. Thank you for joining us."],"610":["Advance Auto Parts, Inc.

If you have any objection, you may disconnect at this time.","Before we begin, Zaheed Mawani of Investor Relations will make a brief statement concerning forward-looking statements that will be made on this call.","Zaheed Mawani","Good morning, and thank you for joining us on today's call to discuss our fourth quarter results. I'm joined this morning by George Sherman, our President and Interim CEO; and Mike Norona, our Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, I would like to remind you that our comments today contain forward-looking statements we intend to be covered by and we claim the protection under the Safe Harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

The company intends these forward-looking statements to speak only as of the time of this conference call, and does not undertake to update or revise them as more information becomes available.","Now let me turn the call over to George, our Chief Executive Officer. George?","George Sherman","Thanks, Zaheed and good morning, everyone. We will take a different approach on today's call. First Mike and I will briefly address fourth quarter performance. Then I will share my perspective regarding our outlook and how we plan to drive improved execution and results going forward. We will leave plenty of time at the end for your questions. Let me get right into it.","Mike will address our fourth quarter results in more detail in a moment, but at a high level our worse than expected top line performance reflected both the negative impact of warmer weather and the continued impact of our efforts to move quickly to capture efficiencies through integration which inadvertently led to disruption in servicing our customers and supporting our stores. This combination of factors resulted in negative comparable sales of 2.5%. We are not satisfied with these results.","We have, however, made considerable progress and believe many of the major execution challenges are behind us. That being said, we still have work to do to drive efficiency across the company. As I said, we have made progress and let me be clear that we fully understand that we are in improvement mode.","Several big parts of integration are now completed including corporate consolidations, the integration of our field teams and pricing alignment work. In addition, we have completed the first major tranche of the CARQUEST market conversions and substantially all of our product alignment work. We also made significant progress in our cost cutting initiatives in 2015 delivering over $50 million in incremental cost synergy savings and driving efficiency by closing approximately 80 underperforming stores.","Through actions to-date we have mitigated the disruption caused by integration work and we are moving ahead with our plans to deliver improved and more consistent performance. Going forward, we will focus on continuing the CARQUEST market conversion program and building on our prior success which has enabled us to deliver mid single-digit comps across multiple markets where conversions have only taken place. We're also doing the work to align our supply chain and stores systems.","As we exit 2015, we begin to see improvement in our store level availability. In the field, our teams are refocusing in our base business and away from the integration efforts that dominated much of 2015. We are clear eyed about the work that lies ahead, but confident in our ability to enhance our efficiency, performance and profitability. In a few moments, I will talk about our plans to implement more field-centric organization, drive additional cost reductions and relentlessly pursue opportunities to increase efficiency across our operations.","But first let me turn it over to Mike to provide some brief context on the quarter. Mike?","Mike Norona","Thanks, George, and good morning everyone. We delivered comparable cash EPS of $1.22 for the fourth quarter despite the softer than expected sales. This result included a $0.03 hit from foreign currency and a $0.03 benefit from the incremental synergy realization.","Fourth quarter net sales declined 2.6% with comparable sales down 2.5%. Comparable store sales were negatively impacted by approximately 90 basis points due to the timing of the New Year's day holiday which was in our 53rd week last year and 46 basis points of negative foreign currency impact partially offset by favorable impact from our CARQUEST store consolidations.","The unseasonably warm start to the winter impacted both our commercial and DIY businesses particularly in batteries and cold weather related hard parts categories such as starters, alternators and related products. With fewer customers seeking cold weather products this also resulted in lower add-on sales. Partially offsetting this performance was continued strong results in our brake business across both our commercial and DIY businesses.","In our commercial business, performance was primarily driven by mid single digit sales declines in our Great Lakes and Plains cold weather markets while the mid-South and Southeast fared better. The softness in seasonal category sales was partially offset by a modest increase in our commercial ticket size and the strength I noted in our brake business. Nonetheless, we continue to expand our customer base with our national accounts business growing in the mid-single digits and TECHNET, which partners with independent repair shops adding 600 new members in the quarter.","Within DIY strong brake results only partially offset the softness in battery and battery accessory sales as well as other winter seasonal categories resulting in a sequential decline. Despite the softness, we continue to expand our Speed Perks program which now has over 10 million members and will be an important driver of our ability to increase customer loyalty going forward.","Our gross profit rate decline of 15 basis points was primarily the result of supply chain expense deleverage due to the comparable store sales decline partially offset by lower shrink expenses. Our fourth quarter comparable SG&A rate increased 33 basis points year-over-year primarily due to the expense deleverage from the comp store sales decline partially offset by our continued cost reduction initiatives and disciplined efforts to lower administrative and support cost. All in, fourth quarter operating income on a comparable basis decreased 8.2% to $157.6 million and a comparable operating margin decreased 48 basis points over the same period last year to 7.7%.","Free cash flow for 2015 was $454.9 million versus $480.5 million last year driven by a decrease in our AP ratio to 76.7% versus 78.6% last year. This decrease was principally driven by transitional inventory growth resulting from our product integration work, the CARQUEST consolidations work and the growth in the Worldpac branches.","Turning to the balance sheet and leverage, adjusted debt to EBITDAR was 2.5 times at year end. During the quarter we have paid $80 million in debt and remained at or below our maximum stated leverage ratio of 2.5 times. We are committed to preserving a balanced and disciplined approach to capital application to drive shareholder value while maintaining our investment-grade ratings.","We remain focused on taking the actions required to achieve our 12% adjusted operating income margin target. To reach this objective we will deliver improved gross margins and reduce cost by approximately 100 basis points through a combination of G&A reductions and improved store productivity. This includes capturing the remaining $50 million of our previously disclosed $160 million in cost synergies.","Before I turn it back to George, let me touch briefly on the remaining integration initiatives we are pursuing in 2016. We're focused on two areas. One, continued execution of CARQUEST market conversion programs and two, development and testing to enable us to combine our AP and CARQUEST supply chain and store systems into one network. We're also pursuing supply chain optimization work including the closing of our Sutton, Massachusetts distribution center. In conjunction with these efforts, we expect to incur additional one-time costs of $75 million to $90 million in 2016 including $65 million to $75 million related to ongoing integration efforts and $10 million to $15 million related to supply chain optimization work.","We are pleased with our progress in our CARQUEST conversion markets nearly all of which are experiencing comp increases which average in the mid to upper single digits in the fourth quarter. This year we plan to execute approximately 350 market conversion projects.","In terms of our store network and supply chain projects, we expect to begin in-store system pilots by early quarter two and supply chain pilots in early quarter four. As previously indicated, full-scale rollout is expected to be in 2017.","With that, let me turn it back to George to discuss our plans for 2016 and beyond. George?","George Sherman","Thanks, Mike. We have a tremendous platform across commercial and DIY and I am confident in our ability to drive improved profitability and generate increased shareholder value. As I noted at the outset, our plans include implementing a more field-centric organization to drive increased customer satisfaction and improved repeat business and revenue while reducing cost and relentless pursuing opportunities to drive additional operational efficiencies","We are company made up of approximately 5,300 hyper local businesses. In order to be successful, we must meet the needs of our customers at a local level by aggressively empowering our teams to make decisions in their local markets and providing the appropriate operational infrastructure to executive against those decisions. Developing a field-centric system is not a concept, but it\u2019s something that we are in the early stages of executing.","There are three key pillars that underpin our objectives as a field-centric organization. One, providing superior availability to ensure we deliver the right part, at the right place, at the right time. Two, providing the right infrastructure to achieve outstanding customer service with flawless execution. And three, providing the right tools and incentives to develop focused and inspired teams with the desire to win.","Let me share a few insights on each. Superior availability, having the right part in the right place at the right time is essential to winning a great commercial business and also benefits DIY. Because we run approximately 5,300 local commercial businesses, serving the customer requires input from and empowerment of local store teams. Trying to manage those 5,300 businesses with central office is both inefficient and ineffective. We are changing that.","In order to drive more effective local execution, we are investing to improve inventory coverage to support our stores while simultaneously developing a field-centric process that empowers the general managers of the stores to make decisions and tailor their inventories to best serve the unique local customer base. We are piloting this process in five regions and while it is very early in the program, we are seeing high levels of store engagement and believe it will translate to improved commercial sales over time. The goal is clear, having the right part in the right place at the right time.","We will continue to leverage our in-market hub and super-hub stores and expand delivery frequency to stores from our DCs, but we will do so on the most efficient basis. We are making sure to rethink our supply chain and delivery frequency by first determining the best answer for each store and its customers. [indiscernible] provide the best in-stock and availability and therefore the best overall service for our customer.","Actively determining the optimal goal for the stores, we can then determine the most effective and efficiency supply chain delivery process and system. That means where it will make sense to have daily delivery, we will have it, but daily delivery is not an answer by itself. Delivery scheduling is a means to provide the stores with what they need to satisfy the customer. Field delivery will not be justified for every store. We are looking at delivery frequency, end market availability, outgoing frequency and evaluating which combination is the best local market answer to enable us to serve our customers most effectively.","Second, outstanding customer service. We are laser-focused on achieving excellence in commercial through flawless execution. Unlike the retail side of the business, our interactions with commercial customers take place on a daily basis. We believe we do a great job focusing on commercial and we will naturally build the availability and the can do attitude in the stores will also help retail. With average commercial sales of approximately $730,000 per program, we are already among the industry leaders, but we can do more as we shift our identity from a retail culture to a commercial focus.","We know that as we do a better job servicing our commercial customers, we will then drive frequency. To be clear, while it will be a commercial-first organization, we will not lose focus on DIY. Commercial is our most significant growth opportunity, but we believe our commercial focus will have synergistic benefits to DIY because the same fundamentals apply across the businesses. We continue to be focused on growing our Speed Perks membership program and satisfying our DIY customers through our knowledgeable team members in well-placed locations.","In 2016, we will be investing to further develop great commercial field and store teams, deliver focused sales and service execution and scale key programs such as our strategic accounts and membership programs like TECHNET and Pro Rewards.","Our third pillar, having focused and aspired team is about inspiring and powering those teams by providing them incentives and support that positions them to win. Our first step is to provide our teams with broader authority as business owners. We are improving our communication approach to support the sales organization versus an operational organization.","As part of this, I engage directly every quarter with our field organization leadership to address business priorities, yield centric leadership and changes throughout the organization in an unfiltered manner. I want to make sure they hear directly from me about our goals, expectations and challenges as we develop greater accountability and transparency across the organization.","In addition, we're positioning our stores to have a simplified and customer focused operating model. We are also working to limit disruptions across the system so our store and regions can focus on the vital business priorities we have ahead of us this year. We are also testing new compensation approaches to support fuel centric ownership mentality. As we execute against these three pillars we are focused on continuing to drive improvements across the organization to deliver profitable growth. Let me clear, but we see opportunities to take cost out to improve efficiency that does not affect the customer experience. We will move in an aggressive pace and prioritize our actions accordingly. This means not only capturing remaining cost saving synergies we highlighted but continuing to look for other ways to further reduce costs.","It means examining structural changes to optimize our supply chain such that our plans to open a new DC in Nashville Tennessee and close our DC in Southern Massachusetts. We will continue to focus on improving productivity and profitability across our strong base. We are now applying a higher threshold of performance acceptability to stores and continue to look at all parts of our business to improve returns. We expect to take further actions to address underperforming assets and unnecessary costs. We will make sure to analyze all customer facing cost saving opportunities with a strong balance towards improving service levels. We are looking at all areas and want to make the best decision possible.","This work does not happen overnight but we will follow the analysis where it leads and take the appropriate steps to continue to improve performance and drive value. The bottom line is clear, we must drive improved profitability as we grow our topline. Our comps will grow up and our customers can rely in us to get them the parts they want, when they want them. We must execute flawlessly for the customer by becoming a commercial first business with leading parts availability, great teams and efficient operations.","Turning to our outlook for 2016. We expect modest topline growth driven by comparable store sales in the low single digits. We also expect to open 65 to 75 new stores including four to six Worldpac branches and one new Worldpac distribution center. At the same time, we are maintaining tight control over costs and we are laser focused on achieving stated 12% adjusted operating margin goal for 2016, which is not changed.","In closing, the changes we are making to our organization are both real and substantial. We began to make the shift to operating our businesses more locally and will keep advancing that agenda. Our teams know our customers best and they\u2019re embracing their new responsibilities as we drive more local decision-making. I've been equally impressed with the pace and commitment in which our store support center teams have enthusiastically shifted decision-making.","I see the responsibility in some cases while accepting greater accountability in others with a singular focus on winning the market. I'm also encouraged by the ability of our organization to learn and adapt. Ensuring we don't repeat mistakes of either action or inaction. We are making the right decisions to change our profit formula to yield better outcomes. Finally, before we open up to your questions, I\u2019d like to take a moment to thank all of our team members for their continued focus and commitment to customer service.","With that let\u2019s open up the call for questions?","Question-And-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Simeon Gutman of Morgan Stanley. Ma\u2019am your line is open.","Simeon Gutman","Thanks. Good morning. First question is, can you comment on how Q1 is running and if you're seeing some improvement? Is that attributable to weather getting better or something strategic, meaning execution is starting to get better?","George Sherman","If you look at Q1 so far sequentially we\u2019ve seen some progress but it is not up to what our expectations are right now. We started of flat, we\u2019re actually in a period now where we\u2019re going up against our strongest comps from last year. So we are seeing some moment we expect more we have a plan that we intend to execute throughout the year. So we're not sitting back hoping for the weather to change we are executing fundamental execution issues that we think will affect our business really around the availability in service areas. So early on really premature call again we\u2019re only a period or so into the year but we have every expectation that we\u2019re going to begin to get them up to our expectations.","Simeon Gutman","And I will ask my follow-up and just a clarification on what - on that as a question. The improvement you're seeing in - or you said flat but not up to your expectations. Is that in weather markets getting better or did you see maybe something that at the margin on execution get better? And then my real follow-up, is if you talk about the distribution model the supply chain, do you feel any different about how it positions today or and functionality when you bought it anything capacity Howard said of geographically your ability to service the entire store base?","George Sherman","I\u2019ll start with the sales Simeon and say that just broadly again, we\u2019re seeing obviously pockets of strength and pockets of weakness as we always do. So there is always going to be some variability geographically but broadly still not where we wanted to be. Still we\u2019re working on improving it overall. From a supply chain standpoint, the biggest change we've seen so far and we\u2019ve mentioned this is obviously we have 1300 stores now from advance that are on multi-day delivery and we've made changes to the - upgrades to the AP network in terms of DCs. We've also put capacity adjustments in some of the Carquest distribution centers as well.","Simeon Gutman","Okay and just to clarify, if I'm not cut off, then back to the comp question. As you note, comps are to be expected to be flat - I'm sorry, positive low single digits by the end of the year. Is it a sequential ramp or is it very back-end loaded by the way you guys are modeling it out?","George Sherman","It\u2019s not back-end loaded, it\u2019s a sequential improvement along the way, it has to do with obviously some of the trends from last year that we're going up against but it has more to do with the initiatives we are executing.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Lasser of UBS. Sir your line is open.","Michael Lasser","Thanks a lot for taking my question. It's going to be about bridging the margin from the 10.2% that you achieved in last year to the 12% in 2016 so you're going to need about 180 basis points of expansion. It sounds like you're going to get 100 basis points from the cost reduction initiative, another 50 basis points from the synergy realization. And then are we to assume the last portion is from gross margin expansion and how visible is that SG&A improvement that you are expecting for 2016 so if your sales fall short of your expectation, what's the sensitivity to your margin if that happens?","George Sherman","Obviously our plan is for 12% which we recognize - we are clearly improvement mode on. So it requires a combination of working the cost lever, working gross margin and clearly, there is a levers component to it as well. We've gone to great efforts to work hard on the cost components of this and we\u2019re working equally or doubly hard on sales right now. Cost we can control right away, so we\u2019ve made some improvements and you're right we're going to take a big chunk out of our cost structure. And we're going to continue to look for ways in and begin to find more and more of it. So we\u2019re not stopping at 100 basis points or stopping at any one fixed number we keep looking to fund more and more cost to take to streamline this operation build efficiency and really frankly limit the amount of work load that it gets send on to our stores. So we will make adjustments on a lower comp if that in fact is would happens, we do clearly have expectations around leverage as part of this - a part of 12%","Michael Lasser","And George, it sounds like it\u2019s part of the margin expectations; you are anticipating some benefit from a change in the store operating model and the pilot of the change in store compensation model. What have you seen already from those tests and how quickly do you expect that you will be able to roll them out?","George Sherman","From a store operating standpoint Michael we are beginning to see some change especially from the empowerment initiatives. So I think one of the biggest things that we're working on right now is a quick move toward fuel centricity. We recognized that we won very, very local businesses and they are all unique in their own way. We feel that we can get things 90% plus right out of the support center but we\u2019re empowering our teams to take up the rest of the way to 100%. So they now have more and more autonomy over adding SKUs to their assortment and adding more product to the supply chain system. We think that will have some of the most immediate benefits.","The single selling model is you know we are in sustained mode on that one. The team is becoming more and more comfortable with it and we believe that fundamentally is the right thing to do is serve all customers that walk in or call our stores. And as a business that's been quite outspoken about being commercial first, everyone needs to be willing and able to be pick up the telephone and help the commercial customer or hop into a truck and make a delivery. So we're pleased with that aspect of it. The compensation pilot is just that. It's a pilot in a limited amount of stores that is not having much impact nor it is intended to right now across the entire chain of stores. It\u2019s a learning event for us right now and my focus is to get the empowerment to the field that allow us for a true sense of business ownership before putting in a compensation system that rewards business ownership.","Operator","Our next question comes from Seth Basham of Wedbush Securities. Your line is open.","Seth Basham","Thanks a lot and good morning. Just to follow-up on some of the earlier questions to make sure I understand your bridge from where you're running right now with comp store sales-wise to a low single digits. In terms of the largest drivers of that improvement, does it have to do with how you're going about changing the skew availability to stores or there are other support initiatives that you have that you think will be the drivers here?","George Sherman","It's a combination of both. So if you ask is it SKU availability, we're going to absolutely say yes to that question every time. Our business fundamentally is quite simple, a customer asks us if we have the part and can we get it to them quickly and that is how we operate and that's how we rum and that's how we will drive comps over time. So yes to having the part is absolutely critical for us and getting availability right and we feel that we\u2019ve made some good progress on that is absolutely job one for us. That being said there are the initiatives that have an impact on comp sales during the course of the year. Certainly our consolidation of Carquest Stores will impact our comp sales. The Speed Perks Program at 10 million members will impact our comp sales. More investments in inventory and hubs will affect our comp stores and the move to multi-day delivery will affect comp sales as well. So we have a waterfall of activities that we\u2019ve built up that we think will drive comp sales methodically but clearly it starts with availability.","Seth Basham","Okay. Good. Thank you and just a follow-up to that. Do you think about your progression in comps in 2015 and the deterioration over the year? When you diagnosed that, how much of it is due to lost customers on the commercial side and where do you think your ability us to win back those lost customers?","George Sherman","I probably make a distinction Seth and say that its lost business on the commercial side as opposed to lost customers on the commercial side. If we lose some of course we did, we know that. But we point to categories like our strength in brakes as an indicator that we still have a healthy base of commercial customers who are still buying from us. We need to sell them the entire car. So, going back and just trying to re-establish connections with customers is difficult but trying to expand our base of business with existing customers is a more attainable objective certainly.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scot Ciccarelli of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Scot Ciccarelli","Good morning, guys. So last quarter, you guys referred to roughly 10% of your sales base comping down over 10%. That was the 120 basis point drag you referenced and I think the suggestion was those stores were undergoing significant changes but you've also referred to stores in markets that comp in the mid- to upper single digits where they have undergone all the changes and the businesses had a chance to settle into a natural rhythm. I guess what I'm curious about is better understanding the cadence of sales changes in a specific market. In other words what happens to comps when the changes first start? How long do these disruptions last? And then when do you start to see the improvements? And I know that there's a bunch of different items that have been obviously along the way.","George Sherman","Yes, thanks, Scot. Good morning. Let me try to take that in sequence. I think if you look at first of all, our comments around what you\u2019re describing our outlier stores, which was a group of stores that disproportionately affected our sales miss, couple of actions there. Number one, as we previously mentioned and mentioned in the script, we closed some stores during the course of the fourth quarter. You can fully expect that there were among those bottom 10% performers. So that\u2019s a small group of stores, and that\u2019s not the entire difference. We also are moving into a period right now where we are currently executing accelerated consolidations of poor performing stores. So in this case, specific Carquest stores that were not meeting our expectations that we have now begun to consolidate into Advance Auto Parts stores and that will solve for another tranche of the stores. There are still outlier stores and there will be. So our field teams has continued to work on the performance of some of our outliers.","As you look at the consolidation or the market conversions and looked at results, we are generally pleased and we are pretty much pleased across the board. So that number, that initial number that you referred to clearly inflated due to the Carquest conversions. So once the market begins to undergo conversion, there is as you would expect a negative sales impact. And it really lasts for anywhere from five to six weeks. So we see this period of about a month to a month and half when there is actually physical construction going on in the stores, team members are changing, parts are changing in some cases that we see comps go down, and then we see it ramp back up. And our effort has been to take that time period and compress it as much as possible and we have. So in the early consolidations, it was a longer period of time. So we have seen that narrow down pretty nicely overtime to the point where and obviously, we will work to continue and improve that to be shorter and shorter. But it\u2019s about five to six weeks that there is a negative impact and then the store begins to merge with better results, and then generally shows up in the form of double-digit comps, showing up clearly in consolidations and anywhere from single - mid-single to high-single to up to double-digit comps in our conversion stores.","Scot Ciccarelli","And so are there an - George, are there any markets where you have done the conversion, but haven't seen that kind of result?","George Sherman","You know, of all the conversions that we have done, there are one, maybe two markets where it\u2019s been strictly limited to just conversion, not consolidating two boxes, but just conversion that we have seen flattish results and that we are working to improve. By and large, the overwhelming majority of the markets have had kind of results that we wanted.","Scot Ciccarelli","Got you. And understood. And then secondly, payables to inventory ratio, it's obviously a huge cash flow driver for your industry. You guys are still performing well below your direct peers. What's the right way to think about that kind of ratio going forward and the impact on the cash flow? Thanks.","George Sherman","Yes, look, we obviously want to work to continue to drive our AP ratio. We will focus on taking inventory out. We do have some specific vendor focuses. So as you look at our AP ratio, you look at our base of business, we have a fairly targeted list of those that we are negotiating with to make some changes on AP ratio. At the same time, we are being very clear that availability is job one. So we don\u2019t want to send mixed signals to our team. We have got to be in stock, we have got to have the parts that the customer wants when they want it.","Scot Ciccarelli","Okay, thanks a lot guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dan Wewer of Raymond James. Sir, your line is open.","Dan Wewer","Thanks. George, on the sales lift in the conversion stores, I guess you're calling out 5% to 12% increases, is that primarily the do-it-yourself revenues kicking in with the availability of the advanced do-it-yourself assortment in those Carquest stores or is it the commercial revenues picking up?","George Sherman","Dan, it\u2019s a combination of both. So when we talk about our conversion store, we are simply rebranding. We are going into Carquest for making it an Advance Auto Parts store. We are enhancing the sales floor in those cases. So we do see and we do expect to see a DIY lift in those stores and we have been seeing it. That said, that brings an additional commercial business as well, so we have been pleased on both fronts. But you\u2019re right, as we convert stores, our real expectation is around trying to bring a little bit of DIY to a store that\u2019s historically not had.","Dan Wewer","And on the consolidation, so are you still seeing 70% to 80% of the commercial business in that consolidated store transferring to the remaining Advance store?","George Sherman","Yes, we\u2019re Dan, 70% closer to the right number.","Dan Wewer","And of the 325 to 350 consolidations and conversions for this year, how does that split out between the two? I know the economics are very different between a consolidation and a conversion but so how would that split out between those two types of projects?","George Sherman","Roughly 50-50.","Dan Wewer","50-50. And then the last question I have, on the expense reduction goal of 100 basis points, and then if you assume that, that 50 basis points of the synergies, maybe that flows into expenses as well, that would imply that expense dollars are roughly flat, it looks like in 2016 compared to 2015 adjusting for the 53rd week. How much of that\u2019s already been achieved through closing the 80 underperforming stores through the consolidations at the corporate office. How much of that expense savings has already been achieved and how much of it has yet to be achieved?","George Sherman","Dollars are actually down, so not flat, but down the last year, and we continue to accelerate on that and look for more opportunities. And I want to be clear, we won\u2019t do things that\u2019s caught in a sales muscle. So when we talk about SG&A, we are primarily talking about G&A and we continue to look for more and more opportunities, but if we make substantial progress, dollars will be down.","Dan Wewer","So the biggest variable in achieving the 12% EBIT rate, whether or not you achieve that, really is a function of whether or not the comps are flat or maybe up 2%. And then to a lesser extent, whether or not you can deliver on the gross margin gain, it sounds like the cost reduction, therefore that's - there's no way that you can miss on that.","George Sherman","Yes, we know the size of the improvement that it represents, 10% to 12% and it certainly would be aided quite a bit by the top line that we expect. So the leverage portion of this is important, but we have clearly over-indexed on the expense side.","Dan Wewer","Right. Okay, great thanks and good luck.","Operator","Our next question comes from Greg Melich of Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Greg Melich","Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to make sure I understood the charges, Mike that you outlined and sort of what's incremental and what was in the plan and what I should compare that to. So the incremental $75 million to $90 million of charges, would that compare to what was $127 million in 2015 and $82 million in 2014?","Mike Norona","Yes, so Greg, we gave an outlook of $75 million to $90 million and $65 million to $75 million of that would be comparable to the last year portion and those relate to the market conversions, and the IT projects around the catalog and the store systems. So those are primarily the driver as we think in 2016, and those are comparable to the one-time cost we would have seen last year. And then the $10 million to $15 million is our supply optimization work that really gets going this year and a big driver of that is the Sutton DC that we are going to be closing down this year.","Q - Greg Melich","Got it. And my follow-up will be going back to the sales trend, George, which is, do you have a - what really happened with DIY versus do-it-for-me in the quarter? You gave some nice category issues in some of the regions, but if you look at basically what were the two sides of the business or what were the sales, however you want to cut it.","George Sherman","Yes, I mean, really we had softness in both sides of the business and when we talk about weather, which we don\u2019t like talking about, that clearly represents more of an impact on DIY in specifically a category like batteries. So we had some great strength that we went up against in batteries and we didn\u2019t see the cold this time around and that just based on the one line alone has a pretty significant impact on the DIY business, but it was both parts, weather on the DIY side.","Q - Greg Melich","And, Mike, just a follow-up to the previous one, just do you have an EPS range guidance that falls out of this? I mean, if you just take the margin and the comp, you get to something like $9.50, at least that's my back-of-the-envelope math, but am I still missing something there?","Mike Norona","Yes. So I am not going to comment on that, Greg, but what I will tell you is, we gave today - we gave in the release, our assumptions and they reflect the most important outcomes that we are focused on this year, which is improving our profitability and improving our sales and we remain committed to our 12% target. Given the variability and the range of our comps, and trying to predict where we will fall in that range, and as we are building momentum, and also the structural moves that we are going to continue to do to improve to move to more field-centric and localized business, we have chosen not to try to predict an outlook range. But we think we have given you the assumptions that reflect the outcomes that we are expecting this year.","Q - Greg Melich","Great. Thanks. Good luck.","Operator","Our next comes from Tony Cristello of BB&T Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Tony Cristello","Thank you. Good morning, thank you for taking my questions. First part is a bigger picture. You talk about the field-centric approach, and two of the categories being availability and infrastructure. And what I'm wondering is how much does 2016 cover for those two buckets versus how much will be left to get you where you really want to be in 2017 and 2018? And I'm just trying to understand, is this a shift in terms of trajectory of where you were taking your business and is it now another two or three years to get you where you need to be?","George Sherman","No, Tony. It\u2019s George, I\u2019d call it a stair-step approach. I mean, we have been talking about customer, our field centricity for well over 18 months, we have just accelerated our pace pretty substantially. So I would not look at this as a multi-year rebuilding process, but I will look at it as an evolution that\u2019s already begun and that we have taken very substantial steps toward accelerating in the past quarter. So it really is - I mean, we are not trying to flip how we buy our inventory merchandise. We are simply giving our team in the field an ability to take a limited portion based on what they see as specific need for their customers and get it right, and we just don\u2019t feel like 5,300 times over. We can have a level of exactitude out of those office that reflects what\u2019s happening in the field and we want to empower our field team to make - to put in those difference makers to get it from maybe 90% to 100% correct. So hyper local business, especially for commercial and we feel like the team needs to have a say on how they are assorted, what the quantities look like, because they know the changes to the businesses faster than our systems were able to detect them.","Tony Cristello","And then on that, so it sounds like the systems, going into next year should be in place for what you need?","George Sherman","Yes, I mean, I think the systems are very quickly falling in the place right now. So we are moving very, very fast on this, again, we do not look at this as a multi-year project, we look at this as a shift in some decision rights, we look at this as being a more effective listening organization and we think it properly orients around our whole what matters most, which is our customer and our store teams.","Tony Cristello","Okay. And then I guess the one follow-up here is on the infrastructure. Do you have an update on how you would see this infrastructure best in place to meet the needs of fulfilling and availability? I mean, what changes still remain in order to get you the fill rates that you're still not at?","George Sherman","Yes, Tony, I think if you look at multi-delivery for instance, we said I think that we would try to tailor that to our specific customers\u2019 needs and there is a formula in every market that we think is the right outcome that's best to serve our customer. That maybe 5X delivery, that could be 3X delivery. That may be five hub runs a day. That may be seven hub runs a day. That may be an in-market super hub, may not be. So it is just, it is calibrating our market needs to the needs of the customers, the pace of the commercial business and making sure that it\u2019s right. So we still continue to work to the formula, we feel great about some markets and we clearly recognize that we have opportunities in other markets.","Tony Cristello","Okay. But you have enough distribution capacity in place, it's just reworking that or do you still think you're going to need to be adding as we move forward?","Mike Norona","We have the infrastructure in place, we will upgrade three DCs in 2016. So we will begin to add further capacity to those facilities. We\u2019ll also add seven new superhubs in 2016. So we will look and we will find those market opportunities where they exist and will make those changes, but largely we feel we have the infrastructure in place.","Tony Cristello","Okay, great. Thanks for your time.","Mike Norona","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matthew Fassler of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Matthew Fassler","Thanks a lot. Good morning. My first question is just to quantify the number of stores that are in that, the conversion markets that are generating those mid-single digit to high single digit increases and then just to quantify the number of stores that you would expect to enter similar stage of integration or emerge from the similar stage of integration in \u201816?","George Sherman","Matt, we\u2019ve touched roughly one-third of our stores with the conversion consolidation relocation activity. So, about a third of the Carquest stores that needed to be addressed. We will hit 350 more this year and as I mentioned earlier, about a 50-50 split between conversions and consolidations. So some of those will just merge with an Advance store and drop onto the system.","Matthew Fassler","So the rough number of stores, that's comping mid to high single, are you saying that's a third of the Carquest stores?","George Sherman","It's not quite that high of a number. Remember, we'd done 100 early consolidations, then we did during 2015 and we will do about 175 more in 2016. These are conversions.","Matthew Fassler","So it's about 150 of the stores in the chain, but not those numbers.","George Sherman","Yeah.","Matthew Fassler","Okay. And then my second question, just big picture philosophically, you seem to have two big efforts happening simultaneously. The first is the conversion of the Carquest chain and then the upgrading of execution on a number of levels? And the second is an effort to take out costs. Now understanding that you've got an SG&A ratio opportunity versus some of your peers, it seems like those two efforts are somewhat or can be somewhat an opposition. It's certainly much harder to improve execution and generate topline as you're taking cost out of the business. Is there a thought to focusing on the operational improvement to stabilize the topline prior to accelerating those cost reductions?","George Sherman","Matt, there is an effort to separate the taking cost off from affecting the topline. So we are looking very much non-customer focused activities, so take things like indirect procurement. Areas of the business like that. Looking at the store portfolio as we've done, take out ineffective assets along the way. We are laser focused on improving topline performance, that is absolutely job one and we feel that we have our field team on the point for that. Field team drives the sales improvement and the corporate team is here to support on the cost outside, we've gone more towards G&A and the corporate teams take more of a lead in that activity. So we think that they are compatible. We absolutely will not let ourselves cut in the muscle that affects sales ability.","Matthew Fassler","Got it. Thank you so much, guys.","Operator","Next question comes from Chris Horvers of JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Chris Horvers","Thanks. Good morning. So first, a clarification question on the comp side. So you mentioned the cadence. Curious if the New Year's and leap day - New Year's shift and the leap day affect the first quarter? And then I have a deeper question.","George Sherman","They don't.","Chris Horvers","They don't. They offset each other's. So the low single digit for the year doesn't include any benefit from the calendar?","George Sherman","That's correct.","Chris Horvers","Okay. And then you mentioned the geographical dispersion in comps. For the Southern and Southeast markets and broadly, the non-cold-weather markets, did they actually comp positive? And how was the sequential performance in those markets relative to the third quarter because it sounds like in the in-store inventory availability did get better, certainly from a very low point earlier in the year.","George Sherman","If you look at, I think we call that our strength areas. Certainly the Southeast was among our stronger markets. Look at areas like Charlotte, Atlanta, Tennessee, some were better performing markets. As for the improvement in availability, we talked about adding inventory on our last call, which was to happen during the course of Q4. So from a sequencing standpoint, I wouldn't look at it as though it dramatically improved the moment we've said it, but that over the course of the three months between calls, you saw more and more inventory come into the system.","Chris Horvers","Okay. And then as a follow-up, if you go back to what it sounds like Carquest was comping or growing sales at on a per store basis prior to the acquisition, it sounded like they were - it seems like they were ones and twos and certainly since this acquisition, it seems like that's deteriorated. So can you talk about - that sounds like shared loss. So is there something structural about Carquest that's driving that share loss that part of the investments that you're making into those stores and into the supply chain are meant to fix? Thanks.","George Sherman","Yeah. I would call the trend of Carquest pre-and post-integration to be relatively comparable. It's about the same as it was before. There are many Carquest stores that we're not investing in at all yet. There is still work done on the road. So I don't believe that there is anything that's caused anything meaningful kind of change in Carquest trajectory by virtue of the integration. Maybe there are stores that we've gone in physical construction. So those conversion stores did see that six-week impact on sales that I mentioned earlier, but then a lift afterwards. But as far as a broad-brush trend of Carquest stores having lesser performance than pre-acquisition, that's not the case.","Chris Horvers","Okay, but I guess the relative performance to what your commercial experience was or what Auto Zones or O'Reilly are not that it seems like they were underperforming so it was - was it the lack of DIY, was it the lack of investment by the prior management team? What would you diagnose that underperformance in that in those stores relative to the industry?","George Sherman","Yes. I call it the latter, I mean, I think that if you look at their performance pre-acquisition, relative to the main competitors, that is correct and that there was certainly particularly in the couple of years prior to acquisition some reduction in investment.","Chris Horvers","Understood. Thank you.","Operator","Our nest question comes from Daniel Hofkin of William Blair & Co. Your line is open.","Daniel Hofkin","Good morning. So just a couple of clarification questions to what's already been asked. As you are looking at 2016, can you discuss what you expect the trajectory to be for comps in both segments of the business? Seemingly, the commercial business was - would be very - if it has more room for improvement. Do you expect that to outcomp DIY in 2016? Just give us kind of a relative sense for how those fit against that low-single-digit overall comp. And then can you just, based on the low single digit, obviously that is a range. I get that but what does that imply for total sales as a range, total sales dollars given that you're going to be opening and consolidating a bunch of stores?","Mike Norona","Yes. We are not going to comment too much on mix between DIY and commercial, but I will just reiterate that commercial is going to be our primary sales driver. So no question that it is slanted more toward an investment and a focus around the commercial business, while trying to maintain as much DIY as we can.","Daniel Hofkin","And then I just - I may have missed it earlier. I don't know whether you addressed this. Is there any update at this point on the search for a permanent CEO?","Mike Norona","Yes. There is not an update. The board is diligently doing what they consider to be one of their primary roles, which is the CEO search. It is going on. And here, in advance, we're driving ahead with the business and there is no question about leadership.","Daniel Hofkin","Okay. So no comment regarding expected timing of an announcement in either way?","Mike Norona","Correct.","Daniel Hofkin","Okay. Thanks very much. Appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Baker of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Mike Baker","Thanks. I want to ask about the 12% operating margin. So I guess it's going to be one question in three parts. First, so you first talked about that 12% margin I think on the second quarter call this year. I think since then, the last two quarters haven't been great quarters. So I guess where are you right now in the progression to that 10% to 12% margin versus where you thought you would have been when you first talked about it six months ago?","George Sherman","Mike, we've made progress on the comp area for sure. So if you want to look at the primary areas that we're showing traction on, it's cost reduction, part of which was reflected in some of the Q4 results, which we weren't happy with. But we\u2019re making progress in our cost structure, we have an issue in place on margin and we certainly intend to change the comp trajectory and that last part is actually job one.","Mike Baker","So is the cost savings enough to offset the sales weakness such that at the end of 2015, you were where you would have thought you would have been or does the weakness in the second half of this year require an even better 2016 than you would have thought six months ago?","George Sherman","Yeah. The weakness in 2015 gives us a little bit more of a target. I mean, that's just the fact of the matter. So we have a little bit more work to do, little bit more wood to chop on it, but the same principles remain, meaning it is taking aggressive cost out in the right places, accelerating our comp sales and expanding our margins.","Mike Baker","Okay. Understood. Part two. That was only part one. Part two would be, how should we think about this quarterly? I mean, it's 180 basis points. That's a big number. Do we expect to see some of that in - as early as this current quarter or is it going to be not as much improvement earlier in the year and then hundreds of basis points in the back half of the year?","George Sherman","Yeah. Mike, we will build throughout the course of the year. With that said, our quarters aren\u2019t equal. So obviously, if you look at a quarter like Q2, that is a critical quarter for us, relative to Q4, which is less so.","Mike Baker","Okay. But again, should we expect to see some improvement, at least close to that range as related to this current quarter?","George Sherman","Yes. We should.","Mike Baker","Okay. Last one. This is just a clarification because I think people have said it differently in some questions so I just want to make sure. The SG - sorry, the synergy saving of $50 million, that's part of the 100 basis point cost savings or that's in addition to the 100 basis points of cost savings?","George Sherman","It's part of the cost savings.","Mike Baker","Okay. So it's 100 basis points on SG&A and then presumably 80 basis points on gross margin. Is that right?","Mike Norona","Not exactly. I think George, if you look at what we said before, I think George said it earlier, 100 basis points of SG&A and roughly in that 50 basis points and then a little bit of leverage is what we said, but we haven't given a specific on gross margin, but we have given specific on SG&A, which is in the 100 basis point range.","Mike Baker","Okay. Okay. Thanks.","Operator","At this time, there are no further questions. I will turn the call back to Zaheed Mawani for any final comments.","Zaheed Mawani","Thank you, Cheryl and thanks for our audience for participating in our fourth quarter call. That concludes our call. Thank you.","Operator","That concludes our call today. You may now disconnect.

Finally, a replay of this call will be available on our website for one year.","Now let me turn the call over to Darren Jackson, our President and Chief Executive Officer. Darren?","Darren R. Jackson","Thank you, Joshua. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter conference call. First, I'd like to thank our 54,000 Team Members for their hard work and congratulate them on their performance during the first quarter. The consistent focus on service leadership and superior availability and our Team Members' commitment to excellence resulted in a good start to 2012. The combination of solid comparable store sales growth and expense management allowed us to grow our operating profits nearly 21% in the quarter and increase our operating income rate by 167 basis points to 11.5%. Mike will provide more specific details on the first quarter financial results later in the call.","During the quarter, we continued to grow Commercial through providing customers with both reliable and increased delivery speed, improved availability and through our efforts to increase the strength of our multichannel sales offering, with the rollout of our business-to-business e-commerce platform. During the quarter, we restarted our commercial wave rollout and our growth continues to be fueled by rapid acceleration of our Commercial sales over the last several years.","In the first quarter, Commercial made up approximately 38% of our total sales versus 36.6% of our total sales in the first quarter of last year. Additionally, we are pleased with the improved top line and bottom line performance of our commercially focused Autopart International business. AI generated a 6.2% comp store sales increase, while increasing their operating income rate by 246 basis points. Our DIY business continued to improve and positively contributed to our comp store sales growth. We continue to increase the level of service our Team Members provide, better focus our advertising to drive customer traffic and maintain our competitive pricing structure to better compete locally.","All in, our comp store sales grew 2.1% for the quarter. Our performance was strong over the first 3 months of the first -- of the fiscal quarter, driven by the increase in categories such as oil, batteries and chemicals despite the high gas prices. The milder winter and early spring weather allowed our customers to get an early start for the spring repair season and perform maintenance on their vehicles much earlier in the year. However, we saw softness in our failure-related categories as cars were more able to endure the mild winter, and as such, the demand for those products was lighter than anticipated. Although we had a very solid quarter in sales, our growth underperformed our expectations as our business significantly slowed in April, partially offsetting our fast start to our year.","As we start our second quarter, we continue to see the softness that we witnessed in April. However, we believe this slowdown is temporary and does not overshadow the strong structural elements of our industry, including the roughly 240 million vehicles on the road and the average age approaching 11 years. We believe these factors will continue to be major drivers of the long-term growth and the stability of our industry. Gas prices have decreased from their previous highs earlier in the year, and we are optimistic that the pace of our business will accelerate as gas prices decline.","As such, we will remain committed to our priorities for the year and the pace in which we execute each initiative. As a reminder, those priorities include improving our in-market availability through the continued expansion of our hub network; the opening of our new DC during the back half of the year; our continued efforts to enhance our e-commerce offerings and to increase the penetration of our B2B e-commerce platform for our commercial customers; focused training for our field teams in the areas such as service leadership, inventory management and commercial execution; and finally, continued rollout of our commercial wave programs and the completion of the in-sourcing of our commercial credit to strengthen our competitive footing within the commercial market. Mike will provide more specifics regarding the full year outlook in a moment.","A few weeks ago, I was thrilled to visit with all of our general managers and field leaders from around the country during our Annual Leaders Forum. I walked away with countless examples of how service leadership is being ignited across our company and it was truly inspiring to see the energy and enthusiasm from all of our leaders.","I'd like to close with an example of how one leader is bringing services our best part to life in the field. Mike Byrd had joined Advance 23 years ago as a part-time salesman and has continually excelled with the company, serving as Regional Vice President for the past 5 years. He is a very focused leader, spending a tremendous amount of time side-by-side with his district leaders. He does a fantastic job coaching his teams on ways to better serve our customers. Mike fully understands that our team is in our stores first and foremost to serve our customers. Mike is very engaged and connects very easily with our store teams, but he also sets a very high set of expectations for the team. The recent financial and strategic results that his teams have posted in a very competitive market, including top customer satisfaction scores and high marks, both in team member retention and engagement, are truly a testament to Mike's leadership and dedication of his entire leadership team. Mike accepts excellence as the standard of performance and it shows in the outcomes he is driving. Thanks, Mike, and keep driving us towards excellence.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin Freeland, our Chief Operating Officer.","Kevin P. Freeland","Thanks, Darren, and good morning. I'd also like to congratulate the team for a solid first quarter. I'll take a moment to highlight a few of our accomplishments during the quarter, as well as update you on initiatives to support our superior availability strategy and new store growth.","As Darren mentioned, we continue to move full speed ahead on our key priorities for the year, which include our work to increase breadth and depth of our in-market product assortment and availability. This objective is carried out through the efforts to increase the number of hubs in the marketplace, as well as providing delivery capabilities from strategically positioned hubs and to continually improve the availability in our non-hub stores through the inventory upgrade process.","During the first quarter, we added 23 hubs and our total hub count is now 317 stores. Additionally, we upgraded the inventory in 155 stores during the quarter. As a direct result of our hub strategy and inventory upgrades, our in-stock levels are up 70 basis points over last year and continued to run at record levels.","As a result of increasing sales and better pacing of inventory investments, our inventory levels decreased 0.5% during the first quarter versus first quarter of last year. Additionally, we continue to expand our accounts payable to inventory ratio, which increased roughly 820 basis points versus the first quarter of last year and now stands at 82.5%. This increase in AP ratios allowed us to reduce our own inventory per store by 33.5% with our total owned inventory decreasing $174.2 million or down 32% versus first quarter of last year.","Turning to gross profit, our gross profit rate declined 38 basis points to 50.1% versus first quarter of last year, which was in line with our internal expectation. The anticipated decline was driven by a slower pace of inventory growth resulting in higher supply chain costs as a percent of purchases. However, these cost increases were partially offset by efforts to improve the productivity of our labor and DCs and reduce our transportation costs by focusing on markets and routes where we can better leverage our hub delivery costs. Operationally, we continue to improve and employ high standards of inventory management and asset protection.","As a result, the negative impact of shrink on our margins last year has abated and had no effect on our margins during the quarter. The improvement in shrink was achieved a couple of quarters earlier than we had anticipated.","We continue to make progress on the opening of our Remington, Indiana DC. We remain on pace to begin receiving product during the second quarter and anticipate beginning shipping product in the third quarter. This new DC will serve over 400 stores, including daily delivery to nearly 200 stores. Beside these capabilities, this DC will provide us with much needed capacity, improve our overall supply chain productivity and continue to increase our overall availability.","We continue to reach new customers and grow our sales through the successful expansion of our e-commerce capabilities and new store openings. During the first quarter, we opened 22 Advance stores, 3 Autopart International stores and closed 5 Autopart International stores. As of April 21, 2012, the company's total store count was 3,682 including 200 Autopart International stores.","Now let me turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Norona, to review our financial results in greater detail.","Michael A. Norona","Thanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start by thanking all of our talented and dedicated Team Members for their contributions to the solid financial outcomes we delivered in our first quarter of 2012.","I plan to cover the following topics with you this morning: one, provide some financial highlights for our first quarter of 2012; two, put our first quarter results into context with our expectations and key financial dimensions we use to measure our performance; and three, provide some insights on the remainder of 2012.","For the first quarter, we are pleased with our ability to grow our profitability with EPS increasing 32.6% to $1.79 per share versus $1.35 during the first quarter of last year. Total sales increased 3.1% to nearly $2 billion, driven by a comparable store sales increase of 2.1% during the first quarter and 82 net new stores over the past 12 months. Our comps were primarily driven by continued growth in our Commercial sales, including Autopart International and the increasing contributions by our e-commerce business.","As Kevin mentioned, our gross profit rate in the first quarter was 50.1% versus 50.5% in the first quarter 2011 or a decrease of 38 basis points. This was in line with our expectations. The decrease was primarily due to a much lower pace of inventory growth, which drove higher supply chain costs, partially offset by improvements in supply chain labor and transportation costs.","Our SG&A rate of 38.6% decreased 205 basis points versus first quarter of 2011, primarily due to actions we took last year to build a more competitive cost structure, including productivity improvements of our store labor, a planned shift in expenses from Q1 to Q2 and some continued actions to produce our administrative support costs. The planned shift in expenses, which were previously communicated during our fourth quarter conference call, include our annual general managers meeting, advertising and some strategic investments.","Our team's improved execution and commitment to grow our business while building a more competitive cost structure resulted in a 20.7% increase in operating income versus first quarter of 2011 to $224.6 million. Our operating income rate increased 167 basis points to 11.5% in the first quarter and 11.3% on a trailing 4 quarters basis. Our EPS increased 32.6% to $1.79 per share.","Free cash flow grew to $153.1 million for the quarter, driven by our strong growth in net income and reduced owned inventory. As Kevin mentioned, our reduction in owned inventory was primarily due to our efforts to increase our accounts payable to inventory ratio, which is now at 82.5% versus 74.3% in the first quarter of 2011.","At the end of the first quarter, we had $600.6 million of debt on our balance sheet and our adjusted debt to EBITDAR was 2.1x, which is below our previously stated ceiling of 2.5x.","Our average diluted share count was 74.2 million shares at the end of the quarter. As we have stated in our press release, the company's Board of Directors authorized a new $500 million share repurchase program. This new authorization replaces the remaining $200 million of the company's $300 million share repurchase program authorized in August 2011. We remain confident with the solid industry fundamentals, the commercial market opportunity and our ability to profitably grow over time. As we have consistently communicated, we prioritize growth first as our primary use of capital to increase shareholder value, which includes growing our business through our strategic investments and operational performance and looking for future growth opportunities or strategic capabilities that capitalize on the market growth opportunity.","While we see growth as our primary focus to increase shareholder value, we will continue to use share buybacks opportunistically, reflecting our confidence in achieving our growth plans.","As Darren mentioned, our business softened significantly at the end of the first quarter and we are off to a slow start in Q2. We believe the softness in our business is temporary and we remain confident about our growth prospects, given the continued solid industry dynamics, market opportunity and consumer preference for necessity.","Our commitment is unchanged to rolling out our strategic investments at the same pace as we originally planned, which are focused on Commercial, availability, supply chain and e-commerce. We remain relentlessly committed to growing our Commercial Business, given the market opportunity and potential. We have investments aimed at the foundational elements of serving our customers, improving the consistency in which we serve and developing additional capabilities such as B2B platform and the in-sourcing of our commercial credit function.","We are pleased with the growth of our Commercial sales per program, which currently is at $643,000, and we continue to be confident in our pathway to achieve our goal of $750,000 per program. We are also pleased with our accelerating B2B e-commerce platform and see much growth ahead.","Turning to profit, we are pleased with our continued improvement in our operating income per store and our record trailing 4-quarter operating income rate of 11.3%. Our performance is driven by our team's solid operational performance and actions we took last year to build a more efficient and competitive business that would enable growth and improve our profit model. These actions are allowing us to grow our business while funding the investments in areas, such as Commercial, availability, supply chain and e-commerce and improve our profit model. We are confident that the actions we have taken are the right ones, as we have been able to improve the productivity of our store labor each quarter since the first quarter last year, as well as the consecutive improvements in our DIY sales performance.","As a result of our commitment to build a more competitive cost structure while funding our strategic investments, our total SG&A dollars per store decreased 4.3% to $656,000 per store. These actions have enabled us to achieve record profitability and, more importantly, continue to provide us confidence in our pathway to achieve 12% operating margins.","As we look at value creation, we continue to maintain our disciplined approach to capital, which is reflected in our return on invested capital of 20.3%, which increased 230 basis points over the first quarter last year and represents a 440-basis point improvement on a 2-year basis. We are also pleased with our 82.5% AP ratio and continue to see opportunities to improve our AP ratio and reduce our owned inventory. We are focused on ensuring we are benefiting from our increased inventory per store to meet our customer availability needs and to maximize our cash flow.","Turning to the balance of the year, we continue to be confident that the fundamentals in our industry are strong. However, we think it's prudent, given the recent softness in our business, to temper our second quarter expectations, and we anticipate that our comp store sales will be flat to negative low-single digits in the second quarter. In addition, the previously communicated planned expense shift from the first quarter to the second quarter will negatively impact our SG&A during the second quarter by roughly $13 million or $0.10 per share. All in, we anticipate a decline in year-over-year operating income dollars during the second quarter.","Given these solid industry dynamics, our plan to maintain our investment profile and our operational expectations, we expect our annual comp store sales will grow at low-single digits for 2012. Our gross profit rate is tracking according to our previously communicated outlook and we will make the appropriate adjustments to trend in our business, including adjustments to our variable expenses and maintaining our disciplined focus on managing our administrative and support costs. As a result, we expect that our total SG&A dollars per store will be approximately flat to up 2%.","Although we anticipate our profitability during the second quarter will be constrained, we are maintaining our previously communicated 2012 EPS outlook of $5.55 to $5.75 per share.","In closing, I would like to thank all of our talented Team Members again for their performance during our first quarter. They made a meaningful impact with their relentless focus on service and operational excellence which were key ingredients to improving our growth, profit and returns in our first quarter.","Operator, we are now ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from Greg Melich with ISI.","Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Two questions, one on the top line and then on the SG&A. The do-it-for-me business there, and if I got that right, you said it was 38% versus a year ago. I back into a do-it-for-me comp of around 5%. One, is my math right? And 2, what do you think really drove that deceleration? It seemed like do-it-for-me took a bit more on the chin this quarter than DIY?","Darren R. Jackson","Greg, we never give out the specifics, but you're generally pretty good with your math. And I would say a couple of things, Greg. What we saw and we tried highlight in the script today was the fact that if we would have reported in March, it would have been a much better outcome April. The business just seemed to take a step change down. It wasn't just in the core, but we saw it in our AI business too, which is principally a northeast business. Now we don't get market share anymore regionally, so we can't tell you the impacts for the greater market. But we can tell you that what we saw in April was just in our failure categories, in particular in that northeastern section of the country. It was disproportionally hit. When we look to the south, it didn't take as much of a hit. So when we back up, we'd say let's not overreact because we had a milder winter and we pulled some business probably out of the April time period into March time period. So that's what we can see in the business today. So as we said in our conference call script, as we look out, we have been here before where the business has zigged and zagged in different ways, and I don't think and you should have heard on the call, we don't plan to overreact, we don't plan to stop focusing on what we're focused on and we plan to just drive the business forward as we have been the past 4 years.","Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","And then second, and I'll take this, I guess, to Mike on the guidance. If you just look at how much the EPS grew in the first quarter, you're already into your guidance for the range. So do you think that your EPS for the rest of the year will effectively be flat and the plan is you're down in the second quarter and then up a little bit in the back half for or is it your guidance still doesn't include any buyback and that might be some that that's part of the difference? Could you remind us of that?","Michael A. Norona","Yes, I think that's exactly the way to think about it. Greg, you heard in the comments we are going to see constrained in the second quarter and that's part because of some of the timing of our GM conference and the advertising of some of the things I referred. You can see that our EPS for the year is planned to be up -- we plan to be in that range. If the business is a little bit slower, we'll be in the lower end of that range. If the business comes back, and as Darren alluded to, then that's why we put a range out there. But I think that's exactly the way to think about it.","Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Is your buyback in the guidance or not?","Michael A. Norona","It is not. And very consistently, we don't put our buyback in the guidance.","Operator","Our next question is from Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","A couple of questions. First, on the top line, if you could allude to or talk to the experience you had in traffic and ticket, particularly in DIY, and whether that experience has changed at all over the course of the past few quarters?","Darren R. Jackson","Yes, Matt. So for the last few quarters, we've been talking about the DIY ticket. The DIY transaction count, it's been down. The ticket has offset that, and again in this quarter, we did see a positive DIY comp number. It wasn't a big number, but the transactions, I would say, have roughly remained the same in terms of their consistent trend of being down, offset by ticket. When I look at our overall ticket trend, our commercial tickets and our DIY tickets, what we saw in the first quarter was that combined ticket trend was a little better than the previous 4, but we just didn't see the growth in the overall ticket. So transactions -- combined transactions weren't as difficult in this first quarter as they had been in the previous 4, but the overall growth in the ticket has slowed a little bit. And that probably doesn't come as a surprise when the mix of business out of failure changes a little bit and we haven't seen as many price increases this first quarter as we did last year.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. My second question relates to capital allocation. If you could just give us a sense as to your internal thinking about the buyback and the cadence thereof, the past couple of quarters, you obviously haven't done very much. The decision to re-up the authorization and more than double it in size, presumably reflects some intent to deploy that buyback in the immediate future. So how have you thought about it? And by the way it looks in retrospect like a fortuitous decision. How have you thought about the pace of the buyback and what has driven your decision on when you're buying back stock and when you've put that on hold?","Michael A. Norona","Yes. Matt, it's Mike. So share buybacks have been and are an important part of our capital deployment. But in our view, and as we've consistently behaved, they're not the only opportunity to deploy capital, to create shareholder value. And we've consistently said that we prioritize growth first as our primary use of capital, which includes growing our business through the strategic investments in our Commercial Business, our availability and our operational performance and looking for future growth opportunities and strategic capabilities, things like B2B. They capitalize on the market growth we see. So that's where our first priority is. That said, while we see growth as the primary focus to increase shareholder value, we use buybacks opportunistically to reflect our confidence in those investments, in those growth investments. And we measure ourselves on those investments on ROIC, which we're very pleased of over the last 4 years. It's up 580 -- last 4 years, up 580 basis points. And what I'd say, if you look back historically, we have, our behavior showed, that we bought shares opportunistically and you can reasonably expect us to buy shares in the future, which is why we have a repurchase authorization.","Operator","Our next question is from Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets.","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I know last year's first quarter probably wasn't what you guys expected, now we're seeing this big deceleration in April and a soft start to the second quarter. Now last year's, part of last year's issues was self-inflicted, if I remember right. A lot of changes in the field for us, et cetera. Was there anything internally that may have happened in April or is this simply a function of you saw the drop in traffic, ticket, whatever it was.","Darren R. Jackson","Yes, Scott, I would say that internally, there's not anything that comes to mind. A matter of fact, we were purposeful. We even moved our leadership meeting out to the end of -- or the beginning of the second quarter in order to keep the teams focused. I don't know how to say it more clearly that the month of April was just a step change, and I think weather evens out over time, that deferred maintenance build hasn't changed. We can see from the northeast to Miami very different patterns, of what's happening. And you know what? Your point is a good one. We were on this call last year and I look back now and the only thing that's occurred in the last 4 quarters is that our trailing 4 quarters operating income rate is up 150 basis points. Our ROIC is up 200 basis points. Our owned inventory is down $170 million and our SG&A per store, and maybe this gets overlooked, is that we're constantly balancing how do we get to a better operating model. It's down $30,000 per store. And there's no doubt in that delicate balance of trying to grow your business, accelerate your business and drive the profitability and increase returns. You're going to have moments that are nonlinear. And so, what you should have picked up on the call is that we learned something from last year in terms of how do we keep the teams focused on the business, how do we not overreact to something in the moment and how do we stay, going forward, on the key strategies that we laid out.","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","That's helpful, Darren, and then with the slower sales results and the changing compensation plan that you've implemented across the organization, do you start to get -- when do you start to get worried, if at all, about potential increase in employee turnover?","Darren R. Jackson","Yes, that's a fair question. Well, what we can see right now is if you look at the Hay Group, they will tell you across the nation in retail, we've seen a pronounced pickup in retail turnover, specifically, mostly in part-timers which is not new. I think what their data would say is we're returning to pre-2008 levels. When we look at our own data, there are -- we care about all of our Team Members, but we look at our parts pros for example, which are just fundamentally critical to our Commercial Business, and we've not seen any material change in our commercial parts pro turnover in the last 12 months. So if I had to pick a group of Team Members that we watch very carefully it\u2019s that group, when we look at our general managers, that hasn't moved but a point or 2 and less than the national averages. And we look at our CAM workforce, our sales force, that's picked up a little bit. Those things will happen. Sales Team Members are a unique, special and hungry group, so when sales are happening or not happening, they will move place to place as well. But there's not one group today, when I look within our mix over the last 12 months, where I go, we've got a problem. But I wouldn't want to mislead you that they have ticked up, but they're nowhere near the 2008 levels that we had seen as a company.","Operator","Our next question is from Dan Wewer with Raymond James.","Daniel R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Darren, a question on gross margin trends in the industry. So looking at O'Reilly and AutoZone, they're seeing the same growing sales contribution from Commercial that Advance is seeing. And yet, those 2 companies are posting higher gross margin rates, raising gross margin guidance for the year. How do you go about reconciling the gross margin direction at Advance compared to those 2 peers?","Kevin P. Freeland","Hey, Dan, this is Kevin. I think there's a number of things that would define that. One is, if you were to take the trailing several years, we were posting triple digit growth in gross margins, multiple years in a row and overachieving our competitors at that point. Some of the things that we did were opportunities that any modern retailer could pursue. And just going through the press releases of our competitors, there's maybe a sameness of some of those strategies that are getting deployed at different times over the past few years. I think that explains part of it. Part of it is also, we've explained this, we're bringing on additional supply chain capacity, and what had been a tailwind in margin had been a consistent supply chain set of assets in a growing company we're leveraging over the last several years. We're putting on a material facility and the related costs to that, which is unique to us. Additionally, we are constantly, as an industry, competing back and forth and making sure that we are tracking each other's movements and pricing our products to be competitive, and that will change from quarter-to-quarter of -- in which direction are you adjusting in any one moment. But I think if you look at where we benchmark against them in absolute dollars, adjusting for the fact that we have a slightly smaller commercial mix then O'Reilly's and a much larger commercial mix than AutoZone, I think we stack up well in that comparison.","Michael A. Norona","And Dan, it's Mike, I think go back to our outlook, we are expecting that our margins will be modestly up for the year. So I wanted to put that context out there for you.","Darren R. Jackson","Yes, and you would say there are structural moments where margin improves, we're early on Remington, the benefits, the costs are in front of us, right in front of us, but the benefits of the efficiency are quarters away, if not a year away, as we build up that capabilities in Remington, Dan. And we see the opportunity after Remington more structural benefits. But they just, the chronology of getting there, there's cost before the benefits like many of our initiatives that we run before. You probably saw earlier this quarter our Wearever Platinum launch of our brake program. It's just more of the work that our merchandise teams are doing in our private label product as a way of bringing higher quality product to the marketplace. That has better margin attributes as well. So the global sourcing benefits continue to be out there and giving us benefits, and we recognize there are pockets out there of price competition that we need to respond to. So it\u2019s a -- this constant balancing act. But our absolute margins, near 50 points, our margins that we're happy with. And as Mike said, we still see opportunities to grow those margins, not at triple digit rates, but to balance it in light of the environment too.","Daniel R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","And then as a follow-up question on the sales growth performance in April seems to mirror the direction that O'Reilly was highlighting, perhaps a bit more of an impact for Advance. You noted that it appears to be more weather-related, maybe transferring business forward rather than economic issues, gasoline, SARs, whatever. What is your experience -- if this air pocket in revenues is weather-related and transferring sales, what will be the duration of this? In other words, at what point will that begin to normalize and begin to get back to the sales ramp that you were talking about earlier in the year? Is this 3 months, 6 months?","Darren R. Jackson","Yes. That's fair in terms of -- there are a couple of things to go into that. If you give me a very hot summer on into the fall, that will be outstanding for our business. As you know, better than many, that those extremes really propel our business. What we're pleased about on the last call, and I think we tried to signal this when we gave our original guidance as we were looking out, is that gas prices, we can see this in the '09 numbers and the '10 numbers that when gas was called at $2.80 a gallon, that consumer is, from our vantage point, continues to be under duress. I mean they haven't gotten raises in a couple of years, many of them. So when gas begins that downward movement, and I would say that I'm hopeful that we peaked, the things that we read about today suggest more likely than not gas is coming down and not going up in the near term. So we see that as we go into the back half of the year as being a plus. The other thing that we see as a plus, and it's partly a result of the milder winter in many of our core markets, we saw actual miles driven for the first time pickup. Last year, you couldn't drive a lot in the northeast as a result of the weather, and now it's first few months. But we know miles driven and it doesn't happen immediately, but it's wear and tear on the car. So we see that as a positive sign as we start to look -- as we look further out. And I don't know if that's the third quarter, I don't know if that's the fourth quarter. And though unemployment is still at a stubborn level, I think it's 8.2%, that tends to be a little bit of an overhang. And in an election year, who knows how the consumer begins to think about themselves again. And so when I put that all together, I see the positive theme, certainly gas prices have plateaued and have begun to come down. That traditionally is a good guy for us. Miles driven ticking up, it is a lead, that typically is a good guy for us and miles driven did go up in the first quarter of the year. In terms of unemployment rate, it's not 9% anymore, 8.2%, I'll call that kind of steady as she goes. So neither -- not necessarily a positive, but not going backwards again. And how the consumer is thinking about in an election year just personally, their spending habits, who knows in terms of what that means to. It does not change the fundamental number of cars on the road, doesn't change the age and it does not change the deferred maintenance bill, which is $60 billion. And if I recall in the '07, '08 period, where we roughly, as an industry, and we can see in the total market share numbers that the total market has come down a bit, particularly in March and April. That when we get relief in terms of some discretionary income, that deferred maintenance bill comes due. It just didn't come due in April and May, the beginning of May this year, but that bill is going to come due.","Operator","Our next question is from Gary Balter with Credit Suisse.","Gary Balter - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","First question and then a follow-up, you've done a good job on expenses and is it possible that maybe you've cut too deep in terms of trucks per store or commercial salespeople or change in the comp structure? How do you evaluate that because the weakness seemed to be much more in the Commercial side than on the retail side?","Darren R. Jackson","Yes, Gary, you're right. We have taken out, in the last 12 months, about $30,000 per store. When we look at just fundamentally the number of trucks per store, the number of trucks in the enterprise, those are up modestly. So they're not up double digits and we have deployed new techniques like Flex Fleet to make sure we're getting the trucks to the right place. We're not pouring them on at double-digit rates like we were 2 years ago. So that's -- you're right about that. Our sales team has grown roughly 6% over the last 12 months. So we've added salespeople. But, I don't know if this is a but -- and for example, we have had a more concerted effort on our B2B platform, a little better than a year ago. That number was probably closer to 0. Today, it's approaching double digits and we think that there's growth ahead of us in terms of B2B penetration. That has a twofold effect. It makes it easier for our customers to shop. The retention rates are better. In our own Commercial Business, what we can see in the first quarter, our best customers, our retention rates were at the highest levels that they've been in a year. Those actually went up. So what we can see going forward to your point is we look at driving the business going forward. It's going to take a little bit more in terms of driving new customers in because we're feeling good about how we're retaining our best customers. Now we got to widen that sales bundle a little bit. And as we said in our prepared remarks, whether it's through waves process [ph] or whether it's through our commercial credit program, which we think today were competitively disadvantaged, that's why we're taking it in-house in order to use that more as a tool to enable more in the sales process, that those things are things that we've learned how to do very effectively over the last 4 years. And over the balance of the year, we're not pulling back on those things. We're pushing ahead of them.","Gary Balter - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And then you mentioned the offsite that you had, I think, in Charlotte. Could you talk about the strategic initiatives that you discussed with the employees?","Darren R. Jackson","Well, I would just say just generally the key theme to our Charlotte leadership forum was one, we talked about commercial excellence so this very -- I'm not going to repeat what I just said, is that for our commercial programs to continue to grow at the rates we expect them to grow, it's going to take more of a combined effort from our sales and operations teams. And so part of that work together was how do we use the sales and operations team to build more of a commercial sales culture and the execution in terms of whether it's delivery times, the number of call CPPs are making, the follow-up on focus customers, the roles and owning those commercial relationships. And with culture, it doesn't change overnight, but it's just a more a concerted effort to own the commercial sales culture throughout the organization was one. We talked about inventory excellence. One of the things you did not hear on the call today is that our margin was challenged by shrink. I can't tell you how proud I am of the team in terms of turning that around. So part of just being able to make the sale is that we have to just be outstanding at our on-hands and this business, as Kevin always tells me, it's an item business and making sure we have everything ready and available in improving our close rates at the point of sales. So we spent a fair amount of time talking about inventory excellence. We talked about service excellence, and service excellence throughout all the key roles in our organization and helping our Team Members understand the customer expectations and the Team Member expectations. And across the country today, different than a year ago, every team member knows where they stand every day in terms of their sales performance and sales expectation. And we're systematically going across the country. And at this level, working to every team member to understand their sales contribution, their transactions per hour, their DPT per hour and how we can better help them serve our customers better in terms of delivering on the outcomes. We spend a fair amount of time, a good amount of time also listening. And so a good portion of this, we also had 3 days with some of our best commercial customers, talking to us about what's on their mind and what we can do better to serve them in terms of where we're falling short or where the industry is falling short. So we used that time in Charlotte also with our best customers in terms of a customer forum. And then as Mike alluded to and Kevin alluded to, we have many, I'll call it, technical improvements to the business. The B2B platform, our e-services and how we sell those into the marketplace are important to us to talk to the team about. We're working on our own new EPC in order to make it easier for our Team Members to sell to the customers and be enabled in terms of the selling process. And probably lastly and probably most importantly, we used a good chunk of that time to just celebrate the outstanding performance of many of our best sales Team Members and general managers.","Operator","Our next question is from David Gober with Morgan Stanley.","David Gober - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit more about where you saw the slowdown in terms of DIY versus Commercial in April, and just kind of -- and you've alluded to it a little bit, but just wondering if it was significantly more drastic in the DIY business or if it was fairly evenly spread between the 2.","Darren R. Jackson","I'd say relatively speaking they both took a step down. So as we said, our DIY business comped positive. They comped positive in the fourth quarter of this past year. It was comping much more positive in the first 3 periods of the quarter. But David, I would say that the last time that I've seen this little step change, I think it was Thanksgiving of '07. There was just, from the beginning of Thanksgiving to the Christmas period, something just fundamentally seemed to change. Now it was warmer Christmas back then with the consumers' buying habits. So that leads me to believe, when I can look across both businesses, I don't think the consumer is walking away from their car needs. But I just fundamentally believe and when I don't know, I call our Team Members and spend time with our Team Members who have been here 30 years and said, we've seen this before and when we look north to south, we can see in the failure categories and the wiper categories, we can see the impact of those changes.","David Gober - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And just to dig a little bit more on the DIY side of the business, you mentioned that you were comping much more positively earlier in the quarter, but I was just wondering what you're seeing in the competitive environment there and if that's -- obviously, this is, I think, the fifth quarter in a row that, at least on a per store basis, that the DIY business is down. And are you seeing incremental pressure there that you think will persist?","Darren R. Jackson","I don't know that we're seeing anything competitively different. Probably, the fundamental competitive difference between our competitors and our self is just the number of new stores that we've been adding as an organization relative to others. Now we have said previously as we look out, we see an opportunity with new stores to grow them at a faster rate for sure. Now those new stores, and it's one of the things we didn't talk about in our prepared remarks, our new stores in the first quarter exceeded our expectation. As we look out, there will be new store closing that gap in terms of new store growth, but they're much more commercially driven new stores than DIY-driven new stores. The overall market, we continue to believe in DIY and I think we've said this for years is that '09 and '10 were somewhat of an anomaly because structurally the market we believe is a 1, maybe a 2 grower going forward. And in that 1 or 2, we know that there's a little bit of inflation that historically has been in those product categories. So I don\u2019t think there\u2019s been fundamental competitive or fundamental structural changes in DIY. I think there was just a fundamental choice that the consumer might have spent their money on x versus y because they didn't have the same pressure coming out of a winter season. And they spent some of those dollars a little sooner. We might even say that they spent those dollars, we didn't have a tough December in terms of weather, January. In many of our markets, March was much more historically high warm weather relative to April.","David Gober - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just one final follow-up since you mentioned the new store strategy. You closed, I think, 5 AI stores this quarter and the new stores or maybe a little bit less than at least we were expecting. Just curious if you -- if you're still on track in terms of the store opening plan this year and if the 5 store closures were indicative of anything broader or just one-off choices.","Darren R. Jackson","No, absolutely not. They were just small sores. Some of them will be relocated.","Michael A. Norona","Yes. We're on pace to open the number of stores we put in our outlook and they're just more -- and it was planned this year, just more towards the back of the year versus last year.","Operator","Our next question is from Mike Baker with Deutsche Bank.","Michael Baker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So on your sales on guidance there, obviously includes an increase in the back half of the year, an acceleration. If that doesn't happen, how much of the SG&A can you take out in terms of what you're planning on spending? I understand you think [indiscernible] the last few months is just an anomaly and so no need to panic. I get that, but if it does turn into a more of a [indiscernible] trend, can you pull out some of the expenses?","Michael A. Norona","Yes. So a couple of things happen. One is, there are certain expenses like variable expenses that will naturally flow with sales. So those will flex up and down as sales flex up and down. We also have discretionary dollars that we can flex up and down. The things that we're not willing to compromise are the things that Darren talked about. We still think the fundamentals in this industry are strong areas. So investing in areas like Commercial, availability, our supply chain, our e-commerce, our global sourcing, I can go on, are important. And we also see opportunities for some of the work we did last year to build a more cost competitive structure, where we can pull costs out that are furthest away from the customer to fund those investments. And I'll remind you that's why we gave you a range. We expect our SG&A per store to grow in the kind of flat to 2, and we will toggle somewhere in that range depending on how the sales flex.","Michael Baker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","If I could ask a follow-up, maybe I'm just not getting enough. But [indiscernible] your total sales and the percent that was DIFM versus DIY, I get that total DIY sales are up 0.8%. And given the square footage growth, I guess, how do I square that if that is in fact right? How do I square that with your DIY comps being positive?","Darren R. Jackson","Well, you'll have to check your math because we're not -- they were positive, but they were modestly positive. So I think it's just in the rounding.","Michael Baker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. Fair enough. Then last one if I could. If you think that the slowdown in April was just a pull forward and May is temporary [indiscernible]. I guess, why change the full year comp guidance from low- to mid-single digits to just low-single digits? Is that just you think it was just a pull forward and short-term disruption just being a little bit prudent on that outlook?","Michael A. Norona","Yes. I think that's right. It's Mike. I think that's right.","Operator","And our final question today comes from Bret Jordan with BB&T Capital Markets.","Brian W. Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Just a quick question. If you like at the timing of the demand, it seems like weather impacted pretty significantly. Have you looked at a comparable SKU basis over a 2-quarter standpoint? It sounds like if failure parts were soft, have you looked at, between fourth quarter and first quarter, whether the demand was pulled forward or whether it's just total loss of demand given the lack of winter?","Kevin P. Freeland","Yes. We definitely saw improvement in maintenance categories even in fourth quarter. It was a very mild December. If you look, switching to the wiper-blade business and you see it sequentially declined from fourth quarter into the first quarter. So clearly, as Darren briefly stated, benefit of maintenance categories absolute pull forward into both, even as early as November and things like the occurrence chemicals [ph]. So that's what we've seen coming into April.","Bret David Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Okay. So on the 2-year stack basis, do you have a feeling for total of the loss demand on the failure parts? Things just did not break with the lack of winter?","Kevin P. Freeland","Certainly if you look at some of the categories that are heavily indexed into the northern markets like under car, yes, the cars just did not get the kind of salt and grime that drives damage to those vehicles, and we've seen that sequentially from last year to this year in terms of overall failure category performance or lowering performance.","Operator","This concludes the question-and-answer session.

Jackson","Thanks, Joshua. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter conference call. First, I'd like to thank our 52,000 Team Members for their hard work and congratulate them on an outstanding performance in the fourth quarter and for fiscal 2011. The team's focus and dedication enabled us to achieve new record levels of performance this year. Our continued investment in service and availability translated into industry-leading service experience as measured by NPD, while improving the efficiency of our operations. ","Together, these investments resulted in record profitability as reflected in our 90 basis point improvement in our operating income rate, which reached an all-time high of 10.8%. We remain on track to achieve our goal of 12%. Our improved operating performance enabled our full year earnings per share to grow 29.4% to $5.11, while our return on invested capital reached a record 19.5%. Mike will provide more specific details on the fourth quarter and our full year results in a few minutes, as well as the outlook for 2012.","Our heritage is grounded in our commitment to service and is reflected in our promise \"Service is our best part.\" Just as important, our values, inspire, serve and grow, are critical to how we deliver on our promise on a consistent basis. Together, our team's dedication to our promise and values resulted in record levels of customer satisfaction, Team Member engagement and financial returns in 2011.","Operationally, we set new standards of achievement in delivery speed, reliability, inventory on hand and e-commerce sales, to name a few. Finally, we finished the year slightly below double-digit comps in our Commercial business and saw sequential improvements in DIY throughout 2011.","We entered 2011 by simplifying our strategies to service leadership and superior availability. Service leadership, in simple terms, is to help customers buy through delivering on customer expectations, which requires a relentless focus on service basics and behaviors. We made material investments in our district leadership team, the measurement of commercial delivery speed and reliability, and our service leadership assessments. Ultimately, our goal is to maximize the value of each customer engagement, whether it's when a customer walks into one of our stores, calls us or clicks on our website.","Superior availability is focused on building an industry-leading supply chain through our efforts to build out our hub network and implement our new warehouse management system. This new warehouse management system is a critical element of our state-of-the-art distribution center set to open in the fall of 2012. Kevin Freeland will provide you with more insights on our progress under our superior availability strategy shortly.","I am pleased with the strategic progress we made, as well as our financial results that accelerated throughout the year. Specifically, we were able to generate a 2.9% comp store sales gain during our fourth quarter and a 2.2% for the fiscal year. Overall, our business continues to be impacted by regionality but was less so in the fourth quarter.","Our performance for the year was driven by solid results in both our failure and maintenance products. In our fourth quarter, we saw positive growth in both DIY and Commercial. In 2011, Commercial comps were strong, giving us near double-digit comps for 4 years in a row. We slowed the pace of our Commercial weighs in 2011 to focus on and achieve better execution, which enabled us to better manage our integrated service model.","We are delighted by our ability to turn the tide in DIY, despite a very tough comparison, through improved execution and increased average ticket. Overall, we continue to outperform the market and gain significant market share in our rapidly growing Commercial business, which represented 37.2% of our total sales in the fourth quarter versus 35.1% during the fourth quarter last year.","Additionally, we are pleased with our improved top line and bottom line performance of our commercially focused Autoparts International business. AI grew to nearly $295 million in sales, with an 8.6% comp store sales increase while increasing profits nearly 3x to $12.3 million for the year. We continue to see significant potential to grow our Commercial business and to gain market share.","By contrast, we underperformed the industry and our expectations for DIY market share in 2011. Our team is focused on the basics of execution, merchandising and marketing to build on our Q4 gains in DIY. We are pleased with both our DIY and Commercial sales trends as we start 2012.","A special highlight is our continued effort to serve the communities in which we operate. This is reflected in our work to increase awareness and seek a cure for juvenile diabetes. Our team once again continued our strong efforts in support of JDRF by raising roughly $4 million this year. Our fundraising total since 1994 is now over $30 million, and we continue to be JDRF's #1 corporate partner.","Looking to 2012 and beyond, we continue to see strong structural elements of our industry, including the increasing average age of vehicles, which is nearly 11 years, with 2\/3 of those cars on the road being over 7 years old. With over 240 million cars in the U.S., this continues to be a major driver of the long-term growth and stability of the industry.","Our economy continues to be tempered with high unemployment and low consumer confidence. As a result, we expect to see an economy of necessity, where consumers will continue to favor and seek value through local garages or performing needed repairs themselves.","In the shorter term and with stabilization of gas prices, we expect the industry in 2012 to perform comparably to 2011. However, increases in gas prices at the pump will have a negative impact on the growth potential of the industry, as evidenced in 2011.","As we start a new year, we remain focused on service leadership and superior availability and the elements that support our strategies. Our success will be determined by our ability to run the business with excellence, which is based upon providing outstanding service, growing DIY and accelerating Commercial, effectively managing our inventory levels, continuing to increase the effectiveness of our Team Member training and development while allowing us to retain, hire and ignite the performance of our outstanding Team Members.","In 2012, our key organizational priorities include the continued focus on improving our in-market availability through the continued expansion of our hub network and the opening of our new DC during the back half of the year. We continue to enhance our e-commerce offerings in order to increase the retention and acquisition of larger size commercial customers. We will continue our efforts to increase the penetration of B2B, which has been very well received by our commercial customers. Finally, we will work to maximize our return on every customer visit by providing the service they want and expect from every Team Member.","In closing, I'd like to acknowledge our team's everyday heroics, simply serving their customers better than anyone else. These acts of heroism happen every day in one of our stores, such as Millsboro, Delaware, where TJ Marshlack [ph] and Thomas Lacasse [ph] deliver on our promise, despite the cold temperatures, by installing a battery for a mom and her young son and testing the car's charging system to ensure the job was done right, and we gained a customer for life; or in Topeka, Kansas, where General Manager Chris Anders takes great pride in being available for our customers, connects with them in a meaningful way by taking them from an ordinary transaction and turning it into a memorable interaction. Thank you to all of our everyday heroes as your acts of heroism are what makes Advance a great place to work and will continue to drive our success way into the future.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin Freeland, our Chief Operating Officer.","Kevin P. Freeland","Thanks, Darren, and good morning. I'd also like to congratulate the team for a strong fourth quarter and year. I'll take a moment to highlight a few of our accomplishments during the quarter, as well as update you on our initiatives to support superior availability strategy and new store growth.","Over the course of the year, we worked to increase the breadth and depth of our in-market product assortment and availability through our efforts to increase the number of hubs in the marketplace, as well as providing delivery capabilities from strategically positioned hubs. As a result, we've worked aggressively to add our number of hub stores in 2011, which now sits at 294, or an increase of 68 since Q4 of 2010.","We upgraded the inventory in 47 stores for the quarter and 814 stores for the year. As a direct result of our hub strategy and our inventory upgrades, our in-stock levels were up nearly 90 basis points over last year and are at a record high.","Despite our start to 2011, when our inventory levels increased 21% during the first quarter, our inventory levels at the end of the year were up only 9.6% versus the prior year. This is a great accomplishment, and I want to congratulate our inventory team as their focus on disciplined inventory management allowed us to exceed our goals by sequentially decelerating the rate of growth each quarter while continuing to build our -- build on our already high level of customer perception of availability.","Additionally, we continued to expand our supply chain financing program and have reduced our owned inventory per store by 29.8%, with our total owned inventory decreasing $150 million versus the fourth quarter of last year. Our work in this space has led to an increase in our AP ratio of nearly 1,000 basis points versus the fourth quarter last year and now stands at 80.9%. We continue to be encouraged by our progress, and will continue to work to expand our AP ratio in the future.","Turning to gross profit. Our gross profit declined 39 basis points to 49% versus the fourth quarter of the previous year. This anticipated decline continues to be impacted by increased supply chain costs driven by our investments in hub stores and increased deliveries. Additionally, our gross profit decline was impacted by unfavorable shrink. However, we continue to make great strides with respect to our shrink management. Our shrink performance has improved since second quarter, and we anticipate this headwind will subside in the back half of 2012.","Partially offsetting those headwinds in 2011 were continued improvements in DC productivity and continued benefits from our merchandising, global sourcing and pricing capabilities. While gross margin declined 24 basis points in 2011, it increased 312 basis points over the last 4 years.","Our new Remington, Indiana, DC will begin receiving product in the second quarter of 2012 and is anticipated to begin shipping product the following quarter. Remington will provide us with much needed capacity and will be by far the most advanced DC within our supply chain. Once this new DC is up and running, we'll be able to benefit from additional productivity improvements and continue to increase our overall availability.","We continue to reach new customers and grow sales through successful expansion of our e-commerce capabilities and through new store openings. During the fourth quarter, we opened 19 stores, closed 1 Advance store and closed 1 Autopart International store. For fiscal 2011, we opened 95 Advance stores, 9 Autopart International stores, closed 4 Advance stores and 1 Autopart International store. As of December 31, 2011, the company's total store count was 3,662, including 202 Autopart International stores. Overall, our fourth quarter as well as 2011 was very successful for our team, and I'm thrilled by the strategic and financial progress we've made as we focus on providing superior availability.","Now let me turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Norona, to review our financial results.","Michael A. Norona","Thanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start by thanking all of our talented and dedicated Team Members for their contribution to the strong financial outcomes we delivered in our fourth quarter to close out another very solid year. I plan to cover the following 3 topics with you this morning: one, provide some financial highlights from our fourth quarter of 2011; two, put our fourth quarter results into context with both our full year performance and the key financial dimensions we use to measure our performance; and three, provide you with our annual financial outlook for 2012.","Looking at our fourth quarter, we are pleased with our strong end of the year, with earnings per diluted share increasing 57.9% to $0.90 per share versus $0.57 for the prior year. For all of 2011, our earnings per share increased 29.4% to $5.11 on top of a 31.7% EPS increase in 2010.","Our comp store sales increased 2.9% during the fourth quarter, which was on top of an 8.9% comp increase during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, representing an 11.8% 2-year comp store sales increase. We are very pleased with this result as it marks our strongest comp performance for the year despite challenging comparisons.","For the year, our comp store sales increased 2.2%, with total sales increasing 4.1% to nearly $6.2 billion. As Kevin mentioned, our gross profit rate in the fourth quarter was 49% versus 49.4% in the fourth quarter 2010, or a decrease of 39 basis points. This was in line with our expectations. The decline versus prior year was primarily driven by increased supply chain investments in hubs and slightly higher shrink expense. For the year, our gross profit rate decreased 24 basis points to 49.7%, which was in line with our previous outlook and expectations.","Turning to our cost structure. Our SG&A rate was 40.6% during the fourth quarter versus 42.8% during the fourth quarter of 2010. This 221 basis point decrease was driven by productivity improvements from the company's variable customer-driven labor model, which includes the anniversary of investment rollout expenses, reduced incentive compensation as a result of the company's lower comp sales growth versus the fourth quarter of 2010, occupancy cost leverage, and a significant decrease in overall support costs. The expense reductions were partially offset by continued strategic investments in areas such as commercial, availability and e-commerce.","As a result of our cost management efforts and a continued commitment to building a more competitive cost structure, our SG&A per store decreased 2.2% in 2011 to $666,000 per store. As a direct result of our team's execution and commitment to achieve both top line growth and improve our cost structure, our operating income increased 33.3% versus fourth quarter of 2010 while our operating income rate increased 182 basis points to 8.4%.","Our full year operating income increased 13.6% versus fiscal 2010 to $664.6 million. Our operating income rate increased to a record 10.8% of sales in fiscal 2011, which represents a 90-basis-point increase, which was on top of a 100-basis-point increase in 2010. We are delighted by these results and pleased with our team's progress in growing our business and profitability.","Free cash flow was a record $507.2 million, which represents a $40.9 million increase over last year. This increase was primarily due to our strong growth in net income and reduced owned inventory. As Kevin mentioned, our reduction in owned inventory was driven by our efforts to increase our AP to inventory ratio, which is now at 80.9%, up nearly 1,000 basis points from 71% in 2010, and our work to decelerate the pace of growth of our overall inventory levels, which grew 9.6% for the year. These improvements to our free cash flow were partially offset by our increased capital spending, which was up $90.6 million, driven by our strategic investments in supply chain to improve our efficiencies, to complete our Remington DC and investments in our e-commerce business.","At the end of Q4, we had $416 million of debt on our balance sheet, and our adjusted debt to EBITDAR was 2x, which is below our previously stated ceiling of 2.5x. Last month, we obtained long-term funding through our $300 million unsecured senior notes offering, which will be used to pay off short-term debt and for other general corporate purposes. This was part of our capital structure plan to continue to improve our financial foundation by securing longer term funding at favorable terms, which will help fund our future growth.","With respect to share repurchase program, we repurchased approximately 9.9 million shares of stock for $609.6 million at an average price of $61.51 per share during fiscal 2011. These repurchases continue to reflect our confidence in the company's ability to grow profitably and to create long-term shareholder value.","Strategically, we continue to position the company for growth and improved profitability. Our performance in our fourth quarter and 2011 demonstrates we are on the right path and reinforces our commitment to accelerate growth, improve profitability and drive shareholder value.","We continue to measure our performance based on these 3 dimensions. Our commitment to grow our business is reflected by our fourth consecutive year of strong Commercial sales growth, which continues to drive record sales per store. Over the past 4 years, our sales per store have increased $181,000 to $1.71 million, driven by increased Commercial sales per program, which has grown 45% over the same period. Our ability to grow profitably is marked by our 190-basis-point improvement in operating income rate in the past 2 years, driven by the structural improvements we had made to our gross profit in the areas such as parts availability, inventory management and new capability such as global sourcing and e-commerce, and through the improvements we have made in our cost structure. We continue to be on pace to achieve 12% operating margins.","Turning to shareholder value. We continue to maintain our disciplined approach in managing our balance sheet and capital structure as reflected in our 19.5% return on invested capital, which increased 200 basis points versus 2010 and 580 basis points over the past 4 years. The increase in ROIC and the 116% increase in our free cash flow over the past 4 years were primarily due to our improved operating performance, as well as our continued efforts to reduce our owned inventory.","Turning to 2012. We believe it will be another strong year given the solid industry fundamentals Darren mentioned, and we look to build on our 2011 momentum with our relentless focus on service to meet our customers' needs and continued investments in commercial, availability and e-commerce.","We estimate our 2012 EPS will be $5.55 to $5.75 per share. This annual outlook reflects a weighted average share count of approximately 74 million outstanding diluted shares and includes additional interest expense from our recent unsecured notes issuance.","Now I'd like to provide you with the key financial assumptions implied in our annual financial outlook. In 2012, we anticipate new store openings for both Advance and Autopart International brands to be approximately 120 to 130 stores. Service leadership and superior availability will fuel continued sales per store growth.","We expect comp sales to grow low- to mid-single digits, driven by continued growth in Commercial. We expect a modest improvement in our gross profit rate as we continue to reap the benefits of our previous investments, our focus on excellence in terms of inventory and shrink management, and the anniversary of supply chain efficiencies. Partially offsetting these margin benefits are headwinds associated with the ramp up of our new Remington DC that will come online during our third quarter of fiscal 2012, our new warehouse management system, and the increased mix of Commercial sales.","Turning to our cost structure. We continue to see opportunities to increase our productivity, reduce the variability of our store performance and reduce support costs furthest away from the customer. We expect to continue the progress we made in 2011. However, our focus on growth will continue to require us to make investments in areas such as commercial, supply chain, global sourcing and e-commerce.","Based on our comp sales outlook, our incentive compensation may be leveraged as a result of slightly higher sales and year-over-year growth in 2012. All in, our strategic investments, combined with more normalized incentive compensation, will be partially offset through our continued efforts to improve our cost structure and simplify our operations. We anticipate that our SG&A per store will increase in the low-single digits.","Turning to capital expenditures. We expect our capital expenditures to be approximately $275 million to $300 million, which is slightly higher than 2011, driven by new store development, supply chain investments and store systems. We expect free cash flow to be a minimum of $400 million, driven by areas such as increased net income and continued improvements to working capital, partially offset by higher capital expenditures.","We anticipate the phasing of our quarterly operating profit will be somewhat different than our historical performance. We expect that our operating income growth will be the strongest during our first quarter and will be more constrained for the balance of fiscal 2012. This is driven by our first quarter comparisons versus the very weak start in fiscal 2011; the pacing and timing of our strategic investments in 2012, which are more focused in our second and third quarters; and the anniversary of expense savings from 2011, which started in the second quarter of fiscal 2011 and accelerated throughout 2011.","In closing, we remain focused on our 2 strategies of service leadership and superior availability and continuing to generate long-term growth, profits and shareholder value. Our strategic investments, relentless focus on service and operational excellence are key ingredients to achieving these. We want to thank our talented Team Members for the meaningful impacts they made in 2011 and look forward to an exciting 2012.","Operator, we are now ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from Gary Balter with Credit Suisse.","Gary Balter - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Darren, I was going to ask you if you thought the Golden Eagles will win the BIG EAST Tournament before you get to your 12% operating income. But that's probably not a fair question, so I'll phrase it differently...","Darren R. Jackson","I think they're both in good shape.","Gary Balter - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","When we say the goal of '12, that's -- given the guidance, you're not looking at that for this year, right? That's something that you're looking a couple years out?","Michael A. Norona","Yes. Gary, it's Mike. Yes, that's right. We haven't changed our view on that. And we've said, over the next few years, we're going to get to 12%. And we made great progress in 2011, and we continue to be on track to achieve that goal.","Gary Balter - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Now I'll ask that question. Gross margin was stronger than we expected this quarter, like it was down 39 but it'd come off down 80. What -- you mentioned also higher shrink. Could you discuss what were the components of the stronger gross margin and what gives you the confidence? Because you mentioned you expect it up next year as well.","Michael A. Norona","Yes. Gary, it's Mike. Maybe I'll give you the components and then Kevin can give you some of the insights. The 2 big drivers were supply chain, and  the story hasn't changed there as we've been putting in more hubs as part of our strategy to improve our market availability. A little bit higher gasoline prices, and investments we'll be making in our new DC and our WMS system. So that was the biggest part of the drain. And then our shrink year-over-year was down, but it was down less of a level than it's been in Q3 and Q2. So we're really pleased with the progress we're making -- that the Team Members are making on our shrink. But that was less of a component, but those were the 2 components.","Kevin P. Freeland","Yes, Gary, this is Kevin. The other elements essentially all netted to an even number. We've been aggressively ensuring that we're staying price competitive with our key competitors, continuing to work to lower cost of acquisition of product through category management and global sourcing. As Mike said in his prepared statements, it appears to us as though the shrink headwinds will abate as we get into the back half of next year. But the other elements that sit underneath gross margin, we expect to continue to march ahead.","Operator","Our next question is from Tony Cristello with BB&T Capital Markets.","Anthony F. Cristello - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","I wanted to talk a little bit about sort of your targeted share repurchase, how you're going to manage your leverage. I mean, down to 2x, which is certainly below your target, and your guidance reflects no share repurchase. Is there something we should consider as we look out for the balance of this year? Or is all systems sort of go but you're just going to be targeting it when it's most beneficial to you?","Michael A. Norona","It's Mike. First of all, we're really pleased with what we did last year. We bought about 12% of the company back on the heels of, well, 13.6% the year before that, in 2010. Our philosophy on share buyback hasn't changed. I think we've bought back about 40% of the company since 2004, and we continue to talk about being opportunistic. And that really is our confidence in our ability to continue to create long-term value. So we'll continue to be opportunistic. We have confidence in our ability to continue to grow that value and our historical performance, especially when you look at things like our top line growth, our bottom line growth and our returns, our ROIC, that's up over 500 basis points over the last 4 years. And then the other -- some other pieces is obviously maintaining our leverage ratio under our maximum 2.5x is important to us. Year-over-year, we kept that thing at 2%, and we were at 2% -- sorry, we were at 2x in 2011. And then I think the most important thing for us is share buyback is one available use of our capital. Our first options are always how do we grow the business and looking at options on how we grow the business. So over the last number of years, we put money into commercial. We put money into e-commerce, and we've been very pleased with the returns we've gotten. Kevin's talked extensively about supply chain and the opportunities we have there, our new Remington DC, our new WMS. And I think Kevin said it, we're going to have one of the most automated supply chains. And we'll have an opportunity to see what that does and the efficiencies that it gives. So the first choice is obviously to look at where we put our capital to grow our business. And if there's other little tuck-in acquisitions and things like that, kind of second. And then third, a great way to pay back our shareholders. So our philosophy hasn't changed. And I'll just remind you, we had an open to buy of 300 million. We have 200 million left on that going into the quarter.","Darren R. Jackson","Yes, Tony. Just maybe to build on that, Mike. To answer your question directly, Tony, each year, we just make a deliberate decision not to include stock buyback in our guidance. And that hasn't changed from prior years either. And I think, in a word, we haven't changed our philosophy and our approach. We do plan to be opportunistic. And that opportunistic -- you've been watching us for a long, long time. As Mike said, we've bought back $2 billion of stock since 2004 at about an average price of $45. So we feel pretty good about that strategy and don't see really any need to change it. And the good news is we're well below our targeted leverage ratio. So that gives us a lot of flexibility.","Anthony F. Cristello - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Okay. And maybe if I can just have the follow-up on sort of prioritizing growth. And it seems like as we moved through the phases of 2011, you sort of pulled back on some initiatives and were focused on delivering profitability, and based on where sales trends were. And it seems like you've seen a little bit maybe more of an acceleration of investment, and I'm just trying to understand how much of that was intentional, how much of it was sort of what wasn't spent last year sort of was pushed into this year.  And what's sort of the timing of this next phase of investment?","Darren R. Jackson","When I think about last year, a couple of things. We got out of the first quarter and, admittedly, we did not perform the way we thought and had hoped to perform. And quite frankly, the trends were just very different than when we started the year. And to your point, historically, we go into the year with heavy, heavy investment in the first quarter. I think in Mike's prepared comments, we're investing in the first quarter this year but not at the same levels that we have in historical years. And that phasing has moved, I would say, to be more evenly spread throughout the year. Because one of our learnings last year, and I think we've talked about this every conference call, is that the teams can absorb so much change in a period of time. And so what we've tried to do this year is even that out. And you're right, last year, I would say -- did we pull back on some investment in the second, third and the fourth quarter? Yes, we did a little bit, but it was really in the greater good of getting the process right and allowing the teams to absorb and execute. And you can see that playing out -- from my vantage point, you can see it playing out in the fourth quarter, in particular, that we were able to turn the tide on DIY, still grow the Commercial business at rates that we're happy with and improve our margins, improve our shrink and all those things that come with that, consistency of running the business. And we've gone into this year recognizing that's a big value to us, and we're spreading it out. So as Mike said, our first quarter is a quarter that, quite frankly, we feel really good about. And we tried to signal on the guidance for sure. Second, third and fourth, we feel really good about, but you know what, it will experience more investment this year than it did a year ago, just because of the lapping effect that we talked about.","Michael A. Norona","And, Tony, just -- it's in my remarks, but maybe I'll add a little color to it. We are going to have a little bit of pacing and timing with our costs throughout the year. So for instance, we have our large GM meeting that always occurs in our first quarter. That's going to get moved to the second quarter this year. And advertising last year, as you remember, our advertising, we got out of the blocks last year with some strong advertising in Q1. That's going to be spread a little bit more evenly through the second quarter through Q4. So those are a couple of examples.","Operator","Our next question is from Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I'd like to start out by asking about traffic and ticket trends, particularly for DIY but for the business more broadly as well.","Darren R. Jackson","Yes. So I don't know that there's any new news, Matt, in terms of traffic and ticket trends versus Q2, Q3, Q4 for us this year. Most of the growth, if not all the growth in DIY, has come from larger ticket. Though we have seen, as you would expect, from the first quarter of the year last year through the fourth quarter, our traffic's improved. But we have been -- as Mike alluded to, we did turn to some more traffic-driving marketing as we got into the year last year versus brand advertising, which we did heavy in the first quarter of last year. So there's no new news in terms of what those trends look like. As we look to this next year, one of the things we think about is we know regionality was a drag on our business in 2011. That regionality we felt, obviously, in the traffic. And if you think about it, that just meant there was probably more deferred maintenance. And so if we're slightly optimistic -- we're slightly optimistic around the fact that we'll see a little better traffic trends this year. And we believe that those ticket trends will continue as we get into 2012, too.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That's very helpful. And then as you think about Commercial, I guess in the context of it turned out to be a pretty good year, Commercial was a bit lower than double digit. And as you think about a sustainable growth rate for Commercial, both based on the market and based on your willingness to invest, how should we think about the next couple of years for that space?","Darren R. Jackson","Yes. We haven't changed our view on that either, Matt. We still see that as a double-digit comp grower for us. I would say that if I back up, we did, as I talked about in Tony's question, we did taper off some of our commercial investments last year in lieu of focusing on the execution. So as we come into this year, you'll experience us -- we've got still more wave markets to do, and we've built those into our plans. But we've built them in a way that we're spreading them across the year this year. And we think and we know from experience that those tend to certainly boost our comps and have a multi-quarter effect. So we don't have a different view either structurally about the commercial market. That seems to be as strong as it's been over the last several years. And this year, we must continue that investment pattern in our wave markets, our drivers and our delivery, speed things that we're focused on.","Operator","Our next question is from Greg Melich with ISI.","Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Just to follow up on the traffic and ticket trends, just to be clear. As I back out, it looks like DIY was still around a negative 1. But it's fair to say it improved a couple of hundred bps through the year. So we can still assume that the traffic was down in DIY a couple percent. Is that my math?","Darren R. Jackson","Yes, Greg, fourth quarter or for the year?","Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","For the fourth quarter.","Darren R. Jackson","Yes, traffic was down.","Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","And on gross margin, in terms of the outlook you guys provided, getting up a little bit, how important is getting the DC up and running and getting the inventory built for that to helping the gross margin start to grow again? And how should we think about that in terms of continuing to extend the payables, which obviously has been such a great job to help free cash flow?","Kevin P. Freeland","Yes, Greg, this is Kevin. Essentially, the investments that we're making to bring Remington online are being offset this year through some efficiency programs that we launched that are literally taking effect in the first quarter. So that should be relatively neutral in the overall picture. Mike, in his comments, mentioned that we expect the shrink to abate across the year and no longer be essentially a topic in the back half of this year. We're continuing to expand the global sourcing program. And while it was incredible percentage numbers early on, it is a substantial base at this point. And we're putting large percentages on top of large dollars. So that will continue to fuel the numbers. In terms of the supply chain financing, I would just ask you to look back at the last 3 years of how that program has unfolded. It is a day-by-day, negotiation-by-negotiation process that is a multi-year program. We're certainly proud of how that has played out and proud of the teams that are working on that. We're also proud of the speed at which we've deployed it. Another competitor in our space, certainly ahead of us, but it took them over a decade to accomplish what they were doing as they were blazing a trail, so to speak. But our plans would see improvements in that area for this year and likely beyond.","Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","So at the end of this year, 2012, would you expect inventory to grow at a similar rate to what it did in 2011?","Kevin P. Freeland","Much of the investments that we made this past year, so a substantial increase in the number of hub stores, we continue to see opportunities there, although we leapt ahead last year, did far more than we had historically done. Our plans for this year would look more similar to what you would have seen prior to 2011. So our inventory plans for the year would not -- which in total outgrew the cost of goods sold. As we go into next year or as we go into the balance of this year, it would be not likely that we would continue to aggregate inventory at that same rate, but instead would be a more modest growth in inventory. The intersection of that, with improved supply chain financing, we would expect to see similar cash flow going back to the company through improvements of reducing owned inventory.","Operator","Our next question is from Chris Horvers with JPMorgan.","Christopher Horvers - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Last year at this time, your sales were really hurt by geography and timing in the calendar, given really heavy storms in January and April. So is it fair to say that, that's working in your favor this year and perhaps comps have accelerated? And then related to that, can you talk about how the regionality changed sequentially in terms of the drag, 3Q to 4Q?","Darren R. Jackson","Yes. I can do this. So as we -- I said in our prepared remarks, Chris, that both DIY and Commercial are off to a good start this year. And certainly -- I mean, we've all been doing this long enough to know that last year, and we said this last year, January was tough in terms of the weather, and particularly in the Northeast. So there's no doubt that, that's in there. The way I think about it is that, over the course of the year, I always say this, weather evens out. So to your comments about regionality with Q3 to Q4, my recollection is that Q3 regionality was 300 basis points. This Q4 was probably closer 100 basis points. Unfortunately, this is probably the last time we'll be able to talk about it because the NPD data related to that is going away. We see a high value in that. Others see it differently. So we're done. I think this is the last time we'll be able to talk about that.","Christopher Horvers - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","That's very funny. And then as you think about -- surprise. As you think about the DIY acceleration and what happened with traffic and ticket, was the acceleration mainly a function of your ability to pass price through that you were holding back on in prior quarters that you mentioned? And was there any relationship between that and the gross margin trend looking better sequentially?","Kevin P. Freeland","Yes. This is Kevin. We've had a similar approach to pricing, both on the DIY and the Commercial side, that we built in the first few years that we came together as a team. It's a very simple concept, which is we benchmark our prices at a very detailed level, DIY versus Commercial, right down to the street address. And it is critical that we remain competitive, and that hasn't changed for years. That all said, there are certain items in the assortment that appear inelastic. And those are areas that we look for margin enhancement. But as we go into a head-to-head, what are the key categories, customers that are price shopping, what are they discovering, our analytics would suggest that we've been quite competitive for the last several years and maintained that way through last year. Now one of the elements is we get a certain level of price inflation and deflation at the landed cost level, predominantly driven by commodities. Oil would be an example. It has changed dramatically in the years we've been together as a team. Steel would be to a lesser extent. Those reflect in our gross margin based on our accounting practices faster than they do with some of our key competitors. So the price that the customer sees has remained competitive and consistent. How that actually flows through and impacts different people in our channel is -- so to Darren's point, weather kind of evens out over the year, and so does pricing. But it negatively affected us on the front half of the year. And at this stage, we don't see any material movements in the moment that would be noteworthy to report in terms of an outlook.","Darren R. Jackson","Yes. The other small thing, to build on Kevin's point, Chris, in the fourth quarter, we did have a weather benefit. And what I mean by that is you could change your oil. And so when I look at the mix now -- the other side of that is we didn't sell as much anti-freeze and some of the chemicals for cold weather. You could change your brakes. So when you peer into what was occurring is that mix certainly played a role in terms of the DIY improvement. But I don't want to underestimate or undersell or underappreciate the team's execution. I've felt, in my 4 years, exiting this year and entering next year, that focus on execution. We say running the business with excellence and what our field teams are doing, I must say, it's at an all-time high. It really is in terms of their focus around our oil business, brakes, batteries, the key front room categories. And that played a huge role in it because when I look at the absolute comparisons, as you pointed out, the DIY comparison in our fourth quarter was about as tough as we've had all year. And so it's not just luck or circumstance. They've done a nice job actually bringing it all into the fourth quarter.","Christopher Horvers - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So if I were just going to summarize that, that response, it sounded like, yes, it helped gross margin sequentially but it wasn't as if the acceleration in DIY was solely price-driven ticket increase?","Darren R. Jackson","No. I think some of your peers would tell you that our pricing was below others in the fourth quarter.","Operator","Our next question is from Dan Wewer with Raymond James.","Daniel R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","So Darren, on your guidance of low- to mid-single digits, for the 5% scenario to possibly come into play, what would have to change? Would it be a pickup in Do-It-Yourself growth? Or could you achieve that 4% or 5% comp sales gain even if Do-It-Yourself remain flattish?","Darren R. Jackson","Yes, well, I'll start one level above that, Dan, because that is a relatively wide range. And I'd say, what's underneath that is that -- I don't know where gas prices are going to go this year. Is that -- if we have stability throughout the year in gas prices, and depending on whose projections you read, it could go to darn near $5 at some places. Other people will tell you, you know what, we'll probably stay somewhere around $4.50. So I think about the overall cloud that's out there is understanding where overall gas prices will go. I think we saw that lessen this year. Miles driven tend to have a lesser effect this year as we look at failure and maintenance. Below that, between -- so that, overall, that has a disproportionate effect on our DIY business. I think as we -- and I think DIY, whether we do 5 or above or 1 or below, it's 2\/3 of our business. So your instincts are right, is that the stronger we finish on DIY historically, the stronger we finish on that comp. What do I look at is store execution. And externally, what am I looking at? I'm looking at gas prices. And I'm looking, to a lesser extent, at miles driven to actually think about where we'll finish in that range.","Daniel R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Do you think that, given you've reduced the amount of selling space to the front end of the store and you've taken out some of the Do-It-Yourself-oriented inventory, that, that type of ramp in Do-It-Yourself is possible even if gasoline prices were to stay flat or drop?","Darren R. Jackson","Yes. I have Charles with me. Charles, year-over-year, there's not a material difference you see in what we have in terms of consumer and in terms of DIY?","Charles E. Tyson","No. I mean -- when we came together as a team, early on, we went in and looked at rationalization in our assortments and took what was unproductive and took about 18 months to take that out. But on a year-on-year sequential basis, we've expanded our assortments from better utilization of the back room space and put more inventory into our parts business to actually build our capability to serve the DIY customer, not at the expense of taking away from the front room categories that they expect us to carry.","Daniel R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","And Mike, just one real quick question for you. Can you tell us why the company did not buy back any shares during the fourth quarter?","Michael A. Norona","I think we answered it previously. We bought back 12% of the company, and we're pleased by that. And then we...","Daniel R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","But that was to end that -- that ended the fourth quarter?","Michael A. Norona","Yes, that's what I mean. I mean, we look at it over the year. I think in the fourth quarter, we did some other things around our capital structure. We were planning for a bond offering. We were focused on executing our business. There's also certain blackout periods that we hit. It's a longer period of time that we run into a little bit. But we're pleased. There was no -- I wouldn't read anything into it of why we didn't buy back shares.","Operator","Our final question today comes from Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets.","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I know you guys have touched on this but, obviously, SG&A has been a pretty big swing factor for the last couple of quarters. And Mike, I know you tried to highlight a couple of items. But it looks like the change that you're looking for in SG&A per store is pretty sizable. I mean, we've had down 3% to 5% by my calculations the last couple of quarters. Now we're expecting positive low-single digits. Can you talk about what you mean in terms of normalization of compensation? And then just the sequencing. I think, Darren, you actually referenced this a little bit. Should we -- in terms of some of your expenses.  Should we actually expect flat to down SG&A dollars in the first quarter, followed by sizable increases in the balance of the year? So 2 questions there.","Michael A. Norona","Yes, so Scot, great question. So first of all, the kind of the pockets that we've been taking costs from are really 3 fold. And we started the work in 2010, and we really saw it happen in 2011, where we're seeing better productivity in areas like our labor. So we're leveraging labor. We're spending more -- we're spending the same dollars, a little bit more actual dollars, but we're getting more leverage around those labors, around efficiencies and some of the excellence that Darren talked about. Our commercial programs, our commercial productivity on our commercial sales per program is up 45%. So I think the number is $637,000 per program. And back 3 or 4 years ago, it was closer to $430,000. So we're seeing productivity. We're also seeing reduced variability across our chain in terms of our performance. We're trying to variable-ize some of our fixed costs. And then we're also taking out cost furthest away from the customer, some of our discretionary, our occupancy and areas like that. The way to think about it is this. Where we started -- we were starting from a high SG&A rate. And I think -- I'm really pleased by the team's progress of pulling costs out and better leverage. But the other thing you saw last year is our incentive compensation. That played a pretty big role in terms of our leverage last year because what happened is we pay on growth. We have a very competitive program. We share a material  more amount of our dollars and our success with our Team Members. And just last year, when you do a 2.2% comp versus an 8% comp, the incentive compensation, so that created a little bit of some of the SG&A we picked up last year. Also, and I think Darren talked about it last year, is the investments compared to historical levels were down. So you saw the benefit of the year-over-year change, with investments being a little bit, I'll call it, decelerated last year. When you put that together, last year, we saw more leverage come out. And you think, we did a 2.2 comp and we leveraged SG&A about 114 basis points. I think last year was a repositioning year. The way we look at it going forward now is -- and I haven't felt confident enough to say this but I feel confident saying it now. Going forward, we're probably going to leverage SG&A in more of that 3% to 4% range. So next year, the dollar is going to increase. And what we said is that, next year, our SG&A per store is going to grow at low-single digits. And what I'd read into that is we're going to continue our work to improve our cost structure and productivity, reduce variability and taking costs out furthest away from the customer. That's going to be offset by the investments that Darren referred to. Because we're committed to getting to 12% operating growth. And that is going to come in 2 ways. We got to continue to grow the business, so we need to still invest in commercial, availability and areas like e-commerce and global sourcing. So the offset to the SG&A will be investments in those areas. And we'll continue to demand the same kind of returns that we've been getting. So that's how we think about it. So we would anticipate that we're going to leverage in roughly that 3% to 4% range, and SG&A per store is going to go up in that low-single digits.","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then in terms of the cadence, should we actually think about kind of flattish dollars in the first quarter followed by sizable increases in the back?","Darren R. Jackson","Scot, I think you're on track. Think about, we began the process really aggressively in the second quarter of last year. We're going to anniversary a lot of that work. And you know how expenses work.  We'll anniversary them through the first quarter of this year. As Mike said, we'll have some unique things. We're moving a managers' meeting that -- those aren't hundreds of thousands of dollars, those are millions of dollars that go from Q1 to Q2. We've spread out the investments. We still have investments in Q1, but we're trying to, as I said earlier, even those out throughout the year so the team can absorb them. We're upping our store count this year. That'll add a little bit more to our expense in terms of the flow, principally in the back half of the year. And that's what we tried to clearly articulate in our prepared comments as well.","Operator","Thank you.

Before we begin, Elisabeth Eisleben, Vice President, Investor Relations will make a brief statement concerning forward-looking statements that will be made on this call.","Elisabeth Eisleben","Good morning and thank you for joining us to discuss our second quarter 2018 results. I am joined by Tom Greco, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Jeff Shepherd, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Bob Cushing, our Executive Vice President of Professional; and Mike Broderick, our Executive Vice President, Merchandising and Store Operations Support. Following their prepared remarks, we will turn our attention to answering your questions.","Before we begin, be advised that our comments today may include statements that may be deemed forward-looking statements pursuant to the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

The content of this call will be governed by the information contained in our earnings press release and related financial statements.","Now let me turn the call over to Tom Greco.","Thomas R. Greco","Thanks, Elisabeth and good morning. Before I begin as you read in yesterday's press release I am thrilled to announce Jeff Shepherd has been appointed Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and I am also very excited that Reuben Slone is joining our leadership team in October as Executive Vice President, Supply Chain. I look forward to working with Jeff and Reuben in their new roles and we will provide further context on these exciting changes momentarily. ","I would like to begin by recognizing the hard work of the entire AAP team as well as our network of Carquest independents, who delivered strong balanced performance in the quarter. We are raising our game on execution which is enabling us to win business, drive growth, and significantly narrow the performance gap versus the industry. In addition our focus on cost control and working capital enabled bottom line growth year-over-year and has substantial improvement in cash flow. ","In the second quarter net sales increased by 2.8% to $2.3 billion and comparable sales were up 2.8%. Our adjusted operating income margin of 8.8% increased 19 basis points compared to the prior year quarter and our adjusted earnings per share increased 24.7% to $1.97. Our free cash flow was $382 million through the first six months of 2018, an increase of $237 million year-over-year more than 2.5 times. ","Our cash position is at the highest level since the 2014 GPI acquisition, and as a result Jeff will discuss our capital allocation plans along with more details on our financials later in the call. An escalated focus on execution by our AAP team members and independent partners has enabled a significant improvement in relative growth on both the one- and two-year stack basis and resulted in increased units per transaction and increased ticket values. In addition, following two consecutive years of particularly mild winters, we experienced the winter in which both temperatures and precipitation were closer to historical averages. ","As we indicated on our Q1 call the delayed start of our spring selling season hindered our sales performance in the latter part of the first quarter. Early in Q2, however, we saw increased demand across many categories which we believe will continue to positively impact AAP for the remainder of 2018 as our DIY business and Professional customers benefit from investments in previously delayed repairs. From a category perspective in the quarter we saw increased sales in brakes and batteries which grew mid single-digits. In addition we delivered a substantial improvement in engine management and undercar versus previous run rates as we leveraged long-term vendor partnerships to help with the early deployment of the right inventory leveraging new analytical capabilities. ","Finally due to the delayed start to spring, we experienced strong growth in spring related categories such as maintenance, appearance chemicals, and optics. We saw improvement in nearly all of our geographic regions with accelerated growth performance compared to Q1 with the largest sequential improvements in the Midwest, Appalachian, Southwest, and Gulf Coast regions. ","Turning to the bottom line, we remain disciplined in our approach to control expenses across the entire organization. While our adjusted SG&A cost increased on an absolute dollar basis year-over-year, I want to recognize our field operations and store team members for their ability to leverage additional customer service hours with increased sales in the quarter. Unlike in prior years where we struggled to reduce our costs, we leveraged this large cost line in Q2 by establishing clear performance expectations, providing improved tools and training for our general managers, and tracking results daily at a granular level to manage performance. In total, our adjusted SG&A costs as a percent of sales were 35 basis points lower than the prior year. ","As you'll hear from Jeff on our updated expectations for the year, we remain optimistic on sustaining our top line momentum in Q3 and Q4. In addition as evidenced in our Q2 results our focus on cost control will help offset planned and unplanned headwinds impacting bottom line results for the balance of the year. With that said we remain committed to the execution of our long-term plan and have made headways on several initiatives. In terms of our Professional business, we continued the roll out of our professional e-commerce platform, Advance Pro in the second quarter. We've now converted all of our existing Professional Advance customers to this platform ahead of our initial plans and without disruption to our Customer Value Proposition. ","We have received positive feedback from customers that they love the new Advance Pro platform. It's driving higher conversion rates and increased average dollars per transaction across our Professional business. Our team members did a great job accelerating the rollout, and with faster completion we were able to sunset one system while simultaneously driving growth in our Professional business. In addition, Q2 was the first full quarter since the rollout of cross banner visibility was completed. With an entire quarter of in market accessibility we saw positive trends and higher conversion rates which enabled us to say yes, and close the sale more often. With cross banner visibility, we expand the quality and breadth of assortment for customers, and I'm excited about what this means for our future growth.","For our DIY customers, Q2 was one of marked improvement in terms of both retail and online performance. In our stores, our emphasis on improving the customer value proposition is taking hold among our team members and we've seen improvement in key performance indicators. In fact, we grew units per transaction in 10 of the 12 weeks in Q2, which drove increased average ticket value. This enabled improvement in key categories that drive traffic like motor oil, batteries, and appearance chemicals. In terms of DIY omnichannel, we continue to gain momentum as visitors to our website grew significantly while sustaining our conversion rate. This means we're bringing new customers into our improved online experience and driving loyalty. Importantly we expanded our ship-to-home coverage and made notable improvements to delivery speed which is positively impacting our e-commerce growth. Across DIY broadly we're focused on providing a best in class omnichannel experience as we strengthen customer engagement both online and in stores.","Moving to supply chain we continue to execute on strategic initiatives to streamline our end-to-end supply chain. We are confident we will achieve long-term cost reductions and efficiency and have deployed a detailed plan to optimize our distribution network. To that end as announced last quarter we have began the process of closing our Gallman distribution center and anticipate completing this by the end of the year. Additionally we recently announced internally that we will be closing our San Antonio DC. As with Gallman, we're committed to providing our impacted San Antonio team members with assistance during this transition. Consistent with Gallman, we expect to close the San Antonio facility by the end of the year.","The implementation of our supply chain transformation is critical to our success and we're pleased with our progress to date. As announced yesterday Leslie Keating will retire from Advance at the end of the year. I'm confident in the robust supply chain strategy that she and her team have built and thrilled that Reuben Slone will be taking the lead in a seamless transition. This plan enables us to maximize supply chain capabilities, improve customer service, reduce cost, and better leverage the resources and talents within Advance. ","Leslie came to Advance following her retirement from a successful 30 year career. I am grateful for her leadership and expertise during this important part of our transformation. Leslie joined Advance with three key objectives; lead the development of our end-to-end supply chain strategy, strengthen our supply chain leadership team, and assist in finding a world class successor. She has delivered on each of these objectives and we are thankful for the tremendous work she's led to position us for future success. While we wish her the very best in her much deserved retirement, Leslie will stay on through the end of the year to ensure a seamless transition.","Reuben Slone will join Advance as Executive Vice President, Supply Chain in October. Reuben is a well respected supply chain expert with a proven track record and will be responsible for supply chain operations and our procurement function. Having served on our Board since 2016, Reuben is intimately familiar with our transformation efforts. In addition his background and experience is impressive and extremely relevant to our business. He joined us from Walgreens where he served six years as Senior Vice President, Supply Chain responsible for inventory management and replenishment, imports, transportation, distribution center operations, and logistics. Importantly Reuben brings extensive omnichannel fulfillment experience. This is very exciting for us as we continue to develop best in class customer engagement capabilities with best in class fulfillment.","As we prepare for Reuben's transition from our Board to our leadership team we're also pleased to announce Nigel Travis has joined our Board. Nigel recently retired after nine years as CEO of Duncan brands and currently serves at the Executive Chairman of Duncan. We're thrilled to add a seasoned executive to our Board who has diverse global experience. Nigel previously served in a variety of [indiscernible] and executive leadership roles and adds highly relevant experience to our Board. We really look forward to working with him.","Finally we're encouraged by the current industry trends and outlook for overall growth going forward. We also believe that our efforts to improve and strengthen our business will enable us to drive market share in a strong, healthy industry. With the improved performance across the enterprise coupled with the confidence we have in our future we're taking an opportunity to return a portion of our excess cash to our shareholders by buying back our stock. In line with our strategic objectives and financial priorities our Board has approved a new $600 million share repurchase authorization. ","In summary while Q2 represented another important step in the right direction for AAP, we're far from satisfied. We remain focused on the relentless execution of our strategy and are confident in our ability to capitalize on the substantial opportunity ahead. Before I turn it over to Jeff Shepherd I want to take this opportunity to congratulate him on his promotion and thank him for the tremendous job he's done over the past 18 months. After the completion of a thorough search, Jeff clearly emerged as the right person to take Advance to the next level and I could not be more excited to announce his appointment to Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. ","Jeff brings an impressive global finance background, a deep understanding of our strategic objectives, and is highly respected throughout Advance. He's been an excellent thought partner for me during the past few months while playing a lead role in building a talented, highly cohesive finance team since he joined. Jeff will play a critical role in unlocking our considerable potential. With that I'll turn it over to Jeff. ","Jeffrey Shepherd","Thanks and good morning everyone. I want to thank Tom, the Board and the entire Advance team for their support as we continue working together to fully cast the vast opportunities ahead for Advance. I am honored to be part of such an impressive team of leaders and grateful for this opportunity during such an exciting time in the company's transformation. Before I expand on our financial performance I want to congratulate all of our team members for delivering a strong quarter of improved results and thank them for the hard work they do every day to enable our success.","In the second quarter our adjusted gross profit was $1 billion, an increase of 2.4% from the prior year quarter. On a rate basis our adjusted gross profit margin of 43.7% was down slightly compared to the prior year quarter primarily due to both planned and unplanned supply chain expenses which in total reduced our gross margin by 35 basis points. As we've indicated previously, expenses related to the two new distribution centers that were opened last year raised our cost base in the quarter versus the prior year. Separately rising transportation and fuel costs exceeded our forecasted inflation for these cost lines in the quarter. Additionally while we have seen positive top line results from cross banner visibility there are still significant opportunities to improve operational efficiencies as we fulfill new demand with a less than optimized fulfillment model.","At this stage we're focused on ensuring the part is received in a timely manner and at times this results in inefficient delivery. While we know our cost structure is not optimized we will continue to leverage cross banner visibility to drive growth and expect to deliver improved cost as a percentage of net sales over time as we improve efficiency through the supply chain transformation. Finally despite the increased sales our overall product mix was unfavorable. Our top line benefited from outperformance in engine management and under cars in addition to strengthened HVAC and cooling chemicals. However these carry a lower gross margin rate. These headwinds were partially offset by improvements in material costs, inventory related expenses, and effective. The combination of these factors contributed to gross margin contraction of 16 basis point in the quarter.","Adjusted SG&A was $812 million in the second quarter, an increase of $14 million year-over-year. Overall as a percentage of net sales our adjusted SG&A improved by 35 basis points to 34.9%. These improvements were driven by savings in labor and insurance expenses as we heightened the focus on safety throughout the organization. These benefits were partially offset by an increase in bonus compared to the prior year. This will continue to be a headwind for the balance of the year as our incentive compensation for corporate and field teams was much lower last year due to last year's performance. Of course this is also an important investment as we raise the bar on talent and performance and expect our people to succeed and achieve their goals.","In regard to adjusted operating income we delivered an adjusted operating income of $205 million in the second quarter, a 5% improvement versus the prior year. Our adjusted operating margin increased 19 basis points to 8.8% in the quarter. We remain steadfast in our approach to managing cash and delivering on our capital allocation priorities. Through the first half of 2018 our operating cash flow increased nearly $177 million to $444 million and free cash flow was $382 million compared to $145 million during the same period of 2017. Because of our disciplined cash management and improving payment terms our AP ratio increased to 70%. We remain committed to the progress on our AP ratio and we're confident we will deliver steady improvement throughout the balance of 2018 and beyond. In line with this focus we have successfully reduced inventory year-over-year for six consecutive quarters while repositioning inventory throughout our network to enable us to say yes to the customer more often and increase inventory turns.","With that said we remain committed to our customer value proposition and we will not take actions in a short-term that will negatively impact our customers. We continue to focus on optimizing our inventory over the next several years while improving the assortment across the enterprise and given we are now growing we are being thoughtful regarding our inventory plan for the balance of the year.","Moving to capital investments, due to the timing of certain projects and fewer store openings our CAPEX spend in the quarter decreased to $27 million to $57 million in the prior year. In the quarter our largest investments were related to supply chain as well as IT projects. As Tom said earlier we are seeing continued improvements in underlying industry fundamentals and the benefits from our transformation actions are clearly beginning to take effect. We believe we are poised to improve market share and make further progress closing the competitive performance gap. Based on these factors along with our results in the first half of 2018 we're pleased to update our 2018 full year guidance increasing net sales and comparable store sales growth expectations while increasing our net sales outlook from a range of $9.1 billion to $9.4 billion to a new range of $9.3 billion to $9.5 billion. Our comparable store sales guidance is also increasing from down 2% to flat and is now expected to be flat to up 1.5%.","In addition we are raising the low end of our adjusted operating income margin guidance from 7.3% to 7.5%. Compare it to know we're monitoring certain headwinds in the back half of the year which will impact margin expansion. This includes higher than originally planned inflation and transportation and fuel cost. Further we're pleased with the positive impact cross banner visibility is having on our top line, however, we have significant opportunities to improve overall efficiency and enable better margin flow through.","This optimization effort is currently underway, however, it is unlikely this will yield much in the way a benefit in the back half of 2018. Finally we are reviewing our plans for new Worldpac locations in the second half of the year and see potential to increase the number of branches we will open. Year-to-date Worldpac openings have been very successful in driving top line growth. Depending on timing and the number added there are potential margin impacts associated with the start up cost required to open these branches. These investments however will benefit our entire Professional network looking ahead to 2019. But we're working diligently to minimize current and potential cost headwinds, we feel it is best to remain prudent in our expectations for the year and are therefore maintaining the high end of our previously provided adjusted operating income margin range at 7.8%.","Additionally we're pleased with our ability to generate cash from the business and our overall liquidity is much stronger than it's been in years. Last week our Board approved a new $600 million share repurchase authorization. This replaces the authorization put in place in 2012. In line with our financial priorities and investing in our business and maintaining an investment grade rating we are targeting $100 million to $200 million in share repurchases to the end of 2018.","Turning to the last two items updated in our full year guidance, we are decreasing our capital expenditure outlook to a range of $180 million to $220 million due to a combination of higher level of scrutiny on every capital project as well as timing expectations of certain projects this year. In terms of free cash flow we are pleased with the improvement in the first half of 2018, as a result we're increasing the low end of our outlook by $100 million to a minimum of $500 million for the full year. We're confident the discipline we have put in place, the strategic actions we have taken will enable continued growth for 2018 and beyond. With that let's open it up to addressing your questions. Operator.","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Chris Horvers from J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.","Christopher Horvers","Thanks, good morning guys and congratulations Jeff and for the hiring of Reuben. So a few questions, so can you talk about how DIY and the Pro business performed relative to each other in the second quarter and can you talk about how they trended sequentially versus the first quarter, did Pro accelerate more, did DIY accelerate more because of the seasonal shift?","Thomas R. Greco","Hey, good morning Chris. First of all, they actually performed relatively close over the course of the quarter in absolute terms. Within Pro we saw real benefit from cross banner visibility as we spoke about in our prepared remarks, so we saw a nice acceleration for Pro. And then on the DIY side, we actually had a greater sequential improvement from the first quarter some of which was that shift that we talked about on the Q1 call where a very soft April led to a terrific start to the quarter in May, particularly on the DIY side and very encouraged by the trends in DIY. In the stores, we're executing better, we're driving our units per transaction nicely, that is helping our store performance, and then of course the online piece continues to perform very well and accelerate. So, relatively speaking, in line with each other but sequentially a greater improvement in DIY.","Christopher Horvers","Understood and then how are you thinking about your performance relative to the market. You focus -- you mentioned one and two year stacks, should we think about the second quarter and thinking about looking at the stacks or should we look at the first half given some of these shifts, I think it's tough because I mean clearly there is an acceleration in the industry and execution, so just trying to get your thought there on how you're thinking about instead of the performance of the business on a stack basis?","Thomas R. Greco","Yeah, I think in fairness, we would probably want to look at the full front half of the year, right Chris. I mean just the timing shift from Q1 into Q2 but even if you look at that you'll see a nice improvement relatively speaking versus our primary competitors over the course of the last three years if you look at 2015, 2016, 2017. And then contrast that to the front half of this year you'll see a significant improvement on a relative basis. But I think in fairness you probably want to look at the front half. ","Christopher Horvers","Understood and then just one clarifying question, as you think about the guidance and the raise of the comp guidance for the year, I understand that you talked about an improving demand environment, but was essentially the comp raise only for the first half upside?","Thomas R. Greco","I think we have continued to see positive trends through the back half also so there was obviously the front half performance was reflected, but I think you're going to continue to see an improved demand in environment for the industry. We like what we are seeing. Certainly, it's been very warm this summer, so we benefit from that and then from an execution standpoint I really like the progress that our field team is making in terms of driving improved execution and we're going to continue to stay focused on that every week. So we're encouraged by that and that's partly reflected as well.","Christopher Horvers","Thanks, best of luck. ","Thomas R. Greco","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you and our next question comes from Matt Fassler from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. ","Matthew Fassler","Thanks so much and good morning. It would be really helpful to try to get a sense from you as to the impact you think some of your self-help initiatives had. You spoke about improved analytics and parts availability, you spoke about the cross banner initiative, I know that it might be difficult to pinpoint the impact that it had on the business but while the industry got better you had a very nice beat relative to expectations, any sense of how they're contributing would be terrific?","Jeffrey Shepherd","Sure Matt, I think again splitting it out into their respective businesses, on the Professional side there's no question that the work that Bob Cushing has led on cross banner visibility has really helped us. It gives our customers visibility to the breadth and assortment that we have across the enterprise as opposed to a narrower view. And we're up to 40,000 customers that we've got on Advance Pro. They are in a great position to see all the parts that we have and they're ordering accordingly. So there is clearly some incremental benefit we're getting from that and that just keeps getting better each week as the learning curve improves on cross banner. ","On the DIY side, for sure we're seeing progress on units per transaction, our field leaders Mike Reid and Maria Aires [ph] are driving UPT deep into the organization. Mike Broderick conducts the call each week with the store operations leaders to focus on what's the progress we are making on UPT, how are we performing against very specific initiatives. So we're seeing improvement there and I think we're up 10 of 12 weeks on UPT. There is still a lot of room to grow that one Matt but we feel good about it. And then in terms of online we look at our visitors to our website. I think if you look at the most recent reports that have been out on that through June our traffic was up over 90% in June and we're amongst the leaders in all of retail in online visitor growth and the good thing about that is we have been actually been able to hold our conversion rate as our traffic has been going up. So I think some of the things that we're doing online are helping as well. So those are the big drivers from an internal standpoint that are helping our execution and I think they played a role in not just us rising with all the boats within the industry but by disproportionately doing so.","Matthew Fassler","Just a quick follow up on cross banner, Jeff talked about some margin offsets associated with that, it sounds like the net economic impact this year probably is modest despite better sales, any way to size the margin, perhaps the sales impact for those and the margin headwind you'd expect from that initiative over the rest of the year? ","Jeffrey Shepherd","Yeah, what's happening there Matt I mean you think about when we launch cross banner which is really a strengthened engagement platform for our professional customers and we wanted to make sure we knew what the impact of that was going to be before we started to make wholesale changes to our fulfillment structure. And so now we've got a couple of months under our belt, we're starting to get a sense for what are the products that are disproportionately improving, are there assortment changes we need to be making inside of our Advance stores or Worldpac branches, how do we connect those end market nodes, all of those factors are being considered as we look at the balance of year. So we now have a couple of months under our belt and we're very focused on a much more coordinated effort with our end market nodes. So you think about the hub routes that we have that connect our stores to the hubs and the distribution centers, you think about the routed delivery network that we operate through Worldpac. What's happening now when Bob's leading a lot of its work and with Leslie at the moment and ultimately with Reuben but how do we optimize a new more demand really coming into us and make sure that we're doing it in the most efficient way possible. So that work is underway. I just don't expect it to have a huge impact on the back half.","Matthew Fassler","Okay, thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Baker from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Michael Baker","Thanks, a couple of questions. First on the comps, just using the midpoint of the guidance it looks like you're expecting a similar back half comp versus the front half yet you have about 150 basis point easier comparison and then you guys do look at the two year stack, so why wouldn't we expect an acceleration in the back half versus the front half?","Thomas R. Greco","Hey, good morning Mike. I think the thinking there is we're just early into the quarter. We still got a lot of time left in Q3 as a matter of fact and also Q4. So, we just don\u2019t want to get out ahead of ourselves. I think we really like the progress we're making. You're absolutely right that we had a difficult Q3 last year. We just want to make sure we are thoughtful as we look at this and we are really engineering our cost structure to a level that we can deliver on all the key metrics that we are accountable to, so I think that's the point.","Michael Baker","Okay, that's helpful, and one more, just on the margins you read out some reasons why your sales increase is ahead of your margin increase, couple of thoughts, one, you didn't mention specifically incentive comp or bonuses in there, is that a factor precluding you from raising the high end of your margin guidance? And then secondly you talked about inflation being a potential negative to margins, why wouldn\u2019t you be able to pass through cost increases I think historically that's what the space is seeing, so why would that be a margin hit?","Jeffrey Shepherd","Well, let me let me try and give you a bit of sense for that Mike. First of all we did mention bonuses as a factor. I mean the bonus was a factor in the quarter, it will be a factor full year. So, I'll try and give you a sense for how we are thinking about the full year. Some of these items we called out in our prepared remarks that impacted Q2 and they will limit the margin expansion in the back half. So within supply chain which is the biggest one we are seeing inflation in transportation costs that are in excess of our plans. I just talked a little bit about cross banner visibility where the source and delivery costs are not yet optimized. We talked about product mix in our prepared remarks where we're selling more of certain products which carry a lower gross margin rate. So if you think about those factors impacting Q2 we do see -- we have carried forward a little bit of that into our balance of the year forecast. There is two other items that I draw your attention to balance of year and both of these are within SG&A. First we will be investing in the back half in marketing to drive traffic and customer loyalty. We're really excited about a new advertising campaign that we're kicking off, it'll be in full flight in September and we expect the ROI in this to be very positive but more to come on that. Very exciting new advertising for us, it's been a long time since we've had effective advertising in this company and we want to build our brand, build customer loyalty, and drive traffic behind that campaign. ","Secondly we are opening more Worldpac branches in the back half. There are short-term startup costs associated with this that are above the prior year. But we think both of these investments, the marketing and the Worldpac branches will enable us to exit 2018 and start 2019 with momentum. So those are the things that went into the back half guidance and we're excited about the top line momentum that we have and we want to continue that momentum into 2019 and of course we'll stay diligent on the cost side.","Michael Baker","That makes sense. One follow-up to all that if I could, a quarter ago you said gross margins would be up within your guidance, is that still the expectation?","Jeffrey Shepherd","Yeah, for the year we do expect the gross margins to be up, yes.","Michael Baker","Thank you, appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Lasser from UBS. Your line is open. ","Michael Lasser","Good morning, thanks a lot for taking my question and congratulations Jeff and Reuben on their new roles. One of the elusive factors from Advance Auto Parts model over the long run has been getting the sales and the margins to work together at the same time. We saw a little bit of that again this quarter Tom, when do you think it's reasonable to expect that you can get sales gross margin, the SG&A leverage all work together at the same time?","Thomas R. Greco","Yeah, good morning Michael. Thanks for the comment. I think that we're balancing those levers very thoughtfully. We are actually in the middle of updating our five year strategic plan, we shared a draft of that with our Board of Directors recently. And I would say more than ever we deeply understand the margin differential between ourselves and that of our peers. And we're very clear on what I would describe as our addressable opportunities on the margin line from structural opportunities. So if you consider our year-end margin of 2017 of 7.3% and you contrast that to our primary competitors we believe somewhere between 60% and 70% of that absolute margin gap is in fact addressable. ","So what we're doing now, my leadership team and I we are really fine tuning the choices we need to make in order to balance that addressable margin expansion opportunities with the share growth opportunity because we also have a big share growth opportunity sitting here with what we believe is about 7% of the industry market share. So how do you do that over a five year plan, how do you drive shareholder value through a combination of top line growth margin expansion and SCF [ph] improvement. And I think you should see consistent progress on this from here on in to answer your question directly. We believe we can drive our top line, improve share performance, increase margins, and drive free cash flow throughout our five year plan and that's how we're approaching it. It's really a balance between all of those levers and we're going to continue to stay focused on doing it in a way that is sustainable.","Michael Lasser","Thank you and my follow up question is on how you measure your idiosyncratic improvement or what you have control over within your organization because clearly the industry environment this quarter was much more favorable than it was last quarter particularly in the region that you are more levered to, so can you give us some sense of what you think the weather catch up from the first quarter to the second quarter contributed to your second quarter results?","Thomas R. Greco","Yes, it is a difficult question Michael but to think that as I have mentioned earlier there's obviously an industry benefit that happened in the second quarter overall. But we are seeing progress on some of the key metrics that we look at that say we're improving our competitiveness at the same time. And those are all the infernal input metrics that we talk about whether that is units per transaction or online visitors or even DIY market share that we look at. So, I think there are some things that would say that our execution is driving disproportionate improvement. ","Michael Lasser","Great, good luck with the second half of the year. Thanks. ","Thomas R. Greco","Thank you. ","Operator","Thank you and our next question comes from Bret Jordan from Jefferies. Your line is open.","Bret Jordan","Hey, good morning guys. ","Thomas R. Greco","Good morning Bret. ","Bret Jordan","A question on the leverage ratio, I guess the 2.9 times is still I bet implementing a share repurchase program. It sounds like you have talked to the rating agencies and they will let you spend a couple hundred million without getting down to 2.5 first?","Jeffrey Shepherd","Yeah, we do talk up frequently with the rating vacancies but I'm sure they'll be publishing something. I'm not going to speak for them but we feel really comfortable with where we're at in terms of our cash balance and our ability to continue to generate cash on a sustained basis Bret. So we kind of factored all that in, in-line with our cash priorities which as we've said before maintaining that investment grade rating is very important to us. We want to continue to invest and reinvest in the business. You can see that we have got some back half CAPEX investments were going to be taking place. And having said all that we feel like we've got the right level of cash, we've got the right discipline in place to generate cash, sufficient that we feel like we can start returning cash to shareholders. So we feel very comfortable with the positions that we're taking. ","Bret Jordan","Yeah, and I think you commented that you expected your accounts payable ratio to go up in the balance of the year. So I guess to some extent is there a target AP inventory maybe by the end of the year? ","Jeffrey Shepherd","We expect it to continue to go up. It went up a couple of points I think from Q1 to Q2. And I would expect a similar trajectory but to be clear Bret it's going to take some time. If the initiatives that we have put in place, Mike and his team as they go through the negotiations with our vendors and getting the new terms, we have to lap those old terms and those are going to take time. And as we continue to improve on top line execution that of course will help move the needle as well. But we want to do this in a very disciplined manner so I would expect the trajectory to be very similar to first half. ","Bret Jordan","Okay, and the question I always have to ask, can you update us where we are on IT and catalog consolidation?","Thomas R. Greco","Sure, we're pretty excited about the work that Sri Donthi who is our Chief Technology Officer. He has been here for about three or four months Bret, is doing to really accelerate the work that needs to be done there. He obviously was part of the five year plan, the one page clip notes version of what he's talking about starts with the integration of the technology across all of our banners. We know we have to simplify our systems and data architecture across all of our banners. He's got significant experience with that. He's working closely with Bob Cushing, with Mike Broderick, all of the key constituents to construct a roadmap to get that done faster than it had been moving previously. And we feel very comfortable that we're going to get that work done. So all of that is road mapped and the timing of it is coming. Obviously many of these things have to be tested but Sri is going to make a big difference there for us. ","Bret Jordan","Okay, any targets for timing for when?","Thomas R. Greco","We absolutely have targets against that. We're not communicating that broadly but we're going to continue to work it. ","Bret Jordan","Okay, great. Thank you. ","Operator","Thank you. Our question comes from Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. ","Simeon Gutman","Thanks, good morning. Tom I wanted to ask you a somewhat of a follow up. You were talking about three to five year plan, so does the margin performance this quarter inform you any differently about the potential for the future margin, you mentioned you understand your issues better and I think this quarter was probably the ultimate test given the strain on the supply chain but is the amount that you can get bigger than what you initially thought, does it take longer because you've identified other issues that came to bear this quarter?","Thomas R. Greco","We believe we can get to that mid teen margin Simeon over time so I mean there's nothing that has changed our perspective. I think we understand it better and we understand the sequencing of it, how quickly we can get there, all of those things are clearer to us now as the management team has got deeper into it. And again I think it's important to note that the construction of this five year plan that we're in the middle of right now, everybody here was intimately involved in it. I think the first time around I've been here very briefly. We constructed it with a team that many of whom are not here anymore. So I think I think everybody's got their fingerprints on this one. We know the key levers and the timing of it. We're not completed with it, we had a draft we shared with our Board over the last couple of weeks. And we will finalize that this fall but absolutely believe we can get to that mid-teens margin over time. ","Bret Jordan","And will the sequencing, the timing of it be shared with the Street and where I am going it sounds like in the back half you're making some investment which sounds like the prudent marketing around Worldpac, etc, so I guess the timing of the sequencing versus how the Street is expecting it probably matters, curious if we learn about that over time?","Thomas R. Greco","Yeah, we expect to finalize the plan by the end of the year and we will provide an update on the timing and the key initiatives once we've got everything done. ","Bret Jordan","Okay, and then my follow up is just on product margin. You talked about inefficiencies in the supply chain and then mix shift just from some of the seasonal products. I forget if you mentioned anything about promotion discounts or the over ride still declining year-over-year? ","Thomas R. Greco","Yeah, no we feel good about the over ride situation, I mean I think that we have had a lot of learnings there and now we're managing that much differently than we had managed it and we look at it every week both on the DIY side and the Pro side, it's pretty small on the DIY side as you know. But there's no major changes there year-on-year. ","Bret Jordan","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt McClintock from Barclays. Your line is open. ","Matthew McClintock","Hi, yes, good morning everyone. Tom I was wondering if I could take a different approach in terms of thinking about timing and sequencing, etc and just say it wasn't that long ago you used to tell us and you used to caution us to remember that it's still very early stages in the broader restructuring of the company, it seems now today with a new shared purpose put in place you're starting to get efficiencies out of the sales team and you actually have cross banner visibility that we might actually be out of the early stages or the early inning of a broader restructuring of the company, clearly not within a larger plan but in the broader restructuring, could you maybe update us on your thoughts of where the company is today in terms of a stable platform for executing a maybe a more traditional five year plan or more importantly I am just trying to get a sense of are we now into more of the fourth inning or the fifth inning of what you thought this company could be when you joined, thanks? ","Thomas R. Greco","Yeah, great question Matt. I think how I would react to that, first of all I would say that I've learned in my time here that there's nothing more important to a successful turnaround than the people and the culture. And we spent a great deal of time in the past two years, how do we strengthen the talents in the organization, we have got a lot of great people who worked here for a long time that need to be developed. We had to go outside and find people that brought new capabilities to Advance whether that be in technology, in supply chain, in digital marketing, in many areas. And we got -- we had to build the bench [ph] that we had because we didn't really have much in the way of bench. So I think that the answer I get is I feel dramatically better than I did two years ago in terms of the people and the culture. Now it's early in that respect. I mean you're still -- we are still making a lot of changes to be clear. I will use the field organization as an example. We restructured the field about a year ago. We put two field leaders in place, we put 12 regional Vice President in place. I think they are now starting to get their stride. It was a it was a pretty dramatic change for that part of the organization. We subsequently paired up the supply chain field organization with that store operations organization. So, now those -- think of those as division business teams are starting to perform as much more of a cohesive unit. I still believe there's an opportunity to tear down the silos that have existed here for a long time. I still believe there's a way for us to move faster and more efficiently. I would say we're certainly out of the very, very early innings. I feel much more confident in our ability to do something when we say we're going to do it now. So, I wouldn't say that everything is perfect by any stretch of the imagination. We have still got a lot to do but we're in a much better position than we were two years ago. So hard to put a number on it but I think we're in a bit of a different phase than we were.","Matthew McClintock","Thanks for that color and if I could have one follow up, just with Reuben coming down from the Board and given that he has maybe a little bit of a different backgrounds from a more traditional retailer, are there any changes in prioritization of your longer-term supply chain initiatives or is the message here that it is just more of the same in executing what's already in place? ","Thomas R. Greco","Yeah, the great thing there Matt is that Reuben has been intimately involved with Leslie in the construction of that supply chain agenda. So he knows exactly what we're doing. He's been very supportive, he has actually been a very active board member. He was a very active board member and very helpful for me over the last couple of years. So he's been deeply involved. He knows the leadership team well. Leslie had built a very strong leadership team in the last few years. That was one thing that we really had as a deliverable for her to really strengthen that supply chain leadership team. Reuben has been involved with that. So, the key initiatives that are within the supply chain are going to continue. I think what Reuben brings is real strong background in the whole omnichannel well in fact he was very involved in the construction of that omnichannel strategy with Walgreen. So we are excited about him coming in. He also brings what I would describe as a general management mindset to the role. So I don't see any major shifts in the direction supply chain. I just think we will be moving faster than we have as he comes in here and starts to work closely with the rest of the leadership team.","Matthew McClintock","Thanks a lot, best of luck. ","Thomas R. Greco","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Greg Melich from Moffett Nathanson. Your line is open. ","Greg Melich","Hi, thanks, I had a couple of questions. One, if you look at the comp time and it's a nice improvement, was traffic actually positive or it sounds like a lot of it was sort of ticket and mix may have been helping and units in the basket?","Thomas R. Greco","I'll split it up again Greg, on the Pro side both were positive, the transactions and average ticket. On DIY we saw a significant improvement in our store traffic. It was not positive but it was a significant improvement in our store traffic and average ticket was up and then partly helped by UPT as I mentioned earlier of course. And then of course our online traffic I mentioned earlier was through the roof.","Greg Melich","So overall traffic was positive and with DIY a lot of the improvement it sounds\u2026? ","Thomas R. Greco","If you put them together.","Greg Melich","Okay, great. And was inflation a significant positive in the quarter? ","Thomas R. Greco","Not a huge factor Greg, under 1%. ","Greg Melich","Got it and then I am surprised we haven\u2019t had the China imports question with tariffs all floating around, what percentage of your comps are directly imported from China or indirectly? ","Thomas R. Greco","I will kick this one over to Mike Broderick, Greg. So, Mike.","Michael Broderick","Greg this is Mike Broderick, good morning. So, from a comp perspective we don't really give out that number but at this point in time everything that we're seeing from tariffs is very manageable. We're working with our suppliers to find best country to provide from. But at this point down we've been able to pass it along into the marketplace. So it's really been not much of an issue at this point in time.","Greg Melich","Thanks a lot, and just one last one, thanks for the five year plan that talk about working on that, if you think about getting to that mid teens margin Tom is more of it supply chain, it sounds like with everything you're describing that the bulk of it would be supply chain or am I missing something?","Thomas R. Greco","There's a couple of components, supply chain is probably is the biggest number on the page. But there are three other variables in there that are opportunities for us that we can go after and we're going after all of them. And it is just a question of sequencing and timing at this point and balancing that with the share growth opportunity that we have, that's how we are thinking about it? ","Greg Melich","That's great, good luck guys. ","Operator","Thank you and our next question comes from Seth Sigman from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. ","Seth Sigman","Great, thank you, good morning. So can you update us on store consolidation, how many you closed in the quarter performance maybe as you have heard the closed doors, just in general did you learn anything new about the opportunity, thank you? ","Thomas R. Greco","Hey, good morning Seth. Yeah, absolutely, really excited about what's happening there. I mean we -- I think we're at 35 on a year-to-date. These guys will get me the number on the quarter 20 -- it was 20 in the quarter. Overall the discipline that we're seeing in closing these stores it's just -- it's hard to express how much different it is than it was. In fact we just went through some materials yesterday on some historical stuff that we had done and the assumptions that we had in there which were quite honestly very optimistic in terms of what we could retain. And we didn't actually retain, this was literally a 2014 document. ","Now we've got very clear deliverables surrounding how much professional business can we retain, how much DIY business can we retain. And then there is the team member piece which is so important. We measure for every one of those 35 store closures what percent of each one of those dimensions are being retained. And there's accountability on the surrounding stores, on the district managers, on the Region Vice President, there is discipline around capturing those sales. So it's not just close the store and hope for the best, there's quite a bit of tracking and follow up on it and we're exceeding our numbers there consistently in terms of what we believe we can retain we're actually retaining more than we thought we could retain. In terms of retaining team members we are retaining the key team members we need to retain. And then obviously there's the outstanding lease obligation which I think were much tougher in the discussions surround that with our landlord. ","So all of those variables going into a store closure we make the decision based on a five year cash flow model and we're exceeding all of those metrics. So, we still have opportunities there. I think all of you guys in the call know that. We've got a lot of stores that are less than one mile apart but we don't blindly close every store that is a mile apart. We have a comprehensive multivariate model that we use to make those decisions and we're going to continue to drive hard at optimizing our footprint. And a minute ago Greg asked about the variables that can help us improve margin, obviously one of them is average sales per store. So as we optimize the footprint we can drive our average sales per store up and that can also help us with that margin gap we have with our competitors.","Seth Sigman","Okay, great, thank you and just my follow up question is around the gross margin and the outlook for the second half of the year, you obviously highlighted a couple of incremental headwinds. You did have some headwinds a year ago including supply chain and also trade income I believe, so can you just remind us on what you're lapping from last year, some of those buckets I mentioned and also where are you guys in terms of the material cost reductions as you start to lap those gains from a year ago as well?","Thomas R. Greco","Yeah, we did have some headwinds on and supply chain a year ago. I think what we are looking at this year is really related to fuel and transportation. I mean I think as we mentioned in our prepared remarks I think everybody has talked about this. We planned around 4%, we're seeing diesel is upwards of 20% right now, our gasoline is about mid-teens. So those are pretty big numbers for us. We also talked about mix set, that's a factor for us because as we have this great warm summer we really like it, some of the categories that surged just carry an absolute lower margin rate. So that's also a factor that we're talking about. So when you put it all together you've got where we think this thing is going to come in and we're going to continue to our best to improve on everything that we're driving at. The material cost piece, we continue to drive hard at that. I think we're up to about 80% of the way through the categories now. As I think we said previously, some of the benefits there don't come right away, they come down the road because you have to be acquire the inventory, you have to put it in your system, then you have to sell the inventory just to get the full benefit of the material cost optimization. But Mike Broderick and his team are doing a really good job working with our suppliers on that journey. And then as we move into the next round of that we are thinking about it more as an enterprise approach because we haven't been doing that in that regard to date. It's been primarily an Advance Carquest initiative and we're broadening that across the enterprise going forward.","Seth Sigman","Thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Ciccarelli from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. ","Scot Ciccarelli","Hi guys, I know it's after 9, so 2 quickies. First, can you specifically quantify what the gross margin headwind was from the cross banner efforts? And then similarly, can you tell us specifically what you experienced on the merchandise margin front? Thanks","Thomas R. Greco","Yeah, I mean we're not breaking out cross banner Scot. It's not an insignificant number though so that's why we did call it out and we do believe we can get those costs out of our system. We just have to optimize those costs and we've got to get all of our supply chain teams together to make sure that we're delivering cross banner product as efficiently as possible. What was your other question, sorry. ","Scot Ciccarelli","On the merchandise margin front, you broke that out for us last quarter, I think it was 82 or 86 basis points?","Jeffrey Shepherd","Yeah, overall we actually did see improvement in the quarter on the merchandise cost. A couple of dynamics there, generally what we would see in the past and we saw last quarter was the MCO savings that we just talked to you about. We continue to see that in the second quarter. Largely we were able to offset a lot of the supply chain headwinds that we've experienced in previous quarters and we were largely able to do that. Unfortunately it was more than offset by the product mix so the combination of the headwind of product mix and supply chain more than offset the savings that we normally see in MCO and that's sort of the dynamic that you see this quarter and which is why we're calling out mix and supply chain on a go forward basis. ","Scot Ciccarelli","So, what that improvement have been if you were just isolated? ","Jeffrey Shepherd","We're not breaking that out but like I said if you were to just take mix in MCO it would have been a tailwind for us. ","Scot Ciccarelli","Got it, okay, thanks guys. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Dan Wewer from Raymond James. Your line is open.","Dan Wewer","Thanks, something besides gross margin. I wanted to ask about the ongoing transformation expenses. Tom I think we are what in the fifth year now of the GPC acquisition and what we rank up almost another $30 million of transformation expenses including $5 million actually in cost of goods sold. I don't think you're running that a year ago, I guess there is a lot wider cost of goods sold item for transformation expenses? And then second, how many more quarters or years of these type of charges should we expect?","Jeffrey Shepherd","Yeah, this is Jeff. If you sort of step back and look at what we're calling transformation, we have had the GPI consolidation cost going after some time. Those are significantly ramping down. I think we are under $1 million for the second quarter and what we're doing now is really shifting towards the more of a transformational enterprise look. So, making sure that we're optimizing all of the assets and some of the more bigger ticket focuses such as infrastructure, IT, supply chain, those bigger investments to really make sure we can optimize the assets that we have in place. Specific to your question on cost of sales it's really a dynamic of the accounting. We had some impairments associated with the two distribution centers that we are closing here in the second through the fourth quarter. And those costs for accounting purposes have been recognized in cost of sales rather than SG&A which is normally where you see those costs. So it is just a function of the accounting. We want to highlight that as one of the impairment that we normally wouldn't have if we weren't closing distribution centers and closing stores. So that's why you see the 5 million up there. In terms of your question of timing, the transformation is going to take some time and as Tom said we're going through the five year strategic business plan refreshed. This is all part of that and it's going to continue to inform us in terms of what are the investments that we're going to have to make. Clearly it is going to go through the balance of the year, we've given a range of $140 million to $180 million. We're comfortable with that range for this year and we're assessing it as part of our strategic business plan for the future. ","Dan Wewer","And then just real quick question on the San Antonio distribution center, this facility closed because it became redundant after you opened the Houston distribution center or are we in the early process of unwinding from 50 distribution centers to maybe 20 someday?","Thomas R. Greco","It's really a function Dan of the end-to-end supply chain work that was done that looked across our entire network of 54 DCs and the decision to open Houston had already been made when we did that. So it was really looking across the 54 and it is really the latter in terms of how you ask the question. We are looking across our whole system, we do not need 54 distribution centers so we are gradually working through those changes and we're doing it in a way that's not disruptive. And I will say that both Gallman Mississippi and San Antonio have been executed flawlessly by our supply chain team. We've been moving the stores from those facilities to other distribution centers and we really like the outcome that we're seeing so far. So it really is part of the broader end-to-end supply chain strategy. ","Dan Wewer","Okay, great, thank you guys. ","Operator","Thank you, our next question comes from Seth Basham from Wedbush Securities. Your line is open. ","Seth Basham","Thanks a lot and good morning. I had some questions around integrator replenishment and last mile delivery test in Raleigh, can you give us an update on how that is progressing and when you might be able to expand those additional market spend, that will helpful?","Thomas R. Greco","Sure, yes, we are excited a bus when we started out and we are obviously trying to look for a way to really strengthen availability across the enterprise and you think about availability broadly in terms of assortment in market connectivity and execution. So there's a lot of work going on with assortment, I'll highlight a couple of things. First of all we talked about cross banner visibility but Mike and his team are also working through a transition to dynamic assortment which enables us to use artificial intelligence and machine learning tools to really assort differently and we are in the early stages of that Seth in terms of how we're using that with a couple of categories. I think by the time we get to the first quarter of 2019 we'll be in a real strong position to strengthen both the quality and breadth of our assortment across the system. So that's part of the solution. ","In terms of end market connectivity that's one of the things we are testing inside the pilot. We're making sure that we're using all of the assets that Advance has inside of our market so that we can get the inventory we need to our customers faster than we had in the past. And then execution is really about the measurement of the key factors, how often are we able to say yes to the customer, what's our order to delivery time using our technology platforms to connect all of those things it is enabling us to really look at the different variables and how they can be improved. So excited about the pilot and we're going to continue to learn from it but we're not -- where we see things that work such as cross banner visibility we're rolling them out right away to make sure that we're driving progress. And most of the key metrics that we measure on availability close rate or to the delivery time we're making progress on just through better execution. So you're going to continue to see us focus on that.","Seth Basham","Got it and so as start of the prior roll out, was some of those initiatives beyond [indiscernible] would first half 2019 be the target? ","Thomas R. Greco","Yeah, I mean we are -- a lot of the things that we are doing we are already doing, right. Again with cross banner visibility we have had success but we rolled it out. The new Advance Professional catalogue, we have rolled out. With Sun's data system, so where we see something that works that's low risk kind of reward we just go with it. Where you're touching things that need to be validated that may have customer impact we're being more thoughtful about it. So it really depends on what specific initiative we have. Dynamic assortment is a good example. We want to make sure that when we roll this and implement it in the stores and transition from the current methodology we used that we're getting a lift from it and the earlier turns are good but we want to continue to make sure that the data is clean. We've got enough data behind it. Any kind of AI tools require six to nine months of that kind of validation. So we're making sure that we're doing it thoughtfully.","Seth Basham","Fair enough and my follow-up question is around the online performance. Where are we in terms of DIY sales online percentage of total DIY sales in terms of the mix. And the key drivers of the improvement there in traffic and maintaining conversion, can you pinpoint them as it primarily related to assortment, promotion, transportation, delivery times or anything else? Thank you.","Thomas R. Greco","Sure, I mean we don\u2019t break out the online component of our DIY sales. I will say that the opportunity there for us is extraordinary both on the ship to home and bio-line [ph] pick up in the store. We see a lot of wide open turf there. I think the work that's been done by Yogi Jashnani and his team has really centered on broadening the assortment so offering more skews to our customers. In increasing the delivery capability I think we're up to about 12 distribution centers now, they're able to ship to home which is a significant increase from where we were and that's going to go continue to go up. So obviously as we get closer to our customers with our distribution centers we are able to get the part there more quickly. So you're reducing the amount of time it takes to get to the customer. I think our engagement platforms have been very, very successful in terms of how we've cleaned up our website it's a much more -- the user experience is much better. I think Yogi would say there's still a lot of work to do, there's still a lot of room for improvement but based on where we were I think the user experience online is significantly better and we can see that in the things that we measure there. We obviously measure visitors but we also measure social media sentiments and like to dislike ratios things like that associated with our website and all of those are going to enter in our direction.","Operator","Thank you and our next question comes from Chris Bottiglieri from Wolfe Research. Your line is open. ","Christopher Bottiglieri","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. First question is on private label mix, I think Tom I think before you arrived the previous team disclosed 47% of COGS, can you give us a sense where that is today and where that mix every time and then is there reason to think that this mix will be different than your international mix?","Thomas R. Greco","Sure, first of all when we look at private label mix or any mix now we look across the enterprise. So, I think what you may have heard was a narrower view of that number. We are in the mid-30s in terms of our private label mix so I guess it is a little bit lower than maybe we had previously communicated. And Mike and his team are doing a lot of work on the category management side, Mike Broderick, and maybe I'll have Mike talk a little bit about how we're thinking about each category. But that in of itself was a big opportunity. What we're doing is really combining that MCO work with market share aspirations, with our pricing, with our assortment. So, Mike do you want to talk to little bit of the category management work you are leading. ","Michael Broderick","Of course, good morning Chris, Mike Broderick. So you're right, we've disclosed in the past I would say that from an AAPCQ we're still at that same number of high 40's, close to 50%. It is about $3.6 billion of our business. But when you look at the true opportunity from a private label just to give an illustration, right now we're in the path of actually rationalizing with Bob and Bob's team from Worldpac, we actually have right now three different private labels which were very much in the midst of really trying to rationalize so we get the best use of our inventory dollars. So that's just a good example of what we're going to do in the future. Obviously we're still a big brand house, we believe in our brands, we believe in our partners who have relevant brands for our professional customers as well as our DIY customers. But of course we actually have to have a private label that's recognized in the marketplace too which is a big opportunity that we're going to be driving for the next couple of years. As most of you know this will take a little bit of time.","Christopher Bottiglieri","Got you, okay. And then just as a follow up on the supply chain, two DCs are consolidating now, can you maybe just give us some element of understanding of the operational and technical process you have to undergo to close the DCs and as you kind of think of this bigger opportunity is there kind a limitation into the cadence of how many DCs you can close or maybe just more broadly if you can give some overlap numbers or how are you thinking about the supply chain holistically will be helpful?","Thomas R. Greco","Sure, I mean it's obviously a big undertaking for us. You have to do it in a way that is not disruptive. And in the case of Gallman, I use Gallman as an example, we had a couple of hundred stores. And you're gradually moving them from that facility to Nashville and Houston respectively. So you're doing that, you don\u2019t just kind of flip a switch. It is over several weeks. So we have a basically a close -- DC closure team that does that, that leads the work itself, and to make sure that they work closely with the merchandising team, the replenishment team, the store operations team to seamlessly move stores from Gallman in that case to Nashville or Houston and do it in a way that's invisible to the customer. And I can tell you that to date that has been the way it's worked. We've been very thoughtful about how we do it and in the case of Gallman we ran into a situation where we saw some -- our field rates were getting below the prior year so we immediately slowed down the stores that were being moved. So you're going to do it in a way that is invisible to the customers as possible and visible to the stores. So it's a very thoughtful process. ","In terms of the overall cadence you're right and there's only so many you can take on in a year. We're not going to flip a switch on this, it is a gradual migration. I've done it in a previous life where you've got a certain segment of the organization that is very focused on that change at one time and change management becomes the bottom act. You can't do it all at once sort of thing. So there is a limit on how many you can do. Obviously we are doing a couple in the front half of this year and I think that's probably how you should probably think about the long-term.","Christopher Bottiglieri","That's helpful, thank you.","Operator","Thank you and our next question comes from Ben Bienvenu from Stephens. Your line is open. ","Ben Bienvenu","Hi, thanks, good morning. I wanted to ask about the labor side of your business, you talked about your ability to retain talent as it relates to store consolidation, I am curious to hear about your ability to retain talent more broadly? And then as it relates to your ability to attract talent, maybe how you're going about doing that, is it communicating the narrative of the turnaround in the organization, is it higher pay to attract talent, maybe just give us a sense of where you stand on that front?","Thomas R. Greco","Sure, in terms of retention we have talked Ben in the past about our frontline organization which is so important to our success. We're only as good as our interaction with a customer in a store right now. So those big four jobs that we have out there in the field, the general managers of our stores, the commercial parts Pros were so important to us on the counter, our district managers and our customer account managers that call on professional garages, those four jobs our turnover has dropped significantly versus where it was two years ago and we are kind of holding at the prior year rates. We would like it to be lower but we are -- well basically our turnover is kind of flat this year year-on-year. It had been going down, down, down and now it is flat. So we feel pretty good about that and we are going to continue to focus on it. We do have a significant stock ownership program that we have for our frontline associates where we've had literally thousands of our front line leaders in those groups that have earned a stock awards at Advance and that certainly helps us retain that talent. ","In terms of attracting I got to tell you we spent a lot of time interviewing here. I mean I don't care what function it is, people are accountable to build bench inside their organization and then strengthen the leadership team that they have and develop the people who worked here for a long time. Both of those are very important to me, we spend a significant amount of time as a leadership team every quarter going through the leadership team and the big roles that drive value in our company. And while we have gaps we fill those gaps. So we've actually been -- this is a great place to attract talent. Raleigh, North Carolina has a terrific talent base, we're in the research triangle. ","I mean depending on what you're talking about I think Sri and Yogi would say the technology talent is robust here at the same time the unemployment rates for technology talents are extremely low across the country so you have to be really be very competitive there. But, I wouldn't say that we're -- our overall approach is focused on compensation. It's a very holistic brand proposition that you have when you come here and there is tremendous upside I think to your point, people can understand that the transformation opportunity here is substantially larger. The growth opportunity is substantially larger here than it is in many companies and that's really what we're anchoring on. We spend a lot of time on our brand proposition if you will to employees and we'll continue to do that. ","Ben Bienvenu","Thanks for the detail, best of luck. ","Operator","Thank you and I am showing no further questions in the queue. I'd now like to turn the conference back over to Tom Greco for any closing remarks.","Thomas R. Greco","Well, once again I'd like to thank all of our team members and independent partners for their dedication each and every day to drive improvement across AAP. And thanks to everybody on the call this morning. We appreciate your support you can count on us to be absolutely relentless in moving the successful transformation of Advance forward and delivering value to our shareholders. I'm very confident in the talented team we have in place, we will fully capitalize on the robust opportunities ahead and we look forward to discussing our continued progress with you on our third quarter call in November.

Before we begin, Elisabeth Eisleben, Senior Vice President, Communications and Investor Relations, will make a brief statement concerning forward-looking statements that will be discussed on this call.","Elisabeth Eisleben","Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss our third quarter 2019 results. I'm joined by Tom Greco, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jeff Shepherd, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Following their prepared remarks, we'll turn our attention to answering your questions.","Before we begin, please be advised that our comments today may include forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. While actual results may differ materially from those projected in such statements due to a number of risks and uncertainties, which are described in the Risk Factors section in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, we maintain no duty to update forward-looking statements made.","Additionally, our comments today include certain non-GAAP financial measures.

The content of this call will be governed by the information contained in our earnings release and related financial statements.","Now let me turn the call over to Tom Greco.","Thomas Greco","Thanks, Elisabeth. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today to discuss our third quarter 2019 results. I'm proud to report another quarter of good progress towards our long-term strategic objectives. This would not be possible without the relentless dedication of our more than 70,000 team members and network of Carquest Independents. I want to take a moment to thank them for their unwavering commitment and passion for the customer.","In the third quarter, net sales increased 1.6% to $2.3 billion, and comparable store sales increased 1.2%. This is now our sixth consecutive quarter of revenue growth. Our two year stack on third quarter comp sales accelerated to 5.8% and was the strongest we've delivered in 8 years. We also expanded margins as our adjusted operating income margin of 8.9% increased 36 basis points compared to the prior year quarter. Our adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 11.1% to $2.10. Jeff will speak more about our financial results shortly.","First, I'll highlight some details around our third quarter performance. Consistent with recent trends, our Professional business was strong in the quarter. We grew in each of our Professional businesses with Worldpac and our Independent business leading the way. In addition to opening 9 Worldpac branches and adding 29 net new Independents over 2019, our dynamic assortment rollout is enabling top line improvements.","As a reminder, dynamic assortment leverages machine learning to better understand customer demand and improve the quality of our assortment. We marry lookups by location with several other variables, and we expect this will drive increased turns and profitability of our industry-leading assortment of national brands, OE products and own brand private label.","Dynamic assortment, together with Advance Pro and cross-banner visibility, enabled us to improve stock and close rates in the quarter in those categories that have been deployed. We expect to complete the deployment of our top 25 back-room categories by year-end.","Separately, we've implemented multiple enhancements to our online My ADVANCED platform, including integrated promotions and connected customer service. This includes continuing improvements to Advance Pro, our catalog for Pro customers within My ADVANCE, which now has customized versions for strategic accounts. In fact, we saw double-digit increases in My ADVANCE user sessions in the third quarter. While still early in implementation, the initiatives we've launched over the past several quarters are resulting in continued improvement in our ability to say yes to Professional customers.","Moving to DIY omni-channel. We continue to deliver impressive sales growth in e-commerce, with strong double-digit growth once again in Q3. We continue to see substantial increases in website traffic, along with steady progress in conversion rates. We know speed and convenience are critical to the omni-channel customer, and remain committed to delivering a frictionless experience.","In Q3, we improved the customer experience for buy online, pick up in store. This included enhancements in the mobile experience, such as improved order status via text messaging. We also rolled out a standardized area for order pickup in stores, close to the front door for easy access and convenience. As part of our DIY omni-channel strategy, we also made progress with our walmart.com partnership.","In Q3, we continued to build our assortment and are on track to enable additional customer fulfillment options. Since the launch of our Partnership, traffic, units and sales have accelerated each month. Notably, the majority of customers who have ordered through the walmart.com site are new to ADVANCE. Our DIY retail business remains a work in progress. In Q3, we saw pressure in transactions, which were negative in the quarter, although improved versus Q2.","In Q3, we rolled out our new Speed Perks 2.0 loyalty program following successful pilots in 2 lead markets during the first half of 2019. Speed Perks 2.0 is an important platform to help us improve DIY performance, both short and long term. Our goal here is to improve customer loyalty and share of wallet by leveraging first-party data to personalize our offerings.","Prior to launch, Speed Perks transactions were approximately 25% of total DIY transactions. This is low versus loyalty programs across broader retail. In the third quarter, we began to address this by providing new and improved benefits for our DIY customers.","In addition, Speed Perks 2.0 includes technology enhancements for our team members to see Speed Perks member status at the point of sale. Our team did an outstanding job launching the program, delivering an 80% increase in new member sign-ups, 45% growth in the number of Speed Perks transactions and improved UPT performance versus year-to-date trends. These are all important elements to the long-term success of our loyalty program.","In total, our Q3 launch resulted in sequential improvements in DIY transactions and unit sales in Q3. As part of our investment in this new program, we also saw a significant increase in reward redemptions during the quarter. While this was expected given our test market experience, the investment in our new loyalty program resulted in incremental coupon redemptions in Q3 and exceeded the lead markets. The incremental investment year-over-year was approximately $14 million in the quarter, impacting both net sales and gross margin. We expect this to abate over the next few quarters and believe this is a good investment to delight existing customers and attract new customers. I'm confident that as we sign up more Speed Perks members and increase Speed Perks transactions as a percentage of sales, we will leverage this first-party data to drive sales and share of wallet.","While this was expected given our test market experience, the redemptions during our national rollout exceeded those of the lead markets and resulted in a coupon redemption headwind in the quarter, impacting both net sales and gross margin. We expect this to abate over the next few quarters and believe this is a good investment to delight existing customers and attract new customers. I'm confident that as we sign up more Speed Perks members and increase Speed Perks transactions as a percentage of sales, we'll leverage this first-party data to drive sales and share of wallet.","To summarize our top line results by channel, Professional and e-commerce continued to perform well. And while DIY retail improved sequentially, we're not satisfied at all with our results here and remain focused on addressing traffic, loyalty and overall performance as rapidly as possible.","All channels accelerated on a two year stack basis and at a category level, we saw the strongest growth in brakes and batteries with high single-digit growth, while delivering sequential improvement in cooling, optics and engine management. From a geographic perspective, we saw the strongest growth in our Midwest, West Coast and Appalachia regions.","In addition to making important improvements in the customer experience, we continued our footprint optimization efforts in Q3 to drive profitability and cash flow as we closed or consolidated an additional 23 stores, bringing the total number to 82 stores year-to-date. We've made meaningful progress over the past 18 months to fix and\/or close underperforming stores and will continue to be very disciplined in optimizing our store footprint in a market-by-market approach. All of our top line initiatives are focused on driving sales and profit per store, which is the first of 4 pillars in our margin expansion plans.","In the quarter, we completed the rollout of MyDay, enabling us to get to a single labor management system. This unified and improved system will help us staff our stores more efficiently to meet customer demand. In Q3, we also made great strides in our second margin expansion territory, supply chain. For the first time in 8 quarters, we leveraged supply chain expenses as a percentage of net sales in Q3. We accomplished this while absorbing incremental costs attributable to the work stoppage in Cookstown. While we clearly did not plan for or want the work stoppage, ensuring our long-term supply chain cost structure is competitive throughout our entire network was a critical objective in our negotiations in Cookstown. We're pleased we came to an amicable resolution, which enables us.","Separately, the consolidation and integration of our multiple supply chains is well underway. In terms of Advance and Carquest, we're now in execution mode of cross-banner replenishment as we transition stores to the most freight logical distribution center in a disciplined market-by-market approach. Substantial savings are expected here as we reduce stem miles and further optimize our Advance and Carquest DC network with a completion date of mid-2021.","In addition, the integration of Worldpac and AutoPart International is also now underway. Here, we expect additional savings and growth-related benefits to be fully captured by the end of 2020.","Finally, Reuben Slone and his team are laser-focused on improving operations across our supply chain. Execution is improving as we standardize processes, reduce turnover and improve fill rates. As we build the performance culture throughout supply chain, we expect efficiency gains to drive cost savings.","Moving on to our third pillar of margin expansion, we remain disciplined in our material cost optimization and category management efforts. Despite material cost headwinds this year from inflationary costs, we continue to work diligently with our supplier partners to mitigate increases and our pricing to cover inflation in a rational environment.","We remain focused on increasing SKU count, including expanding our offerings for late-model vehicle coverage. Additionally, we're making great progress on improving Carquest private label offerings and increasing private label as a share of our mix. I'm confident these efforts will enable top line growth on our well-respected Carquest private label brand as well as meaningful margin improvement over the next several years.","The fourth pillar of our margin expansion strategy includes SG&A productivity. Jeff will expand on other cost savings we saw within SG&A in the quarter shortly. However, I want to highlight our performance on team member safety and the benefit this is delivering across our business. Our team has been incredibly disciplined in creating a safety first culture, including building awareness through education and training programs to ensure our team members are empowered to do their job without incidents and return home safely each and every day. The detailed focus of this team is benefiting all areas of Advance, including significant improvements in our accident and incident rates. Our emphasis on safety has reduced our total year-to-date recordable injury rate by 11% and our lost time rate improved by 14% this quarter.","Importantly, our vehicle collision rate has improved by 19% year-to-date surpassing our target for the year. More broadly, I'm very proud of the progress we've made in building a performance culture at Advance this year and confident we're creating an environment where team members can excel. We're improving our competitiveness every day with a stronger, more experienced leadership team and through innovative offerings such as our Fuel the Frontline program, which rewards top-performing frontline team members with Advance stock. We've also made important wage investments in our supply chain, which has dramatically reduced turnover to ensure we are as effective and efficient as possible within supply chain. The investments we're making in our team members, inclusive of ongoing training and development, is evidenced by the continued improvement in our overall annualized average turnover, which declined by 14% in Q3 compared to year-end 2018.","I'm pleased with the progress we've made to date and look forward to sharing more details about our ESG focus as well as our people-first culture when we publish our second annual corporate sustainability and social report in 2020. ","With that, I'll turn it over to Jeff for details on our financial performance.","Jeffrey Shepherd","Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. In the third quarter, our adjusted gross profit was $1 billion, an increase of nearly 1% from the prior year quarter. On a rate basis, our adjusted gross profit margin of 43.9% declined by 39 basis points from the prior year quarter, primarily driven by the increase in the investment in our loyalty program and the incremental costs related to the work stoppage in Cookstown. Despite the work stoppage, we were very pleased with our ability to leverage supply chain in the quarter.","As Tom also mentioned, our investment in Speed Perks 2.0 negatively impacted gross margins in Q3. We remain confident this new program will significantly increase customer loyalty. We expect this investment will normalize over the next few quarters. Our adjusted SG&A performance was very strong at $810 million in the third quarter as compared to $814 million a year ago. On a rate basis, our adjusted SG&A as a percent of net sales was 35%, an improvement of 74 basis points compared to the prior year quarter. This was a direct result of our focus on cost controls and driven by improvements in occupancy, labor-related costs and a reduction in insurance claims from continued progress in team member safety. These excellent results more than offset important long-term investments in information technology. As we consistently communicated, we expect information technology costs will remain elevated through the balance of the year and into 2020, as we work to build new digital capabilities and fully integrate multiple technology platforms across the enterprise.","Adjusted operating income in Q3 was $205.1 million, a 5.9% increase from Q3 2018. Our adjusted OI margin rate increased 36 basis points to 8.9% in the quarter. Adjusted diluted EPS for Q3 was $2.10, an increase of 11.1%. During the third quarter, we continue to be extremely disciplined in managing our cash. This is clearly illustrated as we improved our AP ratio to 77.5%, which is an increase of nearly 530 basis points compared to the prior year quarter.","Our AP ratio has now improved 840 basis points since the first quarter of 2017. We remain laser-focused on working capital management and are confident in our ability to continue generating meaningful cash growth to drive shareholder value. Our free cash flow for the third quarter was $539 million compared to $576 million in the third quarter of 2018. The year-over-year decrease of free cash flow was primarily a result of increased capital investments to drive sustainable sales growth and continued margin expansion going forward.","Year-to-date, we increased our capital spending by 61% to $169 million. We continue to make investments in our stores, warehouse system consolidations and other information technology initiatives, such as our finance ERP system as part of our business transformation. Our leverage ratio was 2.0, which is in line with our capital allocation priorities of maintaining an investment-grade rating, reinvesting in the business and returning excess cash back to shareholders. During the third quarter, we returned nearly $340 million to our shareholders through the repurchase of 2.4 million shares of Advance stock.","In addition, I'm pleased to announce an additional $700 million share repurchase authorization. This new authorization is further evidence of the confidence we have in delivering on our sales and margin objectives as well as our ability to generate significant free cash flow and drive shareholder value. Consistent with our commitment to provide transparency with our transformation plans and expectations for this year, I want to take a moment to provide an update to our outlook for the balance of the year.","We remain confident in our ability to deliver results within the full year guidance we provided earlier this year and updated last quarter. We also recognize that the top end of our comparable store sales may now be challenging to achieve as a result of the continued investment in our loyalty program with higher-than-anticipated coupon redemptions impacting net sales and gross margin in the fourth quarter. Therefore, we believe it's prudent to narrow the top end of our sales guidance, while maintaining the bottom of our current comp sales range. Our updated guidance includes net sales in the range of $9.65 billion to $9.75 billion. Comparable store sales range of 1% to 1.5%. Our adjusted OI margin guidance is unchanged with an adjusted OI margin expansion of 20 to 40 basis points for the year. Similarly, we're confident that with the continued strength of our working capital efforts that we can deliver our free cash flow guidance of a minimum of $700 million, which we increased in the second quarter. I'm proud of what we've accomplished through the first 3 quarters and our entire team is focused on additional progress in the fourth quarter.","With that, let's open it up to addressing your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Michael Lasser with UBS.","Michael Lasser","Tom, in your prepared remarks, you referred to some of the pillars of your long-term plan. But how do you respond to those who say, now you've had 2 consecutive quarters of gross margin degradation and you've made a lot of progress over the last few years in harvesting cost savings, so how realistic is it that you will get to a low to mid-teens operating margin over the long run, as you've outlined previously?","Thomas Greco","Well, first of all, I think the gross margin, just to give you some background on that, Michael, it's important to explain this. We had a couple of atypical elements in the gross margin in the quarter. The biggest factor within gross margin was our investments in our loyalty program. The coupon redemptions in the quarter were up $14 million versus a year ago, which is what we outlined in our prepared remarks. We knew this was going to be higher in the quarter as we planned investment behind Speed Perks 2.0, but the sign-ups and the transactions as a percentage of our total transaction significantly exceeded that of our lead market. So the coupon redemptions were more than we expected.","Over the long term, this is a very good thing. We're absolutely committed to winning in DIY omni-channel, and we haven't meaningfully invested in our loyalty program prior to Q3. The customer and team members response to Speed Perks 2.0 has been fantastic, and it positions us well for the long term. We're going to leverage the first-party data we get from Speed Perks to personalize our offerings and we expect the incremental investment on Speed Perks to subside over the next few quarters as the incremental grow. So that was a very big factor in gross margin in the quarter.","And secondly, we incurred onetime incremental costs within supply chain related to the work stoppage in Cookstown. So we don't think this -- what happened in the quarter is something that is going to have any impact on our ability to achieve our long-term margin goals, both within gross margin and in SG&A. We did -- we had a couple of atypical elements in the quarter on gross margin.","Michael Lasser","And did the launch of Speed Perks 2.0 drive incremental sales in the quarter, and this is important because the comp spread versus those others in the industry is back to widening? And shouldn't we take that as a signal that some of your efforts to close the performance gap are now slipping? And would you attribute all of that to Speed Perks 2.0?","Thomas Greco","Well, we certainly benefited from Speed Perks in the quarter, but it's difficult to say how much. With the number of increased sign-ups we had, obviously, the purchase frequency in our category is much lower than typical categories, so we'll see that over time. We also had a higher percentage of our transactions, much higher than we've seen historically and even in the lead markets. So that's going to benefit us over time because we use the data to personalize. The overall $14 million, if you do the math, that's about a 60 basis point headwind off of POS sales, right, from our total number. So that's the value of the coupon, clearly, somewhere between 0 and 60 we benefited from Speed Perks. But in the quarter, the cost of the coupons outweighed the benefit of Speed Perks.","Michael Lasser","Okay. Just to clarify that so can you help us understand how it was a net positive if you're saying $14 million hit to sales, but it drove incremental comp or incremental sales?","Thomas Greco","Yes. It's difficult to quantify the incremental sales at this point. What we've modeled is that over time the incremental revenue associated with Speed Perks is going to be significant. You're essentially increasing your member base. We started at 11 million. We added a significant number of new members in the quarter, and we had a net increase in our membership base in the quarter. We're going to increase the percentage of transactions. So we're talking about a substantial improvement in our DIY sales over time. In the short term, what you can't really measure, Michael, is how many of existing customers that were already coming in the store are now transacting as Speed Perks customers, and it's very difficult for us to break that out. But we know the value of the program in terms of the impact it has on the P&L. And over time, this is a meaningful benefit for us. We're very excited about it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley.","Simeon Gutman","My first question is for Q4. You provided a fairly wide range of comp, I think, 0 to 1.5 or 1.6, depending on the math. Can you give us a sense, I mean, there's only 6 weeks left, where we're headed so far? And then it looks like if we hold the SG&A rate from the third quarter, which may or may not be the right assumption, that gross margin could be up a decent amount in the fourth quarter, 20, 30 basis points. Can you comment on those 2 points?","Thomas Greco","Sure, Simeon. I'll let Jeff handle the second question. On the sales guide, yes, I mean, we're essentially guiding in line with what we expect. Obviously, the last 6 weeks of the year can be very volatile. But we like what we see so far, and we're well positioned to deliver it within the sales guide. As we said, we will have continued coupon redemptions in the fourth quarter. The reason is we've got a number of coupons from the original program that are still unredeemed. So once the end of the year comes into play, those are no longer available, and we'll only be dealing with the coupons from Speed Perks 2.0, so that's essentially the reason. And I'll let Jeff answer your second question.","Jeffrey Shepherd","Yes. And just to build on the gross margin, we're going to continue to see the coupon headwinds that Tom talked about. The original Speed Perks program, those coupons have a 6-month life. So those are going to roll off basically in the fourth quarter, a little bit of bleed into the first quarter, but not much. But we're still modeling those headwinds as well as the headwinds associated with commodity and tariffs. Right now, we don't see any change in the tariffs into the fourth quarter. So we still think we're going to have those headwinds. Having said that, everything we're seeing right now in SG&A is still positive, we've got excellent control in place to control our costs, consistent with what we did here in the third quarter, and we fully anticipate we'll be able to do that into the fourth quarter.","Simeon Gutman","So just to clarify that point, it sounds like there's still going to be headwinds to gross margin, but it's SG&A that if -- that will provide the leverage to the margin in the fourth quarter?","Thomas Greco","Yes. Yes, that's right, Simeon. And just to make it really clear, I mean, Speed Perks hurt same-store sales because coupons go against net sales, right? And in the quarter -- in the third quarter, that was a 60 basis point impact on same-store sales. So we might have gotten a few more transactions, but it hurts net sales on a net basis in the short term. Over time, when people return more frequently, we benefit from Speed Perks. But in the short term, it's a net sales headwind.","Simeon Gutman","Got it. Okay. And then my follow-up question, the supply chain transformation. You mentioned it briefly in the prepared remarks, Tom, can you talk about where you're in it? What you've accomplished so far? What are the tasks that are going to get done next? And then can you assess any execution risk in some of the next steps, please?","Thomas Greco","Yes. Really exciting progress on supply chain, Simeon. I think Reuben is really getting some momentum there. We've obviously -- it's begun to execute the cross-banner replenishment initiative, which is a significant productivity driver for us. It allows us to reduce stem miles to the stores and to optimize our DC network. So that's well underway. We've had the pilots in the respective red and blue networks, and we're now beginning to move stores to the relevant DC that we've got a number of those planned for the balance of this year. There'll be hundreds of them executed next year and into the front half of 2021, and we'll finish it at that point. Just in terms of raw execution, we are seeing very good progress there across all the key metrics. We are also beginning our work on a standardization of our warehouse management system that Reuben is leading. That will allow us to improve our labor management in the distribution centers.","Finally, we've begun to integrate the Worldpac and AI organizations and supply chains, including the AAI stores. So that will help us over time. So very confident in our ability to deliver the supply chain productivity that we've discussed. And we're beginning to see the benefits of it. As I said in the prepared remarks, we actually leveraged supply chain in the quarter in spite of a pretty significant cost associated with the Cookstown work stoppage.","Simeon Gutman","And just to clarify, one more follow-up on that, Tom, is we keep talking about the benefits of these initiatives won't be done until, I think, the middle of 2021. But does that mean the benefits from some of these initiatives don't show up until 2021? Or they start to show up now and rolling into next year?","Thomas Greco","Yes. We'll start to see some -- on the supply chain, we'll start to see benefits next year as we execute the DC store changes that I mentioned. In terms of the full benefits of the cross banner, the full benefit of the warehouse management system implementation, it starts to come later, but we will see benefit from supply chain next year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Seth Sigman with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Seth Sigman","Just first on the Pro business, I think you categorized it as strong in the quarter. Can you just discuss how it performed relative to the second quarter? Did it actually accelerate? And then, I think you highlighted Worldpac and Independents as the strongest channels within, what's working there and maybe different than what you're seeing at core AAP and Carquest?","Thomas Greco","First of all, Seth, our Pro business did accelerate versus the second quarter. We had a terrific two year stack, the best we've ever seen on our Pro business, by the way, on the AAP business as well, not just the other businesses. I think that what's working well broadly inside of the Pro, is Bob bringing together all of the key elements of our Pro offering everything from the catalog, which we obviously call Advance Pro. We're getting increased usage on the catalog. People are seeing the merits of our assortment. We're executing its dynamic assortment across the enterprise, which is enabling us to improve our stock rate and close rate on key items in the back room. Cross-banner is benefiting us -- continued benefits from cross banner. So we're able to source from the various entities at higher levels than we used to in the past. So we're very happy with where our Pro business is when we look at the reported results to date. We feel good. We feel like we're performing at or above the market. And our Independent business, there, we're able to present some of the things that Bob is pulling together for the broader corporate entity here and present them with potentially new Independents who want to fly the Carquest flag, and the net benefit there we're starting to see as well. So strong conversions in the quarter on the Independent side, but also good comp sales for our Independents -- existing Independents, which is very important.","Worldpac is just a terrific business. They've got a great model. Their online platform is best-in-class. Bob has built that over many years with a terrific team out there at Worldpac. We've opened more branches this year than we've ever opened before. They're driving top line growth. They're expanding margins. They're focused on being very complementary to the broader enterprise. So there's a lot of things that are working well with Worldpac that we're taking and bringing to the broader enterprise. So I'd say, generally speaking, those are the things that are helping us on the Pro side.","Seth Sigman","Okay. That's helpful. So given some of the positive changes happening in the store, presumably that should be helping DIY also. What do you view as the fundamental challenge facing the DIY business? Obviously, online is growing for you. But just, I guess, store-level DIY, some of the challenges that you may be facing there?","Thomas Greco","Yes. I think, first of all, we did improve our transactions and unit performance in the quarter on DIY, the net sales number, as we said. Obviously, the coupons are entirely attributable to the DIY business, way down the net sales number in DIY in the short term, as we said. But I think Jason McDonell is coming in. He's our new CMO. We couldn't be more excited about having Jason here. He is focused on traffic, job one, improving our traffic inside the DIY business. He's done a lot of work in the short time that he's been here. I feel very good about the plans that are coming together for 2020. We've done a lot of work on the customer journey to develop integrated programming. I think that was an opportunity set, to your point, to make sure that the marketing that we're spending is very well integrated with the merchandising plans and the in-store execution. Speed Perks 2.0 will be a driver of top line growth next year. As we start to bring more people into Speed Perks and we start to get a higher share of transactions, we're able to personalize our offering. And we know there's a big share of wallet opportunity there.","Third, the media plans, big opportunity there. Again, Jason is working that very hard right now. We're going to shift nonworking dollars that we were spending in marketing to working, and that will drive awareness, which we made progress on last year, but we kind of stalled that 32%, and now we need to take that up because we're significantly behind the industry leader on that one.","And finally, the partnership that's developing with Walmart will start to be a factor, as we get into 2020. So there's a lot of things that are happening right now in DIY that we feel really good about as we head into next year, and it will give us what we need on the other side of the box, if you will, as Bob continues to drive the Pro business.","Operator","Our next question comes from Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan.","Christopher Horvers","So first, a couple of follow-ups. On the comp guide, what specifically is implied comp guide 4Q because if you held the 2-year stack, it would imply a bigger number than the range that was asked in the prior question? And then could you quantify how much Cookstown actually impacted gross margin?","Thomas Greco","Yes. We're not going to Cookstown, Chris. I'll just say that, obviously, it's important that we have a very, very competitive cost structure in our supply chain. So we had to do what we had to do in Cookstown, and we accomplished it. And we feel really good about where we ended up there, but we're not going to break that out. In terms of...","Christopher Horvers","Is that sustained.","Thomas Greco","No.","Christopher Horvers","Is the Cookstown sustained? No, okay.","Thomas Greco","No, no. It's -- obviously, we've had a several week work stoppage, right? So you've got all the costs associated with that, that are built up in there, and we knew we were going to have those costs in the quarter, and they ended up being where they ended up being. So in terms of the stacks, we're obviously going to continue to drive as high as a 2-year stack as we can. The big factor is the coupons, which we've talked about several times. If you also look at the 3-year stack, you'll see it more in line with the third quarter, so that's essentially where we ended up. But I think the thing to call out is the net sales, the coupon impact on net sales in the fourth quarter. Based on the lower sales number and the redemptions, it's probably going to be kind of a similar number and which is as a percentage higher.","Christopher Horvers","Got it. So just a -- so you're really looking at the 3-year, and that's what was the sort of guiding light for the fourth quarter comp guide?","Thomas Greco","That's right. That's right. I mean, we've seen -- as you know, we've seen continued improvement on that three year stack. So we're kind of focusing on that to factor out the back half of '17, which we all know was a difficult time for us.","Christopher Horvers","Got it. And then another on that -- on the DIY. Did that also accelerate despite the coupon headwind, which is about 120 basis point headwind to the comp in the third quarter on the DIY front?","Thomas Greco","Yes. It absolutely accelerated on POS sales, yes. And that's why the transactions improved, the units improved. In fact, our unit share, Chris, when we look at our relative performance on unit share through syndicated data also improved by about that similar, the relative growth improved by about 150 bps. So on a same-store basis in the most recent period, we actually held share on units, which I feel great about, and we haven't done that in a long time. So selling more units, getting more people signed up to Speed Perks, highest percentage of transactions, over time, this is going to be a good thing.","Christopher Horvers","Got it. Lastly, and then can you talk about -- Jeff, can you talk about how much LIFO was a headwind in the quarter. It was about 70 basis points in the second quarter. Do you -- was that -- where did you end up in Q3? And how are you thinking about LIFO into fourth quarter? And then into next year, really, as -- how does that play out over the year, assuming the price environment stays as it is?","Jeffrey Shepherd","Yes. So for the third quarter, LIFO was an impact of $34 million. You'll see that and we published our 10-Q later on today. Those were 100% offset by, what we call, some of the inventory-related costs, warehouse cost capitalization. We saw improvement there along with store and DC cost changes. So the net impact of that was 0. Obviously, the $34 million was a headwind in the third quarter on a stand-alone basis. The fourth quarter, I would expect to see a similar level, just given the fact that we're still in this higher rising cost environment. So I would anticipate that into the fourth quarter. And I do think in the fourth quarter, it's going to be more of a headwind, especially on a year-over-year basis. If you remember last year, we purchased a bunch of inventory as a result of dynamic assortment and some early buying related to the spring selling season that gave us a little bit of a headwind -- or a tailwind, and we're not going to see that again this year or this quarter for sure. So on a year-over-year basis, it's certainly going to be a headwind.","Going into 2020, if we get cost stabilization, I would expect to see a similar level of impact. As long as we continue to stabilize, we can drive down that inventory. Obviously, we'll pick up that headwind, but we're still working through our plan for 2020. We'll have a lot more detail when we talk to you next quarter.","Christopher Horvers","And so when you see similar levels, is that similar dollars so the rate impact moderates? Are you saying the rate impact should be the same over the year?","Jeffrey Shepherd","Similar dollars in terms of what we're seeing in the third and fourth quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matt McClintock with Raymond James.","Matthew McClintock","Tom, you mentioned that you expect Walmart to be -- the Walmart partnership to be material next year or I don't know if you used these words, but I assume that's what you meant. Could you maybe talk a little bit about how you've improved the customer experience now that you've launched there the improvements that you have been trying to make there? And then, how far away are we before buy online, pick up in store options are available through that partnership?","Thomas Greco","Sure. Yes. Just to clarify, I don't think I used the word material. We definitely feel that it can be helpful next year. It's definitely going to be material over time. I think the big things that we've done so far is on the engagement front. We've obviously stood up the website. There's significant branding on the website for us that the Walmart team has been terrific in helping us enable, and we began to work the fitment work with them to make sure that the experience the customer has when they're buying a specific product is world-class. And I know the Walmart team is very committed to that outcome. We don't want to start adding parts and jobs when the experience for the customer isn't world-class. So that's what we're working on with them right now. We've made a lot of progress. We're adding SKUs all the time as they build fitment capability in the various categories. We're very excited about getting in-store pickup, stood up. We haven't got a firm date on that at this point, but we're shooting for the first quarter of 2020. That's the goal.","Matthew McClintock","And then kind of as a follow-up, can you maybe discuss the engagement levels that you've seen with your current improvements on the buy online, pick up in store experience?","Thomas Greco","Yes. Definitely seeing great progress there. I mean, we're getting excellent growth on in-store pickup. We're now paying the customer right away as soon as they send us their order. We're letting them know the order is ready. The team is executing extremely well and making sure that the product is ready for them when they come in the door. So we're beginning to see that. And we've had, obviously, a cold snap here in parts of the country. We can see it. We can see the benefit of the in-store pickup starting to have an impact on our overall sales because of that and increasing as a percentage of our sales. So we're very excited about the opportunity there. I know Jason is also thinking through how to engage consumers and build awareness on that capability because it's -- you can get it very quickly, and we want to make sure people know that not only can you pick them up quickly at Advance, but we'll install your battery for you, we'll install your wiper blades, we can do other things when you're there. So excited about the new capability we're building there.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gregory Melich with Evercore ISI.","Gregory Melich","I had a couple of questions. First, on the top line. Tom, you'd mentioned on the cross-banner initiatives in categories that have been converted to have Advance Pro and the cross-banner items. You've seen a nice improvement. How many of the top 25 categories have been converted already?","Thomas Greco","First of all, what we've done is we've rolled out the top 25 into stores. So it's really a case of how many stores have received it, right? So when we do it, we put all 25 categories, and we do a -- basically do a changeover in the store that we've done the top 25. So we're pretty much through all of the chain. I think we got to all of the so-called red stores by the end of the year. The blue stores come in the first quarter next year. But the top 25 will be rolled out completely by the first quarter. And I think what we said in prepared remarks is that if you take the store and product combinations, it's about 11% of the back-room sales. So that gives you a sense for it. And we're just going to continue to use this. And we're seeing a couple of points, about 2 points of growth associated with it because the items that we're adding, obviously, are contributing a lot more than the items that we're deleting.","Gregory Melich","So is it -- just to be simple on that, does that mean that if it's 11%, you're gaining 2 points of growth, so that means 20% lift in the stores when you do this in that category?","Thomas Greco","We are seeing big lifts in the categories we're doing -- we're using. Yes, that's correct. 2 points, no wait a minute. No, 2 points in the category.","Gregory Melich","Two points in the category. I just want to make sure I didn't get that goofed up. Okay, understand. And then second, inflation, I know a lot of ebbs and flows here. We hear different things from different people, anything from 150 bps to 300 bps. What is your perspective now on the amount of the pass-through of the tariffs and other cost input inflation that you've seen?","Thomas Greco","Yes. We look at cost per unit, Greg, that's the best way to measure it because when you see average ticket price in Pro, there's a whole bunch of other factors that come into play, but it's 2.5% to 3% on a per unit basis is what we're seeing.","Gregory Melich","Got it. And then last -- and Jeff, maybe more on the free cash flow side. When you guys are using the $700 million plus, how much of that is from the working capital improvements? And how much of it would be from everything else? I mean, my rough math gets to sort of $750 million, then take off CapEx of $270 million, and you get around $500 million, $550 million of free cash flow before working capital gains. Is that right?","Jeffrey Shepherd","Yes, that's right. Most of it is going to come from our working capital initiatives. If you look at what we've done, most specifically in the area of payables, we've increased that substantially. Our AP ratio is at an all-time high at 77.5%, and we think that's going to continue to improve. So the working capital, as we increase our inventory turns, that will help us as well, but we really think we're going to get the vast majority of that improvement through the working capital that we're going to -- that we're not only doing, but it's going to continue to manifest itself through the fourth quarter and into 2020. So yes, that's exactly the way to think about it.","Gregory Melich","And then lastly, on that point of the buyback a lot in this quarter, it looks like you're sort of opportunistic. How should we think about that now that you're down the 2x leverage, I guess, if you include leases, maybe 2.5, but how do you think of that going forward? Does this all the free cash flow come back as buyback? Or would you ever take a look at the dividend again?","Jeffrey Shepherd","Yes. I mean, dividend is something that we've talked about quite a bit. We do have the $700 million additional, so that gives us a lot of flexibility. We're still in the transformation. We still have our same investment priorities. We want to continue to invest back in the business. This year was a heavy investment year. Next year is going to continue to be a heavy investment year. Having said that, though, we want to continue to be opportunistic and the $700 million gives us that flexibility to be opportunistic as we were here in the third quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from Daniel Imbro with Stephens Inc.","Daniel Imbro","I wanted to start on the supply chain. You guys mentioned the work stoppage, that lasted about two weeks. But as you guys progress on your supply chain rationalization from here, Tom, you mentioned those costs shouldn't continue. But in your updated long-term plan, do you think that those kind of negotiations could lead to other higher-wage pressures in your supply chain? Or how are you guys thinking about the impact into your other distribution centers from that work stoppage you had?","Thomas Greco","Yes. Good question, Daniel. I mean, obviously, that's the point. We only have 5 union facilities out of our 50-odd DCs and that's why it was important in this case to make sure that the cost structure there was competitive, so that there's no essentially sphere of influence for our nonunion sites. So we were able to accomplish that, and we feel very confident in our -- first of all, we made an investment this year, as you know, in the DC wages proactively, nothing to do with what happened in Cookstown to make sure that we reduce turn over, and Reuben's done a great job there. We've dropped our turnover basically in half in the DCs, and that's why we're getting much better execution in the DCs. We're not turning as many people. So for sure, the glide path on supply chain is very clear. The productivity agenda has been laid out, and we're executing against it. And it obviously contemplates the relevant wage increases that we need to do over time in order to be competitive. So no change there really.","Daniel Imbro","Got it. A quick follow-up to that, I guess, you mentioned turnover coming down significantly. Do you think the issue that led to the work stoppage and the eventual kind of negotiations were facility specific? Or are these pushbacks you're getting from employees and other facilities as you push more product and rationalize the supply chain?","Thomas Greco","No, very much facility specific, unfortunately, in that case. And we're committed to rebuilding the team in Cookstown. It's a great group of people. I know our leadership team has spent a lot of time with them. This was a long-standing situation that's been going on literally for years. And we owe it to our people to really do a better job of engaging with them directly, and that's the plan from here, but it's very much facility specific.","Daniel Imbro","Got it. And then last one for me, just on working capital. I think this is the fourth quarter of actual inventory dollar growth on the balance sheet as a result of dynamic assortment. As we lap over that in the fourth quarter from last year, should we begin to see inventory levels resume, they're going to trickle down as you guys work that out? Or should inventory continue to grow as you invest in parts availability?","Jeffrey Shepherd","No, I think we're going to start to see that to stabilize and then work itself down. I think -- in fact, in the fourth quarter, I think we're going to see inventory come down from where they're at today. It'd probably be in line with what we saw at the end of last year. And then as we have the dynamic assortment stabilize, we'll continue to trickle that down going into 2020.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Bottiglieri with Wolfe Research.","Christopher Bottiglieri","So I wanted to dig in like -- congrats on improving market share data on the DIY side. I was wondering if you held your market share in Q3 equal to Q2, what would that impact of comps have been? Like how much of the market share in DIY help your comps this quarter?","Thomas Greco","Yes, I think the change would be the relevant number, I think, there, Chris, would be about 30 bps, something like that, the improvements. So I think it's -- NPD doesn't capture everything. So to be clear, I'm just giving you the NPD number, but it's 29 categories. It's not everything in the front room, but it's a good proxy, that's the number.","Christopher Bottiglieri","Got you. Okay. That's helpful. And then, obviously, there's a lot of innovation. You're making a lot of changes. But would you -- what would you attribute that improvement in market share from? Was it Speed Perks? Was it kind of like Walmart? Was it just everything else you're doing online? Just kind of get your thoughts there.","Thomas Greco","Well, we, for sure, believe that Speed Perks contributed to improve transactions in the quarter. I mean, we saw the 150 change. Now some of that was industry related in terms of the improvement in transactions. But for sure, Speed Perks had some contribution. I think the in-store pickup was well executed. Our team is very focused on these initiatives. I mean, the Speed Perks itself, we called out the changes. I mean, we challenged the field to do a good job executing Speed Perks. In the lead market, we had a 30% increase in sign-ups. And in the national rollout, it was 80%, okay? Transactions as a percent of sales, lead market, 28%; national rollout, 40%. So I do feel the field team is executing better than they ever have. We see that in our Net Promoter Scores. That's obviously helping us. And when we launch something like in-store pickup, it's much more -- it happens faster. Our ability to get it done happens faster. So I mean, as we continue to build the initiatives, Chris, on DIY, I'm much more confident that we'll execute them well.","Christopher Bottiglieri","Got you. Okay. And then big picture, I mean, I think you're very much ahead of your peer group online, doing a lot of great work there. But I would say this industry has historically been kind of online resistant, which, frankly, I learned the hard way in the last couple of years. But big picture, where do you see the online presence in this category growing over the next several years? Are you making a calculated bet that online penetration picks up? Or is this -- this is where you think you could be most differentiated? Any thoughts that would be helpful.","Thomas Greco","Well, absolutely, we expect it to pick up. I mean, if I -- and I'll still think about online, Chris, as Pro as well, right? It's not just DIY. So your Pro experience, we've got, obviously, Worldpac, which is primarily all online, right? Then you have the AAP business, which is much lower. I think, on average, were something like 38% of our Pro orders come in through online platform. So we expect that number to go up. And obviously, that has, over time benefits for us because we're not on the phone, handling the customer over the phone. So that number goes up each year. We see that number going up each year. On the DIY side, we've certainly quantified what we believe the online penetration is going to be. We think it grows substantially, both ship to home and buy online, pick up in store over time. And that's why we want to make sure the buy online pickup in store experience is world-class because that's where we think we can really differentiate ourselves.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs.","Katharine McShane","I wondered if you could talk a little bit about what you're seeing with labor costs versus the improvements you were able to make in the labor-related costs during the quarter? And is this a dynamic we can see for the next several quarters?","Thomas Greco","Yes. We've done a really good job, Kate, managing wage deflation. We talked about supply chain earlier on the call that we did make an investment there. And that was intended to reduce the turnover inside of supply chain. Meanwhile, on the store side, which is, of course, the majority of our people, we have a unique program that no one else in the industry has, which is Fuel the Frontline. We're now up to 18,000 grants of company stock. We are absolutely convinced that this is lowering our turnover meaningfully in the key jobs that we have. That's the General Managers in our stores, the Customer Account Managers, the commercial parts pros and the can so -- DMs rather. So those 4 comprise 15,000 people. They're critically important for our company. We want the very best parts people in the industry, and those 4 jobs are central to the success. So we make sure that we're highly competitive there, and we've seen our turnover drop across the Board there. So to me, that's the best acid test, if you will, on how you're compensating your people and the type of roles you're providing. And while we're still seeing inflation, obviously, in wages, and we've got states that are increasing minimum, we contemplate all of that as we package our value proposition, employee value proposition together and we use the Fuel the Frontline to really augment that so we can keep our best people.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets.","Scot Ciccarelli","So we've talked a lot about kind of Speed Perks this morning and how is $14 million drag both sales and gross profit in the quarter. But can you help us better understand why the sales and gross margin drag would actually decline as the membership and usage of the program grows because I thought that was the implication?","Thomas Greco","Yes. The biggest factor is, we still have outstanding coupons unredeemed from the original Speed Perks, Scot, and they'll basically be gone by the end of the year. So that's a big factor because we're redeeming not only the coupons from Speed Perks 2.0, but from the original program. So as the year ends, those coupons are no longer eligible. They basically expire. So as we get into 2020, we'll see that subside, but we contemplated it for the fourth quarter. And as we get into 2020, we start to see incremental revenue. We see more frequency, people come back more often. We sign more people up. And by the way, we have people -- less people leaving. We're seeing improvement across the board on each one of those. You think about how do I attract new members, how do I graduate members from one tier to the next tier and how do I retain existing members. And the way we measure that, Scot, is did somebody transact in the past year. So we saw an 80% increase in new. We saw significant improvement in our retention of the people that were in Speed Perks. And then, obviously, we're trying to graduate people up the tier. So that's the intent. And what you'll see is revenue going up. With everything we've modeled, everything we've seen in the lead market, the revenue will be going up and the cost will be coming down.","Scot Ciccarelli","Got it. So in other words, you have 2 parallel programs where you're kind of getting hit, but only one kind of revenue source. And then over time, that first piece kind of goes away, and then you're going to just have a higher contribution margin on incremental sales as you build that base?","Thomas Greco","Yes. I mean, the pure Speed Perks program, the math on the pure Speed Perks 2.0 is very attractive. It's just in this interim period. We knew coming into the back half of the year that we were going to have to deal with these existing unredeemed coupons from the original program, which now you've got a whole bunch of awareness to them, and there was a lot of them out there.","Operator","Our next question comes from Liz Suzuki with Bank of America.","Elizabeth Suzuki","Can you talk about the monthly trajectory of comps? Are there any particular months in your quarter that they were significantly better or worse because I know it can be a bit volatile or more so for Advance versus some of your peers, just given your geographic exposure?","Thomas Greco","Yes. There wasn't a huge swing, Liz, as there have been in the past quarters. I think it started out very strong in kind of our northern geographies and then it did tail off in our northern geographies. And of course, now in the last week, we've seen that bounce back. So if you think about our periods: 8, 9, 10, 8 and 9 were better than 10. It's not unusual for us to see that, especially in the northern geographies. And when we called on our top performing areas, west Coast, Midwest, we were a little challenged in the back end on -- in the Northeast and Great Lakes, which is, again, up in those northern locations.","Elizabeth Suzuki","Great. And just sort of longer term, I mean, can you explain some of the bigger gaps in your margins versus peers on gross margin, in particular, just mix aside versus DIY versus Pro. Just can you talk about some of the low-hanging fruit on the margin side that over time you think you can get closer to some of your peers?","Thomas Greco","Yes. Well, we've called out four key territories, Liz, that we're executing against. So sales and profit per store, where we're making good progress, we started this journey at $1.5 million. We want to get to $1.8 million. And then there's a number of initiatives to drive profit per store, including everything that you would expect inside the 4 walls of our stores themselves. The supply chain is a very big factor. We talked about that earlier on the call. We're executing against the initiatives there. The category management piece is one that we're excited about. We're standing up, essentially a strategic pricing capability next year, and we've made a pretty big investment in the new pricing engine, which is going to allow us for regional pricing and an adaptive pricing approach to omni-channel that's going to deliver a seamless customer experience. We're also driving private label. Our customers are really responding well to Carquest. I wish we could roll it out faster, to be honest. We've got a number of categories that we're initiating now that we're going to continue to drive that, but private label as a percent of sales is a big opportunity for us. So inside of category management, you've got the ongoing material cost optimization. You've got strategic pricing. You've got a private label as a percent of sales.","And then in terms of SG&A, I feel great about where we are. There's a number of initiatives underway there. You saw the performance in the quarter. You're going to continue to see that going forward. And then there's the ERP system that Jeff is executing against for finance, where essentially a lot of the SG&A initiatives or about the integration of the company, which is now well underway, okay? We are integrating the company in many places. We've already done workday in terms of HR systems. We're in the process of ERP, talked about warehouse management systems. And Sri Donthi, who is our Chief Technology Officer, is doing a lot of things in the IT world to bring the systems together.","Elizabeth Suzuki","On the private label point specifically, I mean, what percentage of your sales is that now? And how big do you think that can ultimately get?","Thomas Greco","Yes. I mean, we're in -- it depends how you look at this and we really have different categories where we see big opportunities there. But we think we're well underpenetrated versus peers. I know that there's been a lot of commentary on that. But when we do the benchmarking, we feel that there's an opportunity for us to significantly grow private label as a percentage of sales. And I think this year, we're up about a point, Liz, but there's still a lot of room to grow in terms of percentage of sales.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Baker with Nomura.","Michael Baker","Two questions. One, if I'm right about my math, it looks like the fourth quarter, the midpoint of the guidance, if you just use sales and the implied operating profit, it looks like you're looking for an operating profit. Increase is better than you've done year-to-date. I get about 60 basis points at the midpoint. And I guess, related to that, an improvement in the operating profit dollar growth. Is that right? And if so, why should the fourth quarter margins on a year-over-year basis look better than they have year-to-date?","Jeffrey Shepherd","Yes. No, I think you're directionally correct. Again, we know we're going to have headwinds in the gross margin. We're going to be working very hard to overcome those. We ideally like to see a positive gross margin comp from a rate basis year-over-year. But a lot of the efforts that we're seeing within SG&A, we talked about standing up the MyDay being able to leverage labor in the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter, it's a volatile quarter. But what we've seen so far going into the quarter, we think we can get a significant amount of leverage in terms of the SG&A that's really going to drive that growth on a year-over-year basis.","Michael Baker","Okay. So it's in the SG&A side?","Jeffrey Shepherd","And then don't forget about supply chain. Look, we leveraged slightly. And that included these onetime costs that we're not going to see again in the fourth quarter. So our expectation is that supply chain is going to continue to leverage in -- even more significantly in the fourth quarter.","Michael Baker","Okay. Understood. And then one more, if I could. Just on the Speed Perks. Are you -- is this just a catch-up in terms of the offering to customers relative to your competitors? Or are you now getting more aggressive in prices? It's always been -- the space has been thought of as being very rational in pricing, but you're talking a lot about a new loyalty program and presumably better for the customer. So where are we in pricing the space? Are you getting more aggressive versus peers? Or are you just catching up to them?","Thomas Greco","Yes. I think it is a rational environment. Let me start by saying that, but we do feel we have the best offer in the industry. There's a number of drivers to that, Mike, that we feel pretty good about, and the receptivity has been fantastic. I mean, our team members are incredibly enthusiastic about it. They're talking to the customers about it. They can see the -- we've allowed them to see the status of the customer on the point-of-sale system. So they're talking it up in the stores. We think we can get the percentage of transactions up significantly. If you benchmark versus broader retail, we are very low. And it's important that we have that first-party data. We want to know what kind of car somebody drives. We want to know what -- everything about that person in terms of what they're buying in our stores. And today, we have a lot of customers that come in where we don't know that. So this is our opportunity to get them into the program and make our offering much more sticky. So that's the intent behind it, that's what we saw in the lead markets and that's what you're going to see us do.","Michael Baker","Okay. So effectively, you're getting more people to sign up by giving them a better offering?","Thomas Greco","Yes. Our offer is, we believe, the best in the industry right now. We do.","Michael Baker","And so is there the risk that others follow you in terms of that offering?","Thomas Greco","Yes. I can't comment on what others are going to do. I just feel that our program is one that can really help us get the first-party data we need to drive share of wallet with existing customers. We know that they don't buy all of their auto parts needs in our stores. That's the fact. We've got a very clear picture on the various levels. We've got 3 levels within the platform. We have our elite members. We have our VIP. We have our club members, and we have a pretty good idea of what our share of wallet is in each of those tiers. And the goal, obviously, is to drive more people up -- graduate people up the ladder so that their share of wallet increases.","Operator","Our next question comes from Seth Basham with Wedbush.","Seth Basham","I just had a couple of follow-up questions, diving into gross margins a little bit more deeply. First of all, in terms of the supply chain leverage in the quarter, a, would you care to quantify? And b, could you give us some color as to where it's coming from? Is it from freight rates or fewer stem miles, et cetera?","Thomas Greco","Yes. It was relatively minimal. Granted, we did have the cost of the work stoppage that we called out that was in the number and we still leverage. So I feel pretty good about it. So if I take that cost out, we actually did pretty well. It's really across the board. I mean, we're executing better in the DCs. I think we're managing our turnover much better in the DCs, as we said, and that allows us to get our piece -- unit piece per hour, all of those picking, packing, receiving, all of those things that need to be done flawlessly, we're making progress on. Clearly, we are starting to see benefits by optimizing our fleet. We're going to see much more of that over time. As we start to get to cross banner, that's where you're going to see the big numbers come out. We have fewer distribution centers now. I mean, we're now up to -- we've announced a total of four.","We still got Armonk facility to close in the balance of this year, early part of next year, but that will be four or less buildings, right? So you've got all of the reduced costs associated with that. I think we're working much better across the banner. So Reuben is looking across all of the banners of AAP to figure out how to be more productive in terms of how we move things around. We move a lot of auto parts around in this company. So moving around less is going to save us money. So finally, safety is improving inside of our buildings. That doesn't show up necessarily in supply chain, but it's important. It shows up in SG&A. So I think the productivity agenda for supply chain is what we feel really good about. And I think we're starting to see the benefits from.","Seth Basham","Got it. That's helpful color. And just other piece of gross margin I was interested in is the impact from mix shift to the online channel. First, any category mix shift that you experienced this quarter?","Jeffrey Shepherd","Yes. We did see headwinds associated with mix, and we look at it sort of 2 different ways. One is the channel or banner mix. And as expected, we continue to see the shift from DIY to Pro. To your question on the product mix, we did see it in 2 categories: one was in batteries and the other was in wipers. And the first one was just a mix within the category. The second one was just broader of volume out of the category, which is a very high-margin category. So that's what we saw in terms of category mix.","Seth Basham","Got it. And did either of those mix shifts impact your gross margins more or less than last quarter?","Jeffrey Shepherd","They're about the same.","Thomas Greco","And just to add one thing on that, Seth. I mean, obviously, the question came up earlier, but we fully contemplate all the mix changes that are going on inside the industry as we guide and look at our go-forward plans, whether that's our long-term plan or 2020. So all of the shift to online, the shift to Pro, the shift to large customers and Pro, those are all contemplated, and we end up netting out is our -- from that. So those are known headwinds that we believe are going to happen one way or the other.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Tom Greco for closing remarks.","Thomas Greco","Well, thanks, everyone, for joining us today. As you heard this morning, we're going to continue to work diligently to execute our strategic objectives, and we're confident we're putting the necessary steps in place to deliver growth in the balance of 2019 and beyond. We recognize we still have work to do, particularly in DIY, but we believe we're on the right path to succeed. I'm proud of the team we have at Advance, and I'm grateful for our team members' unrelenting focus on saying yes to the customer, while creating significant long-term shareholder value growth. Before we conclude, and in honor of Veterans Day yesterday, I want to take a moment to thank our veterans from all branches in the military for their service. It goes without saying that we're all deeply indebted for their sacrifices, including our more than 6,000 Advance team members, who previously served. We're honored to partner with several organizations to recruit, support and engage with service members, including building homes for heroes, the USO and hiring our heroes. We're committed to fully further the partnership with these great organizations working together to support our veterans. Thanks for joining us this morning, and we look forward to sharing our fourth quarter results and 2020 outlook with you in February.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call.

Before we begin, Joshua Moore, Vice President, Finance and Investor Relations, will make a brief statement concerning forward-looking statements that will be made on this call.","Joshua Moore","Good morning, and thank you for joining us on today's call.

We intend to be covered by, and we claim protection under, the Safe Harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.","Forward-looking statements address future events, developments or results and typically use words such as believe, anticipate, expect, intend, will, plan, forecast, outlook or estimate, and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that may cause the results to differ materially, including competitive pressures, demand for the company's products, the economy in general, consumer debt levels, dependence on foreign suppliers, the weather, business interruptions and other factors disclosed in the company's 10-K for fiscal year ended December 29, 2012 on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","The company intends these forward-looking statements to speak only as of the time of this conference call and does not undertake to update or revise them as more information becomes available.","The reconciliation of any non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on the call with the corresponding GAAP measures are described in our earnings release and our SEC filings, which can be found in our website at advanceautoparts.com.","For planning purposes, our second quarter 2013 earnings release is scheduled for August 8 before market open, and our quarterly conference call is scheduled for the morning of Thursday, August 8, 2013. To be notified of dates of future earnings reports, you can sign up through the Investor Relations section of our website.","Finally, a replay of this call will be available on our website for 1 year.","Now let me turn the call over to Darren Jackson, our Chief Executive Officer. Darren?","Darren R. Jackson","Thank you, Joshua. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter conference call. To our 54,000 team members, thank you for your hard work and focus on our everyday fundamentals in order to better serve our customers and grow our business.","Also, I want to take a moment to welcome George Sherman, our new President, and congratulate Charles Tyson in his recent promotion to EVP, in charge of merchandising, marketing and supply chain. Both George and Charles are with me today and will be available to answer questions during the Q&A portion of this call.","Turning to our business. We highlighted during the fourth quarter conference call that our start to the fiscal year would be challenging and demand would continue to be weak for the first quarter. We are not surprised nor are we satisfied with the sales and bottom line results. We continued to experience the temporal impacts to our industry with respect to the unseasonably warm weather in early 2012 that deferred maintenance expenditures and impacted failure rates in vehicles, especially in our cold-weather markets. We expected tougher sales comparisons and the short-term impacts of consumers both considering and increasing big-ticket spending, including new car sales, to factor into our results. Yet, we did not fully anticipate certain impacts to our core customer, including the payroll tax increases, the delayed income tax refunds, coupled with a very slow start to the spring selling season.","Collectively, these factors contributed to a much softer than anticipated comparable store sales performance, which declined 3.2%. Our comparable store sales decline was driven by our DIY business and partially offset by a modest gain in our commercial sales. Our decline in transactions was partially offset by an increase in average ticket, which was driven by price optimization and the mix of products sold.","The encouraging news is that we expected our sales trends to materially improve in April, and they did. Our best weekly performance during the quarter came in the last 2 weeks, which ended April 20. During that period, we saw both transaction and average ticket growth. The principal driver was a return to a more normal weather pattern in the Northeast and the Great Lakes regions. Specifically, we have seen improvements in our seasonal and maintenance categories as customers began to perform that much-needed work on their vehicles that had been deferred much of last year. This is reaffirming that our market remains strong and consumers still have a willingness to invest in reliable transportation.  These positive trends have carried over to the start of our second quarter, generating low-single digit comp store sales increases. However, our optimism continues to be tempered in the face of a solid start to the second quarter.","Our last 6 weeks' sales performance have been positive but somewhat uneven week to week, hampered in part due to the sluggish start to the spring selling season. Our seasonal categories like wash and wax, air conditioning and radiators have been the most erratic.","Further, our sales outlook for the balance of 2013 remains guarded on account of a couple key macro factors. First is the increase in the number of people purchasing or contemplating the purchase of a new vehicle. Undoubtedly, this will be good for us in the long term. However, it will cause short-term volatility in the industry as customers become more selective in what they invest in maintaining their aging vehicle.","Second, our economy continues to be fragile with declining consumer confidence, high unemployment and financial stress on our core customer, which became more acute with the most recent payroll tax increases that took effect at the start of the year. The silver lining is that the economy of necessity, where consumers will continue to seek value from their local aftermarket garages or perform needed repairs and maintenance themselves.","Despite our cautious sales outlook, we remain committed to growing our business and profitability through our consistent focus on service leadership and our superior availability strategies. We intend to stay the course in 2013 on our objective of a company of one delivering on the fundamentals. The expected outcome is simple, which is to make the day in terms of our customer experience, sales and profitability.","Pragmatically, that means delivering on a few key initiatives, starting with commercial sales and in-store execution, while maximizing the benefits of our investments and availability, delivery speed, e-commerce, diagnostic capabilities and beginning the rollout of our new electronics parts catalog. Collectively, this is consistent with our transition from building capabilities to leveraging them to improve our ability to consistently grow our business and accelerate our profitability.","In the first quarter, these efforts are reflected in our improving commercial customer retention and growth rates. Our gross profit rate was essentially flat for the quarter, which was above our expectations. Our SG&A per store was down slightly on a trailing 4-quarter basis versus the first quarter a year ago.","All in, and despite our lower-than-anticipated sales performance, this allowed our operating income change in the first quarter to be within our previously-shared outlook of down mid- to upper-single digits, decreasing 9.1%. Mike will share more details of our financial performance later in this call.","Now let me provide you an update on our 5 key priorities I outlined at the beginning of 2013. First, growing our Commercial Business through improved levels of delivery speed and reliability and increased customer retention and share of wallet with our national and regional customers. We continue to monitor our ability to deliver fast service safely and accurately, and leverage our investments on our online ordering and the in-sourcing of our commercial credit. Finally, we have begun to invest in sales activation programs to better grow our national and regional customer accounts.","As a result of these efforts, we saw positive comp store sales gain in our commercial sales, across-the-board improvements in delivery speed, record B2B and credit penetration, and our mix of business and commercial during the quarter grew to 40.8% versus 37.9% during the first quarter of 2012.","Our second priority of improving our local market availability is that we continue to increase the number of hubs in our fleet through the new store openings and the upgrade of existing stores that have that space and are strategically located to operate the hubs.","Through our first quarter, we expanded our hub store count to 348, adding 9 hubs during the quarter and 31 since the first quarter of last year. Additionally, we see -- we are seeing progress with our operations at our new Remington DC. As we previously stated, we anticipate ramping up to 400 stores being serviced by Remington this year. Through our first quarter, we had 278 stores receiving shipments from Remington at least once per week, with more than half of those stores receiving daily replenishment. The initial results of our stores receiving daily delivery is promising as they are experiencing a mid-single-digit sales lift versus their control stores within the region, driven principally by the parts category. However, we are still very -- in the very early stages and need to continue to monitor the results over the next several months to draw any definitive conclusions.","Our third priority is expanding our new store footprint. As you recall, we completed the acquisition of BWP at the beginning of the fiscal year and began our efforts to integrate the 124 stores we acquired to the Advance Auto Parts platform. We have just completed the integration planning of this work and will begin the process of converting and consolidating stores over the next 12 to 15 months. We successfully transitioned the independent stores to GPI and retained the outstanding team members at a very high rate and focused much of our attention on maintaining the great relationships built by the BWP team.","We continue to move forward with our more aggressive new store opening plan, adding 46 net new Advance stores and 5 net new Autoparts International stores during the quarter. Mike will provide a little more detail on our new store openings during the quarter.  We continue to be delighted by the performance of our newer classes of stores, with our 2012 class of stores continuing to outperform our expectations and our 2013 class of stores meeting our expectations during the quarter.","Our fourth priority, improving our in-store execution, is supported by our new tools to measure personal productivity to help place our best salespeople during the hours of the days of the week with the highest amount of traffic. Also, we are working to improve the level of individual effectiveness to maximize every customer engagement. These efforts are simply tied to improving our schedule effectiveness and increasing our customer order size by providing our customers with the full solution all the time in order for them to get the job done right the first time. We are still progressing towards our goals, however, we continue to improve our results, which are reflected in our increase in average ticket size.","Five, and finally, improving our profitability through increasing our efficiency throughout our support areas and our store operating model. Our leaders have been working locally and collectively to identify and deliver efficiencies in our business that will put us on a trajectory to achieve accelerated profitability and reduce the SG&A-per-store gap versus our industry peers. Additionally, we have developed long-term incentive programs designed to accelerate both the growth and profitability. Collectively, our company priorities remain intensely focused on operations to drive results through customer service, enabled through outstanding and consistent execution.","In closing, I'd like to share an example of how team members bring Service is our Best Part, to life. As we've mentioned, we have been very excited about our new service model of daily replenishment in our Remington distribution center and have increased the availability of parts that it has helped us achieve for our customers in those markets.","With any new facility with the new team members, it is always important to have someone who is a constant champion of the customer. For Devon Kurtz [ph], the AGM in Remington, this comes naturally. No matter the question or special request to help serve our store customers, he always has the same positive purposeful approach of doing whatever he needs to do to provide that help, to provide that service and to get the job done. He provides a constant focus of quality and integrity with the Team Members in the facility with a calm, continual reminder of the importance of providing great service out to the stores and our customers. Thank you, Devon [ph] , for being a leader in Remington and for the company.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Mike Norona, our Chief Financial Officer.","Michael A. Norona","Thanks, Darren, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start by thanking all of our talented team members for their continued efforts to improve our business and serve our customers as we navigate through a challenging first quarter and start to our year.","I plan to cover the following topics with you this morning: one, provide some financial highlights for our first quarter of 2013; two, put our first quarter results into context with our expectations and key financial dimensions we use to measure our performance; and three, provide some insights on the remainder of 2013.","As we shared on our fourth quarter earnings call, we anticipated our first quarter would be challenging, given the industry softness carryover from 2012, tougher sales comparisons, the annualization of 2012 new stores, along with the heavy concentration of stores opened in the fourth quarter of 2012 and higher incentive compensation. That was further magnified with the first 90 days being even more challenging than we anticipated, especially in DIY, driven by higher payroll taxes, delayed tax refunds and a slow start to spring.","While we are never satisfied when we do not meet our expectations, we were pleased with our discipline to make adjustments during the quarter as we responded to a softer sales environment. These adjustments, along with the stronger sales in the last 2 weeks of our first quarter, allowed us to deliver a somewhat better bottom line performance than we anticipated and shared out at the beginning of April.","As I mentioned to you last quarter, we continue to remain focused on influencing the things that are in our direct control and positioning our company for long-term growth and profitability by maintaining our strategic focus, executing on the fundamentals and simplifying our operations.","As a result of the weaker consumer demand, our comp store sales decreased 3.2%. Our total sales, however, increased 3% to over $2 billion, driven by the acquisition of BWP and the net addition of 163 new stores over the past 12 months. Our comp store sales decrease was driven by declines in our DIY sales, partially offset by a positive growth in commercial sales.","Our gross profit rate in the first quarter was 50% versus 50.1% in the first quarter of 2012, or a decrease of 8 basis points. This was slightly above our expectations for the quarter. The decrease was primarily due to the planned increase in supply chain costs associated with the full operation of our new Remington DC and the impact of BWP sales, which have a lower gross margin rate due to their higher mix of commercial sales, partially offset by continued improvements in our shrink rate.","Our SG&A rate of 39.9% increased 127 basis points versus the first quarter of 2012, primarily due to expense deleverage as a result of our 3.2% comp store sales decline and increased new store openings, partially offset by lower advertising expense due to our adjustments related to the softer industry sales environment and a decrease in credit card fees as a result of the in-sourcing of our commercial credit program.","All in, our operating income was $204.1 million, which was a decrease of 9.1% versus the first quarter of 2012. This was in line with our outlook we shared during our fourth quarter conference call, due to our stronger finish during the last 2 weeks of our first quarter and our team's disciplined focus on expense management.","Our operating income rate decreased 135 basis points to 10.1% in the first quarter. Our EPS decreased 7.8% versus Q1 last year to $1.65 per share and includes $0.01 of transition costs associated with the integration of BWP. We still anticipate the transition of BWP will occur over an 18-month period and the cost associated with 2013 to be in the range of $0.15 to $0.20.","Our free cash flow usage of $105.9 million for the quarter was primarily the result of the acquisition of BWP. Excluding the net impact of the acquisition, our free cash flow would have been $72 million compared to $153.1 million in the first quarter of 2012. Our owned inventory decreased 12.8% versus Q1 2012, primarily due to our efforts to increase our accounts payable to inventory ratio, which is now at 86.7% versus 82.5% in the first quarter of 2012.","Our total inventory increased 15%, driven by our new Remington DC, more hubs, more new stores and the acquisition of BWP. This increase was slightly higher than our expectations due to our lower-than-anticipated sales performance.","During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 767,000 shares at an average price of $76.72. At the end of our quarter, we had roughly $434 million left under our share repurchase authorization, and our average diluted share count was 73.8 million shares.","At the end of our first quarter, we had roughly $605 million of debt on our balance sheet, and our adjusted debt to EBITDAR was 2.2x, which is below our previously stated ceiling of 2.5x.","We continue to measure the performance of our business with the financial dimensions of growth, profit and value creation. We continue to prioritize growth as our primary use of capital in order to increase returns and drive shareholder value. As a result, our focus continues to be on accelerating our commercial growth and stabilizing our DIY business. Our goal to achieve this is by improving our availability through our hub stores, inventory upgrades, supply-chain investments and strengthening our market position with increased new store openings.","We are very proud of our improved coverage and in-market availability, driven by the areas Darren covered. We are also proud of the accelerated pace of our new stores openings, including the net addition of 175 new stores during the quarter, including the acquisition of BWP, which added 124 commercially-oriented new stores in the Northeast; the opening of 49 new Advance Auto Parts stores; and the opening of 7 new Autopart International stores. Additionally, we closed 3 Advance stores and 2 Autopart International stores. At the end of Q1, our total store count was 3,969, and we remain on pace to open 170 to 190 new Advance Auto Parts stores and Autopart International stores this year.","Turning to profit. While we did not meet our profit expectations for the quarter, we are pleased by how our team responded in the face of a slower sales environment to make adjustments that helped our profits. As we shared recently, we have recommitted ourselves to getting to 12% operating margins over the next 3 years. The pathway to 12% is going to be modest gross profit rate improvement and a significant improvement in our cost efficiency and execution. We have aligned our leadership and incentive programs around this goal.","Three big drivers around our cost will be improvements in our labor productivity, developing a more flexible cost model that flexes with sales and reducing administrative and support costs furthest away from the customer. For example, we have developed tools that allow us to set goals and measure individual team member productivity, and we expect to see improvements in our dollars per transaction. We also have a high fixed cost model that needs to scale better as sales flex. Finally, we have to get more efficient with our costs, including lowering our cost furthest away from the customer. We have made significant investments in our business and capabilities in the last 5 years, and those investments came with the expectations of lower support costs, supply chain, professional services, occupancy costs, to name a few. As a result of a commitment to build a more competitive cost structure while funding strategic investments and to employ a more disciplined approach to cost management, our total SG&A dollars per store decreased slightly to $651,000 per store in our first quarter versus $656,000 per store during the first quarter of 2012.","With respect to value creation, we have maintained our disciplined approach to capital, which is reflected in our return on invested capital of 18.1%. For the quarter, our ROIC decreased 223 basis points versus the first quarter last year as a result of our increased invested capital through the acquisition of BWP, the in-sourcing of our commercial credit and the accelerated pace of our new store openings. Also impacting ROIC is our lower operating performance, driven by the lower sales environment.","Longer term, we see opportunities to improve our ROIC as we begin to generate benefits from our Remington DC, our acquisition of BWP and as our sales from our new store openings begin to ramp. We also see opportunities to reduce our net owned inventory as we move towards our goal of achieving an AP ratio of 100%.","Turning to the balance of the year. We continue to be confident that the fundamentals of our industry remain strong and are encouraged by our positive comp store sales performance so far in Q2, driven by our improved performance in the Northeast. Our optimism is somewhat tempered by our soft first quarter, which is our longest and historically strongest quarter, and slow start to spring. It is unclear how much of our strong start to Q2 is the result of a bounce-back from the delayed spring versus a fundamental rebound in consumer demand. Therefore, we think it's prudent to temper our full year expectations. We now anticipate that our comp store sales will be flat to slightly positive for the full year, and we will continue to make the appropriate adjustments to our costs in a disciplined way to adjust to these sales trends.","It is still early enough in the year that we are maintaining our annual outlook. But given the softness in Q1 and slow start to spring, we now expect we will be at the lower end of our previously-shared annual outlook of $5.30 to $5.45.","In closing, we are committed to our strategies in commercial and availability and remain confident in the industry fundamentals and how we are positioned as a company. We are focused on improving our top and bottom line and strengthening our returns to continue to drive shareholder value. We also want to thank our 54,000 team members who lead us every day with their relentless focus on service and commitment to operational excellence and execution, which are key ingredients to delivering on our goals.","Operator, we are now ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Two quick ones, both related to the outlook. On your last call, I believe, you had given some directional color for gross margin and for growth in SG&A per store on the year. As you maintained your guidance in essence for the first quarter, it was a bit off from what we originally thought. Is there any change to the geography of the P&L considered in your outlook?","Michael A. Norona","Matt, it's Mike. First of all, what we said in our outlook is that our margin would be modestly up for the year, and we still expect our margin, our gross profit margin, to be modestly up for the year. And then from an SG&A-per-store perspective, we said that we expected it to be up 3% to 5% for the year. And I would expect now, since we somewhat tempered our annual outlook to the low end, we guided to the low end, that we would be in the low end of that SG&A per store.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. That's helpful. And then secondly, welcome back to the world of share repurchases. It's been a while, and it's good to see you buying back stock. It was kind of a -- dipping a toe in -- back in, relative to the rate that we have been accustomed to when you were most active. What's your thought process on the kind of money you would look to put back into buybacks, given that your free cash flow remains substantial?","Michael A. Norona","Yes. So first of all, I just want to remind everyone we haven't changed our view on how we deploy capital. We take a long term, disciplined approach to our capital, and we prioritize investing in the business first and then looking for non-organic strategic investments in areas that are strategically aligned with our company, i.e. the BWP acquisition. So that hasn't changed. We also see buybacks as kind of that third leg to return back to the shareholders, but our priority is always to give back -- to invest in the business first. You saw that we bought back about $59 million of shares in the quarter in terms of dollars, and we typically -- we don't give a forward outlook in terms of how many shares we buy back. But our capital allocation hasn't changed. And as you saw, I think last time, we said we're going to start buying shares back, and you saw us do that in the quarter.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And just very quickly, by way of cleanup, if you think about the guidance you initially issued, I'm not sure that there was any buyback in there. You've since bought back some stock, so should we assume that the implied share count is in line with no incremental buybacks but the buybacks that we've seen year-to-date?","Michael A. Norona","Yes. That's right, Matt. So we don't -- we won't include any -- none of -- no future buybacks included in our outlook, but we have incorporated what we purchased to-date in our outlook.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The next question is from Michael Lasser with UBS.","Michael Lasser - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I wanted to talk about the pace of improvement that you saw towards the end of the first quarter, and it sounds like it's continued into the first period. It sounds like you've been kind of guarded on your optimism that -\u2013 about the acceleration and it may not have been to the same degree that some of the other players within the industry have talked about. So a, is that fair? And is there an explanation for that?","Darren R. Jackson","Yes. Sure, Michael. This is Darren. So a couple of things. You're absolutely right. Our comments do reflect that we are guarded. When we look back at the first 16 weeks of the quarter -- it's our longest quarter for the year, as I said in my comments -- our last 2 weeks were as we expected, materially improved in terms of our sales trend. But before that, it was pretty uneven. Matter of fact, I would say we started in period one very strong. The middle part of the quarter was very challenging, particularly March, and we expected part of that, particularly in our colder-weather markets because of the early spring that affected us and many others in the industry and related industries. When we got into Q2, as I said in my remarks, if you look over this, the first 4 weeks, we've been absolutely positive in the low-single digits as I said in my remarks. I'm a little guarded because I'm not sure if it's a head fake a little bit in terms of the consumer. So when I look through the trends, we certainly can see -- take our maintenance categories. We've had an enormous bounce-back in our maintenance categories. Maintenance is about 45% of our business. So it tends to skew higher than, say, some of the others in the industry. And so that maintenance category has just been stubborn and erratic for the better part of a year. So that's going to include your oil, that's going to include brakes. And so I guess it's just prudent on our part to temper those expectations 'til we get more than call it a 6-week trend at this point. Now having said that, internally, you can imagine we are playing to higher expectations. But we think responsibly, we should manage both to our top line expectations, manage our costs in the right way to get to the right profitability outcomes at the end of the year.","Michael Lasser - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","That's very helpful commentary. The follow-up question, Darren, in your prepared remarks, you called out rising new car sales and the intention of consumers to buy new cars. In the past, the industry has kind of had an uneven or inconsistent relationship with new car sales. There's been periods where the industry has done really well in a pretty high-SAAR environment. And then obviously, when the SAAR fell, the industry also did quite well. So what's driving that viewpoint right now? And maybe you could talk a little bit about your decision to include that in the script.","Darren R. Jackson","Yes, happy to do that. Let's say, more broadly, when we look into consumers, the one thing in our category we do see, is failure has been a consistent performer for us. And failure categories, again, think about batteries, is probably the anchor in the failure category business. So we know when something actually breaks, the consumer does spend. And that's been a consistent performer as well. When we get into the maintenance categories and how it ties to new car sales, is that -- not just the cars that are being sold, it's the cars that are contemplating -- consumers contemplating a new purchase. And the other thing I would say is that when our industry really benefited in '09 and '10, what we saw was that release in terms of the deferred maintenance spend, and it came at the cost of probably some adjacent industries to us. So we saw housing slow down in terms of the spend in housing. We saw home improvements slow down at that moment in time. I think sometimes, we narrowly just think about our industry versus that consumer has a wallet, and those dollars tend to go different places. Clearly, they're choosing to use part of that wallet in some adjacent categories today. The contemplation of a new car will actually make them more selective in terms of what they invest in terms of their aging vehicle. And then candidly, there are just more cars being spent. So I think, a lot of times, there are industry-specific things that we must pay attention to in seasonal cycles, and we have to be realistic. Ultimately, it comes down to a consumer's wallet and how much open-to-buy they do have. And so my comments really reflect that guarded, but I think pragmatic view, about what the consumer is facing.","Operator","The next question is from Michael Montani with ISI group.","Michael Montani - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","The first one I had, related to the comp cadence that you might be up against if you think about the second quarter of a year ago. And I guess, specifically, the thought would be, if you're positive low-single digit now and we look at the negative 27 comp you did in 2Q '12, was that negative 27 sort of evenly negative low-single digits? Did you start better in April and then maybe tail off towards the back half? I guess, selfishly, it could imply that the comp could be something better than just 1 or 2 for the quarter.","Darren R. Jackson","Well, we -- Michael, we certainly hope so. And I think it goes back to my earlier comments. As I -- I don't have the period-by-period in front of me from Q2 a year ago, but my sense is there was just a consistency to it. I don't think it varied anymore from 1 point or 2, period to period. So that's not necessarily how we're looking at the comparison in the second quarter. It really comes back to -- we want to see more consistent stability in that positive comp sales trend. The good news is we're seeing positive comps week in and week out now. We have some big weeks still ahead of us as we head towards just this weekend ahead of us in terms of Memorial Day, as you head towards July 4 a little later in this year. But the good news is we do see 2 -- on a 2-year basis, our stacks remain positive as well. So all that's good, and I'd just take you back to my prior comments. We think it's important just to kind of temper some of the expectations but clearly focus our teams towards a higher outcome.","Michael Montani - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Great. That's helpful. And then another question, sort of bigger picture, was just looking at call it a 600, 700 bps deceleration in comps from 1Q '12 for yourselves and the industry broadly, we've been thinking obviously weather is a couple hundred bps and disinflation. Can you just provide an update maybe on what kind of inflation you might be having today in your numbers at retail, sort of 1% to 2% perhaps, and what it could have been a year ago? And basically, the root of this is to understand -- have you now sort of cycled out of a period where there maybe was some inflation and now it's kind of stabilizing? Or what are you guys seeing?","Charles E. Tyson","Yes, Michael. We're still expecting a very modest impact from an inflation standpoint. It was more aggressive last year than we expect to see this year. I think you're going to see some volatility through the balance of the year, through the chemical business, primarily driven by what expectations drive through oil. I think in the balance of the business, we're going to see a good level of stability in our pricing. Obviously, if we see a change, as we've done in prior years, we'll react to that pricing to be competitive with the market. But I think it will be very modest as we're seeing through the balance of the year.","Darren R. Jackson","Yes, Charles. You'd probably say -- we're going to have pockets of lower price points, particularly in the AC category year-over-year. So we always have those pockets, Michael, air-conditioning being the one where the commodities tend to be somewhat volatile. I think as we look out, AC is another one where pricing is such, and the cost of commodities will take ASPs down this year. But we'll have other places in the hard parts categories, part because of complexity, partly because of inflation that will offset some of that.","Operator","The next question is from Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan.","Christopher Horvers - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Your gross margin guidance, it was down a little bit here in the first quarter. What changes throughout the year that should allow it to reverse the trend? And then how much of that is getting Remington up to speed from a capacity perspective?","Darren R. Jackson","Yes. So maybe I'll start and turn it over to Charles. So we were pleased in the first quarter, and I think we said in our remarks that we came in above our expectations. Our product margins were good. What really drove the decline in our margins was the investments in our supply chain. So as you know, we have Remington up fully operational now. We have more hubs than we had last year. So our supply chain costs were that, and that was somewhat offset by our progress in shrink. And I do want to pay a real compliment to our retail teams and our support teams that have been driving -- we're achieving record-level shrink. So that somewhat offset it. So the 8 basis points decline was driven by that, and we mixed in more commercial. And that's a little -- that can be lost a little bit in the story. Our commercial penetration, our balance -- or mix of sales was over 40% -- 40.8% of our mix. So that was the drivers in Q1. And really, what we said for the year is it's going to be very similar types of drivers. Obviously, we're going to continue to invest in our supply chain. We've talked about our second DC that we're investing in. And then we expect to see continued strength in our product margins, continue the benefits in shrink. And then the 2 offsets to that will be our supply chain, and then we're going to continue to mix in a higher mix of commercial. So it's really -- really, we're going to see the same things throughout the balance of the year. But again, we expect that our margins are going to be up modestly, and we planned this Q1 to be down. And that was part of our outlook as well.","Christopher Horvers - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Right. So just the math of that and Remington suggests that it sort of gradually moves to positive and -- more positive, I guess, in the back half?","Michael A. Norona","Yes.","Darren R. Jackson","Yes. As you put more stores on Remington, you're going to leverage Remington and those costs of Remington. So they start to come down over the course of the year.","Christopher Horvers - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then on the SG&A side, any quantification of those drivers more specifically? And can you point us to -- on the cost efficiency side, did you see benefits here in the first quarter of the commitment to drive profitability? Or is that still coming?","Michael A. Norona","Yes. So maybe I'll hit your first one first. The drivers in the quarter of our cost increase was obviously fixed cost deleverage because we did a lower comp and new stores. So we've ramped up our new stores, we saw a lot that we're annualizing now as we -- a lot of the stores that we opened in the back half of last year. So those were the 2 biggest drivers, and they were offset by some adjustments we made in our marketing spend as we adjusted the sales. And we had favorability in our credit card fees because of the in-sourcing of credit. So that's what happened in Q1. The drivers for the year are very similar. It's going to be new stores. We do have $0.15 to $0.20 of transition costs for BWP that are built into that number, and then higher incentive comp. And that's for the year. And that will be somewhat offset by some productivity improvements. We're expecting to see some more effective marketing spend and some lower admin cost. So that's what I would tell you for the year. In terms of our commitment to get to 12% and the improvements we see there, very little of that was baked into the first quarter so far.","Christopher Horvers - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then on -- just a segue on the BWP integration cost. You cited $0.01 in the prepared remarks. You didn't call it out in the actual release. Can you -- is that all in the SG&A line item? And as those costs become more substantial, to get to the $0.15 to $0.20, will you actually call that out in the earnings release?","Michael A. Norona","Yes, we will. We may not call out the specifics, but we will tell you. So we had $0.01. I think Darren mentioned it in his remarks, we're really pleased with the first 90 days. And really, our first 90 days, we were really focused on 3 things. One is the transition of the independents and the Armonk DC to GPI. The second thing we were focused on is building relationships and retaining our team members. We're really excited to have those parts -- that business as part of our company and their talent. So that was an important dimension. And then the third dimension is making sure we're continuing to build and retain the customer relationship. So that's where our focus was. Primarily, those -- and then the other thing that we did during the quarter was really, we built our -- we finished off the integration planning phase. So as they become -- as the costs -- so that's what really made up the $0.01 in costs. We're just getting started. As the costs become more material throughout the year, we'll give you visibility at the highest level. But we still expect at this time that the $0.15 to $0.20 to -- we still expect that, that will be the range in which they're going to be.","Operator","The next question is from Mike Baker with Deutsche Bank.","Michael Baker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Wanted to ask about sort of the comp trends and the improvement that you saw towards the end of the quarter. Can you share with us whether that was -- whether you saw outsized gains in those colder-weather regions? Or did you see improvement in trends in both colder weather and the regions that actually have been hanging in okay? Can you also tell us if it was -- if you saw improvement in commercial and DIY, or one versus the other?","Darren R. Jackson","Yes. That's my answer to the question, Michael. So we did see -- in the final 2 weeks, the spring selling season showed up, and we saw gains across the board. Did the cold-weather markets outperform the other markets? They absolutely did, and we expected them to do. Did DIY come back and commercial accelerate? Yes, it did, in those 2 weeks. And those are things -- as I said in my comments, we expected to bounce back in April, and we expected that bounce-back to be principally in the colder-weather markets. I would have said, in the first 90 days, across our markets, we underperformed and we underperformed in those seasonal categories of the business for the reasons I talked about before. When the final 2 weeks came back -- came in, they bounced back. That bounce-back has continued into the first 4 weeks of this quarter. So it's an encouraging trend for the reasons we've talked about earlier, but that's what we saw in terms of the basic parts of the business.","Michael Baker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, great. Two more quick questions, if I could. One, at your Analyst Day, you mentioned that Wal-Mart was becoming more competitive in this space. Can you update us on what you're seeing there? And then lastly, maybe a subtle point, but on your new stores, you said 2012 was above plan; 2013, in line with plan. Is it just that we're too early to really get a good read on the 2013 stores? Or is there some reason why they wouldn't be performing as well as the class of 2012?","Charles E. Tyson","Yes, Mike, it's Charles. I think what we said was several years ago, we saw how Wal-Mart had made an adjustment into the category. But certainly, from a promotional perspective, we have not seen any material difference year-on-year on how I would see them impacting promotional pricing in the marketplace or a change in mix that fundamentally makes any change in the marketplace.","Darren R. Jackson","Yes. And Michael, as to the new stores, you're right. The 2012 class certainly outperformed our expectations last year. They're outperforming our expectations this year. 2013 are at expectations, and I think it's for the reasons we mentioned. It's too early to tell. And I would have said, in light of the slow start to the spring selling season, they're actually outperforming expectations. They continue to do very well as we mix more into commercial in those new stores, and the thing that held them back in the first quarter was more DIY than their commercial business.","Operator","Our next question is from Dan Wewer with Raymond James.","Daniel R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","If George is available, I wanted to ask him if he could talk about his prior experience and accomplishments and how that could help Advance. And also, what are his initial thoughts on the 4 or 5 weeks he's been with the company?","Darren R. Jackson","George is available.","George Sherman","Sure. Thanks for the question. Let me start with prior experience. I spent the last 4 years with Best Buy on the services side, 5 years roughly with the Home Depot and 15 years with Target. And I think probably the keyword out of those experiences is operations. A lot of time as a -- virtually every store role from General Manager through Regional Vice President, through Senior Vice President of stores, operations with the Home Depot. So I think, if you look at things like beginning to accelerate operating income, that's going to require a fair amount of execution. I think you can count on this being a field-led role for me as President. A lot of time in the stores, a lot of time in the distribution centers, a lot time away from the support center, and that's been the case up until now. It's been 30 days, almost exactly, and those 30 days have been in market, time in stores in Atlanta and in Virginia; Washington, D.C.; Chicago. Had a chance to go see the hub strategy play out in conjunction with daily delivery with some of the markets that are affected by the Remington daily delivery. Out to see the e-commerce team on the West Coast in San Jose. So very initial, but I think the observations so far are -- that they are certainly, from my standpoint, cause for optimism. I think where daily delivery and hub strategy meets, we're seeing, as Darren mentioned, some nice mid-single-digit lift relative to the control stores. And I think -- we had the chance to talk to some of our commercial customers. We're seeing, from a customer service standpoint, reliability, more consistent in-stock level and a plan that's clearly working. I'd add that -- and this is always a benefit as you know -- anytime you have the chance to simplify operations in stores and retail, that's a very good thing. The stores with daily delivery are easier to run. There is less of an event around trailer unloading and truck arrivals when it's not 1 large or 2 large weekly shipments but something smaller coming in daily. That becomes part of the daily routine as opposed to a labor event in the stores. So we're able to redirect focus more toward customer service, and doing well by our customers. So I think that's -- in a nutshell, it is to be an operationally-focused leader for this business and to be out there quite a bit with our store teams, our distribution teams in the field and with our customers.","Daniel R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","During the 30 days you've been with the company and the work in the field, do you see any potential easy wins? Any low-hanging fruit in improving execution?","George Sherman","Yes. I think we're clearly moving toward operational plans now. As Mike and Darren talk about a goal toward -- getting toward 12% op income that requires planning -- I think we're finessing that at the moment and making some changes to it. I don't know that there are what I would call low-hanging fruit, but there are certainly things that we'll begin to address and make improvement of.","Operator","Our next question is from Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets.","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I think this is a little bit of a follow-up from the answer we just got. But you've mentioned twice now you're seeing the mid-single-digit comp lift for the stores receiving the daily delivery. I guess my question is, can you address the profitability of those sales? In other words, are the extra sales being justified by the extra costs incurred on that daily delivery? And then related to that, how are you going to think about kind of that balance going forward?","Darren R. Jackson","Yes, Scot. I'd bring you back to -- we are exceeding the pro formas that we built. When you build a distribution center, there are 3 pieces. One -- as we talk about Remington, Remington enabled a few things. One, it enabled growth and the new store growth we're seeing in the upper Midwest, principally in our Chicago markets. So in part, that distribution center was positioned 8 years ago -- we just finished before I got here -- to position us for growth. So certainly, that DC is paying for itself in part through the growth we're seeing in those key markets. Two, the daily replenishment, as George highlighted in his comments and my comments, we're actually exceeding the pro forma that we've built, and that's a double delta. So we are simply comparing to a control store group, and we are exceeding those expectations. Are we blowing them away? We're not blowing them away, but I am encouraged that we're -- shoot, we're probably a -- our first full quarter, we're not even fully operational in terms of all the stores that we'll serve out of that DC, and this is the sixth DC I have opened in my career. And generally, it takes the better part of the year to work the bugs out because it's both a new facility, a new set of technology, a new set of processes and a new team. So I am pleasantly surprised that we're reporting what we're reporting right now in light of that level of change going into that facility. And then lastly, it comes down to the cost of running the building. If you remember, part of how we're paying for it is that, that sales lift has to pay for the incremental transportation. And it's certainly paying for it. But the other thing that it just takes time to measure, it will get measured in customer retention on the commercial customer side. So that longer-term commercial customer retention, if we think about that in terms of, oh, I don't know, lifetime value customers, there's a big benefit to that, that quite frankly, we're not going to know the answer to that for probably another year. But what we can see so far in customer behavior, in terms of our bigger accounts, we like what we see. And so I'm very encouraged that we're this early in the journey, both in terms of enabling growth, seeing the lift in a way that certainly pays for the transportation. We can -- we're still working through the cost side of the technology and the people. More importantly, the longer-term benefit is in the commercial customer retention and availability for the DIY customer when they come in and the longer-term profitability that comes from that.","Michael A. Norona","And just to -- I think what we want you to hear is we're optimistic. It's still early. We're seeing lifts on both sides of the business. Also, as we mix in more parts, these -- we're expecting that, that will be accretive to our margin as well. And then we're expecting down the road to see labor productivity. These are automated DCs. And like I said, it's early -- still early.","Operator","Our next question is from Bret Jordan with BB&T Capital Markets.","Bret David Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","On the same theme, I guess, given the success you've seen in daily delivery, is there any thought about accelerating the Connecticut distribution center that's sort of next in the pipeline? Or I guess, when would we expect to see that opening up?","Charles E. Tyson","We have our plans in place in terms of the investments we have to make around building that facility. We are on target for a third quarter plan for 2014. It's pretty complicated. So yes, we would always love to want to accelerate, but we want to stick to our plan and do it the right way, to make sure that we execute the opening and fulfill the need for those stores. So the teams are focused on it. They're taking their learnings from Remington. They're doing some parallel parking through Remington into Connecticut. So we expect to open in the expected time frame that we announced before.","Bret David Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Okay, great. And then one question on the commercial, given the national account sales focus. Could you tell us of the 40% that's commercial in the mix, what would you consider sort of national account versus up and down the street business? And maybe compare the growth rates, given the accelerated focus on national accounts and maybe the -- it may be lumpy, but clearly, some bigger wins when you get them.","Charles E. Tyson","Yes, Bret. Usually, what I do is -- in part, we're not going to go into all of those details in terms of how we're focusing our national account strategy. But I'll say this, is that over the first quarter, what we did see is our national account business led the way. I mean, we saw business in terms of national accounts that was closer to higher-single-digit comps than the overall comps for the business. So as you recall -- I mean, you've been following us for a while, we started to build the business I would say principally through the mom-and-pop business up and down the street. We've made good headway in terms of the regional accounts. Our national account penetration is rolling. I'm very pleased in terms of how the team performed in the first quarter. As I said in my comments, our focused customer retention this quarter, we exceeded our plans and our expectations for the quarter. So all in all, I think we continue to walk that journey in terms of Advance growing its business with the right accounts and focusing our attention in terms of the service levels.","Operator","Our next question is from Peter Keith with Piper Jaffray.","Peter J. Keith - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","On the commercial credit program, as you called it out as actual benefit to SG&A, I don\u2019t recall seeing that before. Is there some aspect to that, that that's now beginning to grow more quickly? Or is just other pieces of the business outside of it are changing in terms of how everything flows through the income statement?","Michael A. Norona","Yes. So maybe just specifically, how it flows through the P&L. Prior to us in-sourcing it, we used to pay -- let's call them credit card fees to HSBC, who used to run our program. When we in-sourced it, we now have people doing that and systems doing that. When you net all that together, we're seeing benefits on the credit card discount line, so that when we talk about benefits to SG&A, that's specifically what we're talking about. In terms of the program, I mean, there are 3 primary benefits on that. One is we expect this to be a key enabler to grow our commercial business. Our team members have an opportunity now to have -- put customers, whether its controlled limits and the approvals and things like that. So we think we can drive our commercial business. So that's the first benefit. The second benefit is we just give a better service level when we handle things internally. So now, all the touch points with our customers are done with us. So whether it's through a store, through a sales associate, through our SSC or through our call centers, we're doing all that so we can give better service levels to the customers. And then the third one is the one you hit, is we expect that this credit program will also hurt our -- or help our costs as well through lower credit card discounts.","Peter J. Keith - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful, Mike. So is it -- now that you say you've had it in-house for a couple of quarters, is it now beginning to accelerate for you?","Michael A. Norona","Yes. So maybe I'll talk about the penetration. I think we've talked before that the leaders in the industry are over 80% credit penetration, and we were in the low 40s when we started this. We're slowly making our way. Now we're in the high-40s. We'll probably get to 60 before we get to 80. But I think we're working collaboratively across our organization. We're building the muscle across our -- whether it's with our commercial sales teams, our retail field teams and our credit group, to actually build a program that we can go to the customer. So we're early on. We think it's going to happen over a matter of years, but it's going to be a really important key enabler to helping our commercial growth. But it will be over years.","Operator","Our next question is from Craig Kennison with Robert W Baird.","Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","With the success you're seeing at Remington so far -- it's exciting on the comp side -- what do you see in terms of the cost required to build future DCs? Do you see an opportunity in other words to reduce the expenditure required to advance that strategy?","Darren R. Jackson","Yes, Craig, we certainly do. So Remington is going to be the most expensive facility that we build, and I say that because it both reflects our new WMS system, it reflects the workforce that was brand-new in terms of just teaching them the distribution processes for the company. And naturally, it's going to experience all the bumps in terms of process and learnings of all the DCs. Enfield will be cheaper, because we'll be able to take the footprint and avoid some of the natural startup challenges one has in a new DC. I think the material cost savings that we'll see is that we're on the -- we're building the blueprints now to ask the question, given our existing facilities, \"How quickly can we retrofit them versus build new?\" We don't have a complete answer for that now. The teams are working on that as we speak. But to the extent we retrofit them, the good news is we can materially get the CapEx costs down. What you give up is some of the ongoing SG&A or labor efficiencies because you won't be able to essentially get the same level of technology in. But the teams are evaluating that now. We're optimistic we'll end up with both the build profile and the retrofit profile. So as we grow our business west of the Mississippi, we certainly have a footprint that we see in terms of Remington and Enfield. East of the Mississippi, we're looking for a solution in terms of retrofit.","Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And with respect to housekeeping here, how many commercial programs did you end the quarter with?","Darren R. Jackson","3,300. Right, Josh?","Joshua Moore","Yes. And 16, yes.","Darren R. Jackson","3,316, if you're keeping score.","Operator","And that's all the time we have for questions. I will now turn the call back to management for any final comments.","Joshua Moore","Thank you, Wendy, and thanks to our audience for participating in our first quarter earnings conference call.

Jackson","Thank you, Zaheed. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us, and welcome to our fourth quarter conference call. I'd like to start off by thanking all of our team members for their hard work and commitment to better serve our customers and grow our business.","Joining me on the call today is our President, George Sherman, who will update you on our business operations; and Mike Norona, our Chief Financial Officer, who will update you on our financials.","I'd also like to take this opportunity to convey a warm welcome to the new team members from General Parts that have now joined our Advance team, bringing our total team strength to approximately 71,000. The foundation of any business is its people, and I'm proud to be surrounded by an exceptionally talented team as we head into a special and transformative year for our company in 2014.","Since our last conference call at the end of the third quarter, we are very excited to have closed the General Parts acquisition on January 2, 2014. The closing of this transaction was a historic day for our company. This investment positions Advance for leadership in the industry while broadening and accelerating our growth strategy. Advance's 80-year history has been a story of growth, and adapting to the changing industry and customer needs. This combination is another strategic step forward for our great company, and I couldn't be more pleased and privileged to be part of this next chapter in our journey.","I will begin my prepared remarks today updating you on our fourth quarter performance, followed by my thoughts on our 2013 outcomes as well as our priorities for 2014. I am pleased to report that our results in the fourth quarter were better than expected, with total sales increasing 6% for the quarter. Our comparable earnings per share increased 6.8% versus the fourth quarter in 2012.","Now I'm also very happy to report a positive comp sales, albeit slight, of 0.1% increase in the quarter. This increase was a 210 basis-point acceleration from our third quarter. Notably, both our DIY and Commercial same-store sales accelerated from the third quarter, with Commercial outpacing DIY. Entering the fourth quarter, we anticipated continued sales softness and that our comparable store sales would decline by low single-digits. However, we saw increased levels of customer demand in the back half of the quarter due to favorable winter weather, generating increased sales particularly in battery and the wiper categories.","Sales in all of our markets accelerated from the third quarter, with our cold weather markets accelerating at a faster pace. The sales performance was also a testament to our supply chain and retail operations team for having strong inventory in-stock positions and delivering exceptional service to our customers. Clearly, the extended deep-freeze in the Eastern U.S. has and should benefit our business in 2014.","During the quarter, our gross profit rate declined 8 basis points to 49.8% versus 49.9% in the fourth quarter of 2012. That was expected. Our SG&A performance in the fourth quarter was in line with our expectations, as comparable SG&A increased to 41.7%. Mike will discuss this in more detail shortly.","Looking back on 2013, we continued to see favorable industry fundamentals as we witnessed an increase in miles driven, the average age of vehicles holding steady at over 11 years with approximately 80% of vehicles over 6 years old, and deferred maintenance reaching record levels in 2013.","We are encouraged with the overall progress we made in the year despite navigating persistent headwinds from unfavorable macro factors, including a very apprehensive consumer that was experiencing uncertainty with employment, government health care reform and a very uneven economic recovery.","In addition, we were faced with unseasonably warm winter temperatures during our first quarter, followed by a late start to the spring selling season. In light of all these challenges, we remained focused on what was in our control and concentrated on our objectives of driving growth, providing the best customer service and growing our profits. The back half of the fourth quarter brought extraordinary cold winter weather, which increased consumer demand and led to a strong finish to our fiscal year. As I've said before, weather balances out over the long term.","Strategically, our greatest accomplishment was the acquisition of General Parts International, which closed just after our 2013 fiscal year end. The combined business will be more balanced with a growth platform for Commercial and DIY. We will be able to strengthen our market position and increase service levels to a broader and deeper customer base in the industry. The acquisition increases our reach with immediate coast-to-coast and North American market coverage. It also expands our platform to include the important independent customer channel, while building on our commitment to national accounts, large bay garages, heavy-duty fleet and government programs.","The addition of WORLDPAC, combined with our existing Autopart International business, solidifies our position as the market leader in import parts. In addition, it will create an unparalleled e-commerce engine through our combination with the market-leading WORLDPAC and CARQUEST B2B platforms.","Operationally, our focus and related achievements were concentrated on strengthening and executing on the fundamentals, aimed at driving sales growth, customer service and profitability. As we entered the year, our strategy at the highest level was unchanged in terms of our focus on service leadership and superior availability. Yet, we narrowed our priorities to concentrate on growing our Commercial Business, focusing on in-store execution and developing a more efficient operating model, with both the DIY and Commercial businesses working together.","Overall, we are encouraged by our strong fourth quarter finish in sales, especially in the DIY business. Our focus in 2013 was managing our cost to the slower sales environment and making the necessary trade-offs as we balanced our profit management of our important DIY business while continuing to invest in our customers in key areas of the business. Specifically, our Commercial Business saw positive sales gains resulting from national and regional account growth, incremental growth in our e-commerce business and continued positive response to our leading e-services offers.","Delivery speed and reliability continue to improve across the board. We continue driving improvements in our market availability and assortment through the support of 374 hub stores and the positive impact from our daily delivery capabilities from our Remington Distribution Center that met our expectations.","Collectively, Advance and AI opened 172 new stores in 2013, a 35-store increase over 2012 openings. The performance of our new stores positions us well as we enter 2014. Concurrently, the integration of 124 BWP stores continues to be on track for completion by mid-2014.","George Sherman joined our company as President in the first half of 2013 to lead the operations and day-to-day execution. His impact has been reflected in our second half results. We made significant strides with in-store execution improvements and took meaningful steps towards improved efficiency and effectiveness within our operating model. George and the team have been simplifying how we run our stores, driving productivity improvements and investing in our team members through comprehensive product and leadership training programs. George will speak more about this shortly.","Overall, from an operational perspective, we are very proud of the progress we made as we remain focused on execution, and the team worked with intensity to deliver our priorities being capped off by a better-than-expected fourth quarter performance.","Financially, we are pleased with our progress towards increasing our profitability as operating income on a comparable basis grew 5.5% in 2013 despite the challenging sales environment. Overall, comp store sales did decline 1.5%. However, total sales grew 4.7% due to the acquisition of BWP and new stores.","Our teams worked diligently to drive year-over-year gross margin improvements of 15 basis points, including the cost of the first full year of operation from our Remington DC that opened in the third quarter of 2012. Collectively, our teams managed expenses and made the necessary edits, which helped drive our operating income results in line with our expectations for the full year.","Turning to 2014. This is arguably the most exciting year in our 80-year history. The past 6 years have targeted growth of our Commercial Business through a series of deliberate, strategic and operational stair-steps. The acquisition of General Parts is a logical next step for Advance as we accelerate our growth strategy and capitalize on the fundamentals and structural shifts in our industry towards Commercial. Collectively, the acquisition of General Parts positions Advance as the largest automotive parts provider in North America.","While being the largest is certainly an accomplishment in its own right, our sights are now set on being the best in the industry. Our primary focus areas in 2014 will be squarely set on successfully delivering on 2 overarching objectives: first, be manically focused on delivering on the core business; and second, the successful execution in 2014 of a multi-year General Parts integration plan.","In 2014, we begin the never-ending mission of being the best. We will build on those successes that have gotten us to where we are today and continue to invest in those areas that will drive our sales growth, customer service excellence and profit outcomes. We are committed to improving our sales outcomes for both DIY and Commercial, through continued focus on our fundamentals, growing our store base, expansion of national and regional accounts, and investing in availability through the additional hubs and supply chain efficiencies.","Our focus on improving our business profitability will leverage on our success in 2013 as we maintain our positive momentum with in-store execution and disciplined expense management. We expect to take meaningful steps in improving our overall customer service by putting our customers first and improving our ability to serve. Supporting that initiative will be our commitment to continue heavily investing in our team members that serve our customers day-in and day-out through relevant and comprehensive training and development.","Notably, our acquisition of General Parts has immediately improved the strength of our overall team. The General Parts team members come with deep commercial industry and institutional experience and knowledge which will complement our overall talent as the teams begin sharing knowledge and experience. We are very excited to work as a combined team, one team in 2014.","An additional area of focus and investment for us in 2014 will be our import business. Today, WORLDPAC, together with Autoparts International, position us as the leader in the import market, the fastest-growing automotive segment. The addressable market for imports continues to grow at a faster rate than domestic vehicles based on vehicle registrations. We will look to accelerate our leadership position in this important segment.","In summary, I am upbeat and grounded in our view of 2014. I remain confident about our industry fundamentals, remaining positive, and appreciate the return of normalized winter season leading to a strong fourth quarter finish, giving us momentum as we enter 2014. That being said, the uneven economic recovery continues to affect the consumer, although modest signs of improvement are expected in 2014 with the anniversary of increased payroll taxes and steady gas prices. We remain balanced and we'll continue to manage our business accordingly as we monitor trends as they unfold throughout the year. We will be clearly focused on delivering on our core business outcomes while successfully integrating the General Parts acquisition. In simple terms, we'll continually improve our operational execution while investing in our capabilities to serve our customers better than anyone else in 2014.","In closing, I would like to recognize a few of the leaders who were instrumental in the General Parts acquisition process. Transactions of this size and nature are complex and require cross-functional and organizational teamwork to successfully execute. I could not be more proud of the team that led the acquisition, which included more leaders than I could possibly name here. Yet the leadership and tireless efforts from several leaders, including Jim Wade, Bill Carter, Temple Sloan III, and David McCartney, were instrumental during the acquisition process. Along with these leaders, I'd like to recognize the human resource, finance and legal teams of each organization for carrying added responsibilities, keeping our focus each day and continuing to deliver great customer experience.","I will now turn the call over to George to update you on the work he is leading on our key priorities that support our 2013 success and outline some of the goals for 2014. George?","George Sherman","Thanks, Darren, and good morning, everyone. First, I'd like to thank our team members for their commitment to customer service while continuing to make progress on our 2013 priorities during the quarter. I'd also like to extend a very warm welcome to the General Parts team members that have now joined the Advance team in 2014. With our closing announcement of the General Parts acquisition, we now have roughly 71,000 talented team members working together, as we look forward to delivering on the tremendous opportunity this acquisition enables while providing the best customer service each day.","With my prepared remarks this morning, I'll provide a view on our fourth quarter sales performance, followed by an update on the key priorities that we focused on within the quarter and the full year. Finally, I'll share my thoughts on the business as we enter 2014.","Looking at our sales, we are very encouraged with our performance in the fourth quarter as the team delivered a positive comparable store sales outcome of 0.1%, a sequential acceleration of at least 200 basis points from Q3 on a 1-year and 2-year basis. Our positive sales performance was attributable to solid execution by our field teams and the continuous improvements we are making to our operational infrastructure, which I'll talk more about in a moment.","In addition, the winter weather trends during the second half of the quarter across our markets generated incremental customer demand in various product categories. Our continued investments and availability and superb execution for our merchant and supply chain teams allow us to be well-positioned to respond to a lifting customer demand.","Our field team accelerated performance in both our DIY and Commercial businesses. Our positive comp sales performance was driven by growth in seasonal categories, driving improvements in both dollars per transaction and sales productivity, with Commercial seeing transaction growth within the quarter. All of our regions accelerated from the third quarter, with notable acceleration being strongest in the Plains and Great Lakes regions, 2 regions that were particularly challenged during the third quarter.","As I mentioned previously, we've been on a mission to transform all operational D&A to one that is focused on outcomes: sales, great customer service and profitability. These outcomes are underpinned by fundamental business priorities and structural changes we have been systematically making to our business in order to position Advance for long-term success. We are continuing to see progress against those priorities, and the changes we are making not only help us deliver the positive results in the fourth quarter but also establish all-important momentum heading into 2014.","I'd now like to update you on our progress against key priorities. But first, I'd like to highlight some areas where we're making positive structural changes. First, we've been hard at work simplifying and streamlining our operating structure and charting the course towards a field-centric operating model. We've been working diligently to decentralize decision-making so that we empower our field team members and effectively push decision-making closer to the customer. This will result in faster decisions that will improve our customer experience, but also allow our field leaders to tailor those decisions and strategies for the individual markets and customer needs.","Second, we continue to put focus each day on improving our in-store execution and building an efficient operating model. As I previously mentioned, we're all in when it comes to investing in our team members through training and development. This is an investment in time and resources, and we're clearly committed to providing our team members with the knowledge, training and tools to equip them to deliver a fantastic customer experience while empowering them to deliver on our core business outcomes. Those business outcomes are now clear and concise and are focused on the most important performance metrics. We have been simplifying our business and removing non-valuated tasks, removing unnecessary reporting, redundant procedures and shifting our team members' time and focus towards being on the sales floor, at the counter or on the phone, engaging with our customers and looking after their needs.","Third, we're developing a model of consistent disciplined execution and accountability. We have held firm to a recipe for success and are now seeing improvement in our core operations that give us confidence going forward. Our move to a positive comp in the fourth quarter was encouraging, but to be clear, we are working towards and aspire for a greater outcome. Turning around sales execution is not an overnight process but rather a series of building blocks, through a consistent execution day-in and day-out. The execution of our field leadership teams and their willingness to accept accountability and affect movement to a field-centric organization has been another brick in the foundation that we continue to build as we head into 2014.","Turning your attention now to update you on other key priorities and business outcomes. Our Commercial Business continued to gain momentum in the fourth quarter with positive comp sales and a Commercial sales mix of 40.4% versus 38.1% in the same quarter last year. Our sales per Commercial program exceeded $700,000 per program. Our supply chain and availability work continues, and I'll take a moment to update you on: one, our Remington Distribution Center; two, our hub store initiatives; and three, updates on our ongoing focus on inventory availability.","As we previously communicated, our goal is to service 400 stores through our Remington distribution facility. I'm happy to announce that we have not only met that objective, but have modestly exceeded it. Of those 400-plus stores being serviced, we have 178 stores that are receiving daily replenishment at the end of the fourth quarter.","We had expanded the assortment of our daily delivery by adding additional categories and providing those service stores with the strongest in-stock positions, and we are increasingly encouraged by the performance of those stores receiving daily delivery as they exceed expectations and continue to show a positive momentum and increased sales lift.","Daily replenishment continues to be a priority for us and aligns with our objective of driving availability and breadth of assortment. Further expansion of the daily delivery program will be considered in conjunction with a more holistic distribution network assessment study we'll be conducting in light of our recent acquisition and the 38 new General Parts distribution centers we will now operate.","Second, our work continues towards improvement of in-market availability. A key component of this is our hub store strategy. During the quarter, we added 4 hub stores either through new stores or the upgrade of existing stores, strategically located to operate these hubs. And at the end of the quarter, our store count was 374, an increase of 35 from the fourth quarter of last year.","Third, as we look at inventory, our inventory growth was up 10.7% year-over-year, primarily due to the increase in new store openings, our acquisition of BWP, our increase in hub stores and the ramp-up of our Remington Distribution Center. We also continue to drive improvements in our availability as we look to make strategic investments that get the parts closest to the customer.","Looking at our new store growth during the quarter, we added 55 new Advance Auto Parts stores that bring our new store count over the past 12 months to 172. The performance of our 2012 and 2013 class of stores continue to perform at or above our expectations, primarily driven by a faster ramp-up of Commercial Business from previous classes of stores.","We are once again pleased with the performance of our Autopart International business. The fourth quarter performance was once again led by strong execution, driving strong top line sales growth and diligent expense management, resulting in strong bottom line performance. Heading into 2014, we're excited about the continued growth of our leadership position in imports.","Integration of the 124 BWP stores progressed largely as expected in the fourth quarter. We remain on plan to complete integration by mid-2014, consistent with the timeframe previously communicated at the beginning of the fiscal year. As of the fourth quarter, we successfully converted or consolidated a total of 33 stores and continue to capture the integration learnings which will be leveraged as we enter into our large integration of General Parts beginning in 2014.","As we think about 2014, it's important to recognize where we have come from and where we are going. Since we began Advance 80 years ago, we've been on a continuous journey of growth, and we couldn't be more proud of our accomplishments. Fast-forward to today and we're now the biggest in the industry. However, as exciting as that is, we aspire for more.","In 2014, we are focused on the journey towards being the best. The 2 overarching priorities for us in 2014 will be: first, to maintain an uncompromising focus on our core operations and delivering the best service to our customers; second, to successfully integrate the General Parts acquisition and achieve the benefits we conveyed at the time we announced the acquisition.","We are clear on the absolute importance of successfully integrating the companies and minimizing the distraction factor to our core businesses. Of paramount importance was to keep our integration team and processes distinctly separate from our core day-to-day run of the business team to mitigate such distraction risk. Therefore, we'll be assigning a team to deliver the integration led by Bill Carter, Senior Vice President on our Advance leadership team. Bill brings an immeasurable level of experience to the table. From his combined experience, both prior to Advance while at Bain Consulting, where he led the Sterne Agee work in auto aftermarkets, post-merger integration and program execution, but also with Advance, where he has been instrumental in our Commercial strategy and the integration of our acquisition of BWP stores.","This team will also include members from General Parts, which will provide not only deep institutional knowledge, but a forum for sharing the best practices within the group.","We are pleased with our performance in 2013 as we made significant strides in our execution framework and drove strong sales performance in our fourth quarter. Our work on great execution will continue to build off our successes this past year, and we will continue to invest in and focus on the fundamentals. That begins first with our team. It starts with continuing focus on strong hiring, training and development, performance management and building on our work of developing a field-centric culture; next, concentrating on growth of our sales and service capabilities from national account growth, expanding our e-services offering, growing penetration of our Commercial credit program and our B2B platform; third, continuing to work to support availability-driven growth through a continued expansion of our hub stores and the inventory optimization as we look to continue improvement of in-stocks, and as I mentioned earlier, getting inventory where it matters most, closest to the customers.","A key fundamental, and central to our overarching mission, will be a continuing -- will be continuing to focus on our customers and invest in those areas that will improve our ability to serve each and every day.","In closing, I'd like to take a moment to communicate how thrilled I am to welcome 2 exceptionally talented leaders to my team: David McCartney and Al Wheeler. David McCartney will serve as President of our CARQUEST operations and has been associated with General Parts for 27 years, leading almost every aspect of the organization over his career. He has a passion for creating and enabling teams that focus on success for the organization as well as for our customers.","Al Wheeler will serve as our Senior Vice President of our combined Commercial Business. Al has been with CARQUEST for over 30 years, and brings a rich experience set that will undoubtedly position us to accelerate our combined Commercial Business. Welcome to the team, David and Al.","I'm excited about our synergy and the combined capabilities that we'll now bring to bear in the marketplace. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Mike Norona, our Chief Financial Officer.","Michael A. Norona","Thanks, George, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start by thanking all of our talented and dedicated team members for their commitment to serving our customers in 2013 and the better-than-expected finish they led us to in our fourth quarter. I would also like to sincerely welcome all the new team members from General Parts to the Advance team as we successfully closed the transaction on January 2, 2014.","We entered 2014 with both momentum and excitement from this combination, which will allow us to leverage our new size and scale, combined capabilities and a team of roughly 71,000 talented team members to create value for our shareholders, customers and team members in 2014.","I plan to cover the following topics with you this morning: one, provide some financial highlights from our fourth quarter of 2013; two, put our fourth quarter and full year results into context with our expectations and key financial priorities we use to measure our performance; and three, share with you our financial outlook for 2014.","As a point of clarity, my commentary this morning regarding the 2013 financial performance will be solely related to Advance Auto Parts. The General Parts acquisition closed subsequent to our fiscal year end and we will begin consolidated reporting and commentary beginning with the first quarter of 2014. In addition, the 2013 results I will be speaking to, unless otherwise specified, will be on a comparable basis which excludes the impacts of BWP integration expenses and excludes any one-time transaction costs associated with the acquisition of General Parts.","We began this year by communicating our 2013 EPS full year guidance of $5.45 to $5.60, excluding BWP integration costs, and we are pleased to have exceeded those expectations with a comparable EPS of $5.67, an 8.6% increase from 2012. This was driven by improvements in our operating profit performance as a result of both an increase in our gross profit rate and disciplined expense management. We are encouraged by the improvements in our operational execution, leading to a strong finish in the fourth quarter.","On a GAAP basis, our 2013 EPS was $5.32, which included $0.07 of BWP integration costs for the year, including $0.03 in Q4 and $0.28 of transaction expenses, including $0.24 in Q4 associated with the acquisition of General Parts. At the start of the year, we estimated BWP integration costs would be $0.15 to $0.20. However, the actual integration costs of $0.07 came in under that estimate due to both the pacing of the integration and our actual expenses coming in lower than original estimates. We remain on track to complete the integration by approximately the end of our second quarter.","Turning to sales. Our fourth quarter sales increased 6% to $1.4 billion, driven by the net addition of 151 new stores over the past 12 months, the acquisition of BWP, and a comparable same-store sales increase of 0.1%. Our positive comp store sales are attributable to the extreme winter weather in the back half of the quarter, combined with the strong execution from our retail and supply chain teams. Our total sales for fiscal 2013 increased 4.7% to $6.5 billion, and our full year comp store sales decreased 1.5%.","Our fourth quarter gross profit rate decreased 8 basis points to 49.8% versus 49.9% in Q4 of 2012. The 8 basis-point decrease in gross profit rate was the result of a higher mix of Commercial, which has a lower gross profit rate, driven primarily by the acquisition of BWP, partially offset by increased merchandising margins due to lower acquisition costs and improvements in supply chain efficiencies. Our Commercial mix represented 40.6% of 2013 sales versus 38.1% last year. For the year, our gross profit rate increased 15 basis points to 50.1%.","Our fourth quarter comparable SG&A rate of 41.7% increased 36 basis points versus fourth quarter of 2012, driven by higher incentive compensation and increased new store openings. As shared on our third quarter earnings call, the higher incentive comp was the result of better operating income performance this year versus last year as we anniversary lower incentive compensation in Q4 last year. This was partially offset by lower administrative support costs, specifically less professional fees and increased labor productivity. For the year, our comparable SG&A rate increased 7 basis points to 39.4% versus 39.3% over the same period last year, driven by higher incentive compensation, fixed cost deleverage due to the same-store sales decline, and the increase in new store openings.","All in, on a comparable basis, our fourth quarter operating income dollars increased 0.6% to $113.8 million, and our operating income rate decreased 44 basis points over the same period last year to 8.1%. Our diluted earnings per share on a comparable basis increased $0.06 to $0.94 during the quarter versus $0.88 in the fourth quarter last year. For the year, on a comparable basis, our operating income dollars increased 5.5% to $693.3 million, and our diluted EPS increased 8.6% to $5.67. Our average diluted share count was 73.2 million shares for the quarter and 73.4 million shares for the full year.","For the year, free cash flow was $183.1 million, a decline of 55.6% versus $412.3 million over the same period last year. Excluding the acquisition of BWP, free cash flow was $350.2 million, a $62.1 million decrease from 2012, driven by an increase in owned inventory, partially offset by a lower increase in accounts receivable. Our inventory increased 10.7%, primarily driven by our increase in new stores, our acquisition of BWP, investments in hubs, and our Remington DC. Our accounts payable to inventory ratio now stands at 85.3% versus 87.9% in 2012, and we continue our focus on driving continued AP ratio improvement on our new post-acquisition consolidated base in 2014.","At the end of the fourth quarter, we had $1.1 billion in cash and $1.1 billion of long-term debt on our balance sheet. The increase in our fourth quarter cash position was largely driven by the proceeds of our $450 million bond issuance as part of our financing plan in preparation for the close of the acquisition of General Parts.","As we embark upon this next strategic growth step of our business, our financial principles remain unchanged. We will continue to measure our financial performance through the financial priorities of growth, profitability and value creation. Our approach and philosophy has always been to prioritize growth as our primary use of capital in order to increase returns and drive shareholder value. The General Parts acquisition accelerates our Commercial growth, which is and continues to be the growth engine of the company, and positions us as the leader in the market, creating a pathway for further growth by opening up attractive new channel opportunities, diversifying and expanding our customer base and enhancing our geographic presence. It will also give us an expanded footprint to expand our DIY business.","Turning to profit. Advance has been on a mission to improve profitability, and we are pleased with the progress made in 2013 with our 5.5% increase in operating profit dollars on a comparable basis, driven by our gross profit improvements, increased labor productivity and our disciplined expense management, specifically in reductions we made in our administrative support costs. Looking forward, our mission to improve profitability will continue with the General Parts acquisition and delivering on the estimated $160 million of cost synergies, primarily through the areas of procurement, as well as corporate, store and supply chain efficiencies.","With respect to value creation, the General Parts transaction provides a compelling opportunity to drive shareholder returns through growth in our business that will drive incremental operating profit, earnings and cash flows. From a capital structure standpoint, we are committed to paying down our debt to get back to a maximum ceiling leverage ratio of 2.5x and maintaining our investment-grade ratings. Our investment-grade ratings will help us to make continued improvements in our combined AP ratio with GPI.","I'd like to now discuss our 2014 annual outlook. To begin, I'd like to share 4 guiding principles that underline the basis of our outlook. One, the 2014 annual outlook is being provided on a total consolidated basis, combining Advance Auto Parts and General Parts results, given we see our combination with GPI as an integrated expansion of our Commercial assets and capabilities to grow with our existing customers and attract new ones. To assist you in understanding the outlook, we are providing you with the following 2013 estimated comparable consolidated information, including General Parts, which was used to develop our 2014 annual outlook.","2013 full year sales is estimated between $9.4 billion and $9.5 billion. 2013 full year gross profit is estimated between 45.5% and 46% of sales. And 2013 full year SG&A is estimated between 36.5% and 37% of sales.","This 2013 comparable consolidated information has been provided solely for guidance purposes and represents Advance's current estimate and is subject to change pending the finalization of the close for GPI's 2013 year.","Two, in 2014, Advance will also include results on a comparable cash EPS basis. Subsequent to the acquisition of General Parts, the company believes this non-GAAP information is significant to understanding trends and is important in analyzing the company's operating results and earnings and is providing this information to investors to assist in performing analysis of the company's operating results.","Three, 2014 will be a 53-week fiscal year for Advance. However, the financial outlook provided today is based on a 42 -- 52-week fiscal year.","Four, due to the timing of the General Parts acquisition close, we are still in the process of working through accounting elements of the acquisition and as a result, certain components within our annual outlook discussed today may change. We will continue to advise you of such changes throughout the year.","Looking at 2014, we expect the strong industry fundamentals to continue and are encouraged by the sustained strong winter weather patterns and unseasonably cooler temperatures that have contributed to a good start to sales this year. However, it is still early, and we remain balanced in our view due to the challenging year we just completed and persistent uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment continuing to affect the consumer. As a result, we anticipate our comp store sales to be in the range of flat to low single-digits.","As a reminder of our policy, stores are included in our comp store sales calculation once a store has been open for 13 complete accounting periods or approximately 1 year. Therefore, our comp store sales in 2014 will include Advance, BWP and Autopart International. Stores will exclude any General Parts locations.","Turning to new stores. We plan to collectively open 120 to 140 new Advance Auto Parts stores, Autopart International stores and WORLDPAC branches. We will also continue the work of integrating the remaining BWP stores by the middle of 2014.","Turning to gross profit rate. Excluding the impact of achieved synergies, we expect to see some improvement in 2014, combined entity gross profit rate driven by improved merchandise margins due to lower acquisition costs, increased global sourcing and improvements in supply chain efficiencies, partially offset by a higher mix of overall Commercial sales, which has a lower gross profit rate.","Looking at SG&A, we expect our SG&A for the combined entity, excluding the impact of achieved synergies, to remain essentially flat, driven by new store growth, annualization of new stores in 2013, and somewhat offset by improved labor productivity and improvements in our administrative support costs.","Moving on to synergies. Consistent with our acquisition announcement, we have estimated total run rate cost synergies of $160 million by approximately the end of the third year post-close of the acquisition and expect to achieve approximately $45 million to $55 million in synergy realization in 2014.","Also, as per acquisition announcement, we have estimated total one-time expenses to achieve synergies to be approximately $190 million over a 5-year period, with the majority of the costs being incurred within the first 3 years. We expect to incur approximately $55 million to $65 million in expenses to achieve synergies in 2014.","Turning to capital expenditures. We expect our capital expenditures to be approximately $325 million to $350 million, driven by new store development, supply chain investments, store systems and approximately $50 million to $60 million in capital related to the integration of General Parts. We expect free cash flow to be a minimum of $450 million, excluding the acquisition of General Parts.","As mentioned earlier, our BWP integration program will continue in 2014, as we expect to complete the process by approximately the middle of 2014. We estimate our BWP integration expenses to be approximately $12 million to $15 million for the year. And as a reminder, our outlook is based on a 52-week basis.","All in, we expect our 2014 annual comparable cash EPS outlook to be in the range of $7.20 to $7.40 per share. As a reminder, and as further detailed in our press release, this estimate includes synergies of $45 million to $55 million related to the acquisition of GPI, excludes the amortization of intangibles -- assets associated with the acquisition of GPI, excludes the impact of the 53rd week in fiscal 2014, excludes one-time integration costs associated with the continued integration of BWP, and excludes one-time expenses to achieve synergies related to the acquisition of GPI.","In closing, we are pleased with our comparable operating profit improvement in 2013, along with the positive momentum we carry into 2014. We expect 2014 to be historic, and we are confident about our future as we begin the journey of integrating General Parts and continue to improve on our base business.","I want to again welcome the new General Parts team members to the Advance team, and thank our entire team for what they do every day to serve our customers, inspire our team members and grow our company.","Operator, we are now ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question today is from Gary Balter with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Gary Balter - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just a -- you've owned BWP now for a little while, and that's the closest you've come in terms of having an in-depth knowledge of GPI. Could you talk about the learnings, and recognizing that's a little bit of a different situation because of the franchisee owning other franchisees? Can you talk about what you learn from the way they operate that gives you confidence in terms of things you could apply from GPII or other areas to Advance to improve performance going forward?","Darren R. Jackson","Yes, Gary. This is Darren. So there's a handful of things we learned. First of all, we learned, culturally, we're very similar to the -- whether it's GPI or BWP, and that early on, the work really is to retain the people that are serving our customers. What we've seen in the first 12 months is that our retention levels after acquisition were actually better than the year before. So the team members would clearly have a level of excitement about that. I would say the other thing that we learned is that we had to do some product transitions, and there were some product categories that the customer was very familiar with and very supportive of with their customers, and those product transitions went just fine. So we had to transition into some Advance private label product. We had to transition some of our belts programs and the stocking programs, and our retention levels were very good in terms of just product transitions. Three, it's not simply a real estate transaction that will take 1 of 3 types of transitions with BWP. I would tell you that the one that we're seeing just outstanding results with are the ones where we consolidate a BWP into the backroom of an AAP, what we call tuck and folds. It seemed to be working really well. We're retaining the revenues in much better rates than what we thought, and we're retaining the team members and the customers. There doesn't seem to be any customer retention challenges. Now if we move a little further down the road, we'll lose a little bit of business from those closest to us, but overall, it's exceeded our expectations. I'd tell you the conversions are just a little trickier. I would say those are meeting our expectations. There's fewer of those, and that's when we take an existing BWP and essentially inject a DIY business into it. And what happens is there's a lot more change management with that. And so I don't think it's a technical challenge. And one of the challenges we did have is that you have to put an AAP system because the legacy explorer system, which is the CARQUEST system, was going away. And one of the advantages we see of now owning GPI is that we have access to both systems now, so the change management curve isn't as challenging in some of those conversions overall. And I would say the fourth thing that we've learned overall is that positioning this integration with an integration team that's fully dedicated, we finished, what, 33 by the end of this year. We'll finish them all by the middle of next year. We're using that same integration team. Obviously, we'll have to augment it. And it's like anything in life, you learn with each one that you do, and we're able to execute them a little more seamlessly with each one we get done. That gives me more confidence in terms of how we're positioning for the overall GPI integration.","Operator","The next question is from Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","My primary question relates to synergies. So you quantified the year end number and it sounds like you're looking to book these ratably over the 3 years. Can you talk about the qualitative buckets that you would expect to access earlier in the integration process, whether one or the others is weighted more heavily in year 1 versus year 3.","Michael A. Norona","Hey, Matt, it's Mike. So as we said, we expect to generate $160 million in synergies over the 3 years, and we guided to the range of $45 million to $55 million in 2014. If you break out those, the breakout of the synergies we talked about was purchasing or procurement, as we said in the script; scale and leverage, I'm sure kind of cost synergies; and then supply chain. So kind of the cadence around that, we would expect in 2014 to see some of the purchasing synergies a little bit earlier and also some of the scale and leverage. And then the supply chain, just given now, we're putting our -- their 38 DCs together with our 12 DCs and now 50 DCs, and we've got some studies to do there. The supply chain would come later on in that 3-year journey. But the ones you're going to see this year are going to be more from the purchasing categories and the synergies there, and then -- and some cost synergies.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That's very helpful. And then just by the way, a very quick follow-up. Thank you for quantifying the EPS impact of the extra week. Should we think about the sales impact of that week just as we build up the model as being sort of an average week in your fiscal fourth quarter? Or would there be a reason to think of it differently?","Michael A. Norona","Exactly, Matt. And if that changes, and throughout the year, we'll give you that. It's just difficult to predict 1 week, especially in the fourth quarter just given the volatile that you sometimes see with the weather, but I think the assumption you've made is exactly what I would do.","Operator","Our next question today comes from Greg Melich with ISI Group.","Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I wanted to follow up a little bit on the cash flow and the CapEx investments you've done. Mike, could you highlight what portion of the cost of the integration are cash versus noncash, and also put that in the context of the CapEx going forward, whether it's the run rate we should expect or does it go up as you start to figure out supply chain?","Michael A. Norona","Yes. So first of all, virtually all of those costs that we talked about of $190 million are all -- virtually all cash costs. So -- and then -- and we...","Darren R. Jackson","P&L costs.","Michael A. Norona","P&L costs, and then the -- and then we've kind of broken out the capital separate. So when we -- so you can see when we guided this year, we guided our total capital lease year for $325 million to $350 million, and we said roughly $50 million to $60 million of that is related to the acquisition. Things like IT capital, conversion capital, stores, supply chain systems, so those are some of the capital buckets. And then some of the cost buckets, if you're interested in some of those buckets, I think that was your question, Greg, is we've got project costs, transition costs. Early on, we've got retention and severance costs, conversion costs and then the last big bucket is IT costs. So that gives you just the kind of the P&L versus capital.","Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","And maybe if you could just tie that into the $450 million or more of free cash flow, I think you said that was x GPI. Presumably, that's x the GPI costs? Or that $450 million, that's consolidated?","Michael A. Norona","Yes, that's an all-in -- so the cash flow number's an all-in number. The free cash flow number that we got it to, the minimum $450 million, that's an all-in number.","Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And included in that would be any working capital benefits, and if you have any guidance on that, and then I'll let you go.","Michael A. Norona","Yes, it would be, Greg.","Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And how much working capital do you think we could get?","Michael A. Norona","We haven't shared that out, but that's a good one.","Darren R. Jackson","Yes. And Greg, those build over time. I think we've had our first vendor meeting this week. So...","Michael A. Norona","I mean, Greg, just to give you a little bit of clarity. I mean, the one thing that we said in the announcement of the deal, and I'll share with you again, is maintaining our investment-grade ratings was important. That will help us as we continue to improve our AP ratio. We see some opportunities with GPI. They have a lower AP ratio than we do in their base part of the GPI basis, excluding the WORLDPAC part, and we see some great opportunities improving that working capital through AP ratio with our investment-grade ratings. But it's still too early to tell and provide any further guidance than that.","Operator","And we do have time for one more question from Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets.","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Can you give us a concrete example of how you plan to leverage the capabilities and relationships that you kind of brought on board from GPI into the Advance store base? And then just kind of, hopefully it's a sidebar, how close are you to making any kind of meaningful decisions on store and DC consolidation plans?","George Sherman","Yes, Scot. I'll give you 2 examples on GPI. Last weekend, I was in Orlando with members of my senior management team, meeting with the TECH-NET customers and meeting with the independent channel customers. The TECH-NET customers, there's 5,300 of them, and they tend to be more of the large bay garages. If you look at the Motor Age, they -- the #1 garage in the country this year was the Pellman garage in Colorado Springs, and that's a TECH-NET customer. And so one of the things Advance did not develop is its own auto care program for garages. We don't need to. The TECH-NET program is 17 years old. Al Wheeler, who George spoke about earlier, has been with CARQUEST 17 years and helped build that program from the ground up. And we see that as a tremendous asset that we would build upon with all the assets of GPI. The other one is CARQUEST Technical Institute. They're a training institute, and to that point, the WORLDPAC Training Institute goes out. And when they train installers, it's not just training them on new technical things, but how to run a business. We could run those programs 52 weeks a year and have them sold out. Those are not capabilities that we build to help our -- our installers are more e-commerce-based. And conversely, our Moto shop suite are owned assets that we will offer through the CARQUEST organization and sales teams. So those are just 2 simple ones. I think as to the supply chain, I'll just say this at this point. We're just too early. We recently engaged a third party to help work with us. The LNO study has just begun, and the color on that will be forthcoming later this year.","Operator","And that's all the time we have for questions. I will now turn the call back to management for any final comments.","Darren R. Jackson","Thank you, Wendy, and thanks to our audience for participating in our third quarter earnings conference call. If you have additional questions, please call me at (952) 715-5097. Reporters, please contact Shelly Whitaker at (540) 561-8452. That concludes our call.","Operator","Thank you.

Jackson","Thanks, Zaheed. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter conference call. I'd like to start off by thanking our 54,000 team members for their hard work and commitment to better serve our customers and grow our business. Joining me on the call today is our President, George Sherman, who'll provide you with an update on our 2013 priorities; and Mike Norona, our Chief Financial Officer, who will update you on our financials.","As you're aware, 2 weeks ago we announced that we entered into an agreement to acquire General Parts. We are excited about this transaction and the opportunity it presents for both organizations' shareholders and over 70,000 team members. As we said, this combination will position Advance as the largest automotive aftermarket provider of parts, accessories, batteries and maintenance items in North America.","Strategically, it provides us with a compelling opportunity to expand our geographical presence, channels of distribution and commercial capabilities to better serve customers and deliver value to shareholders. We anticipate the closing of the transaction late this year or early in 2014.","Lastly and importantly, due to the pending close of the transaction, we will limit our comments relative to the General Parts acquisition to the information that we have already shared publicly.","Now let's review our third quarter results and the work our team has been doing and will continue to do as we move forward. Our total sales increased 4.3% for the third quarter. And earnings per share increased 17.4%. While we are pleased with our earnings performance, we are not satisfied with our 2% comparable store sales decline. The decline was driven by our DIY business and partially offset by a modest increase in our commercial sales.","The sequential decline in our business from the second quarter results was, however, consistent with the slowdown in the overall market growth. The overall market continues to face headwinds from a backdrop of limited consumer spending as the consumer appraisal of the economic conditions continues to affect consumer confidence.","Specifically, the market softness we witnessed in July and early August continued through the third quarter. We continue to deal with several unfavorable macro factors, including a very apprehensive consumer that is navigating uncertainty with our government, healthcare reform and a very uneven economic recovery. The result is consumers are only performing repairs that are absolutely necessary to keep their vehicles on the road.","Consequently, deferred maintenance remains at record levels. The short-term volatility is evident as the overall aftermarket growth slowed in the third quarter compared to the second quarter.","Additionally, looking within Advance's competitive set, we continue to see our competitors intensifying their efforts to drive growth, resulting in more new stores in our footprint. This proliferation of stores and commercial programs in this slow growth period dilutes sales, with over 80% of the new store growth from our competitors occurring in our footprint over the last 12 months.","Our comparable store sales shortfall was offset by improvements in our gross margin and disciplined expense control in the quarter as we proactively managed the business and made the necessary adjustments to conform to the market.","The team effectively managed our gross profit rate to 50.2%, which was 42 basis points greater than Q3 last year despite continuing headwinds from the full operations of our new Remington distribution facility and the acquisition of BWP, which has a higher mix of commercial sales.","Similarly, our diligent expense management resulted in an SG&A rate of 39% in the quarter. The rate improved 49 basis points in the third quarter versus Q3 last year. We saw improvements across numerous areas of the business. Notably, we saw lower administrative and support costs, lower marketing expenses and improved labor productivity while absorbing higher incentive costs versus a year ago.","In addition to the consumer macro factors I discussed earlier, we are witnessing structural change within the industry. We continue to see divergence in the growth patterns between DIY and commercial markets.","Even looking at current market trends, we see a variance differential. Specifically, the market deceleration from Q2 to Q3 this year was led by a 400 basis point decline in DIY versus a 200 basis point decline in commercial amid the continuing consumer concerns. Looking ahead, we believe the addressable commercial market is $40 billion, which is nearly double the size of the addressable DIY market and growing at 2x the rate of DIY.","In response to these macro factors and structural market shifts, we are managing our business forward accordingly. First, we are matching our expenses to the economic conditions within the industry. More specifically, we are managing our cost to the slower sales environment and making pragmatic trade-offs as we balance profitable management of our important DIY business while following the consumer and market trends by continuing to invest in commercial.","Second, we continue to evolve our business to the market trends and make specific investments to capitalize on the fundamentals of our industry, which remain positive. I'll speak more about this in a moment. Our strategy over the last 6 years has targeted growth of our commercial business through a series of deliberate stair steps.","Our strategic intent hasn't changed. Today, approximately 40% of our business is commercial. We have reached this point today through organic growth, as well as through regional acquisitions, most notably with our AI acquisition, and we are also seeing success early on with BWP.","Looking ahead, the pending acquisition of General Parts is another strategic stair step for Advance as we accelerate our growth strategy. Ultimately, these underlying consumer shifts, coupled with industry fundamentals, are the core indicators that point to a stable environment for growth. Specifically, the average age of vehicles has a clip [ph] of 11 years, with approximately 80% of the vehicles over 6 years old.","Deferred maintenance has reached record levels. And the increasing complexity of vehicles and parts is prompting customers to entrust complex repairs with independent repair facilities. These customer shifts and fundamentals position Advance to deliver incremental growth while increasing our overall share of the customer's purchases.","Despite the near-term sales slowdown, we remain committed to growing our business and profitability through the consistent focus on service leadership and superior availability strategies. We continue to stay the course on our company of one focusing on the fundamentals as our core objective that will guide us for the foreseeable future.","For the last number of years, our team was clear that we needed to invest in what the customers wanted most. As a result, we have strong availability, enhanced delivery capabilities, more technology, more talent, and we're in the best position we've ever been in to serve customers.","Today, our priorities will continue to include commercial growth, parts availability and improving execution and productivity. George will discuss the work going on in these priorities shortly.","Overall, despite challenging sales, I'm encouraged with the progress on the fundamentals and execution as an organization. Great execution is a trademark for all organizations that sustain the balance of structural and motivational initiatives leading to profitable outcomes, sales being just one part of that outcome.","Beyond sales, a number of other elements must come together successfully to drive profitable outcomes. And our team has again demonstrated evidence of strong execution through our gross profit rate improvements, in addition to effectively managing costs, which resulted in a 91 basis point improvement in our operating income this quarter.","As we head into the fourth quarter, we remain cautious with our sales outlook based on the current market trends. This view of our business for the remainder of the year is reflected in the outlook Mike will discuss a little later.","Internally, we continue to remain focused on our strategies and are confident in our team's abilities as we work diligently to drive improved sales outcomes. Looking ahead, I'm excited about the opportunities that lie ahead for our team members, our customers and our shareholders as I look forward to the combination with General Parts, where our execution of the fundamentals that I spoke of earlier will be the cornerstone for success as we go forward.","In closing, I'd like to share an example of how growth and focus on the fundamentals brings service as our best part to life. Regional Vice President, Rich Flaherty, is a leader who has developed a store environment where all team members work together to serve our customers no matter what they need, enables partnerships with our field operations and commercial teams that are solutions-oriented. They truly focus on solving customer service issues to ensure we're always exceeding the customers expectations.","Rich and his team have worked tirelessly to build an internal bench of high-performance team members at all levels. Rich communicates very effectively through market meetings with his GMs, PPPs to ensure they're all well aware of the keys to driving the business and have in place ways to remove barriers from serving the customers. Rich, I commend you and your leadership, and thank you for the great work your team is producing.","I will now turn the call over to George to update you on the work he is leading on our key priorities that support our 2013 objectives.","George Sherman","Thanks, Darren, and good morning, everyone. First, I'd like to thank our over 54,000 team members for their commitment to customer service while making progress on our 2013 priorities during the quarter. Additionally, I'd also like to express my excitement over our pending acquisition of General Parts and the tremendous opportunity that we have before us as a result of this transaction.","I'll now provide you with an update of the key priorities that support our 2013 objectives of growth and focus on the fundamentals. First, Commercial Business has been and will continue to be a key priority and the primary growth focus of the company. We continue to intensify our focus on executing against the integrated model strategy comprised of DIY and Commercial.","Although the commercial market growth rate is outpacing the DIY market, DIY remains an important part of our business, our profitability and our go-forward strategy. And despite the industry-wide slowdown in traffic, through our focus and solid team effort we saw notable growth in the third quarter in our dollars per transaction.","In the quarter, our Commercial Business continued to see improved levels of delivery speed and reliability and increased customer retention and share wallet with national and regional customers. Our national and regional accounts growth approached double digits during the third quarter due to our strength and availability and delivery speed, growth in commercial credit card penetration resulting from our in-source credit program and dedicated focus on strengthening relationships with commercial customers.","Overall, we are pleased with our commercial program productivity, generating $700,000 per program all-in between Advance, BWP and Autopart International stores.","In addition, we are pleased with the leading e-services offerings that we have for our commercial customers. Our B2B e-commerce business grew roughly 50% in the quarter as we continued to advance our capabilities and improve the breadth of services we offer to our customers.","We have also rebranded our motor shop suite of services, highlighting Advance's commitment to providing an innovative and holistic customer experience through continued investment and product development, new technologies and customer service.","Second, our work continues toward improvement of in-market availability. A key component of this is our hub store strategy. During the quarter, we added 16 hub stores either through new store openings or the upgrade of existing stores strategically located to operate as hubs. At the end of the quarter, our hub store count was 370, an increase of 42 from the third quarter last year.","We also continue to work on our daily replenishment capabilities at our Remington DC. As previously stated, we anticipate 400 stores will be serviced by Remington, with approximately 45% of those stores receiving daily replenishment by the end of fiscal 2013.","SKU assortments in stores receiving daily replenishment have increased over 1,600 SKUs from the same time period last year as daily replenishment allows us to carry a larger breadth of inventory. Since we deployed our rapid replenishment capability, performance of stores receiving daily delivery have outpaced our control stores within the region, driven by parts categories. We are still in relatively early stages, and we'll continue to monitor results before we can draw any definitive conclusions.","And third, we are working tirelessly on improving business performance through effective execution and enhanced productivity, overlaid by an efficient operating model. We're relentlessly committed to simplifying our operations by reducing tasks and improving process in our stores so our team members have more time to focus on engaging with the customer. This focus has started to yield outcomes as we significantly improved our sales per hour performance during the quarter.","Broadly speaking, we continue to simplify our field priorities while strengthening our operational DNA [ph] and reorienting our field teams toward profitable sales outcomes versus being a task-based team. When I refer to outcomes, I'm referring holistically to intensifying our customer experience, our customer satisfaction levels and our sales and operating income performance. We are already starting to see positive steps taken in this direction with our expense control and gross margin improvement contributions over the past several quarters.","We're also investing in our team members. We remain on course with DIY and continue moving closer and closer toward a more balanced model between DIY and Commercial. This type of evolution requires both an operational and a cultural shift in order to be successful. We are investing in our field leaders and supporting their individual journey within our dual model environment. We are providing our team members with the training and tools to equip them to deliver on those outcomes I referred to earlier.","Notably this year, we've implemented new general manager onboarding and district leader training programs. These programs are geared toward developing our leaders consistently on the fundamental principles of effectively coaching and leading our team members, providing the best experience for our customers and effective management of their stores and districts.","Turning to new stores. During the quarter, we added 35 new Advance Auto Parts stores, keeping us on track for our new store opening plan this year. The performance of our 2012 and 2013 classes of stores continue to perform at or above our expectations, primarily driven by a faster ramp-up of Commercial Business than previous classes of stores.","We are pleased with the performance of our Autopart International business. The solid third quarter performance was led by strong execution, driving double-digit top line sales growth and diligent expense management resulting in strong bottom line performance.","We are well into the formal process of integrating our BWP stores and remain on plan to complete the integration of 124 BWP stores into Advance Auto Parts stores by mid-2014, consistent with the time frame previously communicated at the beginning of the fiscal year.","The sales and profitability of the BWP stores are currently exceeding our expectations. Most importantly, during the transition, we are remaining focused on employee retention and customer service. As of the third quarter, we successfully converted or consolidated the first 9 stores. And I've learned a lot from the integration process, and now expect to complete approximately 30% of the stores by year-end. Despite fewer conversions and consolidations than originally anticipated this year, we remain on track to complete the process on time.","Collectively, our company priorities remain consistently focused on operations that drive results, led by a focus on delivering on our customer promise and enabled through outstanding and consistent execution. Additionally, looking ahead, we could not be more excited about the future growth opportunities for the great work that our teams are already driving forward and with the pending acquisition of General Parts.","To be clear, as we prepare to undertake the integration of General Parts post-close, we will be focused to ensure our integration efforts are closely aligned with our operations while continuing to flawlessly execute and deliver the best customer service throughout the process.","I've thoroughly enjoyed my first 6 months with Advance. I look forward to continuing to update you on these important priorities in the future as we continue our focus on commercial to build deeper relationships with our core customers and work diligently to drive and improve sales outcome.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Mike Norona, our Chief Financial Officer.","Michael A. Norona","Thanks, George, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start by thanking all of our talented team members for their continued efforts to improve our business and serve our customers as we navigated through our third quarter. I would also like to say how excited we are about our future partnership with the General Parts team and the transformational opportunities it presents for value creation.","I plan to cover the following topics with you this morning: one, provide some financial highlights for our third quarter of 2013; two, put our third quarter results into context with our expectations and key financial dimensions we use to measure our performance; and three, provide some insights on the remainder of 2013 and how we're thinking about 2014.","As we shared on our second quarter earnings call, sales began to soften during the last 6 weeks of the quarter. And that softness continued through the third quarter. We believe this continued softness was primarily as a result of the ongoing challenging macroeconomic environment.","While we are disappointed with the negative comp store sales, we are pleased with our operating profit performance. Operating profits grew 13.5% versus third quarter last year and were in line with our expectations, driven by both an increase in the gross profit rate and disciplined expense management, resulting in a 91 basis point increase in our operating income rate to 11.2% for the quarter.","We remain focused on influencing the things that are in our direct control and positioning our company for longer-term growth and profitability. While we are pleased with our bottom line results during the quarter, we realize in order to continue our profit expansion, we must improve our sales performance while continuing the disciplined spending we've exhibited over the last 3 quarters.","As a result of the weaker consumer demand, our comp store sales decreased 2% compared to the third quarter of last year. Our total sales, however, increased 4.3% to $1.5 billion, driven by the impact of the acquisition of BWP and the net addition of 170 new stores over the past 12 months.","Our comp store sales decrease was driven by a decline in the number of transactions, partially offset by an increase in the dollars per transaction. The decline in transactions was primarily in DIY, while the dollars per transaction increased in both DIY and Commercial, with a larger increase in Commercial.","Year-to-date, our total sales increased 4.3% to $5.1 billion. And our comp store sales declined 2%. Our gross profit rate in the third quarter was 50.2% versus 49.8% in the third quarter of 2012 or an increase of 42 basis points. The increase was primarily due to higher merchandise margins, driven by a lower product acquisition cost, partially offset by planned increases in supply chain costs associated with the operation of our Remington DC and the impact of BWP sales, which have a lower gross margin rate due to the higher mix of commercial sales. Through the third quarter, our gross profit rate increased 22 basis points to 50.2% from 49.9% over the same period last year.","Our SG&A rate of 39% decreased 49 basis points versus third quarter of 2012, primarily driven by lower marketing expense, improved labor productivity and lower administrative and support costs. These were partially offset by onetime costs related to the pending acquisition of General Parts, higher incentive compensation and the impact of increased new store openings.","Through the third quarter, our SG&A rate increased 18 basis points to 39% versus 38.8% over the same period last year. All in, our operating income for the third quarter was $170.7 million, which was an increase of 13.5% versus the third quarter of 2012. This result was in line with our expectations and is a testament to our ability to drive gross profit expansion and the team's disciplined focus on expense management despite softer comp store sales performance.","Our operating income rate increased 91 basis points to 11.2% in the third quarter. The increased operating income rate came both from Advance stores, as well as our Autopart International business. Our EPS increased 17.4% versus Q3 last year to $1.42 per share and includes $0.02 of transition costs associated with the integration of BWP and $0.04 related to the pending acquisition of General Parts.","We still anticipate the transition of BWP will occur over an 18-month period from acquisition, and the associated costs with 2013 to now be in the range of $0.08 to $0.11. Through the third quarter 2013, our operating income dollars increased 4.7% to $569.5 million. And our diluted EPS increased 7.1% to $4.65, including $0.05 of BWP integration costs and $0.04 of costs related to the pending acquisition of General Parts.","Free cash flow through the third quarter was $81.1 million, which is down 72.8% over the same period last year, primarily as a result of the acquisition of BWP. Excluding the net impact of BWP acquisition, our free cash flow would have been $251.5 million compared to $298.6 million over the same time period last year, primarily due to higher owned inventory versus last year, offset by lower capital expenditures.","Our owned inventory increased 10.4% from Q3 2012. And our accounts payable to inventory ratio is 83.5% versus 83.2% in third quarter of 2012. Our total inventory increased 12.3%, driven by the acquisition of BWP, more new stores and investments in availability. This increase was higher than our expectations due to our lower-than-anticipated sales performance.","We expect our inventory growth will be lower by the end of our fourth quarter and continue to be focused on improving our accounts payable to inventory ratio with a continued goal of getting to 100%.","At the end of the third quarter, we had roughly $605 million of debt on our balance sheet. And our adjusted debt-to-EBITDAR was 2.2x, which is below our previously stated ceiling of 2.5x.","We continue to measure the performance of our business through the financial dimensions of growth, profit and value creation. During the quarter, we continued to accelerate the pace of new store openings, including the net addition of 28 stores. This includes the opening of 35 new Advance stores, offset by the closing of 7 stores, including 5 Autopart International stores and the consolidation of 2 BWP stores into existing Advance stores.","At the end of Q3, our total store count was 4,018. Including the acquisition of BWP in Q1, we've increased our net store count by 291 over the last 12 months. We remain on pace to open a total of 170 to 190 new Advance Auto Parts and Autopart International stores this year.","In addition to our core store growth, we believe our acquisition of General Parts, which we anticipate closing in late 2013 or early 2014, will accelerate our commercial strategy and position us as a leader in the market, creating a pathway for further growth by opening up new attractive channel opportunities, diversifying and expanding our customer base and enhancing our geographic presence.","We expect the acquisition of General Parts to be a significant step to accelerate our commercial growth, which is and will continue to be, the growth strategy for our company. It will also give us an expanded footprint to expand our DIY business.","Turning to profit. Advance has been on a mission to improve our profitability through sales growth, gross profit margin expansion and improving our cost structure. Despite softer sales during the quarter, our operating margins increased 91 basis points, driven by gross profit margin improvements, primarily driven by our merchandising teams, resulting in lower acquisition costs and field execution. We also made progress in our expense management, where our field teams improved our labor productivity as measured by our sales per labor hour compared to the third quarter last year. And we continue to lower our administrative and support costs in areas such as professional fees.","As a result of a more disciplined approach to expense management, our total SG&A dollars per store decreased to $654,000 per store during the third quarter on a last 12-month basis versus $659,000 during the third quarter of 2012.","With respect to value creation, the acquisition of General Parts provides a compelling opportunity to derive shareholder returns through the growth in our business that will drive incremental operating profit, earnings and strong cash flows.","Year-to-date, through the third quarter, we have deployed over $317 million of capital, including investing approximately $180 million in our acquisition of BWP and returning approximately $79 million to shareholders via share repurchases.","At the end of the quarter, our average diluted share count was 73.1 million shares. Our disciplined approach to capital is reflected in our return on invested capital of 18.6%. For the quarter, our ROIC decreased 38 basis points versus third quarter last year as a result of our increased invested capital due to the acquisition of BWP, the in-sourcing of our commercial credit program and the accelerated pace of our new store openings.","Turning to the balance of the year. Given current market conditions, we expect the softness in the sales environment to continue in Q4. As a reminder, Q4 is our lowest volume and most volatile quarter as we compete with holiday shopping season and seasonally lower demand for parts. As a result, we are maintaining a cautious outlook for Q4 sales and now anticipate our annual comparable store sales will be in the low negative single-digits for 2013.","We continue to expect that our gross profit rate will increase modestly for the full year. And we will continue to adjust our costs appropriately, given our sales trends to deliver on our profit expectations. We also expect to have headwinds in Q4 with incentive compensation, given our profit growth this year as we anniversary lower incentive compensation in Q4 last year.","We expect our SG&A per store to be approximately flat, inclusive of BWP integration costs and all General Parts onetime costs incurred through the third quarter. Given what we see for the fourth quarter, we are maintaining our annual 2013 EPS outlook to be in the range of $5.30 to $5.45, inclusive of BWP integration costs, but excluding all onetime costs incurred in the fourth quarter related to the General Parts acquisition.","As we look to 2014, driving top line growth and bottom line profit will continue to be the focus as we begin integrating General Parts. We remain cautious in the short term as our customers continue to adjust to a difficult macroeconomic environment. We expect that longer-term industry dynamics to remain favorable as a result of the continued increase in the average age of vehicles and the deferred maintenance remains at record levels.","We expect our top line growth to be driven by stronger commercial comps, improved execution, new stores and continued improvements in our availability. We also expect growth from the additional scale, new channels and capabilities from our pending acquisition of General Parts.","We expect to continue to improve our profitability through our existing work to improve our gross profit rate and cost structure and through the realization of the synergies from the pending General Parts acquisition. A key success factor will be to ensure we remain focused on our current day-to-day business operations, delivering on our company objectives and executing against our customer promise, which we are confident we will do. We will provide a more detailed 2014 annual outlook on our fourth quarter earnings call.","As a reminder, in anticipation of the pending closure of the General Parts transaction, our prepared remarks and any subsequent commentary related to the acquisition will be strictly limited to the transaction materials Advance has already shared.","In closing, we are committed to our strategies in Commercial and availability and are focused on improving our sales performance while continuing to improve our profitability and strengthening our returns to continue to drive shareholder value. We also want to thank our 54,000 team members who lead us every day with their relentless focus on service and commitment to operational excellence and execution, which are key ingredients to delivering on our goals.","Operator, we are now ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question today is from Simeon Gutman with Credit Suisse.","Simeon Gutman - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So Mike, you maybe touched on a couple of areas of SG&A where you're finding some savings. From a high level, can you talk about the balance between corporate and the stores? And do you think any of the comp decel is attributable to lower spending? Or as Darren mentioned, this quarter was more just a function of the environment?","Michael A. Norona","Yes. So maybe I'll start, and I'm going to pass you over to George. So if you remember, in the beginning, one of the things that we've been talking about, and we're pleased with is, we needed -- about [ph] the profitability of our model. And at the beginning of this year, we said that, that would come from 3 main areas: improved marketing effectiveness, labor productivity and then our store and administrative costs. And we're pleased with the progress we've made in all those categories. I'm not going to break it out in terms of the pieces just because we don't typically give that kind of information. But we're pleased with the labor productivity. We've had record productivity the last 2 quarters from our field. And that's a credit to our team members that are serving our customers and are doing it in a more effective and efficient way. The SG&A that we're taking out of -- one of the things that we're on a mission on is taking costs out that aren't giving us a good return. And when you take out things like professional services and other costs -- another big driver of our costs, and I think we mentioned it in the release is last year we in-sourced our credit program. We're seeing the benefits coming through our credit card fees, lower credit card fees. We're doing that. So the whole idea is to take costs out furthest away from the customer or improved productivity and not to impact sales. But I'll pass it over to George as to the impacts to sales.","George Sherman","All right. I think it's very much what Mike said. We try wherever possible to go after noncustomer-facing activities to make expense adjustments. We're always aware and keen to the possibilities that we may do something that could affect sales. We wish that it was more surgical in taking costs out of the operation. Sometimes, it does. And we're quick to correct those. I think we're also quick to recognize shifts in our business. So if you look at where we're seeing progress on the sales -- where we're seeing progress in the market, we are committed to a consistent and high level of service to our Commercial customers. And sometimes that takes the form of drivers in a store, but we look at it. We look at the results. We are always open to the possibility that we could do something that affects our sales. And we react quickly. But our bias is to go toward noncustomer-facing activities, keep it as far away from the customer service model as possible.","Simeon Gutman - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then a follow-up regarding the spending backdrop. We get some of the issues that are happening, I guess, in DIY and some of the fleet things that are happening in DIFM. But there is a good amount of deferred maintenance, as Darren mentioned. Gas prices have come in recently. As we turn the year, we'll start to cycle some payroll tax cuts. So is there any reason to be a little more upbeat after you get through this whatever government adjustment process, any reason to be more upbeat as we get into early part of next year?","Darren R. Jackson","Yes. Simeon, this is Darren. You hit on a couple. I think the anniversarying of the payroll tax holiday, the cost of it, the absence of it is certainly one. And you know what, gas prices moving towards $3.25 a gallon nationally is obviously another one that should be a tailwind versus a headwind. I think the government, whether it's healthcare or the shutdown, I think what's happening, and we can see it in the mix of our business, is that consumers are clearly squeezing those dollars a little harder. And they're just making choices around what must get done versus what's nice to get done. And so that being said, when they have a few more dollars in their pocket, and those 2 events will help them for sure, that is a reason to be a little more upbeat. I think the other reason is if you're stretching it out, I think the number jumped nearly $6 billion this year in deferred maintenance. I suspect when the number comes out again in another 4 months, we'll find that -- I don't know that it's jumped another $6 billion, but I bet it's jumped another few billion dollars in terms of what's out there. And that will put them into a mode, if it's anything like we saw in '09, that's when we saw a big relief of that deferred maintenance number. So I don't think it's a question of if. I do believe it's a question of when. And that's really going to come down when the consumers prioritize more of the spending and some of the preventative maintenance spending that really helped fuel those years of higher growth.","Operator","The next question is from Matt Fassler with Goldman Sachs.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","My primary question relates to expenses. I just wanted to take a step back and get a sense of how you think about this philosophically as you plan your SG&A. Are the cost cuts that you're implementing a function of really response to the competitive backdrop -- not competitive backdrop, I'm sorry, the macro backdrop, or it is more a function of a benchmarking exercise where you get a sense of where you stand versus your competitors? I asked the question because you index [ph] quite well from a sales productivity perspective, less so from an operating margin perspective. So is this an attempt in a sense to rebalance those metrics to get to a higher level of profit dollars with a lower cost structure and a willingness to absorb a sales hit? Or am I reading too much into that?","Darren R. Jackson","Matt, it's both. So certainly, at the front end of the year, probably about the first quarter, we were not as bullish on the overall year in terms of sales trends. And early on, we told -- I think we told the greater world that we just -- we're going to be more conservative on the sales trends. And we're going to match our expenses to those sales trends. And for a number of years, we've said, look, we know our SG&A per store is high. And we have taken steps net SG&A per store not to artificially hit an artificial target. But what I would say is step through where we see productivity opportunities. And those productivity opportunities aren't in every store. There are many stores that the productivity, we're not only happy with, we're thrilled with. There are other places in every business through outlier management where you go in and you're just looking at store standards and productivity and targeting the efforts there. And it's not just about a store because I think Mike talked about in marketing, too, you target return on advertising. It's not just there. You look at IT. You look at different places, whether it's a percent of sales or other measure. And it doesn't happen overnight. It really is somewhat of a building towards the cultural piece of that, but really executing against some very specific, I would say, more fact-based productivity measures that you're looking for. And it's a balance. And certainly, we have edited some sales as a result of that. A simple way to think about it is that I couldn't be more thrilled this year that we're growing our large bay and our national accounts. And I'm certain that we are giving up some sales in our non-focused customers that are 10 miles away from a store. That expense trade-off is actually good for 3 reasons: one, our service levels just got better for our larger and more important accounts; two, we weren't servicing those accounts 10 miles from the store in a consistent way that was going to build our brand; and three, what it allows us to do at a store level is effectively plan, as well as the sales team, plan and focus as to where we're spending our time.","Michael A. Norona","And Matt, I do want to mention one other thing. You're also looking at net SG&A figures. Included in those SG&A figures, Darren's exactly right. For many years, we were criticized with our high cost structure. And it was very planful. We did -- I think we did the work first before we started pulling the costs out. And as Darren said, we've adjusted the variable to the trends in the business. And we've actually strategically made moves. But included in that SG&A, we're also investing in new stores. We're also investing in availability. So these are net numbers that you're looking at as well. So the offset to some of that SG&A -- because people talk about the SG&A cuts that we're making. And our SG&A per store is coming down. But we're also netting in those numbers is we're opening more stores this year than we did last year. And we're improving our availability, too.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So understanding that there is a game plan behind this P&L geography, as we think about the next couple of years, and let's forget about the existence of the deal, how far along are you in this process of cost cuts, with some potential sales hit [ph] associated with it? Are we halfway there if you think time-wise or level-wise?","Michael A. Norona","Well, it's too early, Matt, to talk about what will happen with respect to the acquisition. It's just too early. We haven't done that work yet. I can tell you the things that we'll continue to talk about as a company, even when we put these 2 organizations together is we're always going to want to take costs out furthest away from the customer that aren't giving us good return. So that will always be a plan of ours. We'll also always want to improve our productivity. So those 2 things. And George, I don't know if...","George Sherman","Yes, I would add to that. I think while we continue to look for opportunities to sharpen our cost base, there is no question that we're not going to put a cap on productivity. We think that building a productivity culture and a sales culture within our organization is very important. We've spent a lot of time and put a lot of focus on that this year to really get our teams focused on driving sales per hour and becoming more and more productive at every level.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And finally, Mike, you have, from time to time, given us a target for growth in SG&A per store as part of the guidance thought process on the calls. Do you care to do that today for the fiscal year?","Michael A. Norona","No, we won't. I'll give you more details when we do our Q4 call for next year. We do that. We don't look out further than that. So we'll give you that. I will say -- we said it on the call that we're expecting our SG&A per store to be roughly flattish this year. And part of that we built in, and we said it in our remarks. We're going to continue our progress on our cost work. But when we hit Q4, we do have some headwinds this year that we didn't have. So we're going to be anniversarying a lower incentive comp last year. And as you remember, a lot of people in the company didn't get bonuses last year. With the profit improvements we've made this year, there's going to be more incentive. So that's probably the biggest impact that we'll see in Q4. But we're expecting it for the year to be roughly flattish.","Operator","The next question is from Dan Wewer with Raymond James.","Daniel R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Mike, I guess just continuing on this theme. In the quarter, operating margins were up 90 basis points. But if you were to add back in the deal expenses with GPI, I guess you're up 120 bps. Thinking back to the Investor Day last spring and your goal of 200 basis points of improvement over a 3-year period, how much further ahead are you of that goal at this point than what you were talking about last March and April? And are you now thinking maybe that 200 basis points upside could be conservative? Again, that's excluding the transaction.","Michael A. Norona","No. Dan, I don't know if we're ahead. I think we're pleased. So I think that the numbers you're talking about is -- so we leveraged SG&A 49 basis points. Well, that includes the deal costs. So when you take those deal costs into account, I think that if you just do the math, I think that's 84 basis point of leverage we would have in SG&A. And then that includes BWP costs. So I think that's how you're getting through the numbers. I think in a bigger frame, I think we're pleased with the margin improvements we've made. We're expecting modest this year. We're pleased with the SG&A improvements. When we set the 12% goal, quite frankly, too, we also planned that the comp would be better. So I think, for us, where we're focused on is while managing our costs is the right thing, we've always said that in order to get to 12%, it was 3 pieces: it was growth and it was profit through SG&A and margin. And I think we're pleased with the SG&A. I think we're pleased with the margin. And I think as George and Darren said, we've got some work to do on the sales. And there's parts of our business -- Darren gave a great story that's happening in Boston. We've got pockets of the business that are doing well. And I think where we're focused is getting that top line going.","Daniel R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And this is a follow-up. Darren, you had noted that 80% of the stores opened from your competitors are going into your territory. Unfortunately, that's not going to change based on where O'Reilly is indicating. They're going to open all these stores in Florida and up in the northeast. What kind of competitive response can Advance make? I know you're not going to compete on price. But what kind of competitive response can you make to help protect your market share in those regions?","Darren R. Jackson","Well, the most important thing you can do in those regions, Dan, is take care of your customers and take care of your team. And so in certain of those markets, there's tactical things that we'll do to protect our customers and tactical things that we'll do in terms of growing our business. I think in the DIY business, we've seen this in other industries, when 83% of the customers make their choice around DIY based on who's closest to their home, you're balancing the impact of, what I'll say, is just core human behavior. And you're trying to offset that with your team and how you're treating your customers. I mean, as we look out and without getting into things we can't talk about in terms of General Parts, we see enormous opportunity rolling Advance beyond our traditional footprint. And we talked about this a lot in terms of 88% of those stores are east of the Mississippi. We certainly see General Parts giving us a multipronged approach to growing our business through WORLDPAC, which we think is just an extraordinarily special model and led by a great team. And we see the opportunity with the Advance brand. And more recently, as we've spent some time with the independents meeting and greeting them, we see that as an opportunity for growth, too. And there's a lot of growth outside of our footprint that is now -- that will be available to us once we complete the process.","Operator","The next question is from Greg Melich with ISI Group.","Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I wanted to follow up on the productivity and sales culture that George mentioned trying to drive in the organization. As you think about getting that balance right, would you consider, on the DIY side, doing things like loyalty programs like O'Reilly's doing to maybe reinvest some of that margin or productivity gains into the selling side of that equation? Then I had a follow-up.","George Sherman","Yes. I don't think we discount any possibilities as to how we would serve our DIY customer. I think when you talk about the sales and productivity culture as it applies to DIY, we've been very focused on training our teams, getting more automotive systems training in place, getting more training and reporting around how the entire project our job is sold into the store and become very focused on when our traffic patterns are at their highest and putting task management in place and move it away from those peak periods of the day. So we won't put any limits on what we would do in terms of serving that customer. But we're certainly not in any way, shape or manner, walking away from DIY. It's a huge part of our business.","Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then I just wanted to follow up. In the prepared comments, I think, Darren, you mentioned that sequentially, DIY, you think, was 400 bps weaker and do-it-for-me, 200. Was that for you guys or the industry?","Darren R. Jackson","That was the industry, Greg. So all we're doing -- we don't get granular industry data anymore. But we do get it at a pretty high level from NPD just quarter-to-quarter. And you could just see a slowdown Q2 to Q3. And you shouldn't read into it, it went negative, but it was pretty pronounced in DIY. And I think as our competitors have talked about earlier in the quarter, I think we just saw part of that malaise come through, part of it governmental and part of it for different reasons from the consumer.","Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","And with merchandising margin being driven with the reduced sourcing costs, imagine there's some deflation there. Was there any LIFO? Or are we seeing that also show up on the top line where there's actually deflation now on the top line?","George Sherman","Yes. So I'll talk about LIFO, and then Charles can talk about it then. So LIFO, if you look at just the LIFO line, we had a little bit of income this year anniversarying against more income last year. So LIFO was actually a headwind for us in the quarter. But just looking at the LIFO line is the wrong way to look at it. You've got to look at did we change mix, did we adjust prices? And when you put that all together, the inflation, deflation had minimal impact in the quarter. Charles?","Charles E. Tyson","Yes. And I think the other thing is a sourcing. We work across our whole vendor structure to continue to work on improving acquisition costs and improve our overall gross margin. So it doesn't mean that we necessarily would deflate at top line through price positioning. And it's very rational pricing in the marketplace. So you're seeing that benefit across a wide array of our vendor structure in terms of how we're driving the margin equation.","Operator","Our final question today is from Bret Jordan with BB&T Capital Markets.","Bret David Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","A little follow-up on George's comment there on sourcing, and I guess lower product acquisition costs came up. Is it same product at a lower price or are you shifting the product mix? Is there more private label products coming into this -- into the category that's driving the gross margin up? And I guess to some extent, is the higher owned inventory also having an impact? Are you getting better pricing in exchange for less aggressive payable terms?","Charles E. Tyson","So I'll answer the first question first. We've said consistently in the last 3 years that our investment in our global-sourcing capabilities has continued to drive benefit. And that's driving through a higher percent of private label penetration. So the answer to your question is yes. In terms of the inventory builds, we're making those strategic investments in our markets. If you look at our Remington DC and you look at our 6x [ph] delivery, we're putting more product closer to the customer to make sure that we drive a better availability. We're not trading off terms for price. And we continue to maintain that discipline as you see in our AP [ph] ratio continuing to improve over the last 3 years.","Bret David Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","And then I guess one other question on the margin. The SG&A benefit from some of the lower marketing expenses, was there inefficient marketing spend? I guess as you talk about new competitors coming into your footprint or increasing competition in your footprint, does marketing need to come back up to some extent? Or was it just inefficiency you were able to take out and you can continue to run marketing at these levels despite increasing competition?","Darren R. Jackson","Yes. I think, Bret, there's a couple pieces. Charles, do you want to provide color? I think when we stood back and looked at our marketing, we had a broad range of vehicles last year. I think what we did is we stood back and looked at those multiple vehicles, whether it was direct marketing through the mail. Certainly, we're all spending a lot more online than we have in years past. And in radio, and many of those have different timelines in terms of the returns. What we could see is that ability to consolidate under fewer vehicles this year. And when we made that consolidation, we really made it against a view of which one of them are future facing, call it, the Internet. Which one of them quite frankly are we renting the business for short periods of time and which ones of those do we have to be more consistent over time. And we added it against that lens, and really are staying the course in that approach to the business. And I'd say, years before that, you're just -- you're probing the wall a little bit in terms of how the consumer is reacting. And as you better understand what they're reacting to in how things are changing, you're narrowing the mix based against an effectiveness measure, not just against a total dollars spent. Would you add anything, Charles? George?","Charles E. Tyson","No. I think you said it perfectly.","Operator","That concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call over to Zaheed Mawani for closing comments.","Zaheed Mawani","Thank you, Wendy, and thanks to our audience for participating in our third quarter earnings conference call.

Before we begin, Elisabeth make a brief statement concerning forward-looking statements that will be made on this call.","Elisabeth Eisleben","Good morning, and thank you for joining us on today's call to discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2017 results. I'm joined this morning by Tom Greco, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Tom Okray, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Bob Cushing, our Executive Vice President of Professional, Mike Broderick, our Executive Vice President, Merchandising Inventory, Replenishment and Store Operations and Prabhakar Vaidyanathan, our Vice President, Treasury and Investor Relations. Following their prepared remarks, we will turn our attention to answering your questions.","Before we begin, be advised that our comments today may include statements that are not historical facts and may be deemed forward-looking statements as defined by the SEC's Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. While actual results may differ materially from those projected in such statements, due to a number of risks and uncertainties, which are described in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and on our website, we maintain no duty to update forward-looking statements made.","Additionally, our comments today include certain non-GAAP financial measures.

The content of this earnings call will be governed by the information contained in our earnings press release and related financial statements.","Now, let me turn the call over to Tom Greco.","Thomas Greco","Thanks, Elizabeth, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin my remarks by thanking the entire AAP team and network of Carquest independent for their unrelenting focus throughout the first full year of our 5-year plan.","In 2017, we implemented important building blocks to capture the substantial opportunity ahead. In doing so, we made progress against our long-term strategic objectives amidst a challenging environment to the industry.","In addition, we narrowed the competitive growth gap on a full year basis and delivered significant cash flow improvement.","Specifically, total revenue is down 2.2% and comp sales were down 2.6% in Q4. While we're far from happy with this sales outcome, it was ahead of our guidance, which considered the difficult comparison of our positive 3.1 comp in Q4 2016.","Our top line performance was a result of improving execution throughout the quarter and a better-than-expected December, resulting in a 2-year stack of positive 0.5% in the quarter.","Our adjusted operating income margin was 5.6%, and our adjusted earnings per share was $0.77.","Rounding out the financials, our continued focus on working capital resulted in free cash flow growth of 56% on a full year basis to $411 million. Our cash position is the best it's been since the 2014 acquisition.","Throughout 2017, we've put the foundation in place to enable our transformation. Delighting our customers and empowering our frontline team members remains at the center of everything we do, which will ultimately drive market share gains and significant margin expansion.","In terms of sales in the fourth quarter, we continued to see top line strength in certain businesses and regions.","The Worldpac business achieved top line growth above the industry average, and our Canadian business continued to perform very well.","In both corporate and independent U.S. stores, our 1 and 2-year stack performance improved compared to Q3.","From a category perspective, we saw above-average growth in battery sales as well as increased demand for wipers and lighting. These improvements were partially offset by softness in undercar and cooling categories.","We expect these trends to carry forward into the first quarter of the year, as the first quarter has started off with colder weather in key geographies, driving a winter-related demand.","Turning to the bottom line in Q4. We realized savings from productivity, including material cost optimization, which benefited gross profit. In addition, we saw positive impacts from 0-based budgeting within SG&A, as we delivered cost savings and lower third-party fees compared to the previous year.","Finally, we remain laser focused on cash flow and reduced inventory for the third consecutive quarter by $51 million in Q4, with a total reduction of $157 million in 2017. Tom Okray will elaborate further on our financial performance shortly.","While we're pleased we closed Q4 by exceeding our guidance across the board, we fully recognize a great deal of work remains to fully capture the tremendous opportunity ahead.","Now I'd like to review the transformation actions we took in 2017 and what you can expect from these initiatives in 2018.","Throughout 2017, we made important investments to strengthen our core value proposition. We made investments in the customer and in technology. We also made investments in our people, investments in our frontline team members as well as team members in our customer support center. We're confident that the investments we made last year set us up for long-term growth.","A major accomplishment we announced late in Q4 was a strategic partnership with Interstate Batteries, the undisputed market leader in batteries for professional installers. In terms of DIY, AAP will be the only retailer in the nation carrying a complete lineup of Interstate Batteries in-store and online. This unique partnership creates a powerful combination of Interstate's R&D and brand recognition with our substantial fulfillment capabilities combined with our store and frontline asset.","The Interstate relationship reinforces the importance of brands and suppliers to our transformation. We want to provide the very best market-leading brands at great prices. In addition, our supplier base is critical to our success. We continue to work closely with our highly-valued suppliers to find additional partnerships that drive benefits for both parties.","Moving to an update on key initiatives within our long-term plan. I'll start with Professional.","In Q4, we continued our availability transformation rollout and ended the year with roughly 1,000 stores completed. We're also implementing other proven initiatives to enhance our professional value proposition in all stores. This includes cross-banner visibility, a critical step in increasing availability, which is expected to be complete in Q1.","As a reminder, we believe AAP has the strongest lineup of professional brands in the market. And cross-banner visibility enables both professional customers and all Advance, Carquest and Worldpac team members to see a broader range of inventory across the enterprise and place their order from one platform.","The ability to see the entire inventory and portfolio of brands available in market regardless of banner enables us to serve customers faster and more efficiently. Most importantly, it enables us to say yes more often.","Related to cross banner, we implemented Advance Pro, our e-commerce engine for professional customers, in approximately 12,000 professional customers in 2017, including 4,000 converted in the fourth quarter. Advance Pro allows our professional customers to fully access our common catalog, and we plan to double the number of customers utilizing this platform in 2018.","In terms of DIY, we're improving the in-store experience for our customers. Our team members are now leveraging a standardized approach to customer engagement and selling. We're providing increased training to frontline team members enabling better execution.","In addition, we continued to improve the quality of our online experience through the launch of our new website in mid-2017. We added to our online SKU assortment, made search much easier and in providing a faster and more frictionless online experience.","As a result of our omnichannel focus, our DIY performance strengthened in Q4, and we exited 2017 with momentum in DIY.","Next, we've been working on strengthening and streamlining our supply chain from end to end. Our first priority is to improve baseline execution. We remain focused on a limited number of KPIs in our supply chain. While we've made progress on fill rate, close rate and store in-stock rate, significant upside remains.","In 2018, we expect to see further improvements in each of these metrics along with order-to-delivery time and consistency, safety and cost. We'll also begin moving forward in 2018 with our longer-term supply chain transformation roadmap. We are taking the necessary steps to validate key elements of our plans this year with meaningful benefits to come in the future.","In terms of optimization, our supply chain can be streamlined to better meet the future needs of our customers. Our supply chain strategy is about differentiation, improving the customer experience and structural cost reduction.","The 3 key elements of our strategy include: first, a market-by-market approach to drive share; secondly, the repurposing of our in-market store and asset base; and third, the optimization of our distribution centers.","In the future, we anticipate markets across North America will have significant differences in how customers shop for auto parts, requiring a market-by-market approach to drive share. Some of the variables we considered include the outlook for professional versus DIY; online versus in-store sales; and buy online, ship to home versus buy online, pickup in store.","To optimize our in-market store base, we've also evaluated the entirety of our assets market by market. This includes Advance stores, Advance HUBs, Advance Super HUBs, Carquest corporate and independent stores, Autopart International stores and Worldpac branches. Our goal is to strengthen our customer value proposition while simplifying our current asset base.","In some DMAs, we see opportunities to reduce our store base where we have underperforming stores. While stores remain very important to our long-term success, when you have more than 5,000, not all stores have the potential to perform at the level we expect. In those situations, we're adopting a very surgical approach to reducing our store base. Bottom line, we will close stores when it's clear the decision will drive long-term cash flow.","We're approaching store closures very differently than we have in the past. This includes a much more robust process to transfer sales to other AAP outlets, and most importantly, an approach that ensures we retain our top-performing team members.","In some markets across North America, our store presence is limited. In these markets, we intend to accelerate Worldpac branch openings to drive professional growth while investing in marketing, online and digital to drive DIY. Regardless of the inherent differences in each market, our objective is consistent: strengthen our customer value proposition and gain market share.","In terms of distribution centers, we currently have 54 across North America. In many cases, we ship parts from multiple DCs to the same city, demonstrating there's a significant productivity opportunity. Our plans to optimize the AAP DC network includes some initiatives that are relatively easy to implement. Others are more difficult, requiring technology unlocks currently in progress. We begin this journey in 2018, capturing some early wins while testing a more comprehensive solution with the potential to significantly improve in-market availability and substantially reduce costs.","When we say streamlining our supply chain from end to end, we'll bring each of these 3 initiatives together. First, a market expansion strategy that puts the customer first and considers the future shape of demand and our existing asset base market by market; second, an in-market network that optimizes stores to drive ROIC and free cash flow; and third, a DC network that is integrated and better leveraged at end state.","Allow me to briefly touch on new stores. Given our underperformance in company-owned Advance and Carquest stores over the past few years, we see an opportunity to improve execution through increased focus. As a result, we don't want to distract our field leaders with new stores until we grow the comp sales of existing stores.","This is not to say we won't open new Advance and Carquest stores in the future. It simply says we're laser focused on execution in existing stores and strengthening the Advance and Carquest brands. Once we're growing comp sales in existing Advance and Carquest-owned stores, we will open new stores again. Most importantly, we remain focused on growth, gaining market share and driving improved performance.","We're making growth-related investments in 2018. In terms of CapEx, we're investing in technology and additional Worldpac branches. In terms of OpEx, we're continuing to invest in online, digital and on frontline team members to drive growth. And as I mentioned, we're bringing Interstate Batteries to our stores where we will be the only nationwide retailer with the extensive Interstate lineup available.","In summary, we are pleased with how we finished 2017. In 2018, we expect to further narrow the competitive growth gap and deliver margin expansion. We remain focused on cash and our inventory optimization efforts. We're highly confident 2018 will be a year of improved performance.","With that, I'll turn it over to Tom Okray for a review of our financials and 2018 outlook.","Thomas Okray","Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. I will begin with the operational performance of the business and specific impacts on our margin results.","In the fourth quarter, gross profit was $874 million. On a rate basis, our gross profit margin of 42.9% was 69 basis points lower than the prior-year quarter of 43.6%. The primary driver of our gross margin contraction was increased supply chain costs, which reduced our margins by 89 basis points. While the biggest driver of our increased supply chain cost was a result of new DCs, which were approved prior to the commencement of our end-to-end supply chain work, we also have an execution opportunity here, as Tom mentioned.","In addition, the noncash impact of our inventory optimization efforts negatively impacted our gross margin by 20 basis points. These increased costs were partially offset by continued material cost improvement and a reduction in defectives, which combined, improved 42 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of 2016.","Adjusted SG&A was $760 million in Q4, a decrease of $22 million as compared to the prior-year fourth quarter. This was $38 million lower versus our adjusted SG&A in the second quarter of 2017, exceeding our objective of lowering adjusted SG&A by $25 million versus the second quarter of 2017.","As a percentage of net sales, our fourth quarter adjusted SG&A improved 24 basis points from 37.5% to 37.3%. Continued progress and expense management during the quarter, including labor, third-party fee reductions, and other improvements in utility, maintenance and repair costs, were partially offset by higher medical costs and insurance.","Turning to adjusted operating income. We delivered adjusted operating income of $114 million in the fourth quarter and adjusted operating margins of 5.6%, 45 basis points lower than the prior year, which were impacted by the gross profit and adjusted SG&A levers we described above.","The impact of the tax reform signed into law in December will have a significant impact on our income and effective tax rate. As a result of changes in the law that reduces the federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, we will require to revalue our deferred tax liabilities in Q4 at the new lower rate of 21%.","This drove a one-time noncash tax benefit of $144 million and was the primary driver of our fourth quarter effective tax rate, which is a benefit of approximately 149% or $1.94 increase to our diluted EPS.","Due to the one-time nature of the noncash tax benefit, we excluded this impact in our adjusted net income and EPS calculations. In 2017, our effective tax rate with tax reform was 8.6%. In 2018, we expect our income tax rate to be between 24% and 26%.","Turning to cash flow and to echo what Tom discussed earlier, we are very pleased with the strength of our free cash flow in 2017.","Our full year 2017 free cash flow was $411 million, a 56% increase as compared to prior year. We have put a tremendous amount of focus into managing our cash that simply did not exist in the past.","This includes the new working capital management and CapEx policies implemented over the past 12 months. We will be relentless on selecting profitable investments, protecting the long-term health and viability of the company and maximizing the returns to the business.","Now I'd like to wrap up our discussion with an overview of our expectations for 2018.","With respect to Q1, we expect to deliver OI margin expansion, both as compared to Q4 and on a year-over-year basis. Based on the current trends we are seeing across our business, we estimate flat to 25 basis points of adjusted OI margin improvement for the first quarter compared to the same quarter in the prior year.","For the 2018 full year, we expect to deliver net sales of $9.1 billion to $9.4 billion, with comparable store sales in the range of negative 2% to 0. We expect adjusted operating margins to increase between 0 to 50 basis points for the year.","We estimate our 2018 capital spending will be $200 million to $250 million. Leveraging our efficient deployment of capital allows us to maintain our historical level of capital spending while increasing our investment in technology, e-commerce and our people.","In line with our continuing transformation agenda, we estimate integration and transformation expenses of $140 million to $180 million in 2018. The increase versus the prior year is primarily related to optimizing our supply chain footprint.","Following the December 2017 tax reform, we estimate an effective tax rate between 24% and 26% in 2018. Further, we estimate this change will result in $70 million of incremental cash flow and increase EPS by $0.90.","This incremental cash flow from the tax reform provides additional operating flexibility. However, it did not change our investment strategy or annual operating plan that was finalized in November, ahead of the passage of tax reform.","Our 2018 plan includes increases in technology and e-commerce in addition to continued investment in our people.","We remain focused on delivering free cash flow and expect to deliver at least $400 million of free cash flow in 2018. The primary drivers of the $400 million when compared to our fiscal year '17 free cash flow result are incremental cash flow related to the lower tax rate and continued improvement in working capital, offset by higher capital spending, expenses related to our supply chain footprint optimization and the 2017 nonrecurring benefits related to the sale of our aircraft and vehicles.","In summary, we are pleased with the traction and positive momentum we achieved this past year, but want to be very clear, we still have a lot of work ahead of us. Our entire team continues to work hard every day to drive further improvements, and we are confident that we will deliver against our 2018 objectives. We remain optimistic about the opportunities ahead and look forward to discussing our continued progress throughout the year.","With that, let's open it up to addressing your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from the line of Seth Sigman with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Seth Sigman","Thanks a lot. Good morning. Nice to see the progress guys. Just quickly on the DIY improvement that you cited, Tom. So I think you attribute some of that improvement to enhancements you made to the online offering. Can you elaborate on that a little bit more? Was that direct-to-consumer? Or was that buy online, pickup in store? And I guess, just overall, what does it tell you about the importance of online in the category?","Thomas Greco","Well, first of all, we definitely made some progress on our website, Seth, in the back half of the year. We are focused on just improving the experience overall, making it more frictionless. So reducing page load times, reducing the number of clicks to get out. We tried to align our entire organization around the online offerings so that we're actually compensating our general managers for buy online, pickup in store and buy online, ship to home.","So everybody is really aligned around making the omnichannel experience better. So we're continuing to elevate the focus of -- people often, over half of the time, start to search for auto parts on a mobile device, so we've just got to be out in front of that. And you're going to continue to see us make investments in technology and the omnichannel experience to drive that and that helped our DIY business.","It was one of our best quarters on DIY for a while. We did benefit, I think, a little bit from the storm-related activity that was throughout the Southeast and in Texas. That drives DIY. It actually hurts Professional, but it drives DIY, but that was kind of the story of the fourth quarter.","Seth Sigman","Okay, that's really helpful. And then just a quick follow-up on the cash flow. Obviously, a significant improvement this past year. Just based on the guidance, I mean, you guys will have close to $1 billion in cash at the end of 2018. How are you thinking about deploying that at this point? Is there an opportunity to possibly resume buying back stock here?","Thomas Okray","Yes. Thanks, Seth. We're staying true to what we said in the past. We want to get back our leverage ratio to 2.5. We're at 2.9 now. We want to get back to 2.5. Second priority is invest in the business, a lot of opportunity there. And then, the third one is return to shareholders with buybacks. Right now, we don't have anything on the radar screen for this year in terms of buybacks.","Seth Sigman","Okay, thanks. Good luck.","Thomas Okray","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Your line is now open.","Michael Lasser","Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. My first question is on how you thought about creating your top line guidance for the upcoming year. Others are kind of indicating they think the industry is going to grow 2% to 4%. If we take the midpoint of your flat to down, your comp guidance would suggest that there's not going to be much narrowing of the performance gap versus the others. So did you just take a lot of conservatism in your outlook for your comp for the upcoming year?","Thomas Greco","Good morning. Mike. I certainly understand your question. Let me give you some perspective on this one. In terms of sales, we absolutely believe 2018 is going to be a stronger year for the industry and for Advance for a couple of reasons. First of all, from an industry standpoint, the dynamics are all positive: GDP, vehicle, miles driven, sweet spot, car park, finally a cold winter, which we benefit from with a lot of stores in the Northeast to North Central.","And when you look at ourselves, the big changes that we had to make as part of this transformation are behind us. When you think about the field restructure we executed last year and the professional sales organization, these were big changes to big things and they were very distracting. So there's no question that we'll be more focused this year on our execution of our plan. The big initiatives that we have are starting to have an impact as well whether that's cross-banner visibility, availability transformation, or omnichannel work.","And then, we did finish the year with our best 2-year stack in a long time and narrowed the gap significantly, both on a full year and fourth quarter basis. All of that said, it's very early in the year and we need to be prudent. We have a large cost base that over time we're addressing in a way that's thoughtful and doesn't impact the customer.","And for 2018, we built our cost base to match that sales guide. So be assured, everybody at AAP is focused on exceeding the sales and profit numbers we've guided to. And in the event that we do that, it will be a tremendous year for us, and we think this is the right approach for 2018.","Michael Lasser","My follow-up question, Tom, is can you give us the sense for how the margin integration expenses are going to flow from here over the next few years? Are you at the point where 2018 will be the peak integration expense year? And after this, you'll be able to make substantial progress to your long-term operating margin expectations?","Thomas Okray","Yes. Michael, I'll take that one. I think you are going to below the line costs. As we see, those -- our GPI integration costs are going to come down over time. They were roughly $24 million in '17, will come down more in '18. Our amortization related to GPI is going to stay roughly steady at about $40,000. But what you will see over the next couple of years going forward is an increase in our transformation expenses, as we really start to double down on our supply chain footprint optimization.","Michael Lasser","Okay. Thank you so much. Good luck for the rest of the year.","Thomas Okray","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Simeon Gutman","Good morning, guys. First question is related to Q4. This is not -- it's maybe hard to do, Tom. But how much was the better trend, the result of weather versus how much can you isolate to execution and operational improvements?","Thomas Greco","Yes. I mean, we obviously look at it every single week, Simeon. We look at our input metrics that really define what ends up happening on the output side. And given the changes we made in the third quarter, which I'd say the peak of that disruption was around period 7, period 8. As we looked at period 9, 10, 11, 12, each one, we started to improve whether that was an in-stock, fill rate, greeting the customer, the things that we're measuring on a routine basis.","So I would attribute more of the improvement to execution. The weather was -- as I think you've heard from others, October, November was favorable. We had a good October and November. December, we expected it was going to be tough. It got better as we closed the year, and obviously, that continued into the first period of this year. But overall, December was not a good year-over-year lap. It was an excellent 2-year performance, but it was not a good 1-year performance.","Simeon Gutman","Okay. And my follow-up has 2 parts. The first part is on the guidance for 2018, in particular, the EBIT margin range. Is that solely tethered to the comp range? Or is there a potential upside coming from margin items? Meaning there's some cost reduction and\/or margin enhancement that could occur irrespective of how comps play out? And then just as a small part of that, can you just comment on why the CapEx is about $60 million south of where you were, I think, prior to -- I think, for this year, why is it $60 million light versus guidance?","Thomas Greco","Okay. Well, maybe I'll take the margin. I'll flip the CapEx question over to Tom. We're really excited about the fact that we're going to expand margins this year. We're starting to see the productivity agenda kick in. The areas that we've discussed in the past are starting to really impact our P&L. The material cost optimization helping us on the gross margin line.","The supply chain productivity agenda is helping us. And then 0-based budgeting is really becoming pervasive throughout the company. And that's enabled us last year to make investments in the area of the businesses that we think we need for the long term.","And we referenced that in the prepared remarks, technology and marketing, customer service and in people. So yes, we have engineered our cost structure to match that sales guide to the extent we can beat that sales guide. There's going to be some upside overall.","But we want to make sure that we're being thoughtful about how we run the business and we've engineered the cost structure accordingly. So the productivity agenda we have for 2018 is robust. It's about -- it's slightly bigger than we had last year, but it's in the same areas of material costs, supply chain and 0-based budgeting. Tom, you want to talk on CapEx?","Thomas Okray","Yes. With respect to CapEx, we've just become much more cash focused within the company. I think I've mentioned on previous calls, we've got a cash council that meets twice a month. We've actually got an organization now in terms of the capital department that we didn't have in the past. We're not happy with the 13 ROIC. We want to have the industry-leading ROIC.","And so we've just really raised the bar on our capital projects. We're just being much more rigorous in terms of what gets through and what gets spent. We've got target for each category of capital spend. So the decrease from 2016 is really just a higher bar for approval.","Simeon Gutman","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities. Your line is now open.","Seth Basham","Thanks a lot and good morning.","Thomas Okray","Good morning.","Seth Basham","My first question is on the margin guidance for 2018. For the first quarter, you're guiding to 0 to 25 basis points improvement, but for the full year, 0 to 30 basis points. It seems like you had the easiest comparison in the first quarter. Why would you see a more limited improvement in the first quarter relative to the balance of the year?","Thomas Okray","Yes, it's good question. It goes back to what Tom talked about for the overall guidance. We're just really trying to be prudent with the guidance in the first quarter as well as for the overall year. We like the gross margin that we see in the first quarter. It's still early in terms of sales. Depending on how the sales growth goes, then -- that will dictate what the overall bottom line margin will be and how much we lever in terms of SG&A.","Seth Basham","Got it. Helpful. And my second question is related to the supply chain transformation that you guys are undertaking. Can you provide a little bit more color on the initial steps you're taking in 2018, the easy wins versus the bigger wins? And what you're doing at the pilots on those more comprehensive changes?","Thomas Greco","Sure, Seth. So first of all, when we talk supply chain, think of it as end to end. So really all the way from the distribution centers to the stores. So I'll speak to those separately. In terms of the distribution centers, first of all, we feel great about the amount of planning and rigor that's gone into our long-term transformation plan on supply chain. We're very committed to optimizing our network while strengthening the customer proposition. That's very, very important to us. In terms of distribution centers, we mentioned in prepared remarks, we've got 54 DCs. There is an opportunity for optimization there. These DC plans are very sensitive, as you can appreciate, for both competitive and internal reasons. So we're not prepared to share specifics on what we're doing there at this time. And at the appropriate time, we'll share more details on the DCs themselves. As it pertains to the stores, the stores are inextricably linked to the supply chain work we're doing on the DCs, obviously. So what we've done is we've taken a market outlook, literally DMA by DMA, in the tri-state area. What do we expect in terms of auto parts sales over the next several years, how much is going to be Pro versus DIY, how much is DIY online versus DIY ship to home, et cetera? So every market in the country, we've done that work. And then we overlay the entirety of our asset base in each DMA. So in the case of the tri-state area, we have obviously Advance stores, we have Carquest stores, we have Carquest independents, we have Autopart International stores, Worldpac. All of those assets, we look at in the market. And then we're taking a very surgical approach to optimization. So in the case of an asset we have in that market, a store, for example, if we don't feel that store can achieve the desired rate of return, we're going to close that store. And we're extremely confident in terms of the effort we put into this that when we close a store, it will be very good for the company's cash flow over time. But the one thing I would add is we're going to close the stores very differently than we have in the past. Obviously, we've gone through this before. It's a much more thoughtful approach. We have to figure out how to retain the professional business when we close those stores, and most importantly, how do we retain our top people. So the overall work that we've done here is significant, and we start to take our first steps on it in 2018. And we're very excited about the long-term prospects to drive margin expansion and market share associated with it.","Operator","And our next question will come from the line of Greg Melich with MoffettNathanson.","Greg Melich","I had a couple of questions. One, on the integration costs, and then understanding the working cap a little better. On the integration, if we take out the amortization, it seems to have been running around $70-something million in the last few years. And Tom, I think I got it from your earlier comments that that's the step-up to basically $100 million to $140 million. So could you help us understand why that part of it's going up so much once we take out the amortization? What it's going on? And if that new run rate of 2018 looks more like a peakish number? Or is it building to something larger once we get supply chain done over the next couple of years? And then I have a follow-up on [indiscernible]?","Thomas Okray","It's all related to the question that Tom just answered. We're going to be very surgical in terms of how we look at our supply chain optimization, making sure that the stores and the DCs pave their way. So that's the main reason for the increase.","Greg Melich","And so whether it's $100 million or $140 million is a function of like sort of the timing? And if that of being $100 million, then we would expect the difference in the next year? Or how -- do we think of that as a new normal? Or is this a year that we're going to be spending more on it than typical?","Thomas Okray","I think we'll see it at the current levels for the next few years as we undergo the supply chain transformation.","Greg Melich","Perfect. And then on inventory, a nice reduction last year. Is that a number of improvement year-over-year that we should think about going forward? In other words, can we get under $4 billion of inventory? Should we expect another $150 million out? And also, the AP ratio, as that plays out, how should we think about that?","Thomas Okray","Yes. That's a great question. We took out year-over-year $157 million in inventory, whereas the prior year, we grew $151 million. So for a net decrease of over $300 million. We would expect in '18 a similar level of decrease year-over-year. If I look at the AP ratio, we're at 69.5, round to 70. We've got certain barriers there to getting to our high 90s target. One of it is just structural. That's related to our supply chain. We've got 5 different supply chains, as we've talked about. It just requires us to have duplicative inventory into the system and that's something that's going to stay until we get at this transformation we've been talking about. The other issue, we've got lower purchases as we start out with this inventory drawdown. That's going to catch up in the back half of the year and provide some tailwinds to our AP ratio. And then the third thing, we've been very maniacal on cash flow, so what we've been doing is we've been netting receivables to accounts payable with our vendors. So that will also normalize over time. So we still stay committed to the high 90s AP ratio. We also think that we're going to have a similar level of reduction in inventory this year as compared to last year.","Greg Melich","That's great. And if I could, one follow-up for Tom. It sounds like the Interstate deal is a pretty interesting and unique one. And are you -- how are you thinking about that beyond in other categories in sort of partnering and using some of the vendor's brand more exclusively and more broadly? Are there other areas that you think could really help enhance -- so I'm just -- really just thinking Worldpac, now with Bob looking at the entire commercial side, are there other areas or categories that look interesting to you to do something like that?","Thomas Okray","There definitely are. And we're not going to get into specifics here, Greg. But the whole point about brands and the importance of brands to our customers, all the work we've done lead us to believe that brands are extremely important, not just to our DIY customers, even more so on the professional side. So how do we partner with our suppliers? Our suppliers are critically important to this transformation. How we partner with them to really lift up their brands, work together to find relationships where you can literally make 1 plus 1 equal 3 and that's what we think we've done with Interstate. Obviously, they bring great R&D and brand to the category. They're the #1 battery amongst the professional installers. And we have a large footprint in 74,000 passionate team members and 1,500 independents that love to sell auto parts. And you put that together, it's a pretty powerful combination. So we do think there's more of those out there, and we are working actively with our supplier community right now to find more.","Operator","And our next question will come from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets.","Scot Ciccarelli","Scot Ciccarelli. So over the last 2 years or so, early on, you guys had pretty big spike in SG&A dollars. But SG&A spending and SG&A on a per store basis seemed to have improved pretty significantly over the last 2 quarters. Now, I know Tom you talked about your building your expense plan to the sales outlook you just provided. But when you think about your outlook for '18, how are you guys thinking about SG&A growth on a per store basis? And related to that, should we expect much of a net change at all in terms of total stores given your store commentary from earlier?","Thomas Greco","Well, maybe I'll take the first one on total stores. Again, we want to be clear on the AAP\/CQUS side. If you look at what we've done previously, '15, '16, '17, we opened up what I would describe as conventional stores, Scot, anywhere from 70 to 100 -- 75, 100 square foot boxes that had DIY and professional in them. And at this stage, we want to make sure that our field team is laser focused on executing in existing stores and making sure we're driving the comp sales in existing stores. And our team is very focused on that. We're excited about the prospect of moving the comp sales of our existing stores up.","In terms of adding new stores, the primary effort there in 2018 is going to be Worldpac. So we've got some markets where we're opening up Worldpac branches, and this is all part of the end-to-end supply chain strategy. It's a really go-to-market, a little bit differently than we have in the past and take advantage of the growth we see coming in professional with a model that works very well. Tom, do you want to...","Thomas Okray","Yes. In terms of the absolute level of SG&A going forward, we feel comfortable with the levels we're at now. And obviously, there'll be some repositioning going on. We'll continue to invest in labor. We are still building the leadership team below Tom's direct leadership team. Then we'll have payoffs in the future. As we've described in the past, we're front-loading, for example, on the finance organization until we get our new ERP system in, and then we'll be able to take out cost in the back end. We're also going to invest in e-commerce and in marketing. And we'll have some headwinds related to depreciation as our investments are more e-commerce related. Having said that, we feel really good about the progress that we're doing in terms of ZBB. We're really turning over every stone. So we think we're going to offset those increases as we go forward. Bottom line, as it relates to SG&A levering, it's going to come back to the top line and the comp growth.","Scot Ciccarelli","But just to be clear, Tom, so you're -- when you said comfortable with the level we're at, you're talking total SG&A dollars kind of flattish in 2018 versus 2017?","Thomas Okray","Correct.","Operator","And our next question will come from the line of Dan Wewer with Raymond James.","Dan Wewer","I want to ask about the adjusted debt EBITDAR. It looks like it's been unchanged, the 2.9x for about 3 quarters. What kind of conversations are you having with the rating agencies in terms of a timeline that they would like to see for the return to the 2.5x threshold? And then also curious, with the cash flow benefits from tax reform, that happens below the EBITDAR rate, so with your conversation with the rating agencies, are they thinking about looking at that metric differently to include that unexpected cash flow benefits from the lower tax rate.","Thomas Okray","Well, as S&P already includes cash flow in terms of how they look at the ratings. To your specific question though, we have regular conversations with the rating agencies. I won't comment on their behalf, but we're very happy with the cash flow that we've generated, free cash flow up 56%. We think that, that's attractive to both equity and debt investors, but yes, we've had great conversations with both S&P and Moody's.","Dan Wewer","So there's not an expectation -- there's not a timeline as to when that needs to return to the 2.5x threshold?","Thomas Okray","No timeline that they've given us. No.","Dan Wewer","I guess -- and then a separate question. You talked about the 2 new distribution centers and the pressure that's putting on your gross margin rate. Were those the facilities that opened in Nashville and in Houston? And I'm a bit confused. Those opened before you joined -- Or those were in the process of opening before you guys joined, and so they really don't fit with the long-term supply chain outlook? Is that correct?","Thomas Greco","What we said, Dan, was that they opened before we completed the end-to-end supply chain work. And they did -- they were approved in mid '16. I mean it takes a while to approve these. Obviously, you're talking about long term -- this is a 500,000 square foot building, so they were approved relatively shortly after I joined, certainly before Tom joined. But I was here. We approved, then we just haven't done the end-to-end supply chain work.","Dan Wewer","And so this is going to be an overhang on the gross margin rate for quite another 2 or 3 quarters?","Thomas Okray","Yes. It will be for a couple of quarters, which really makes our results in Q4 from gross margin I think all the more interesting. I mean, we had a big headwinds from the supply chain. We also had a headwind from the inventory optimization. We've really had great performance on our material cost optimization and in fact, we've good working relationship with our vendor partners. Another headwind was trade. That will get turning the other way when we start seeing the growth in comps going. So we're happy with where we're positioned in gross profit. But you're right, for the next couple of quarters, we will see headwinds related to the DCs in the supply chain area.","Operator","And our next question will come from the line of Chris Bottiglieri with Wolfe Research.","Chris Bottiglieri","A couple of questions. I guess just to start. Piecing together a bit on what you said on the call today, I was wondering if you could update us on the $750 million cost takeouts, kind of how far you are on that gross number by the end of 2018? So we think about comp deleverage, they don't set that wage inflation that everyone's seeing in new DCs that Dan just referenced, the increased investment you're making on finance and ecomm, supply chain headwinds near term and then the margin improvement, if that is your guidance. Tell us something are we a lot -- so I would imagine, it's really north of $100 billion. Just want to get your perspective on kind of where you are on those gross takeouts.","Thomas Greco","Yes. Well, first of all, we're on track for the $750 million. That was gross productivity that we communicated, and then we'll hit that number in the time frame we committed. We're making real progress on taking out costs in each of the areas that we talked about. Everything that you just referenced is included in the guide. Obviously, we knew about the DCs. We've been investing in our front line really since the tail end of 2016. You think about some of the challenges we face back then, our turnover in the key positions was really off the charts. General managers, commercial parts pros, customer account managers, DMs. And we introduced essentially a stock ownership program that we called Fuel the Frontline, and that was a pretty big investment for us in 2017. That carries forward into '18. We literally gave out stock awards, performance-based stock awards to thousands of our frontline team members, and that really helps us with this wage inflation issue that you referenced. I can tell you that our turnover in 2017 in each of those jobs was down significantly. And we remain focused on getting the very best parts people in the business to come and work at Advance, and this has been a key lever for us to go do that. So we're very mindful of making sure that we're investing in our people, and that's fully included in the guide.","Chris Bottiglieri","Got you, okay then. Then one related. So it sounds like the 20 basis points of pressure from, what we call, supply chain cost, it sounds like, unfortunately, inherited those costs before you took over. You're originally looking for 100 basis points of pressure, that fell to about 20 in the back half. So as you kind of cut inventory costs, how do you think about -- I know it's not cash, but how do you think about the level of those margin headwinds in 2018?","Thomas Okray","You're talking to the inventory optimization, Chris?","Chris Bottiglieri","Yes, exactly. The previously capitalized supply chain costs as you kind of cut your inventory, you incur those.","Thomas Okray","Yes. You could expect that to be approximately flat going forward for '18, so the headwinds should subside in '18.","Thomas Greco","Yes. I'll add, Chris, that this is a big opportunity for us. I think we learned a lot last year, and we were happy that we got -- we're able to get it down by $157 million. There is more opportunity there. We're going to do it smart though, and we do it in a way that doesn't impact the customer. So it's a very important driver of cash flow for us, so we're very focused on it. And as Tom said, this cash council that I attend every other week is really driving the focus on all elements of working capital and cash flow metrics. So we feel very good about our ability to continue to drive cash flow.","Thomas Okray","Yes. We fully recognize that our inventory velocity is not where it needs to be. But back to your question, on a year-over-year basis, we should be basically flat.","Operator","And our next question will come from the line of Bret Jordan with Jefferies.","Bret Jordan","On integrating the DC network subject, I guess, is the software in place? I mean you're rewriting the APEX software. Do you have the systems finished now where you can start consolidating the supply chain?","Thomas Greco","They're not finished. We continue to work on it, Brett. We're taking this one step at a time, but it's very much underway, the technology work to get that enabled is underway.","Bret Jordan","Do you have a feeling for a timing on that?","Thomas Greco","We're not communicating that at this point. But we do have a feeling for it. We are continuing to work through it.","Bret Jordan","Okay. And I guess the second question would be, if you look at your collection of distribution centers, the 54 that you have, and you think about where you need to be in a couple of years as far as consolidating that, do you think you have the assets today where you can just sort of call the herd, or do you have to build out incremental distribution infrastructure to fill out the gaps?","Thomas Greco","That's part of the validation work that we have this year. Certainly, we've got more assets than we need, okay? But I get your point. Are there additional things that we need to do? I think there are parts of the country where our footprint is relatively light. And by the way, they happen to be very growing parts of the country that we are thinking through. But overall, we have more than we need, whether or not we have to add some back in certain areas is something we're validating.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Alan Rifkin with BTIG.","Alan Rifkin","So 2018 is going to represent the fifth year post the acquisition. And admittedly, Tom, you've only been there a little less than 2 years. But as we look at the integration and transformation expenses forecasted for 2018, they're materially higher than what we saw in '17. I guess my first question is, do you have a rough idea when these integration expenses will cease? And the $140 million to $180 million in expenses, approximately how many stores and\/or DCs might that include?","Thomas Okray","Yes. So again, let me unpack the integration expenses, Alan. The GPI amortization of intangible assets, that's going to be $40 million ongoing into the future. The GPI integration piece, that is going to come down significantly and start to subside in '18; '19, it will be virtually gone. Where we will start to increase is our transformation expenses. That's where we will get at the supply chain and the store footprint, which we've been talking about on the call. We're not going to talk about the time line here. We're doubling down on those activities in terms of testing in '18, but we would expect them to go on for the next couple of years.","Alan Rifkin","Okay. And a follow up, if I may, with respect to the inventory rationalization. By the end of '17, it was certainly less than what you had guided to at the beginning of '17. Is that because there is less inventory, in your opinion, to write down? Or do you just think, Tom Greco, that the inventory reduction program will take longer? And is an incremental $800 million to $900 million in inventory reduction, is that a pretty good number to go by?","Thomas Greco","Well, first of all, I think what happened last year, we did a number of things on reducing inventory. And candidly, some of them worked extremely well, and some of them, we didn't feel worked as well. So we refined our plans very quickly after we started to see it was compromising the customer proposition because we're not going to do that. We're putting the customer first in everything we do. The single biggest opportunity we have is to drive market share in our category, in our industry, and that's kind of the superordinate goal. So when we see something that's compromising that superordinate goal, we're going to pull back, Alan. And fundamentally, that's what we did.","So the overall plan to drive inventory down is a thoughtful one. It has multiple components to it. Some of which, obviously, you can appreciate, would be related to our footprint optimization. So there are some unlocks there. Some of it is about stratifying SKUs differently than we have in the past. But I think, overall, I think your number is in the ballpark. It's going to be a multi-year journey for us to get there.","Operator","And our next question will come from the line of Chris Horvers with JPMorgan.","Chris Horvers","I wanted to follow up on the operating margin outlook. You operate in a very high cost business. So I was curious, if you sort of -- if you didn't have the productivity opportunities, what level of operating margin deleverage is a natural headwind in the business on a flat to down to comp?","Thomas Greco","Yes. It's a tough hypothetical question to answer if you didn't have the productivity agenda. I mean, obviously, every business needs to have a productivity agenda to offset inflation, to offset any sort of headwinds that you have in normal business, whether it's fuel or our wages. So I want to stay away from the hypothetical and just tell you how I'm thinking about '18. I really expect us to do well in gross margin and have gross margin be favorable to the prior year. We're doing some fantastic things on material costs and defects. We'll have our inventory optimization headwinds subsiding. We'll continue to see supply chain headwinds, as we've talked about. And as it relates to SG&A, where -- whether we lever there and how much we lever there is really going to come back to the top line growth.","Chris Horvers","Understood. And then as you think about -- I know you only guided comps for the year, but how -- is there any commentary you didn't give in terms of the potential cadence over the year? Do you think 2-year stock continue to improve in 1Q? You had the disruption in the second to the third -- third quarter from the field structure changes. So any comments on cadence would be great.","Thomas Greco","Yes. Obviously, we're focused on continuous improvements. So I mean I think I look at the back half of last year, where we had the peak of the disruption, right, Chris. That looks like a big opportunity for us. We're just going to be focused on fill rate and in-stock and making sure that weekend service is right for our customers. Last year, at this time, we were heading into a period where we were thinking about reducing our regions from 34 to 12 and making major changes. And I just have to say, that's just a very disruptive event. No matter how many times I've done it, there's always disruption associated with that.","So obviously, the year has started out well. I mean the first part of the year in Northern geographies was very cold. We love potholes on the road. I grew up around them, I'm hoping that there's a ton of potholes. I hope they don't repair them. And we're going to have a very strong spring selling season associated with that. So we feel good about the way the front half set up. But I would say the back half looks like we can really start to make some gains.","Operator","And our next question will come from the line of Matt Fassler with Goldman Sachs.","Matt Fassler","My first question kind of a cleanup for Tom Okray. Tom, If you could just specify if you didn't already what portion of the transformation charges that you expect to book in 2018 will be cash? And how that would compare to the cash component of those charges in 2017?","Thomas Okray","Yes. I mean we're not going to go into the details, specifically, to say how much is going to be cash. But a healthy portion of it will be cash, which is why we put the guide together that we did for our free cash flow. Obviously, if you look at our free cash flow, we're starting out with $411 million in 2017. We've got tailwinds related to tax reform, working capital improvement and high ROI. But we have the tailwinds associated with CapEx, the transformation related to your question, and none -- and one-time equipment sales which happened in 2017 that won't happen in 2018, so.","Matt Fassler","Understood. And then secondly, if we could take a step back on the top line. You're guiding to a level of revenue growth, same-store growth below the level that your peers are guiding to. And you're guiding essentially to market share loss. And my understanding that last year was a year where you put the business through a lot -- through the transformation effort, it sounds like some of that will continue, but probably to a less extreme degree. Is there a reason based on the distractions or disruption in the business or the desire to walk away from some less profitable business? Anything in particular you've put your finger on to say, \"This is the reason why you should not expect us to hold pace with the market in 2018?\" Or would you ascribe it to a conservatism? Because your comments on sales a moment ago, in answering the prior question seemed pretty constructive on both the first half and the second half of the year.","Thomas Greco","Yes, Matt. It's really about being prudent and thoughtful with our cost base. I mean we really do feel very good about the sales outlook. And we measure market share based on what people report, not based on what they guide to. So if we look at our performance in 2017, we did narrow the gap. The guidance is something that every company looks at in different ways. And at the end of the day, the scoreboard will look at us when we report our sales at the end of the first quarter, second, et cetera.","Thomas Okray","Yes. It's very difficult to take the cost structure out once you put it in. It's much easier to add costs when the sales are growing.","Matt Fassler","So it sounds like we should take the cost structure associated with that comp guidance extremely seriously and to kind of watch the top line as it evolves?","Thomas Greco","That's a good way to look at it.","Operator","And our next question will come from the line of Mike Baker with Deutsche Bank.","Mike Baker","Within both the first quarter margin and the full year margin guidance, can you talk about what you'd expect for gross margin trends within that?","Thomas Okray","Yes. We don't want to get down to the gross margin and SG&A guidance. But what I'll tell you is, I would expect for both the Q1, as well as the fiscal year, that we will have -- we will be favorable year-over-year.","Mike Baker","Okay. And then so we can then -- on the first question, specifically, you said that the 0 to 25 was now [no] some thoughts on gross margin, but that 0 to 25-basis-point spread is predicated on sales. It sounds like you're not giving specific first quarter guidance. But I mean any idea of what kind of comp is associated with a flat margin in the first quarter versus up 25 basis points in the first quarter?","Thomas Greco","Yes. I mean we're not going to guide on sales for the quarter, Mike. But again, we're very excited about the outlook for the year on sales. And we're going to continue to focus on beating the sales guidance we've given by the widest margin possible. That's the focus of everybody in the company.","Mike Baker","So if I could ask one more follow-up. Is there anything relative to the 16 weeks in the first quarter that things get easier or more difficult as you go through the quarter? I know just about a year ago, where we had the big tax refund dip, which a year ago at this time was down $59 billion and now it's about flat. How does that play into the sort of cadence of trends throughout the first quarter?","Thomas Greco","Yes. Obviously, we certainly saw that last year, Mike, and I think everyone spoke about it. But in our case with the 16-week quarter, I think it evened out at least for us. We didn't attribute any sales softness to the tax refund situation last year. It was really more about timing thing as far as we were concerned. I mean we couldn't find it. I mean we, obviously, saw the $59 billion. We look at that thing every week when it comes out. As I think you wrote in one of your notes, it's up year-on-year right now, marginally. The 2-year stock looks horrendous right now for the very reason you talked about. But eventually, that money comes back into the economy and to our customers pockets. And when it does, they're going to come and want their car to be repaired and they're going to want to fix it. So I don't think that plays out at least for us in the first quarter.","Operator","And our next question will come from the line of Steve Forbes with Guggenheim Securities.","Steve Forbes","So you mentioned the $70 million of cash flow tied to tax reform right now. There was no change to your investment plan that you provided in the fourth quarter. So given the action of other retailers broadly, especially as it relates to wages and benefits that you're focused, especially your message today on driving improved top line momentum, can you expand on why you're confident that your investment plans for next year is sufficient, especially as it relates to people?","Thomas Greco","Well, we really measure turnover, right? I mean that's the key one for me, Steve. You got to make sure that you're keeping the best people, the parts people who are really critical to that customer relationship. And we look at that every 4 weeks. We measure our turnover. We look at it year-on-year by job type. And I would describe turnover as a leading indicator, right? If it's going up, which, honestly, when I got here, was going through the roof on the big core 4 jobs that are customer facing, that's not a good sign, right?","So we had to invest back in our people to make sure that we were getting the best parts people we could. And it's been going down for several periods in a row. So we'll stay focused on that. We, obviously, have ongoing dialogues with our frontline team members. They are very important to us. And we're going to continue to make sure that they love coming into work everyday, and they're excited about it.","And as I said, I think it was a little over 4,000 were awarded stock ownership in the company. It's a model that we like a lot because it creates ownership. Our people celebrate those wins. So it's very important to keep great people in the company, and that's what we're focused on, and we do it in a way that's holistic. We don't look at like one-offs. I mean, as you probably know, different states have changed their minimum wage and other retailers are taking their starting salaries up, those types of things are going on around us, but we don't look at it in a vacuum. We look at it holistically.","Steve Forbes","And then as a follow up. Maybe just your high-level thoughts here, right? So you mentioned you're not going to talk about a time line for the supply chain optimization. But I believe, right, it was clearly part of the $750 million 4-year target, right, from the productivity agenda. So how do we piece this together, right? Are you seeing greater opportunity in material cost optimization and ZBB? Or will you still be able to capture enough supply chain savings, right, maybe not dependent on a particular time line to get us to the same place? I mean how do we think about this high level as you try to help us conceptualize the gross to net and the margin opportunity that exists?","Thomas Greco","We feel very confident that the elements of the supply chain strategy that are firm, that are embedded in the $750 million, we will execute in the time frame that we've called out. But there some other things that are less certain at this stage that may not happen, we're not sure. But overall, the $750 million is the $750 million. We feel good about the $750 million.","Thomas Okray","Yes. What I would add to that is there's 2 buckets of supply chain optimization. One is just the daily supply chain, less touches, better received, better pick-pack-stow, better truck utilization. And that is the foundation of what's in the $750 million as it relates to supply chain. There's a separate bucket which is the end-to-end supply chain, which is treated as a separate project, if you like, and really connected, but viewed separately from the $750 million.","Steve Forbes","And then on that end to end, right? You touched on the incremental transformation expenses and so forth. And as you kind of develop this plan and test it this year, I mean, is there a range of expenses that we can start thinking about, whether it's both capital investments and expenses? What it would take to get you where you need to go? I mean you said it's going to be around, right, maybe $100 million over the next couple of years? How big is it?","Thomas Okray","Yes. We're not going to talk about specific expenses at this time. But what I will talk about is opportunity. When you look at our gross margin compared to our competitors, a big difference in terms of our gross margin rate is supply chain. We have a lot of work to do there, so the upside in terms of gross margin that will flow through too -- overall, bottom line is, it's quite large.","Operator","And our next question will come from the line of Elizabeth Suzuki with Bank of America.","Elizabeth Suzuki","I just had a quick housekeeping item, and you may have answered this already and I missed it. But could you talk about what percentage of your sales are currently taking place online? Or what that number was in 2017 versus 2016? And just what the gross rate looks like for online sales versus total company?","Thomas Greco","We don't split that out. We were very excited about the growth that we've had in online, and we're going to continue to invest in it. Our website improvements were significant in the back half of this year -- sorry, of '17. And we did see a pretty big surge at the end of the year, and we're continuing to see that into this year. And we're going to continue to make sure that we serve our customers how and where they want to be served. And if they want to buy online and have it shipped to home, they want to buy online and pick up in store, we're really working towards the omnichannel experience really throughout the enterprise.","So we've put that into our overall DIY number. Obviously, we look at it from DIY. We also have a pretty big online business on the professional side, where Bob Cushing has led with Worldpac a really strong website that is very, very user-friendly, customer-friendly, all those kinds of things.","Elizabeth Suzuki","Okay. But is it fair to say that the growth in online is, generally, outpacing total company sales growth?","Thomas Greco","Yes, yes. Both in terms of DIY and in terms of professional.","Operator","And our next question will come from the line of Ben Bienvenu with Stephens Inc.","Ben Bienvenu","I want to ask about tax reform. It sounds like you're not planning on reinvesting into incremental wages, though you are making a number of investments more broadly mutually exclusive from tax reform. So I wonder, it sounds like a turnover is a key metric you're tracking as it relates to how you think about investing in wages and field level associates. How willing are you be -- how willing might you be to change your posture on tax reform reinvestment in light of a tightening labor market more broadly and even within your own industry?","Thomas Greco","Ben, first of all, I want to just clarify, well, we are investing in frontline compensation, okay? You used the term wages. We look at the total, right? And when we make a pretty big investment in field to frontline, which we did last year, we are investing in our people. It is intended to incent them and compensate them at a level that they get excited about. So we have been investing in our frontline compensation, and we're going to continue to stay focused on that.","So the tax reform that came whenever it was late in the year, we had set our plan, we were very aware of the competitive dynamics around wage inflation, not just within auto parts, but in broader retail. And as we built our plan for 2018, that was all factored in. So to the extent that we've got to address specific markets, we'll go ahead and do that. But the environments, I would call it, the labor environment itself is something that we look at very closely as we build our financial plan for 2018. And we want to make sure that we're driving -- making Advance a great place to work and attracting the best parts people we can. So you're going to continue see us with that as an overarching goal. And how we achieve that through different methods of compensation is something that we spend a lot of time on.","Ben Bienvenu","Okay, great. And then, for Tom Okray, a clarify on the guidance. I think you said gross margin percentage should be in flat, up in 1Q and then up in the full year. When you combine that with sort of flattish SG&A dollars year-over-year, that seems to make it hard to get towards the top end of the EBIT margin guidance. So can you help us think about sort of the puts and takes within the range of the EBIT margin guidance relative to those comments?","Thomas Okray","Yes. I'm not going to go into specific split between gross margin and SG&A. I'm just telling you that we feel good and expect expansion in gross margin year-over-year. SG&A expansion or SG&A leverage is going to be very dependent on the top line.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Matt McClintock with Barclays.","Matt McClintock","Tom, you kind of hit it upon this earlier, but just in terms of the store optimization going forward. Historically, the company has shared kind of an expectation for a recapture rate. Could you share that this time around? And also, what did you learn last time that lessons learned that may be prevented from achieving that recapture? And what are you doing this time around to ensure in a better sense that you will be able to recapture a lot of that business?","Thomas Greco","Yes, a good question. I think a couple of things. First of all, I can tell you unequivocally the level of rigor and discipline that we put into evaluating our store fleet is a factor greater than it was. We are looking at a very large list of variables. How far away from one store to the other is it? What's the competitive dynamic? What's the growth rate? What's the margin? Professional? DIY mix? All of those factors go into it. And then in terms of what is the [do different], the big levers, right, are, how do I retain the professional business, which is difficult, and I want to be clear, in our business and I think for all of the major players, it's difficult to retain the professional business when you close a store and try to move it to another store. But we have a plan to do that much better than we have in the past. And I'm not going to communicate the specific number, but we know the number that we have typically achieved in the past in terms of retention of that professional business. And obviously, our goal is to, at minimum, achieve that and anything above that is actually upside.","DIY is harder, obviously. You've got shoppers that are coming into that store. It's more of a proximity there so, but we do have some solutions there that pertain to more online, Speed Perks, loyalty card, those types of things to retain the DIY sales. And then the third factor is, obviously, the lease itself and what's the obligation that's on the lease when we look at these things. So those 3 variables are the big things that are being considered. And we make sure that when we close that store, when you look out a couple of years, that cash flow picture is extremely rosy. So that's kind of how we're approaching, and I think you're going to see a very different level of discipline and rigor from our field team. We've been very thoughtful about how we're doing it as well, by the way. So when we make a change, it's not going to be concentrated in an area. We're going to have -- we have 12 regions, so each of the regions will have a fairly short list of projects to work on, and we're going to rack and stack and make sure we execute it flawlessly.","Operator","And our next question will come from the line of Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer.","David Bellinger","This is David Bellinger on for Brian. So a couple of questions from us. And first, shifting back to e-commerce. So you mentioned wipers is a positive in Q4. That should be a category that lends well to online sales. So can we take that as further evidence that online competitors are simply not pushing aggressively into the space, at least at this point? Or is there anything new in terms of online competition from your perspective?","Thomas Greco","Well, Brian, first of all, yes, I mean, the wipers sales have been through the roof. As you guys are living up there in New York, it's been a good year for wipers with snow, and ice and rain. Mike Broderick, obviously, leads our category team. We've got a terrific category strategy on wipers. I think it's probably one of the first ones where we are starting to see the fruits of our labor in terms of putting a very disciplined category plan in place that works. We refined our planograms I think in the fourth quarter of 2017, and we're seeing a big uptick.","So it's honestly not surprising, I would say, to us that the wiper business has responded the way it has. We actually -- obviously, look at market share very closely. We look at NPD. We gained market share in the fourth quarter on wipers. And we gained market share in period 1. And we also -- keep in mind, we install wipers for our customers, and that's a big deal. That parking lot service that we provide is a real advantage versus an online player where you've got to do it yourself. So those are the couple of the big factors.","David Bellinger","Got it. And then my follow-up, on Worldpac. So you mentioned sales have been above average for a few quarters now. So is there anything behind that outperformance? Or is it simply a better inventory position? Or there are some other factor helping those stores relative to the Advance store base?","Thomas Okray","Yes. So for Worldpac, if you go back probably 20 years, we've been outperforming the industry, this whole is base upon the technology. And so basically, the online presence obviously that we have there with our customer, the B2B side, the assortment strategy that we basically have incorporated through the years there. And sort of what we call the ease of doing business.","So importantly, with all that technology that we've developed over the years, we're bringing that same technology to Advance. So when you think about true demand, which drives assortment strategy, when we look at the new B2B platform that we put out which is fully integrated with SMS' Advanced Pro, what we've just done recently with the cross-banner visibility, where in-market customers have access to basically the full offering portfolio of brands, all of that is key elements to it. And as I mentioned, importantly, for all of us is that we look at what is the technology which is a differentiator for us, and that technology is being brought to advantage, we've released it, and we're going to continue to do it throughout 2018.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Carolina Jolly with Gabelli.","Carolina Jolly","I'll just ask a really quick one here. Can you talk about any discrepancies around your comps that you saw across the regions? Any spread between regions?","Thomas Greco","Sure. I mean, for the year, Carolina, we -- the West and the Southwest was our best-performing geographies. And I think, honestly, they benefited last year disproportionately from the weather. So I mean, last year was a year where I wish I would have had more stores in the west. We had a great year in the west. Our RVP up there is terrific. She did a great job. The Southwest was also strong for us. And then they were both strong in the fourth quarter.","As it pertains to shortfalls, we weren't -- we had a very tough quarter in the North Central, North Midwest. Northeast was better, okay? But north-central, North Midwest was very tough last year and in December. We love it when you've got continuous days of 0 to 15 degree weather. And last year, in December, we had that in the north midwest and north-central. It was a big, big December, huge actually. That didn't happen in December. But honestly, we did benefit from that early part of this year, but it didn't show up in the fourth quarter. So West and Southwest best, north central and North Midwest lowest, and in Northeast improved versus where we've been.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session for today. So it's my pleasure to hand the conference back over to Mr. Tom Greco, President and Chief Executive Officer, for some closing comments and remarks. sir?","Thomas Greco","Well, thanks again for joining us today, everyone. As you heard, we're really pleased with how we finished 2017. And we're confident that we're putting the necessary pieces in place to drive long-term growth. We are firmly committed to the continued execution of our strategic plan, and we appreciate your ongoing support. We acknowledge that there is a great deal of work ahead of us. But we have got a talented, very committed team in place, and we're poised to capture the opportunities ahead of us. And we look forward to speaking to you again in May when we discuss our first quarter results. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation on today's conference.

Thank you, everyone. Good evening, I'm Zaheed Mawani, and I run Investor Relations. Welcome to the AAP combined earnings and strategic business plan update meeting. We're very excited to be here today and share this update with you over the next couple of hours.","Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that our comments today contain forward-looking statements. Please refer to our earnings release that we issued today for more details as it relates to our third quarter.","We have a great agenda for you today. So we're going to get into a third-quarter recap, and then we will go right into strategic plan highlights, followed by a question-and-answer session. And then afterwards, we will be serving light refreshments, and members of the management team will be here for introductions and discussion. Okay, with that, let's get started.","And I'm going to turn it over to Tom Greco, our President and CEO, to get us going. Tom?","Tom Greco","Well, thanks, Zaheed, and good evening, everyone. We're really thrilled to see all of you here today. I'd like to welcome all of you to our event, both those of you here in the audience, as well as those of you joining us on the webcast. We greatly appreciate your interest in our business, and we're very excited to share our progress with you today. We'll start by providing a brief recap of the third-quarter results, and then we'll transition to an overview of our strategic business plan. We've been developing this over the past several months. With that, let's get right into it.","Our comp-store performance in Q3 was down 1% as our initiatives to improve top-line performance began to have an impact. While we delivered sequential improvement versus previous quarters, let me be clear. We will be relentless in our pursuit of positive comp sales.","In terms of profitability, our adjusted operated margin rate of 9.7% and adjusted EPS of $1.73 were impacted by three primary drivers, all of which we called out during our Q2 call. First, we made investments in the quarter to better-serve our customers. Secondly, we took deliberate actions to reduce inventory levels versus Q2, which resulted in cost headwinds. Going forward, we'll continue to bring our inventory levels down without disrupting our customers. And third, we faced higher supply chain operating expenses in the quarter, including our planned transition from 5X to 3X delivery frequency in selected markets.","As for our top-line performance, while it's still early, we're encouraged by our sales improvement, as the heightened focus on execution translated to improved input metrics and ultimately sales. We remain relentlessly focused on execution and we're going to make investments in customer service and availability to align our entire organization around the customer and around gaining market share.","To date, our investments have driven sales performance at a faster rate than expected. On our Q2 call, we called out back-half investments in three areas in availability, in customer service and in our front-line organizations. All three of these investments have been promising. In terms of availability, we have a number of initiatives underway that test different ways of positioning our inventory, of assorting parts and of delivering parts to our customers. These tests are being conducted throughout our network. The initiatives all have the same end-game get the right part in the right place at the right time consistently, reliably and predictably.","As we work to improve availability, we're working to do so at less cost and with more availability. We're testing these initiatives in multiple phases and we're applying some of the learnings to our base business. So far, we like many aspects of what we're seeing and we plan to roll out these initiatives in 2017. We also see elements of our test that we can leverage in the future, and we'll discuss the progress we're making on availability later when we review our strategic business plan.","In terms of investments in our customers, we're equally encouraged. This includes investments in availability, in store labor and in a front-line incentive program. These investments enable our front-line team to compete at the absolute highest level and position them to win with our customers. In particular, the incentive program we launched has been extremely well-received by our field team, and almost immediately has had a step-function impact on reducing turnover in all front-line roles. Our field team is fired up and they're increasing their focus on what matters most to our valued customers.","In summary, we're encouraged by the investments we've made in availability in our customers, and in our front-line team. On a regional basis, we saw comp sales improvement in every region in the country. While performance in the Northeast and Great Lakes still lagged our overall business, it improved as our actions to improve performance in some of our more challenged distribution centers paid off. Our teams in these regions are excited about the changes as we're giving them the chance to say yes to our customers more often.","To sum up Q3, we're encouraged by the progress we're making and the momentum that is building behind our efforts. That said, we still have a significant amount of work to do to dramatically change the trajectory of our business. Accordingly, we're maintaining a very disciplined approach to improving customer service, as it's absolutely vital that we get this right for the long term. We're focused on delivering consistent sales and profit improvement over the long term, not just the next quarter. We'll continue to sharpen our focus on execution, improve availability, and deliver on the needs of our customers as we execute our strategy.","I'll be back up shortly to provide an update on our strategic plan. But before I do, it's my absolute pleasure to introduce Tom Okray to give a brief third-quarter update on our financial and operational highlights. Tom brings more than 25 years of experience in finance, operations and supply chain to AAP. Most recently, he served as VP, Finance, Global Customer Fulfillment at Amazon, where he was the finance lead overseeing the optimization of all key elements of Amazon's global fulfillment network. In addition, Tom spent over 20 years at General Motors in finance and supply chain-related roles. He was most recently responsible for overseeing more than 120 billion in annual expenses and 8 billion in CapEx as CFO, Global Product Development, Purchasing and Supply Chain.","Tom is absolutely passionate about winning in the marketplace and he's laser-focused on what matters most to our customers. He knows what it takes to win in the digital world and he's bringing an entirely new dimension to our thinking as we navigate the future. We're thrilled to be joined by Tom, given his unique background and deep operating experience, as we write the next chapter of growth for AAP. Tom?","Tom Okray","Thanks, Tom, and good evening, everyone. Before I begin my prepared remarks, I just want to briefly share how thrilled I am to be a part of the AAP team. I joined the organization at a very exciting time, as we refocus the Company on our most important priority, the customer. We will work to improve our service levels, our overall execution, and without a doubt, our operating and financial performance. I also want to thank Mike Norona for assisting with my transition and our third quarter financial close. Total sales for the third quarter decreased 2% to $2.25 billion, principally driven by our comp-store sales decline of 1%, store closures, and Carquest consolidations. The declines were partially offset by growth at Worldpac, store conversions and new stores.","Our gross profit rate decline of 104 basis points was primarily driven by higher supply chain expenses and headwinds associated with reducing inventory. Our adjusted SG&A rate was essentially flat year over year, driven by continued cost-reduction initiatives, partially offset by investments in delighting our customer. All in, our third-quarter adjusted operating income came in at $217.6 million. Adjusted operating margin decreased 95 basis points over the same period last year, to 9.7%. Operating cash flow through the third quarter was $409.4 million versus $520.1 million last year, primarily driven by an increase in inventory versus last year, and lower sales. While we have not provided an annual EPS outlook, we'd like to give some context on how we're thinking about the balance of the year.","We're encouraged by our sales improvement in Q3. However, it's early and we have a lot of work to do. Additionally, as you may know, our fourth quarter is our lowest volume and most volatile quarter of the fiscal year. We expect continued headwinds in our operating margin rate, similar to what we experienced in the third quarter, as we continue to invest in our customers, our inventory, and optimize our supply chain network. That wraps up our third quarter recap. We're going to transition to discussing elements of our strategic business plan.","With that, I'll turn it over to Tom Greco.","Tom Greco","Thanks, Tom. So at this point, we're going to transition to the strategic business plan. This plan has been several months in the making, and we couldn't be more excited about our prospects for the future. Our plan is deeply rooted in focused consumer and customer research for both DIY customers and professional customers. Our goal is to dramatically improve performance across the board through a step-change in customer service. Please understand, we'd like to share as much of our plan as we possibly can with you. At the same time, we feel it's in our best interest of all concerned that we're careful on just how much we share about our plan, for competitive reasons. Also understand that if you're left wanting for more details, we've spent considerable time analyzing the pros and cons of doing so, and we've concluded that it's not in our or shareholders' best interest to do so. That said, we've got a very compelling plan to capitalize on the enormous growth opportunity that we have at AAP. And we're excited to share our plans to deliver improved results and shareholder value.","Before we get started, I know this might be the first time we're getting to know each other. There's some new people in new positions at Advance and for some of you, this includes me. Stepping back, and with the benefit of my first six months in the role, along with close to 30 years of experience at PepsiCo and Frito-Lay, I'm confident we're in a great position to capitalize on the opportunity ahead. Many of the ingredients for success that I enjoyed at PepsiCo are transferable here: Constructing a demand driven growth agenda that's rooted in customer and consumer insights. Transforming the supply chain to build new capabilities and drive productivity and empowering the front-line organization to drive execution and operating improvement.","Without question, I see the application of each of these learnings here at Advance. In fact, there's more opportunity to drive growth and productivity at AAP than any role that I've ever had. We'll discuss the opportunities that we see going forward throughout the presentation.","It's also my pleasure today to introduce Bob Cushing, right there in the middle of the slide. Bob recently assumed the newly created role of Executive Vice President, Professional Sales, where he will oversee all of the Company's professional sales operation, including Advance, Carquest, Autopart International, and of course, Worldpac. Today we're rebranding what was formerly known as our commercial business, to professional. Professional is a name that our customers prefer and as a result, that's the name we're going to use going forward.","Bob is perfectly suited to head up this business. He's an exceptionally talented industry veteran, with over 30 years of experience in the industry, and he's been the driving force behind the tremendous growth and market-leading position that Worldpac enjoys today. Importantly, Bob is very competitive. You're going to see that today. He's going to be relentless in driving outcomes, and he'll expect nothing less than the best as he instills a high-performing culture and makes sure we execute to win in the marketplace. In addition to Bob, later in the presentation, we'll hear once again from Tom with a discussion on how our strategy translates to an outlook to the future.","So let's get started. I'd like to begin with what we'd like you to take away from today's event. First, we operate in a terrific industry. It's large and growing, with attractive dynamics across the board. Secondly, AAP has a very compelling market position, including industry-leading assets, tools, and capabilities for us to leverage. Third, we have a tremendous opportunity to drive growth and margin expansion. But to do so, we need to implement real change not just a change in operations, but a real change in culture. We have to focus on the customer first and begin our journey for everything we do with how we can provide the best possible service for our customers. And fourth, we're already executing a clear, focused agenda to drive change. Fifth, overseeing this effort is an aggressive leadership team that's fully aligned around our plan. In summary, one can only conclude that AAP represents a compelling investment, with tremendous opportunity to deliver shareholder value.","So let's start with the fact that we compete in $135 billion industry that's experienced strong growth for several years, and we see no end in sight. Industry forecasts predict consistent growth over the next five years, led by professional. For certain, the industry continues to benefit from an increase in vehicles in operation, an increase in average age of vehicles, an increase in older vehicles, and an increase in average miles driven per year. These industry fundamentals will drive strong growth for the industry for years to come.","In addition to industry fundamentals, AAP is well positioned to gain market share. We have many advantages, including a Company owned professional business, an extensive North American footprint of fulfillment centers and stores, and the leading distributors of import parts. Clearly we have the assets to succeed and accelerate growth, but to do so, we need to better utilize those assets to our advantage. Without question, AAP has a substantial market share opportunity. We're also keenly aware of evolving industry trends, including ecommerce, technology, electrification, urbanization, ride sharing and autonomous vehicles. As a result, we're excited by the opportunities of today and the opportunities of tomorrow, as we construct our strategic growth agenda.","With disruption comes opportunity. Whatever we do, we must delight the customer. Everything we do starts and stops with the customer. In building our plan, we knew we had to develop a deep and visceral understanding of the customer, and deliver on their needs. Over the last few months, we've conducted the most significant piece of research our Company has ever undertaken. We spent a tremendous amount of time to understand what delights both professional customers and DIY customers.","Of course, ultimately, we must turn those insights into actions. Our professional customers are looking for high quality parts at the time we promise them. We understand this opportunity, and its unquestionably achievable for AAP. The DIYer needs vary widely by vehicle history, repair complexity and their level of expertise. This requires a very focused agenda for our team members. Armed with these insights, we've developed a strategy and a series of initiatives to delight both professional customers and DIY customers. The initiatives are focused on making sure we have the right part in the right place at the right time, and creating a better overall experience for all of our customers.","This leads to the big planks of our agenda. First, building an advantaged supply chain is the cornerstone of our efforts, as we improve availability, delivery consistency and speed, to delight our customers. Secondly, in professional, we're building a dramatic improvement in the customer experience at every single touch point, as we ramp up sales and service capabilities.","Next, in DIY, we're planning changes to improve the in store experience and drive loyalty, as well as a re invention of our online experience. Fourth, our growth agenda will be supported by a robust and ongoing productivity engine that will enable us to expand margins and fuel our growth for years to come. At the center of all of this, of course, is our talent and our culture, which will support and facilitate our ability to execute each initiative.","Let's begin with supply chain. A robust and highly functioning supply chain is absolutely foundational to our success. To achieve this, we plan to leverage our existing supply chain assets. The key in constructing an advantaged supply chain is to build new capabilities to improve availability, delivery consistency and speed, and drive growth, while removing unnecessary costs. I'm highly confident we can achieve this at AAP. We have a very strong asset base in terms of square-footage, inventory and delivery trucks, but they are not optimized today. We will optimize our assets to delight our customers. We've been conducting numerous test-and-learn initiatives over the past few months. In our business, having the right part at the right time is essential. It's table steaks for competing in the industry. As a matter of fact, a few years ago, the Worldpac team actually trademarked the tag line -- the right part at the right time. Our test-and-learn markets are delivering very positive results. This includes a significant increase in, in-market parts availability, a significant decrease in order-to-delivery time, and overall reduction in inventory and days on hand -- all while increasing availability.","Our customers are taking notice, and I quote: whatever you guys are doing, it's working for me. I get parts quicker. Cars spend less time on the lifts, so I get more jobs done. The bottom line here is that our changes are leading to increased sales, lower costs, lower inventory levels, and higher customer satisfaction. In addition to our test- and-learn initiatives, we have an opportunity to streamline our supply chain network and systems. This simplification of our supply chain enables us to get the Advance and Carquest supply chain and network fully integrated. This provides three primary benefits. First, streamlining our supply chain improves product availability. Secondly, it drives significant productivity by reducing spend miles from DC to store. And third, it simplifies our systems and processes by enabling seamless inventory transfer throughout the value chain, which is a huge benefit for our team members and independent partners. Therefore, what we formerly referred to as our integration plan, is now fully embedded in our ongoing strategic business plan. As such, we're no longer going to be discussing progress on integration. We're one Company now, and everyone is focused on the customer. Bottom line, there's no longer discussion about integration, but more about how do we use our supply chain assets better, and rethinking the system to better fulfill customer demand, and more efficiently get more parts closer to more customers.","Now, turning to our professional growth opportunity, we're ramping up sales and customer service capabilities big time. And I'd like to invite Bob Cushing to review our exciting plans for professional customers.","Bob Cushing","Thank you, Tom. It's a pleasure to be with you here today. This is an exciting time to be with AAP. In my early observations, I have recognized the tremendous opportunities that exist today to accelerate our growth. In my new role, I'll drive improved performance across the enterprise by leveraging my experience and our proven capabilities, highly coveted by our customers. My goal is to completely transform our customer sales and service model, both online and in person, on the professional side of our business. I will be highly focused on improving the overall customer experience to dramatically improve our first call and first click capability.","As I've looked across AAP, I've found many assets that are totally under leveraged. So it all starts with attractive brand portfolio. And our customers have spoken. They want high quality "," branded parts to service their customers. And our research confirmed that AAP's parts assortment consistently delivered against this objective, more than any other supplier. While we're pleased with the result, we will continue to work diligently to delight our customers.","Additionally, over the past 40 years, we have developed an industry leading selection of private-label products to meet the needs of our professional customer. AAP's private-label brands support our multi brand strategy, which is what's preferred by our professional customer. So when you look, we start with the significant growth opportunity from a solid base of domestic vehicles in operation. And importantly for our customers, we're ahead of the curve on the growing import opportunity. The vehicle import market share is expected to grow dramatically, as it has over the past 15 years. This will provide a tremendous growth opportunity for AAP across these higher enterprise. We have the import expertise with Worldpac and Autopart International, we've delivered this, and basically built the leading import program for the past 40 years.","Another asset we can leverage better is our training. Our customers want professional training to help grow and improve the profitability and grow their business. Their technicians need advanced technical training, to meet the demands of diagnosing and repairing today's and tomorrow's vehicles. We already have two great tools today. We have the Carquest Technical Institute, and we have the Worldpac Training Institute, which is focused on the import side, again, the opportunity I just described. Together, the Carquest and Worldpac training institutes provides the professional customer the most comprehensive training curriculum in the industry. And it's only available at AAP.","In today's digital world, serving professional customers has to start with an industry leading online experience. And we have a great online asset at Worldpac today. In the research that we conducted, our online experience was rated best-in-class by our customers. This performance was also recognized by Frost & Sullivan research, which found automotive technicians rank Worldpac as the best program distributor. With a comprehensive line of quality products, easy-to-use online system which is speed-dial, outstanding salespeople, competitive pricing, dependable delivery and consistent product availability. I could not more proud of the team for this accomplishment. But as we look forward, the only way we'll leverage this great suite of assets is to put the customer first always. This has been really important to me my entire career, listening to customers, responding to them and providing them what they need: High-quality product assortment, Delivery service that's fast and consistent, Technology to drive growth and ease of doing business, providing our customers with an industry leading catalog, a sales team dedicated to delighting the customer, and training to enable our customers to grow their business.","So now it is our time to shift into high gear. We will knit together and leverage best practices across all of AAP's professional business going forward. I know there are better ways to integrate our supply chain. I know we can leverage our catalog and technology to create a better online experience. And for certain, we will build a more robust sales and customer service culture at AAP. And by the way, we're already doing it. In fact, we just solidified a multi-year agreement with one of the largest customers, who is really pleased with the new am AAP approach.","And I quote the customer: we chose Advance professional based upon their overall enterprise value. The combination of product coverage, local availability, technician training, technology, as well as competitive pricing, made them the right choice both now and into the future. They have a proven track record of great customer service and consistent execution across a large geographic area, which makes them the right strategic partner for the business. The entire AAP team could not be more excited about taking our professional sales to the next level. And we know there's a significant market share opportunity for us as we execute our plan. And we will deliver it.","At this point, I'll kick it back to Tom. Thank you.","Tom Greco","Okay. So now you see why we're so excited about professional. Now I'm going to talk DIY. And we're a little l further along in our journey to accelerate professional than we are in DIY. While we continue to strengthen the DIY plan, we're already seeing signs of improvement in our DIY sales, as we really get focused on the customer. Just like inside professional, our DIY success begins with putting the customer first in everything that we do. We have to build trust, confidence and loyalty with DIYers all over the country. We leveraged some custom, significant research we conducted with DIY customers, and our plan is to delight them at every touch point.","Across the board, we're improving parts availability, we're building engagement platforms that drive traffic, we're ensuring a consistent in-store experience to drive frequency, we're focusing our training on priority segments to build knowledge and capability. And we're revamping our Speed Perks loyalty program. We're also increasing our investment in mobile and digital to seamlessly connect the online and in-store experience, all of which have the common goal of gaining market share. First, we plan to grow our customer base. We've analyzed our business over the past several years, and we have a very clear idea what's been driving our challenges with traffic and sales growth inside of DIY.","Some of the factors driving the decisions on how DIYers choose an auto parts retailer include vehicle history, repair complexity, and their level of expertise. From this, we've identified priority segments where we're confident we have a right to succeed. Meeting the needs of these customers will require thoughtful planning around labor, training and marketing. We're excited about attracting new customers to AAP with targeted marketing and a wider array of services. Next, we'll drive frequency with existing customers. Speed Perks is entering its third full year. To date, we haven't been leveraging the scale of this program as well as we should and will going forward. Our plan is to build customer loyalty with Speed Perks. We now have millions of Speed Perks members, which gives us a deeper understanding of their lifetime value. We're learning more and more about how these customers want to be engaged. And we're building momentum around new ways to cultivate a much stronger relationship with these customers by leveraging insights and analytics around their individual needs and behaviors. Just one additional trip per year by each Speed Perks member results in a tremendous growth number for AAP.","Finally, winning in DIY requires us to improve the overall experience for our customers, both in-store and online. Critically important to achieving this goal is to address the basics of the business. We have to raise our standards on execution. This includes ramping up discipline inside the store, and re-dedicating ourselves to a consistent and exceptional customer experience every single time. We also must ensure that we serve our customers when and how they want to be served, which means elevating our online experience. The end result will be a much better experience for DIYers in every interaction they have with AAP in person, over the phone or online enabling us to build customer trust, confidence and loyalty. Our customers have been telling us that we're making progress in DIY. In the past few months, we've seen an increase in the number of complimentary letters from DIYers all over the country. To read just one: your manager and his staff were so nice and so helpful in what was for me a very stressful situation. His actions have made me an Advance Auto Parts customer for life.","In summary, our team is energized to better-serve the DIYer. And just like in professional, there's a significant market share opportunity in DIY with improved execution. Between the transformation of our supply chain, building out new capabilities in professional, and improving the overall experience for DIYers, we're very bullish on our ability to sequentially accelerate our top-line performance going forward, just like we did in Q3 of this year.","Now, let's talk productivity. Accelerated productivity will fund our journey. In order to sustain investment in growth, a robust productivity engine is absolutely essential. We've gone up and down every single cost line in the entire enterprise to construct our productivity plan. It spans six major categories and will contribute meaningfully to profit growth.","The categories we've targeted are: distribute, ship, run as it pertains to stores, deliver, sell, and support. Please note that while we're removing unnecessary costs, we're also driving new capabilities and investing in long-term growth creation. Our current productivity build delivers 500 million in cost reduction over five years. To be clear, this is a gross number. Some of this will be used to fund our growth and transformation initiatives, so not all of this will flow directly to the bottom line. You'll see the impact of the re-investment of our productivity savings in improving operating margin over the period of the plan.","Our productivity agenda includes three important areas of focus. First, zero-based budgeting, where we're eliminating waste and standardizing our approach to cost control. Secondly, as I mentioned earlier, we plan to streamline our supply chain to drive both effectiveness and efficiency. Simplifying, optimizing and fully leveraging our existing asset base yields big savings in our plan. Finally, we've initiated a substantial piece of work on material input costs. As part of this, we'll leverage procurement and value engineering to round out the big planks of our agenda.","Bottom line, we're entering 2017 with a very high level of confidence in our productivity pipeline. In addition, we're very much looking forward to having Tom Okray provide his perspective, given his extensive experience in large organizations where productivity and cost management play a central role.","Finally, I'd like to touch on talent, culture and capability. Across the organization, you can expect us to be maniacally focused on growing talent, evolving our culture and growing new capabilities. Specifically, we'll grow talent by developing much more robust leadership development programs for our existing leaders. We're also promoting talented leaders who know the parts business cold, and have the capability to do more.","And importantly, we've done a great deal of work on evolving the culture of the Company. This includes building a culture which is obsessively focused on the customer, and one with an exceedingly high level of accountability of ownership and drive for results. Related to this, our leadership team has spent time looking at incentives and ways to empower all of our team members to act like owners. As an example turnover. We put a tremendous focus on reducing turnover, and I'm pleased to inform you that we were down significantly in Q3 versus previous year in each of the key roles in the field.","Finally, we're defining the new capabilities we need across the entire enterprise. Where we lack the talent internally, we're going outside to find people who have industry leading capabilities that we can leverage. And we've already hired several people from outside of AAP that are bringing an entirely new dimension to our thinking as we prepare for the future.","In summary, over the next five years, our plan delivers sequential top line sales improvement, $500 million in gross productivity, substantial margin expansion, and world class talent, culture and capabilities, which will future fit AAP for years to come. ","Now it's my pleasure to invite Tom back to the stage to give you a high level view of how our plan translates to an outlook.","Tom Okray","Thanks, Tom. The opportunities Tom and Bob discussed to deliver improved results are familiar to me. I'm used to putting the customer first always. And I know we can drive accelerated sales growth and margin expansion included in our plan.","Turning to the financial impact of our plan, for 2017, we will deliver positive sales comp growth and a modest increase in operating margin. By 2021, our plan delivers mid single digit comp sales and at least 500 basis points of margin expansion. ","As Tom previously discussed, we're building a platform to enable sustainable growth and operating leverage. To achieve that goal, we've worked backwards from the customer, and balanced our efforts to achieve growth, reduce costs and efficiencies throughout the organization. Importantly, we're also focused on delivering shareholder value. We will deliver strong operating performance, which will generate strong cash flow improvement.","Further, we have tremendous focus on working capital. This includes optimizing our inventory and our payables, which will result in a dramatic improvement in AP ratio. Our strong cash flow generation, combined with a balanced capital allocation plan, enables us to invest in new capabilities such as digital, and growth, such as new market development. We will apply disciplined rigor around driving strong returns and efficient use of capital, as measured by ROIC. We look to return excess cash to shareholders while maintaining our investment grade rating, with a bias towards share repurchases. Together, we have a tremendous opportunity to leverage the largest asset base in the industry to drive shareholder value. I couldn't be more excited about the future of the Company.","And with that, I'd like to ask Tom and Bob to return to the podium. We will take some questions. Zaheed, can you lead us?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","Unidentified Analyst","[Technical Difficulty] Great, first six months -- I guess the biggest follow-up I'd have on this is, if you think about that longer-term goal, getting the 500 basis points of improvement, mid single-digit margins, what do you think is the biggest constraint, if you will, to actually getting there? You've listed a lot of great opportunities. But as you're looking at it, what is the biggest hurdle? Is it the supply chain? Is it getting the culture to move faster? I'd love to hear in your words. And Tom, as a follow-up, just what's -- any CapEx budgetary things we should be thinking about as part of that five year plan?","Tom Greco","I think the big one for me is the customer obsession piece that has to permeate the entire organization. It's something that has been lacking, okay? And we have to get that much deeper embedded into the organization, so that every single team member is out there really doing whatever it takes to provide the best service we can provide to our customers. And we're working very hard at building that culture. We've taken some steps to really elevate and lift up examples of people who were doing that. Because we do have people doing that throughout the organization, but it's not as consistent as we'd like. And that's -- if I could wave a wand and change one thing tomorrow, it would be that. But that's the biggest opportunity area, I think, in terms of getting to where we need to go.","Tom Okray","The way we're looking at CapEx over the plan is basically in line with what we've historically spent. That's our input at this point. Absolute dollars right now.","Zaheed Mawani","Great; why don't we go to the back of the room, Michael?","Michael Lasser","Good evening. It's Michael Lasser from UBS. Two questions. First, Tom, how do you bridge the fact that AAP's operating profit per employee is about almost half the rate of the peers, and how do you bridge that to your plan and your customer focus to get that? And second part of the question is, how do you gain the market share that you've lost, back?","Tom Greco","Sure. Well, first of all, the differential between ourselves and our peers is really around some of the things that we just talked about. I do know, we're not fully leveraging our current asset base across the board. The entirety of our infrastructure can be better-optimized, better-leveraged, and we're taking the steps we need to achieve that goal. So that's a multiyear journey, but we're going to do it in a very disciplined fashion without disrupting our customers. We're not going to knee-jerk, we're not going to rush it. But there's ways that we have already identified to better-leverage the existing asset base that we have, and essentially get to those types of margins that we aspire to.","And then your second, remind me on the second question? Yes, I think we're very focused on driving at what the customer wants. The input metrics that we've identified for our organization have been narrowed significantly. So the number of things our field organization is focused on is down to a much more manageable list. And I think that our cadence, which we go through every week to look at how we're performing against those key input metrics that are customer facing are resulting in, relatively speaking, improved sales performance. And you know, in terms of the customers, getting the customers back, I think we're already getting customers back. We track how many customers we sell to every single week. So I know the absolute number of professional customers we're selling to by week, and we know exactly where our opportunities are. And we're getting the customers back we need to get back.","Zaheed Mawani","Thank you. Simeon, we'll go with you.","Simeon Gutman","Thanks. Tom, I think the first conference call, we talked about some of the issues being more process driven than infrastructure. Curious a lot of the presentation talked about that. Curious if you can update some thoughts on it? And then, Tom, you answered that question about CapEx, saying it's going to be constant. Does that mean we'll either see new stores come back into the mix, or does that constant mean maybe new stores slow down and you put some more investment back into infrastructure? One more and one follow-up. As we often hear, you have the parts in the system, but you're touching it more to get it to the customer. Is that an observation that's fair, and how do you fix that?","Tom Greco","Maybe if I could, Simeon, I'll combine your first and third question. Because I do think how we were getting parts to the customer was not optimal. So we have tested a number of different ways of inventory positioning, of assorting parts, and of how we deliver to the customer. And all of those have been factored into our strategic business plan. Some of them we've just kind of lifted and shifted right away, and moved them to our base business. But we're not going to comment specifically on the things that we're rolling out. But part of the goal is to reduce touches. Obviously we don't want to touch parts; we want to reduce the number of times we touch parts in every part of the supply chain, inside the DC, how many times we touch it on the way to the customer, how many times it gets touched in the store. Touches are bad in a supply chain, so our goal is to reduce touches. But we wanted to do that in a way that enables more availability, and that's the trick that we're trying to balance with.","Zaheed Mawani","We'll come over here to Matt.","Tom Okray","Did you want to me to get the CapEx question?","Zaheed Mawani","Oh, pardon me. Yes.","Tom Okray","Just to finish up? The main buckets of CapEx will be renovation of the existing stores, IT, as well as looking at potentially opening new stores as we get the flywheel going and start gaining market share.","Matt Fassler","Good afternoon. It's Matt Fassler from Goldman Sachs. I guess this one's for Tom Greco. You spoke about culture and the change in the selling culture at the organization. How does one go about doing that? How are you energizing the team and directing the team in that regard? And then if we could also tie that to any changes you're making in incentive comp, how you're managing to thread the needle of presumably making that compensation better-aligned with productivity while still keeping that level of motivation as strong as it has been?","Tom Greco","Good question, Matt. For us, those customer-facing employees are just so critical. Our general managers, our district managers, our commercial parts pros, our commercial account managers, those are the people that face customers every single day out there in the marketplace. Six months ago, candidly, we had a very difficult time retaining people. You probably are well-aware of the fact that we were losing people to competitors. We took some steps to address that through incentives, by lifting up the importance of those roles, listening to those people. We brought a general management council into place to essentially help us forge our agenda.","We're spending a lot of time looking at turnover rates by geography, by district, throughout the country. So we've made a lot of progress. I mentioned in the prepared remarks, our turnover rate is down across the board in each of those four roles, dramatically. It was up significantly, and now it's down year on year. And we're going to continue to pay attention to that, because we know that if we can get continuity and we can get our people trained and skilled and knowledgeable, and really loving coming into work every day, that's going to make a difference over time. So it really is about the tools we're providing them, the training we're providing to them and the incentives. And we have to enable them to compete at the highest level in the marketplace. And that's what we're doing.","Zaheed Mawani","Great. We'll go over here to Bret.","Bret Jordan","Thanks. Bret Jordan with Jefferies. A question on the supply chain. I think you talked about the number one being, the number one of on your focus list. At what point are we going to have distribution centers on a common IT system? And is it still the thought to rewrite the legacy program and use it as the overlay? And then the follow-up question on that is, the inventory levels, I think at the end of the second quarter, you talked about maybe taking several hundred million dollars out of that balance. Would we expect that to happen around the same time you get a common IT backbone?","Tom Greco","So thanks, Bret. First of all, the whole initiative around streamlining the supply chain is that we're going to look across our entire infrastructure and optimize the assets that we have. Part of that, of course, is to get to a single supply chain stack, so that we have distribution centers that can communicate with stores on either network. So that, we have a very deliberate plan to roll that out. We have a timeline. We know when we're going to get it completed. Part of that is to get to a single information technology system, so that's a much easier system for us to work with.","We're also looking across the entirety of our supply chain to include Worldpac, Canada, Autopart International, all of those represents elements of a North American supply chain, which ultimately we want to get to. So we're pretty excited about the streamlining supply chain. There's a big productivity driver in our strategic business plan. It's a big simplifier for our people, because they don't have to deal with the multiple processes, and it's going to helps us with availability.","On your second question, which was surrounding our catalog, we've got Bob here, who -- maybe you can talk to this a little bit, Bob, on the catalog. But we're excited about having Bob oversee the entirety of our professional business. We've never done that before. We've always looked at it somewhat vertically. Advance, Carquest, Autopart International, Worldpac, we want to make sure that we make it as easy as possible for our customers to access all of those really -- the broad lineup of parts that we have. Bob, can you maybe talk a little bit about it?","Bob Cushing","Yes, so Worldpac has built, for the last 40 years, the industry-leading OE catalog. And back in 2004 when Worldpac was acquired by GPI, we were working with them collaboratively to build their after-market catalog. Now we have this opportunity to bring them both together, to have the best possible customer experience. It's an exciting time, and we will no doubt have the leading catalog in the industry, I'm pretty certain of it.","Bret Jordan","So second quarter next year, one catalog for all of AAP?","Bob Cushing","It will be in 2017.","Bret Jordan","Okay, good enough.","Zaheed Mawani","Okay. What we're going to do now is just transition and take a call from a participant on the phone, and then we'll come back to in the room. So if you're on the phone and you're ready, please go ahead with your question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Baker from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Mike Baker","Hi. Can you guys hear me okay? Hello, can you hear me?","Tom Greco","Yes.","Mike Baker","Okay, good. Sorry, just wanted to make sure. All right, so one industry question and then one Company-specific question. On the industry, you talked about more vehicles age 11 or older, or vehicles aging. I'm wondering what you guys see as the sweet spot of vehicle maintenance? Is there some age that vehicles get tooled at the market rate vehicles for you? And of course, there's probably some age when they sort of come into your sweet spot. What do you think the right cohort or bucket is to look at? And how do you see the number of vehicles in that bucket trending? That's the industry question.","And then I'll ask the Company-specific question at the same time, and then I'll listen. So the margin progression, 500 basis points essentially over five years, but you said slight improvement in 2017. So it's really 500 basis points between 2018 and 2021. Can you give us more help or color on the cadence there? Is it still going to ramp up in 2018 or '19, or is it going to be very back-end loaded? Thanks.","Tom Greco","Okay. I had a little trouble hearing there, Mike, but I'll do my best. On the first question, which was a sweet spot, it's really five years-plus. That's really the sweet spot for our business. So that's why we like the fact that there was 17.5 million vehicles sold over the past 12 months. That gives us an outlook for the next five years. We know that when those vehicles come around five years from now, that's when we'll start to really see a ramp-up in sales for us. On the second question, do you want to take that?","Tom Okray","Sure, I'll take that. First of all, let's step back. We're not satisfied with our operating margin that we have in Q3, and we're not satisfied saying modest improvement in 2017. But we're building a foundation here for the future. We're going to put the customer first. We're going to invest in the customer. We're going to optimize the supply chain and we're going to reduce our inventory. We're not going to cut corners. At this point in time, we're not going to give a glide path of what the timeline looks like to get to the at least 500 basis points margin improvement by 2021. Perhaps more color when we're back talking in February.","Mike Baker","Okay, I appreciate it. I'll turn it over to somewhere else.","Brian Nagel","Hi, it's Brian Nagel from Oppenheimer. So Tom Greco, a question for you. If we step back and look at this plan, the 500 basis point goal of operating margin is impressive, and gets you much closer to your competitors. So, I guess the question is, as you've studied the business now and you're not the first to attempt to drive higher operating margins here at AAP. What were the mistakes made previously? And how does your plan differ from maybe some of the prior efforts to do this?","Tom Greco","Okay, thanks, Brian. Obviously hindsight is 2020, and I think mine is as good as anyone else. But I'll comment briefly on what I think is different about our plan. First of all, I will say that I think our plan is dramatically different than we've seen previously, in terms of what I've looked at. I would say there's a couple of big ones.","The first one is that we are obsessed with the customer. Everybody on this stage is obsessed with the customer. We are going to drive that deep into the organization. We may have said we were obsessed with the customer in the past, but I think there's a lot of evidence that would say that we were not obsessed with the customer in the past. And that's probably job one, is to drive that, as I mentioned earlier, deep into the organization, ensure that it's a filter that we put every single decision that we make through the entire Company.","Secondly, we really didn't have a cohesive strategy, that I could gather, over the last several years. That caused us to make significant shifts in direction frequently over time. And when you're shifting a large organization of 75,000 people, it gets very difficult to get any kind of momentum around the agenda.","Third, when you have that going on, it really starts to compromise the execution. Because you're trying different things, and different priorities take a different level of energy at any given point in time. I can tell you, the number of things we were measuring was significant. The number of input metrics we were trying to accomplish was a very long list, and it did vary quarter in, quarter out.","So that, over time, reduces the amount of accountability that people inside the organization have to deliver against those goals, and it starts to compromise the overall ability to get things done and to achieve the margin expansion goals that were outlined. I think those are the big things that I would observe. Customer service is going to be or obsession with the customer, really, going forward, is our agenda. We have a cohesive strategy now. We're going to be focused on operating metrics and execution that are required to deliver against that. We do have to build the culture of the organization to be really focused on not just the customer, but to have a very high level of accountability, of ownership and drive for results. And that will be different going forward.","Brian Nagel","Thank you.","Zaheed Mawani","Okay, we'll come over here.","Dan Wewer","Dan Wewer, Raymond James. Tom, can you give an update on your thoughts about Carquest consolidations going forward? A few conference calls ago you expressed some dissatisfaction with the revenues that you were giving up. And then the second.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","Tom Greco","[Technical Difficulty] conversions, the relocations, the openings, the closings, all of those things. And I'm an insights and analytics person. I want to really go deep on the metrics. What we said we were going to achieve with those goals, what we actually achieved -- we look back over the timeframe that they were initiated and we weren't comfortable, candidly, with what the performance of the consolidations were in that timeframe. So we dramatically reduced them by about a third, based on what we originally planned at the time of the deal itself. And I feel really good about that decision, because we're going to be able to drive market share. We're going to be able to retain employees. We've got some great people that work on the Carquest side of the business, on the independents and the corporate side; so that, I feel great about. The conversions -- I will tell you, I was in one last week -- that has worked well. Because you're essentially adding DIY to what was formerly an entirely professional operation. And so we see obviously increased traffic associated with that. We're driving comp sales in that store. We're getting more professional business. So the conversions have been much more successful overall. So you'll see us actually accelerating some of the conversions to get more DIY business on that side. As for our goals, again, we're going to focus on the customer. You saw our market share -- its single-digits. There's a lot of food on the table for us to grow. We have $10 billion in sales in a $135 billion market. We feel very good about our ability to gain market share overall in that timeframe. Obviously we don't ignore our competition. We look at it market by market. But our belief is that staying absolutely laser-focused on what's important to the customer is going to ultimately enable us to gain market share.","Zaheed Mawani","Great. We'll come right over here to Chris.","Chris Horvers","Chris Horvers JPMorgan. I have a few questions here. The $500 million in sales productivity, how much of that is sales-dependent? We've had some companies that I follow sort of talk about productivity metrics, and it's really not cost out, it's more just leverage. So how much of that is straight cost-out opportunity? And how would you break that out between cost of goods opportunity versus the expense opportunity? And then I have a follow-up question.","Tom Greco","So first of all, none of it is sales-dependent. I don't look at it that way. I'm looking for cost-out, period. So when we look at our productivity agenda, we're looking at waste opportunities that do not impact the customer. So my definition of productivity is, same sales, lower cost. So we don't need four-comp or three-comp, or anything like that to achieve that productivity goal. That cost is coming out. And we've identified each of the buckets that we believe it can come out in, and we're going to continue to focus on that. That will be an ongoing journey for us over the life of the strategic business plan. How much of it is -- what were you saying?","Chris Horvers","Cost of goods versus\u2026","Tom Greco","Yes, there's obviously -- we had the three buckets, so that material cost optimization really does reflect some cost of goods. But it's obviously stilted more towards straight productivity in some of the operating lines that we have inside the P&L. We're not going to give a specific number, but it's definitely more on the straight productivity.","Chris Horvers","Okay. And then what drove the improvement in comps during the quarter, going from a minus 4 to minus 1? Can you talk about how much availability improved during the quarter? How much would you attribute to lower turnover? And then how much would you attribute to sort of stopping the confusion that was going on in the organization? And then finally, any comment on cadence during the quarter would be great.","Tom Greco","Sure. Well, first of all, we mentioned, right or wrong, we kind of landed on a small list of input metrics not too long after I got to AAP. And we said to the organization: we are not changing these. Even if they weren't perfect, we were not going to change those input metrics. We're going to look at them every single week, and we're going to go very deep, as opposed to this kind of wide swath, one week, we're going to look at this, some other week, we're going to look at something else. We're looking at the same small list of metrics. I can tell you that not every one of them, but several of them have shown significant improvement, quarter-to-quarter, so Q1 to Q2 to Q3. Some important ones that are customer facing ones, order-to-delivery time is one of them. Turnover, I mentioned earlier. We've got pockets of the organization where our fill rate and distribution centers is improving, and that one, we've got pockets where it's not. But we've narrowed the input metrics down significantly. People know what we're going to be talking about. You used the word distraction. I think that we've basically said this is what we're going to be focused on. And I'm really proud of our field team, because they've really responded to that agenda, and they're really driving against it, and that has really helped us. We're not going to comment on how our sales went through the quarter. Really excited about how Q3 ended up relative to Q2.","Zaheed Mawani","Great. We'll just come over here to Scot.","Scot Ciccarelli","Thank you. Hi. Scot Ciccarelli, RBC. Follow-up on Chris's question, just so I understand your comment, Tom. If you're really talking about 500 million in productivity, or let's call it cost saves, shouldn't that translate into something higher because of the sales leverage that you guys would expect from a mid single-digit comp? I'm trying to reconcile the two.","Tom Greco","So translate into more margin expansion, is that your question, Scot?","Scot Ciccarelli","Yes.","Tom Greco","Yes, well, again, we're trying to future-fit the Company for the long term. So we're going to continue to invest back in the customer to enable us to grow for many years. So it's not just about the five year plan. We've got a five year plan. We feel really good about it. We like the way that our sales is going to unfold, and we're very confident in that productivity pipeline. But we also are expecting that we're going to have to continue to invest in the business to drive growth over time. Because there's a lot going on inside the industry, and there's a lot of unknowns in the next five years that we have to be thoughtful with.","Scot Ciccarelli","Okay. And then a follow-up, actually for Bob. Given the success at Worldpac, what would be the top three changes you'd like to implement at the professional business as you take over the whole commercial operation or professional operation at Advance?","Bob Cushing","Well, I said earlier in the prepared remarks about, again, providing our customers what they value most. And so they want to have a quality brand portfolio, fast and consistent to the market every single day. We have to run that business every single day. So that's a critical one. We also want to end up making sure that we end up taking the catalog and having the catalog readily available to the customer. Which means we're basically integrating and having two catalogs there to serve it up. And of course, having the technology to basically make sure that we provide to our customers the best possible experience, to get the right part at the right time. So technology, catalog, right part at the right time. Those are critical, and that's what our customers value most.","Zaheed Mawani","Great. We'll come over here to Chris.","Chris Bottiglieri","Hi, thanks a lot. Chris Bottiglieri, Wolfe Research. Quick question, if you're able to. Can you give us some context on how you're, as I look at it, you have five disparate businesses that you're looking to homogenize. Give us the context for how each segment has performed on a comp basis over margins over the last couple years? Like, just what you're dealing with today, and kind of how you look to bridge that toward your mid single-digit comp growth?","Tom Greco","We're not going to comment on the specific comp sales for individual businesses. But we have seen certainly across the enterprise improvement in the third quarter, and we feel really good about that. Obviously, they're coming from different places, to your question, Chris. Bob's Worldpac has been performing at a high level for quite some time, but other parts of the business have been struggling. So we're very mindful of where everything is positioned, but we did see improvement in the third quarter virtually across the board.","Chris Bottiglieri","And then one brief follow-up. You think about your value proposition moving forward, what's embedded in your comp outlook versus the market growth obviously implies you're going to suddenly take a lot of share. So when you think about the competitive set, what really differentiates AAP from your peers? Like what are your value drivers that are going to allow you personally to grow faster than everybody else? Like, what do you do different and better?","Tom Greco","Well, first of all, I'll ask Bob to talk a little about professional, and maybe I'll handle DIY, because we do see them as extremely different businesses. I think that is part of the opportunity that we may have had in the past, when we were sort of blending the two of those together. And through the research that we've conducted, it was extremely clear that we had to get much sharper and crisper on our proposition to DIYers without watering it down with: well, gee, what about professional side of the business, how are we going to handle that. With the DIYer, which, obviously we showed the chart earlier, it's a $50 billion business. We do expect the segment to grow. We've got a lot of insight around what are the segments that are going to grow inside of DIY.","We're focused on the segments where we're confident we can win. We're going to engineer our training, our marketing, our labor model, all towards those priority segments, and really converging the investment levels that we have inside of DIY. Which is a re-purposing of the money that we have today towards those priority segments. And then leveraging Speed Perks as a loyalty program. Which we got up and running, we've got a lot of members who joined us, and we've got an opportunity to engage them very differently than we have in the past. And we're building a plan to go do that. So I think it's the overall value proposition will be quite different than it was in the past. And again, we are seeing some progress on that, because in the quarter, we saw a nice pop on the DIY side in addition to our overall business. Would you like to talk about professional, Bob, please?","Bob Cushing","Yes, so on the professional side, when I look at it from the standpoint of our footprint, we have the leading footprint in North America. And so when I look at that and our capabilities there, with the assets that we have available, when I look at the assets that we have and all these different business units and the years of experience serving the professional customer. Knowing exactly what drives their business, what drives their growth, what I know we have on the portfolio side, what I know we have on the technology side, what I know we have on dig digital driver side, we have all of those capabilities. And now for the first time, we're able to harness all of the business units and the assets and resources there towards bringing the best experience to the customer. And this is the first time we've had that opportunity. And again, we're almost three years into the AAP acquisition of General Parts, and this is the first time we're able to bring that level of higher customer service that we're going to provide to the professional customer. And all of those will drive our particular sales and growth opportunities, and accelerate it as we bring more and more of those assets to the field, to the customer, and win that business every single day.","Zaheed Mawani","Great. Let's go over here to Alan.","Alan Rifkin","Thank you very much. Alan Rifkin with BTIG. How are you?","Tom Greco","Good.","Alan Rifkin","I believe you said in your prepared remarks there would be no more reporting on integration. Yet almost three years after the acquisition, we had a $0.12 charge in the quarter. Can we take your statement that there will be no more putting on integration to mean that going forward, there won't be any more below-the-line charges?","Tom Okray","No, that wasn't the context of the comment. The comment was related to -- we're not going to focus on the customer, we're going to focus on our core business. We're not going to talk about the integration. We will still have an ongoing charge from operating income down to adjusted operating income.","Alan Rifkin","Any idea when these charges may cease? Will it be sometime in 2017, or do you foresee the charges going even further than that?","Tom Okray","At this point in time, we're not going to comment on how long the charges will go.","Alan Rifkin","Okay. And just hypothetically, if, let's say there's an industry turn-town and sales don't meet your modest positive comps for next year. What point do you start to maybe take a more draconian view on perhaps closing a few distribution centers and\/or closing some stores? Or is that not on the drawing board, even if you hypothetically don't meet your plan next year?","Tom Greco","Well, first of all, we're excited about our comp prospects for next year, very excited about it. Secondly, we do believe that there's an opportunity to streamline our supply chain which is not draconian. It's really an opportunity to be smarter about leveraging our existing assets. If you think, Alan, about the different parts of the business that have come together over time through acquisition, we actually have a pretty impressive footprint. We just have treated them very vertically, as opposed to horizontally, is what I would say. And you're going to see us look for opportunities to better-integrate the entirety of our supply chain assets, DCs, over-the-road, our store delivery fleet which the stores, the Worldpac branches. We've got a lot of different assets that are out there that have handled things in a very siloed fashion, and we see opportunities to better-integrate those. And that may mean, over time, we're going to be able to leverage those assets in a better way.","Alan Rifkin","Okay. One more if I may. You mentioned that the DIY business is obviously lagging professional, which obviously, there are industry headwinds which result in everyone seeing similar trends as that. But just to break that down a little bit further, are you seeing the relative weakness on both the Carquest side, as well as the legacy stores? Or is it more skewed towards one versus the other?","Tom Greco","Well, I mean, obviously Advance has a much stronger DIY business than Carquest. Carquest was built on professional. In fact, we actually have the founder of Advance here; Nick Toddman has joined with us today. So, wonderful to have Nick be with us. They really built this tremendous business for the DIYer originally, and then separately, Carquest built their business with a focus on the professional customers. So, I mean typically, the Advance store has a much higher DIY base, and it's much more institutional there's much more institutional knowledge, I would say, on the Advance side of the business, for DIYers. I'm looking forward to touring some stores with Nick to get his opinion on how we're doing, which he gives us when he sees us all the time. But it's a fun business. It's a great side of the business. They've got people who want to fix their vehicles and really we've got some exciting things we believe we can do to bring that level of focus back to the DIY side of the business next year, that I'm not going to speak about here. But we're excited about our plans there.","Alan Rifkin","Thank you, Tom.","Zaheed Mawani","And just right now we're just going to shift back to a caller on the phone. Please go ahead with your question.","Operator","Our next question will come from Craig Kennison from Baird. Your line is now open.","Craig Kennison","Good evening, thanks for taking my question. What does your plan or what does your research show with respect to the threat from Amazon? Are there any opportunities to partner? And of course, I'm especially interested on the view from Tom Okray, given his background with that organization.","Tom Okray","It's a very interesting question. But I'm here to tell you that we're obsessed with the customer. We're aware of the competition, but we're obsessed with the customer. And that's what we're going to focus on. We know if we do the right things for the customer, then that will take care of itself.","Zaheed Mawani","Great. Next question on the phone, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jamie Alexander from Redmond Asset Management. Your line is now open.","Jamie Alexander","Yes, this is kind of a follow up on the prior analyst's question. What are the changes that you foresee in the industry over the next five years?","Tom Greco","So I think it was what are the changes in the industry in the next five years.","Jamie Alexander","Yes, you said it was a rapidly changing industry?","Tom Greco","Yes, obviously we continue to see the growth on the professional side. All of the work that we've done is saying that the professional side is going to outperform. I think we showed in our charts that it's we're talking mid single digit growth on professional. As more and more people enter the ownership stages of their vehicles and they're not fixing them themselves, they're going to take it to one of our hundreds of thousands of customers that are out there that repair vehicles across the nation. And we're excited about that because we feel we're very well positioned in that space.","Bob showed the chart on imports. We've got a strong domestic base of business with our customers. But if you look five years going forward, we expect imports to grow at about 20%. So again, we feel very good about that, in that we're well positioned with the strength of the business that Bob has built with Worldpac in the next five years to help us really get after that opportunity.","Some of the other things we showed are very much on our mind. None of them are kind of five year items, whether you talk about the electrification, you talk about autonomous vehicles, you talk about some of those larger macro shifts-- we don't see them impacting our core business in the next five years. In the next 10 or 15 years, they become bigger factors. So we're going to definitely pay attention to what's going on there. And as I said in our prepared remarks, we want to be -- with disruption comes opportunity. We want to be part of that opportunity and look for growth vectors that may not exist today in our base business.","Zaheed Mawani","We're going to shift back into the room, and maybe we'll come over here, please, Theresa?","Unidentified Analyst","I had two questions. One, just on cash flow; can you just quantify and maybe share some specifics on what you guys think is the gross opportunity in terms of the working capital that could be currently released, and that's stuck on the balance sheet? And then second is just, as you think about balancing share repurchases with maintaining investment-grade ratings with agencies, is there a target leverage ratio that we can think about for modeling?","Tom Okray","Well, let's start out with the working capital. Stepping back, we all believe that we have too much inventory. No question about that. And as Tom mentioned in his remarks, we are thoughtfully looking at bringing that down without impacting the customer, for sure. What we want to do is look at the metric of our AP ratio. We believe that's the best way of looking at how we're performing. So that means optimizing obviously the payables and the inventory level, with most of the work coming in the denominator. I think we were at 73.4% this quarter. Our peers are much higher than that, and we couldn't be more excited about getting up to the levels of our peer group over the five-year period; which obviously will unlock a tremendous amount of cash on a $4 billion-plus inventory level. And then your second question?","Unidentified Analyst","Was just, is there a target leverage ratio, like three times adjusted debt?","Tom Okray","Yes, we're going to maintain our 2.5 times leverage ratio.","Unidentified Analyst","So as you guys grow EBITDA and release cash from the balance sheet, should we assume that the excess cash gets used to repurchase stock?","Tom Okray","Our first priority will be delighting the customer and investing back in the business. Our second priority will be maintaining our investment-grade rating with the 2.5 leverage ratio. And then our third bucket will be returning cash to the shareholders.","Zaheed Mawani","Thank you. Let's go over in the front row here to Seth.","Seth Basham","Seth Basham from Wedbush. My question is on the store labor model. What have you observed over the last six months, Tom, on the labor model, and how do you change it going forward? There are a lot of shifting roles and responsibilities between DIY and DIFM, and the incentive structure obviously has been up for consideration. Can you give us some observations?","Tom Greco","I think obviously we made some adjustments to our labor model in the latter part of last year that I think we may have rushed a little bit in terms of the execution of that -- which is an opportunity for us going forward. I mean, we want to make sure -- when you're talking about something as important as your store labor, which faces customers, it requires a tremendous amount of analytics up front, rigorous testing, proven methodologies, then you roll it out. So what I observed was, we weren't really approaching it that way, and so we had to sort of reverse course on some of the things that we did. And early on, it's been very well received by our field organization. You have to listen to what our region vice presidents, our district managers, our general managers in the stores, are telling us. And as I went around, I mean, I try to spend as much time in the stores as I can. And I do take a lot of notes, and I listen to them when they tell me: this is not driving my comps. It gives you the allusion of profitability, because you're reducing costs and you're really just getting customers angry, and they don't come back to your store, and then it's just a bit of a vicious circle.","So we've been very thoughtful about our labor model. I think we've made a lot of progress on better aligning our hours to the demand, both on the DIY side and on the commercial side. And we'll continue to do that. We've got to make sure that we can service the customer with all of the things that they want, whether it's parking lot services or delivery frequency or when they want the part, we've do to have the labor there to fulfill the demand. And we've made pretty significant changes, I would say, in how we're approaching that.","Seth Basham","That's helpful. And just as a follow-up, if there are more changes to come, what's the timeline for them? Are we talking about another year, or are we pretty much at status quo?","Tom Greco","For labor particularly? Yes, no, I mean, the changes that we've initiated are fairly positive right now on labor. We're going to continue to refine them. We certainly reserve the right to do better. But I'm pleased with the results that we've had so far on our labor model.","Seth Basham","Thanks.","Zaheed Mawani","Great. We'll just come right over here to Jack.","Jack Balos","Jack Balos, Focus Research. We were originally told a while ago that the integration of Carquest would be completed in 2017. Is that still correct?","Tom Greco","Yes, that's a similar question Jack, was it, yes, to what we had earlier. We've basically stepped back on the original goals that were outlined, and integrated them into the broader strategic business plan. We're very comfortable with the five year outlook, and we're going to do it in a way, the full integration in a way that's not disruptive. And I want to make sure that as we bring the supply chains together as we integrate the systems and do all the things that were part of that plan, that we do it in a way that's going to be flawlessly executed. So that timeline is different than we originally communicated. The new timeline is different.","Zaheed Mawani","Great. Maybe we'll -- hey, Theresa, can we just come to the front row here, to Denise? Thank you.","Denise Chai","Thank you. Denise Chai from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. How are you thinking about new store growth over the next five years? And will there be any more store closures?","Tom Greco","We've got our plans. We're not going to comment specifically on what the aggregate number is. But we do start to move in a much more positive direction, let's just say. When you take the aggregation of store openings, store closures, consolidations, conversions, relocations all of those start to turn positive for us in the five year horizon. And they haven't been, as you probably have seen, in the last three years.","Denise Chai","Okay, thanks. And then a follow-up on AI. You're closing some stores in Florida. What's the strategy for AI?","Bob Cushing","So with AI, we're working closely with them and collaborating on a holistic professional strategy across the entire, and they're, of course, included in all that. They have a pretty robust footprint out there today, and we're going to leverage that within the holistic professional strategy that we're building today. They're part of it as well, as obviously Worldpac, Advance and Carquest.","Zaheed Mawani","Thanks. We'll just go over there to John.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, thank you for taking my question. I just wanted the follow up on the five-year plan. You described it as at least 500 bps of margin expansion. Do you have line of sight to an outcome that's better than that? And what would drive the difference between 500 bps and whatever that might be?","Tom Greco","Well, obviously we've got the five-year plan modeled. More sales would drive a better outcome than we currently have modeled, I think is the easiest way to answer that question.","Unidentified Analyst","And is it possible that you could hit 500 bps sooner than five years?","Tom Greco","I'm not going to respond to that. We're aggressively pursuing the margin opportunities as rapidly as we can. And if it comes earlier, that's fantastic. But again, we're making sure that we focus on the customer. And we're going to make sure that we invest where we need to, to provide the customer with the service they need to build long-term relationships with both professional customers and DIY customers. Which, that's the wild card in there, is really keeping the engine moving to drive the top line.","Unidentified Analyst","And just last one, on incentives. Do you plan to reorganize the incentive structure in some way to hit those numbers? And how do you envision that playing out?","Tom Greco","Yes, we definitely have plans on the incentive structure. We're not going to comment on that in here. I think we'll be in a better position in February to provide that to you, because we're still in the final stages of refinement. But we are looking very closely at incentives, really, across the board.","Bret Jordan","And, Bret Jordan, Jefferies, quick follow-up. On the AP inventory, Tom, you were saying you thought you could reach your peers' levels. And maybe this question is for Bob. Does Worldpac have the leverage against the vendors to get to 100%, or north of 100% accounts payable to inventory? Or is the OE vendor base less likely to take the extended payables? I guess, do you really think 100%-plus is a target, or does your supply chain differ from theirs?","Bob Cushing","Yes, I think you do have to, you hit the nail on the head. You have to adjust for the dynamic on Worldpac on that. So then it starts to get into how much is the mix of Worldpac? And as we're talking in the five-year window, is it 100? Is it 90? At this point in time, we're just swagging. But we want to get the industry leaded, obviously adjusting for the Worldpac payables dynamic.","Zaheed Mawani","Thank you. Theresa, we'll just come over here.","Adam Leba","Hi, thanks. It's Adam Leba from Luna Sales. Just getting back to the cash flow question. And I haven't modeled it out, but if I'm thinking forward on all the levers in the business, if you're able to grow mid single-digits, you'll have plenty of money to keep your rating to feed the business and to buy back stock. And I guess the possibility of getting a tax windfall is higher now than it was a week ago. So if you have more cash than you need, I guess the long-winded way of getting the question is, how do I think about, or how are your repurchases paired against your view of intrinsic value of the stock?","Tom Okray","I think we're weighing into a very hypothetical question in terms of value of the stock versus potential repurchases. Clearly I gave you the order it's going to be. Number one, invest in the business. Number two, maintain our ratings. Number three, repurchase stock. Obviously we'll also look for any investments out there that can help fulfill the customer in terms of acquisitions, those types of things. But I don't want to get into speculation of where the stock value is in terms of repurchases.","Zaheed Mawani","Let's go back over to the back row, please.","Unidentified Analyst","Just a question on the supply chain, because it does feel like the Holy Grail for this industry, to make sure you have the parts when and where you need them. I had always had the impression that the legacy AAP DCs maybe weren't perfect that's kind of why you built Remington, sort of as a test. But that they weren't prefect for the professional customer. Maybe the Carquest, they had a lot of DCs, but they also were a little bit inefficient or maybe not perfect for the professional customer. Do you -- it sounds like you're happy with the supply chain as is, and you can kind of make it work. But if you had to redo the system, would you do it differently?","Tom Greco","That's obviously a very difficult question. We did greenfield the solution. We looked at what a greenfield solution would look like. But then of course, you have to overlay -- I've got capital in the ground today with this asset base. And the piloting did reveal that there was more elegant ways to get the right part in the right place at the right time than perhaps we had looked at in the past. And knowing what we have, our distribution center network, our super hubs, our hubs, our store network -- we have a great asset base. I just want to kind of reinforce that, just utilizing that asset base differently than we'd used it in the past, is how we're thinking about it. So we'll continue to look for opportunities to improve it over time, but we feel great about the asset base that we have. We do feel there's an opportunity to streamline, as I mentioned earlier. But how would with we have done it differently? That's a tough question. I do know what we have today is fantastic, and Bob is all over it, as it pertains to professional customers. He's going to be tapping into every single one of those distribution centers, to get parts closer to the customer. And we're excited about the streamlining, because that's going to bring parts closer to the customer, just in and of itself.","Zaheed Mawani","We'll just come over here to Mike. Thank you.","Mike Montani","Thanks a lot, Mike Montani with Evercore ISI. Just wanted to ask, when the comp moved from negative 4 to negative 1, Tom, can you maybe share a little bit of the traffic and ticket progression there?","And then also DIY versus DIFM? And then to follow up on that, the mid single-digit comps that you all have guided to, what kind of assumptions does that involve for DIY versus DIFM? And also, how much pricing is there versus transaction volume?","Tom Greco","Okay, well, we're not going to break out the DIFM-DIY split. I can tell you that we did improve proportionately in both of them. Professional has been outperforming DIY for us, and it outperformed in the quarter. So we're going to continue to drive at both of those businesses very differently. And missed your second question.","Mike Montani","Just in terms of the mid single-digit comp outlook longer term, maybe can you help us build to that in terms of volume versus pricing?","Tom Greco","Yes, I mean, we're really focused on units growth. A part we measure it I want to know units. Pricing is nice, but we want to grow our business by getting more customers. We want those customers to buy more parts from us over the course of 52 weeks, over the course of five years. So making sure that we, on the professional side, as Bob indicated, we've got a great lineup, a high quality parts lineup. We think we've got a very strong lineup of parts there. We've got to deliver them at the time we promised to our customer. But we want them to buy more individual units from us. And that's why Bob and I have been spending a tremendous amount of time with our customers to really figure that part out. So you'll see us very focused on unit growth. Ultimately, we're going to look at pricing, but we're going to do it smartly. We're not going to take pricing so that we start losing customers. The idea is to drive more customers and have more customers buy more parts from us.","Mike Montani","Then just a DIY versus DIFM do you need DIY to be up low single digits to the mid singles, or can you do it even if it's flat?","Tom Greco","No, professional's going to carry the load. I think you probably know, about 60% of our business is professional today. The category is growing at a disproportionate rate. We expect that will outperform the industry, so you can do the math. We're calling 3, 4, 5, something like that, for professional at the industry level. So for us to gain share, as Bob indicated, we have to be higher than that. And that's the goal.","Mike Montani","Just the last one I had, for Tom also. Is the buyback pace. Can you tell us what kind of a comp you would need to see in order to get more aggressive there? Or how are you thinking about buying back the stock?","Tom Okray","Ideally we'd have a consistency and a buyback process. But again, its way early days to start talking about buyback schedule.","Zaheed Mawani","Great. Matt, you have a follow up?","Matt Fassler","Thanks a lot. It's Matt Fassler from Goldman Sachs with a quick follow up. I'm curious, now that each of you is a few months into weeks to months into your respective roles, what kind of tools you have to understand market share trends? And with that in mind, as you entered this meeting with a nice revenue beat versus what the street was anticipating, how much of the acceleration, if you will, do you think was a function of improvement in the market, I guess, on a geographically adjusted basis, versus the efficacy of some of the efforts that you've spoken about tonight? Thank you.","Tom Greco","Well, first of all, we have the industry related market share tools that are out there. We do use those. I wish we had more, but I use what's available. So we see that once a period. I see it Wednesday this week, for the purposes of the most recent period. And we've been watching it very closely, and we watch it by geography, we watch it by category, all of the things that you would expect there. And we have seen, I would say, relatively uniform improvements on it. I mean, you've got pluses and minuses, as you always will. But we've seen the sequential improvement come fairly uniformly. Share, yes.","Zaheed Mawani","We've got a follow up here from Chris.","Chris Horvers","Thanks. Chris Horvers, JPMorgan, with a follow up. Understand you don't want to share a lot of details on sort of what the supply chain looks like in the vision. But can you give a sense of what you're dealing with, and I guess, how much low hanging fruit or how much hard work is ahead? Can you talk about what the experience was in the Northeast in some of the DCs that went to daily delivery, what you did to unwind them, and what it looks like now in those DCs?","Tom Greco","Great question, Chris, I mean, I went up there fairly early on, because we were really struggling; I think May, something like that, May or June, I went to a couple of the facilities we have up there. What we did is, we tried to impose a bit of a cookie-cutter approach to those distribution centers. And they really weren't engineered to do it. We had more stores than we should have assigned to them, at a delivery frequency that was very difficult for them to execute flawlessly. And that created a very chaotic environment in the distribution center. We weren't able to fill orders properly; there was accuracy issues. Yes, we were delivering 5X to the stores, but if you ask the general managers of those stores, they would have said: please stop doing this. Because we were just -- it was a bit of a Lucy Show-type thing going on. We just had stuff coming in and out, and in and out. And we weren't getting the right part to the right place at the right time. So we essentially unwound that. We went to 3X in those distribution centers. We got into a much better cadence with the stores. We executed our first one in August.","Then we went in September, in the second one. We've now done all of them. So there's transition costs that we've incurred in the last couple of -- in the third quarter -- and will incur in the fourth quarter, by the way, as you move to this new system. And we're seeing much better fill rates, like significantly better, much better accuracy, and the general managers are much happier, and they're selling more. So it just goes back to, the customer wants the right part in the right place at the right time. The customer doesn't say: hello, have you got 5X? They say: have you got the right part? And when we're able to fulfill that part, regardless of how we got it there, that's what they're looking for. So I was in both of those facilities in -- what's this, October -- I was in there in October; totally different place. There's not stuff all over the place. We've got clean aisles. I can see down the aisles. That's kind of important to me in a distribution center. I don't want to see stuff laying on the loading docks. I mean, I tip my hat to the teams in those DCs, because they've really worked at it very hard. And as a result, our customers are much happier.","Zaheed Mawani","We have a follow-up from Michael.","Michael Lasser","Tom, you mentioned the $500 million savings that you're going to achieve over the next five years is not going to be customer-facing. Can you give us more detail on the non-customer-facing activities that are inefficient at this point? Is it mostly supply chain? Is it corporate? I think helping to at least provide a little more detail will help bridge the expectations there.","Tom Greco","Well, first of all, I'd call out zero-based budgeting, Michael, and I do have some experience with that. I love it. It's a terrific opportunity to really standardize how costs are managed across the organization. And I would consider what we have in there a AAA bond. It's really about getting horizontal views of all of the costs that you have across the enterprise, as opposed to each cost center manager managing their costs in more of a vertical fashion, and us saying: gee, can you do better? It isn't a do-better exercise, it's a change-the-physics exercise. We're not managing those costs the same way anymore, and we're asking people to look at the costs in ways they haven't been looked at before. So those costs, we've got a very clear idea. Tom is running the control tower. We're very clear on where those costs are coming out. They're across the P&L, Michael, so I can't call out specific things. They're really throughout the entire P&L.","The supply chain obviously is a big area of opportunity. We just talked about one here, 5X to 3X. You deliver parts three times a week instead of five times a week, it costs less. And unless you have a really good effectiveness reason for doing it, which we didn't in that case, when we go from 5X to 3X, we save a lot of money. So we're going to continue to look for those types of opportunities. But it's those types of things where, as I said earlier, the cost is coming out. It's not volume dependent or revenue dependent.","Zaheed Mawani","We have a follow-up from Chris there.","Chris Bottiglieri","Thanks a lot. Chris Wolfe Research. Just a quick question. What was the tradeoff from going from 5X to 3X? Is there anything you are losing? Are you losing some of those hard to find SKUs? And then separately, how often are you servicing the hub stores and super hubs? How often do those get replenished?","Tom Greco","What do you mean by the trade-off?","Chris Bottiglieri","I mean, why did the previous management team go to 5X in the first place? Was it just a bad decision? Was there any kind of benefit? I'm just trying to see why this all didn't happen sooner.","Tom Greco","I think it falls into the camp of my earlier answer. I don't know that there was a lot of rigorous analytics done. I don't know that we looked at the DC itself, and how many dock doors they had, and how many stores they were servicing, and delivery frequency. We just felt that, that was a solution that could work everywhere, and it doesn't. That's kind of the short version on that one.","Chris Bottiglieri","What about the mega hubs, super hubs? How often are those serviced right now?","Tom Greco","It varies. It varies by market. We have different cadence for super hubs and hubs throughout the network, as we do for stores.","Chris Bottiglieri","Okay. And sorry, one underlying question, and then I promise, I'm done. For the imports, can you just talk about where that fits in relative to your core AAP stores? Are you servicing like Toyotas, like that level of imports at those stores, or are they doing just strictly domestic? And then kind of where does that all fit in with AI and Worldpac?","Bob Cushing","Was the question the mix of the parts?","Chris Bottiglieri","When you think about the catalog, where does the core AAP store leave off in terms of what types of vehicles they service? What additional types, I would imagine Worldpac is not serving too many Audis and BMWs, they are probably dong more Hyundais. And can you just talk about the SKU mix and how it fits together?","Bob Cushing","Yes, again, we look at it market by market, looking at the VIOs, the vehicles in operation there. And we're seeing a good mix of all makes, all models, at the store level. And importantly, because many of the stores have access to the Worldpac assortment, we're measuring all that activity, and then basically working with the merchandising team to push those parts closer to the store, so they will get is closer to the customer without having to have that extra touch.","We're seeing, again, a good cross-section of parts there, mostly Asian versus high end European which of course is a Worldpac. But I would say for the most part, domestic, Asian and certainly some European, Volkswagen, some Audi, and so forth. But it's a good mix. But importantly, when you go to the market there, we're going to the customer with the answer of: we have all of it, all makes, all models, across the entire enterprise, and we're bringing that closer to the customer. So as that develops and evolves, we'll continue to build the inventory to support that activity market by market, capturing all the look-ups on the online, which we do at Worldpac today, and certainly capturing all the call-ins as well. That's going to be dynamic inventory. Whatever the calls are out there for the customer development side, we're going to have the part closer to the customer.","Chris Bottiglieri","Thank you.","Zaheed Mawani","Okay, well, good. That looks like that concludes our Q&A session. Thank you very much. And Tom, I'll, Tom's going to wrap up.","Tom Greco","Okay, so I really appreciate everybody coming this evening, and the interest you have in our business. I'd just wrap it up by saying, we absolutely believe that AAP is a very compelling investment opportunity. The industry is performing well. We're in a compelling market position, we feel. There's a tremendous opportunity for us to drive growth and margin expansion. I think you've seen that the team is executing a pretty focused agenda going forward. We're aligned around the plan. So, big opportunity to drive substantial shareholder value, and that's our commitment to you. So thanks for coming tonight."],"451":["Advance Auto Parts, Inc.

Before we begin, Zaheed Mawani, VP of Investor Relations, will make a brief statement concerning forward-looking statements that will be made on this call.","Zaheed Mawani - Vice President, Finance Planning, Analysis and Investor Relations","Good morning and thank you for joining us on today's call. I would like to remind you that our comments today contain forward-looking statements we intend to be covered by and we claim the protection under the Safe Harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.","Forward-looking statements address future events, developments or results, in typically used words, such as believe, anticipate, expect, intend, will, plan, forecast, outlook or estimate and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that may cause our results to differ materially. Our comments today will also include certain non-GAAP measures including certain financial measures reported on a comparable basis to exclude the impacts of costs in connection with the integration of General Parts International and B.W.P.

Darren?","Darren R. Jackson - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Zaheed. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter conference call. Joining me on the call today is our President, Sherman, who will update you on our business operations including our integration activities; and Mike Norona, our Chief Financial Officer, and Mike will update you on our financial performance.","Entering 2015, and year two of our integration, we remain very confident in the growth, earnings and service potential of this combination. We are well positioned in the commercial business, DIY, import, domestic, independent and online channels with approximately 60% of our business in the fastest-growing commercial segment.","The 2015 enterprise priorities remain unchanged from 2014. They are, just to remind you, relentlessly improving our base business, execution, and successfully delivering the year-two integration objectives.","We are building on last year's progress and continue to be confident that the steps we took positioned us well. As a reminder, the notable successes in 2014 included naming our go-forward leadership team, aligning our cultures, while improving our inventory availability principally through the cross-sourcing.","We also completed our supplier negotiations and defined our go-forward product brand structure. We successfully entered Dallas, leveraging the Carquest backbone. And finally, we delivered on the synergy and financial expectations for the year.","Through the first quarter of this year, the cultural assimilation remains very strong. The cross-sourcing availability continues to drive the business, and the growth drivers principally with the Worldpac business, the Canadian business, and our Dallas markets are exceeding expectations. In 2015, the required next step in the company's integration is the company's people, processes, systems and capabilities are to form a common foundation.","In addition to that, aligning our systems and distribution work; this also includes moving to a common foundation for products, pricing, customer process, support centers, pay and benefits, and the store and field leadership structure. This significant work is underway and is an integral step into leveraging the full potential of this acquisition.","It will and has resulted in broad-based change, a number of new learning curves and some temporary disruptions to our business. We completed critical integration deliverables in the quarter and expected some impact to the business; however, the degree of impact on the base business, honestly, was greater than we anticipated.","Consequently, our first quarter performance was lower than we expected. Overall, our sales grew 2.3% to just over $3 billion. The comparable sales were up 0.7% led by commercial growth with our DIY business declining modestly. Earnings per share on a comparable basis grew 6.2% in the quarter on top of last year's 35.5% growth.","Now, our industry fundamentals remain positive including vehicles in operation, gas prices, miles-driven and steadily improving economy. The industry benefits are not equally distributed across the country. Specifically our northeastern and upper Midwest markets meaningfully underperformed our expectations in Q1, principally driven by weather and some of the West Coast port slowdown. Despite the integration workload and some weather-impacted areas, we have continued to grow our sales and our profits.","The integration efforts I referenced earlier had a larger impact on our core commercial business in the quarter as it experienced a sequential slowdown from Q4 of last year. Our commercial business has been consistently performing at the high end or above the high end of the market growth of 3% to 5%. In our first quarter, we were closer to the low end of that range. Our sales and operations teams are intensely focused on leading the business and our customers through these changes to get this part of our business back in rhythm and we will.","Our fourth quarter call, I outlined five key integration priorities that we were focused on this year. Later George will provide more details and a status update shortly. Together, these five key priorities support the overarching objective of aligning the two companies to a common foundation.","This significant just table stakes work is required in order to minimize the confusion with customers and position the combined company to operate more efficiently, and ultimately generate the highest value from this combination. As a company, we made a decision to drive key integration activities aggressively from the start. We believe moving faster with things like the organization and product integration will get us to a desired end state and the results sooner than a piecemeal approach.","I previously noted that our 2015 integration priorities were entering a more complex phase, as I called it. Certainly, it is expected given we are undertaking the largest and most diversified integration project in the industry's history. Although the core business integration work is driving change in short-term volatility in the base business, this volatility will pass and the long-term potential remains strong.","I will conclude my prepared remarks by reiterating our ongoing confidence and the potential of the combined businesses, and the opportunity to grow the company in the long term in size and scale and achieve our next target of 12% comparable operating margins by the end of 2017.","Last year, we focused on executing our integration plan with few unforeseen challenges. A year later, the long-term potential remains the same and we are encountering impacts of change from the integration. It is a reminder that neither results nor change unfold in a linear fashion.","While results this quarter did not meet our high expectations, we expect the business to steadily improve, which is the case so far in the second quarter. Q1 was a new high point of integration change and we expect to start seeing our team settling into a sales and operating rhythms going forward. We also remain grounded that we still have sizable amount of integration work ahead of us and we continue to expect some unevenness in the business this year.","In consideration of this, Mike will review this with you and also provide you with a revised annual outlook. I want to finish by sincerely thanking our 74,000 team members for their remarkable commitment in supporting the changes to position our business for an outstanding future.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to George Sherman, our President. George?","George E. Sherman - President","Thanks, Darren. Good morning, everyone. First, I too would like to thank all of our team members for their contribution to customer service in the quarter and putting their focus and energy into meeting our customer commitments while stretching to complete many of our integration tasks. With my prepared remarks this morning, I'll provide commentary on our first quarter base business performance together with a progress update on our integration priorities.","As we mentioned in the past, Advance is on a path of continuous improvement and consistent execution and we've made tangible progress. However, when you layer on the integration that touches many parts of the organization, and namely customer facing parts such as our field and sales teams, it's clearly not business as usual. The multiyear integration plan will have a few peaks and Q1 was at a high point with many simultaneous work streams being executed. We expected our business would see some impact. However, it was more than we anticipated and led to sales outcomes that were below what we expect and aspire to deliver with a comp of 0.7%. I'll discuss the integration impact and status in more detail (10:42).","Turning to our commercial business. As Darren mentioned, our core commercial business faced the most change and experienced the greatest amount of variability. The overall industry is benefiting from the macro benefits, improving consumer confidence, and those are all net positives. Offsetting the industry tailwinds beyond the integration was weather impact we experienced in our core markets as we continued with high degrees of sales variability and lost sales days due to weather-related store closures.","With respect to our key customer segment, our TECH-NET commercial partnership programs are designed to help our customers improve their service and grow their business. We grew our TECH-NET program in the quarter high single digits year-over-year and now have over 6,500 members. Additionally, the vast majority of our strategic account business also grew at close to the same rate. Our BUD penetration continues to be a strategic priority and we continued our progress with meaningful growth in the quarter.","Turning to our DIY business. In 2015, we expect to improve our DIY business underpinned by three initiatives. First, our Speed Perks loyalty program. We've rolled that program out to all Advance stores, with the Carquest stores scheduled to receive it by approximately the end of Q2. The objective this year is about achieving scale through member acquisition. That translates to a year-end target of about 10 million members. We are on pace with over 4 million members at the end of Q1. The early indicators relative to increased frequency and basket size improvement from members in Q1 are meeting our expectations.","The second initiative is renewed emphasis in investments and marketing toward DIY customers with focus on the heavy DIY'er or the car guy. We like what we're seeing with our initial customer response, with sustained awareness from advertising ramps over time and we're tracking results closely.","Lastly, we continue to invest in our store team members through training initiatives that deliver a great customer experience. We're also working to improve the consistency and simplification of our DIY marketing and how it shows up in our stores to make the customer experience simple and clear. Overall, I'm satisfied with the progress we made in Q1 with DIY and the steps we're taking against our objective.","Turning to our integration. We are now into the second full year of integrating General Parts. This year is focused on aligning to a common foundation. The integration activities put pressure on the core capacity of the business in the quarter and we expected that to be the case. And frankly, it's the only way to move forward and get the teams through the change as quickly as possible and stay focused on the end-state outcomes.","With that in mind, I'd like to share a status update with you on the core integration activities we're undertaking this year stratified across five focus areas. First, our Store Support Center consolidation is essentially complete. During the second half of last year and for the first quarter, we've made the required decisions and worked through the changes to ensure we have all team members operating in their go-forward roles by the end of Q1.","The team members moving between Roanoke to Raleigh will be fully complete after the school year and the Minnesota office is set to close in July. It was important to get all this done, so new team members can begin ramping up the required learning curves as quickly as possible and improving operational execution throughout the year.","Second, our field operations and sales team integration is complete. In Q1, we integrated our field teams across 33 regions in order to build a structure with singular leadership across both brands. We consider this work absolutely essential and a part of the integration that we needed to address with speed and conviction. Our history with acquisitions tells us that unifying teams with aligned goals, career tracks and rewards, allows team members certainty in their role in the go-forward organization.","The cultural overlay between our teams has been positive from the start and that certainly continues. Restructuring our field sales teams is something we needed to do both for our team and our customers. And aligned sales team prevents redundant sales calls and shows an aligned face to our business across the Advance and Carquest brands. As with any field structure change of that magnitude, we experienced disruptions both internally in changing reporting structures and externally from sales reps and the customer relationships shifts. We're now emerging from the high point of the learning curve and the focus is now back squarely on sustainable performance rhythms.","Third, now turning to our consolidation conversion and relocation work. When we updated you last, we have completed our early consolidation program for the first 100 stores, which were predominantly those lowest performing stores in the chain.","In the quarter, we converted the stores served by our Dallas Distribution Center which includes the Dallas and Houston markets. We are very pleased with the team member, customer and financial results. What is most rewarding is the ability to be successful with these conversions in a market that is so highly competitive. We'll next be executing this program in stores served by three distribution centers in Q2, in Salt Lake City, San Antonio and Bangor, Maine. This next wave is approximately 70 stores.","In the back half of 2015, we expect to move at a run rate of 110 stores to 115 stores, consolidated or converted per quarter starting in Q3. The program is projected to run until mid-2017 when the Carquest chain will be fully converted. Overall, we continue to be on schedule with our plan.","Notably, unlike retail store conversions, which can be simple for both customers and our team members, our conversions and consolidations impact how our commercial customer does business day to day. The consolidations affect commercial customers differently and require more effort and agility around the process to make sure we are not only executing the mechanics of the transition, but retain the customers through the process and getting them quickly back to normal operating routines.","We also successfully completed the consolidation of approximately 40 Autopart International stores in Florida in Q1 (16:49) the acquisition process to drive more efficiency and better profit outcomes. These consolidations have gone well and we're very pleased with the sales and profit performance.","The fourth priority is our product changeovers. We began the work in late Q4 of aligning the products, the brands, and the pricing between the Carquest and Advance stores. This program has two components: product re-labels and product replacement.","We've completed 90% of our re-label program as of the end of Q1. This involve team member capacity and focus, including independent store owners and distribution center team members, touching over 20 million pieces of merchandise.","We also completed the additional phases of replacing complete product lines. That's more difficult work since it involves sweeping product back to a central facility, setting new planograms, and bringing in the new product. That requires execution at the supplier, supply chain and store levels that is inherently more complicated. In pursuit of building the best house of brands in the industry, it also involve teaching our teams to sell brands they may have competed with in the past.","Additionally, we continue price alignment work between brands and have aligned approximately 80% of product pricing to commercial customers between Carquest and Advance stores. The outcome is to have one consistent set of prices in all stores across the chain.","Naturally, we have some customer reaction as we move pricing. Certainly in the cases where we lower pricing, that impact is immediate. Getting the required increase in unit velocity that's needed to compensate for the price decrease is not. We've been satisfied with the overall outcome and while it's likely had a negative impact on both our comps and earnings in the quarter, we know this work positions us correctly in the market for the long term, and it had to be done.","Our fifth key priority focus is on our systems and supply chain integration efforts. Looking at systems first. We have completed a significant amount of due diligence on what is understandably a complex part of this integration. The complexity arises largely from three areas: first, migrating and rationalizing the two sets of enterprise systems over to one go-forward platform; second, continue with the Carquest legacy systems; and finally, whenever you bring a set of systems that were designed for a private company under a public company umbrella, it requires additional work to get the systems the same place as Advance is from a functionality and compliance standpoint.","We're taking a measured approach to this complex work ensuring that we focus on high-value areas for our team and customer first. Last year, we were able to complete several systems projects as planned to support the product changeover work, store conversion work, our organization conversion work, and financial compliance requirements.","The next phase of our work is focused on getting the Carquest stores, Advance stores and both e-commerce platforms on to a common Carquest-based product catalog. This is the most valuable element of customer experience and is the value-creating element of the store system by allowing Advance to offer the industry's deepest catalog. We're doing the back-end work this year and expect to migrate the change to that common catalog in 2016.","The third major segment of systems integration is the work of connecting the Carquest and Advance distribution centers and stores systems into one integrated supply chain. That work is also well underway and we expect to begin the process of converting the supply chains in the middle of next year. Concurrent with the systems work is our ongoing expansion of daily delivery in the legacy Advance network. At the end of the quarter, we have 700 Advance stores being serviced daily.","We expect to have approximately 1,000 Advance stores being serviced daily by the end of the year. Our best estimate today is, we'll be nearing completion of the entire chain on daily delivery by the end of 2017. Once the supply chain systems work is completed, we can then finish the consolidation of the back end financial systems. By definition, that'll occur last. And at this point, we expect to be able to complete that work in late 2017.","Lastly, before I close, I'd like to take a moment to share some insights as we focus on pushing forward our growth agenda as a combined company. A few comments on the major ones. Worldpac continues to execute its growth plan at or above expectations and we continue to invest in that business and its growth including the planned opening of 12 new branches this year. Carquest Canada completed the majority of the product changes last year and had no field organizational integration activities, and is now driving solid double-digit growth in local currency for the Carquest Canada business.","Finally, while not the core focus of the acquisition, we see solid DIY growth in stores where we installed the Advance DIY capabilities as part of the store conversions.","In closing, what I'd like to convey is that, we are in the midst of an operationally taxing integration year, and while there have been some challenges, some more than we anticipated and others that we've yet to tackle, those challenges are simply part of this process and should not be interpreted in any other way.","The parts of our organization that are not in the midst of integration change are delivering with strength. We remain absolutely confident in executing against the plan and by the future we see for our company as we work to integrating this acquisition and positioning Advance for growth and industry leadership.","While I've gone into detail to give you a better context on what some of the challenges around the integration look like, make no mistake, we are moving forward every day and are absolutely confident in our ability to execute this work while building upon our core business.","Despite facing the toughest quarter of integration, we grew sales for the sixth quarter in a row. As aspects of the integration move to complete status where we see a majority of certain tasks behind us, there will certainly be a sustained period of execution focus to ensure that we maximize the value of the work that we've done, and continue to emerge as a top commercial competitor.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Mike Norona, our Chief Financial Officer.","Michael A. Norona - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, George, and good morning everyone. I'd like to start by thanking all of our talented team members for their commitment to serving our customers during the quarter while also navigating the change driven by our integration efforts. In my remarks today, I plan to review the financial highlights from our first quarter of 2015 and provide some insights on the remainder of the year.","As a reminder, and unless otherwise specified, Advance will present its financials and supporting commentary on a consolidated enterprise basis, and would also discuss results on a comparable basis which excludes the impacts of one-time integration expenses and amortization of intangible assets both related to the acquisition of General Parts.","Our financial results were below our expectation in our first quarter of 2015, primarily driven by our integration activities. We expected the heavier integration efforts to impact our financial performance in 2015. However, the combination of both the volume of change and the areas of the business that were impacted had a greater financial impact than we anticipated at the beginning of the year. The changes had the most impact on our commercial sales.","Despite the softness, we were able to grow our profit rate and deliver on our synergy expectations. We are confident that we will work through the required operational phases of our integration and deliver the compelling financial value of our combination with GPI.","Turning to sales. Our first quarter net sales increased 2.3% to $3.04 billion compared to our first quarter of 2014. This sales growth was principally driven by the addition of new stores, our comparable store sales increase of 0.7%, which was led by the growth of our commercial business, a 40 basis point sequential improvement in our DIY business from Q4 2014 offset by a net 21 basis point foreign currency impact.","We also experienced more pronounced variability in our commercial sales, where, in some cases, we saw greater than a 300 basis point gap in our commercial sales comps in places where we shifted customer relationships versus where we had no changes. This variability is part of the change and we expect it to be short term.","Comp sales were also partially affected by unfavorable weather across some of our Great Lakes and Northeast markets. As a reminder, General Parts company-owned locations are included in our comp sales calculation beginning in February 2015. Sales to our independent customers are not part of our comp calculation.","Turning to gross profit. Our gross profit rate dollars in the first quarter increased 3% to $1.39 billion from $1.35 billion in our first quarter of 2014. Our gross profit rate of 45.9% was up 31 basis points compared to first quarter of 2014. This year-over-year rate increase was due to 45 basis points of achieved merchandise cost synergies partially offset by cost from our new Hartford, Connecticut DC that opened in late 2014.","Turning to SG&A. Our comparable SG&A rate was 35.7% in the quarter, which improved 26 basis points compared to our first quarter of 2014. This year-over-year improvement was the result of achieved cost synergies and lower incentive compensation partially offset by slightly higher advertising expenses related to our DIY business.","All in, first quarter comparable cash EPS was $2.39, up 6.2% on top of last year's 35.5%. As a reminder, in our first quarter, last year, we had a $0.05 EPS impact in one-time favorable tax audit settlements. Our first quarter operating income dollars on a comparable basis increased 8.4% to $308.3 million and our operating income rate increased 57 basis points over the same period last year to 10.1%. Included in our operating income was $24 million in net incremental acquisition synergies. We are pleased that we continue to deliver against our synergy expectations.","Operating cash flow increased approximately 26% to $102.2 million in the first quarter versus $81.1 million during the same period last year. Free cash flow increased to $45.2 million in the first quarter versus $20.6 million during the same period last year. Our AP ratio for the quarter was 76.5% versus 75.9% last year. At the end of the first quarter, we had roughly $1.61 billion of debt on our balance sheet, and our adjusted debt-to-EBITDAR was 2.7 times.","During the quarter, we paid down approximately $26.6 million of debt and are progressing as planned to pay down debt with our free cash flow to get back below the 2.5 times leverage ratio and maintain our investment grade ratings. We continue to measure the performance of our business and prioritize our investments to achieve growth, profit, and value creation. Our growth engine is our commercial business, which is driven by the growth of new and existing customers.","We also see a opportunity to organically grow stores to over 6,000 locations, which include doubling the size of Worldpac and growing our independent business. Additionally, we expect our loyalty program, which targets the heavy DIY'er, will drive more consistent DIY comp performance through increased frequency and a stronger sales mix of hard parts.","Turning to profit. We see an opportunity to grow our comparable operating income rate to 12% by the end of 2017. As context, our combined post-acquisition comparable operating income rate was 9.1%, reflecting the acquisition of a lower-margin commercial-heavy business. In 2014, through improvements and operational execution together with our achieved year-one synergies, we closed out our first year as a combined company with an operating income rate of 9.9%, which was approximately 80 basis point improvement from the post-acquisition starting point.","This puts us on track against our next profit objective of achieving a 12% rate. This is realistic given it considers the rebalancing of the gross margin profile of our now more commercially weighted business that has a different commercial customer, including national accounts, government, paint and an independent business. Part of getting to 12% lies in delivering $160 million in cost synergies previously outlined and also includes modest profit rate improvements as we move to daily delivery, optimize our current supply chain network, and through our merchandising capabilities such as global sourcing.","We also must take approximately 100 basis points out of our cost structure as we transition to a lower gross margin commercial-weighted business. The key drivers will be reducing our G&A profile in our support centers, lowering system costs as we eliminate duplicate systems as part of our integration efforts, and reducing variability across our store portfolio in both profitability and productivity.","With respect to value creation, the acquisition of GPI continues to provide us with a compelling opportunity to drive shareholder returns through incremental earnings and cash flow. In addition to improving our operating performance, an equally compelling opportunity exists with our balance sheet.","We expect to deliver measurable working capital benefits from our supply chain and IT systems integration work, driven principally through our daily replenishment expansion, optimizing our combined supply chain network, and moving to one set of systems and processes. The outcome of this work will result in a lower inventory investment with greater SKU availability, along with continued progress on our vendor terms, both of which will show up in an improved AP ratio.","Also we're on pace to get back to our targeted level of 2.5 times and maintain our investment grade ratings. Once achieved, we will revert back to our previous capital allocation strategies to drive shareholder value, which includes investing in our business and deploying our share buyback program.","Turning to the balance of the year. We do expect to see continued short-term business volatility from our integration activities, given these changes were sequenced throughout the first quarter and our teams were still working through the changes as we exited the quarter. The duration of the change is difficult to predict, given the reality that change takes time, as there is an acceptance and learning curve our teams are working through. It's prudent to build in the earnings miss we experienced in our first quarter and factor in some continued integration headwinds into our results, primarily impacting our commercial sales.","We now expect our annual comparable store sales to be at the low end of the previously communicated low single-digits range. As a result, we are revising our full-year comparable cash EPS outlook down to $8.10 to $8.30. As part of this outlook, we expect our share count to be 73.7 million shares, our tax rate to be in the range of 37.5% to 38%, and our interest expense to be approximately $64 million.","We are confident in our team's ability to execute and our revised full-year outlook reflects our best view of the short-term change impacts from the integration. Our 2015 synergy estimates remain unchanged at $45 million to $55 million for the full year.","In closing, our first quarter of 2015 was more challenging than we anticipated given the degree of change that impacted our teams from the integration. That said, these changes were required to move to one common foundation that will enable us to deliver the full potential of our combination with GPI, and we are confident in our team's ability to navigate through this change. We are also encouraged by the strong performance from those parts of the business that were not impacted by our integration work, which shows we're on the right path.","I would like to finish by thanking our team members once again for their tremendous and tireless efforts in the first quarter and for what they do every day to serve our customers, inspire our team members, and grow our company. Operator, we are ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question comes from Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. Thank you. Your line is open.","Gregory S. Melich - Evercore ISI","Hi. Thanks. I had a couple questions. Mike, I think you've mentioned synergies, $24 million of net acquisition synergies. Is that a cumulative figure including last year's first quarter or how should we think about that number? And then I had a follow-up.","Michael A. Norona - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","That's an incremental number, Greg. If you remember last year, we did a little bit over $8 million. And this year, we're a little bit over $32 million. And that is a net number.","Gregory S. Melich - Evercore ISI","So we should think of the $24 million as being halfway through to the $45 million you expect for this year?","Michael A. Norona - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. The way to think about that, Greg, if you think about last year, our synergies built. So in the first half of the year, last year, we had about 30% of our synergies and they've built throughout the year. This year, it's going to be the opposite \u2013 it's going to be the flip, roughly 75% of our synergies will happen in the first half of the year, and then the last 25%, just because they'll be annualizing the bigger numbers from last year.","Gregory S. Melich - Evercore ISI","Got it. And then second question is, could you remind us how many distribution centers you now have for each business, or now it's one business but how we started with GPI and Advance? And how the plan of integrating these and how many you expect to have as you move forward on that integration?","Darren R. Jackson - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, Greg. Good morning. So in total, we're at 44 centers today. We've completed a logistics network study that's going to inform us on where we're going to end up from an integration perspective. Where we are on the journey right now is, we are going to do a significant amount of upgrade work on a large number of the Carquest DCs to prepare the capacity for the expansion of our conversions. And in the second quarter we'll be in a position to start announcing where we're going to be with (35:21). We obviously have a lot of work to do in different markets and that's when we'll come back and give you greater insights in terms of total count.","Gregory S. Melich - Evercore ISI","So this year is about fixing up the ones we have to make them as optimal and then we decide which ones to close next year? Is that a fair way to think about it?","Darren R. Jackson - Chief Executive Officer & Director","That's exactly right.","Gregory S. Melich - Evercore ISI","Great. Thanks. I'll let someone else have a shot.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Lasser with UBS.","Michael Louis Lasser - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. As you get into some of these more complex marketing integration, are you finding anything that's changing your longer-term view or causing you to change direction? So perhaps you're realizing that some of the systems from either legacy organization just may not be up to speed and you're going to go through a big change in management process anyways, so why not take this as an opportunity to bring everything up to the state-of-the-art?","George E. Sherman - President","Michael, good morning. It's George. I'll start with that one and turn it over to Bill Carter, who is running our integration. We are very committed to powering through the conversions and the consolidations. And I think if you look at conversions as a starting point, that's relatively straightforward work. We've done it in the past. We have a core competency around it. We like the DIY outcome that has come with much of that work. The consolidations are inherently more complicated. But, again, I think with the BWP acquisition, we learned how to do a consolidation quite well.","A little bit more taxing, a little bit more time-consuming, but we have to keep on working through this. We've not seen anything that would cause us to dramatically change any of the schedules.","Bill Carter - Senior Vice President, Business Development and Integration","That's correct both from a store standpoint and a product standpoint. You heard George mention the progress we're making and we continue to be on track. I think the second part of your question is, are you learning stuff through the integration that's causing you to change.","I'd say we learn every week, we learn every month, and we make tweaks. We're not radically changing the long-term integration plan by any stretch of the imagination, but we continue to improve it over time. One example that George mentioned on the call is, we recognize the value of giving to our common catalogs sooner rather than later. So that our availability across the network can be similar across platforms.","So we're prioritizing that as something that's a value-creating engine for the team member and the customer. And that was a learning that we probably had three or four months ago, as we were doing our due diligence and have adjusted accordingly. To prioritize that is something we're bringing to the front from a value creation and common foundation standpoint.","Darren R. Jackson - Chief Executive Officer & Director","I'd also say, Michael, that we're not changing the process but we're certainly iterating the process. So every consolidation, we get a bit better. So, for instance, if a Carquest store is moving into an Advance store and that base of business that they're bringing along with them require some parts that were not in the assortment of the Advance store, we're being more expeditious in moving that over.","Bill Carter - Senior Vice President, Business Development and Integration","Correct.","Darren R. Jackson - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Maybe last case. Michael, your last question is why not get everything to state-of-the-art. That would be hard. But there will be a handful of things that will be state-of-the-art by 2017. Our catalog will be state-of-the-art by 2017 and we'll start to experience some of those benefits as early as the beginning of next year. Our supply chain, in terms of daily replenishment, by the end of 2017, will \u2013 the 5x delivery across the nation will be state-of-the-art.","So there's more examples. So we're trying to balance this, as George said, in terms of the team's ability to kind of work through the change, things that we have to power through versus piecemeal, and we're keeping an eye on the things that are critical to the customer relationship that should be state-of-the-art by the time we get through this in 2017.","Michael Louis Lasser - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. That's super helpful. And, I guess, what we're all trying to figure out is just \u2013 with all the pieces you have in place and what you're learning, there's nothing that suggest that you won't be able to close the \u2013 or at least narrow the margin gap that AAP currently have with some of its peers over time. So there's nothing that's really changing in the longer term? And then, as part of that, when should we expect that \u2013 some of the recent integration hiccups are going to be less impactful and the business will perform more in line with the market? Thank you so much.","George E. Sherman - President","Hey, Michael. It's George again. I don't think we see anything that would cause us to change any margin expectations. As far as the work and what's behind us and what's ahead, I tried to give some detail on this and I'll give a bit more. I think if you look at the actual work that's been done, we've tried to move to a common foundation between the two companies and we see that \u2013 we mean product brand alignment, pricing, process, getting the store support centers consolidated, getting our store leadership teams consolidated in the field, and then beginning some of the early consolidation, conversion and relocation work.","If you look at that, I think the product label part of this is largely behind us. So again, that was very physically intensive. It's touching 20 million pieces of merchandise and it's essentially close to done. So we're emerging there.","If you look at the product replacement, that work is still ahead of us category by category. As far as pricing, we're nearly complete. Most of the pricing unification has happened, and it certainly has in the major product lines. I call the work ahead of us some of the clean-up work odds and ends, but the major lines have now been changed. That's a big change for us.","If you're in the field and you're working with customers and the pricing is different between an Advance store and a Carquest store and you're beginning to bring your customer base together, that leads to questions, obviously, on why someone is getting a lower price than someone else.","And then, I think, when the work is done, as you can imagine, one of two things has to happen. If we raise price, it's holding line on unit velocity. And then if we lower prices, it is getting the unit lift that we need to pay back for the pricing investment that we make. So we're making progress there. And I think we're emerging from that portion of it as well.","The support centers are \u2013 the work is done. Now, bringing the teams up to speed, ramping them up in terms of just their handle on their new positions remain something that takes a bit of time. But I think those major elements are behind us. The product lift is still ahead, no question about that. There'll be some more work around that. A little bit of pricing work needs to be done yet. And then, obviously, the conversions, consolidations will go on for well over a year and a half, two years.","Michael Louis Lasser - UBS Securities LLC","This was helpful. Thank you so much.","Darren R. Jackson - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities.","Seth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Good morning and thank you for taking my question. My first question is around the cadence of the impact from some of the integration changes that you're making. I understand that they're temporary and primarily in Q1. But as you've gone through the first month of the second quarter, have you seen the impact lessen? And does that give you confidence that you'll be able to hit your new targets for 2015?","George E. Sherman - President","Yes, Seth. It does. And I think there are markets where either the change has been limited or the change has abated. If you look at our Canadian business, again, they did this work last year. Their product replacement is well behind them, they've activated on it, and they're running nice solid double-digit results in local currency. If you look at Autopart International business, they've been protected from most of this change and are continuing to run very nice growth.","Worldpac is just growing and is completely isolated from this change and is running nice single-digit growth. Where we went into Dallas\/Fort Worth on the go-forward systems, we have seen very good results in a very competitive market where we've begun to \u2013 where we did the work early, and, Seth, we did the BWP work well ahead of this. That was the biggest concentration of Carquest business in the Northeast. So much of that work is behind us and we like the way that we've emerged into Q2 with our Northeastern business, and the intensity of the change of management is far less of a factor there.","Seth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","That's helpful. So the earnings revision for the year is primarily related to the miss in the first quarter as well as some pressure in the second quarter with very little change to the second half vision?","Darren R. Jackson - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, that's a way to think about it. It's always \u2013 I think George really articulated well. All those things didn't happen at the same time in the first quarter. So some of the change happened throughout the quarter, so we're still navigating through the change. So I think that's a way to think about it, Seth. It's always difficult to predict the exact level of change and the learning curve that the teams are going through, but a way to think about the outlook is we've built in the miss in the first quarter. We have lowered our sales for the balance of the year. We went to the low end of our previous range. If you think of a low-single digits in kind that 1% to 3% range, we think we're going to be in the low end of the range and I think that reflects what you just shared. So that's kind of how we thought about (44:54)","George E. Sherman - President","But I would look at the change as, is it the product brand work? Is it the pricing work? Is it the process work? Is it the corporate work? And I think it's an amalgamation. It's all those things. And as I said, some of that is behind us now. So we see this abating during the course of the year.","Seth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Very helpful. Last question for me. The DIY business, it seems like you made some progress there. Can you comment as to whether or not the comps in DIY were stronger in the first quarter than the fourth quarter?","Michael A. Norona - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. We said they sequentially improved 40 basis points, Seth.","Seth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Great. I missed that. Thank you very much.","Darren R. Jackson - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs.","Matthew Jeremy Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks a lot and good morning. Two quick questions. I'll ask them both up at once. First of all, as you think about the impact of the loyalty program, you spoke about its impact on sales. Can you talk about how that tends to impact margin and how you expect the margin impact to progress as that program ramps? And then, secondly, if you could just update us if you haven't already done so, on the sales impact, on the sales recapture rate that you're seeing as you close, as you continue to consolidate some stores.","Darren R. Jackson - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, Matthew, sorry go ahead.","George E. Sherman - President","Yeah, Matt, let me start off with the Speed Perks program and then Charles Tyson will add some comments as well. I think we've been satisfied with every aspect of Speed Perks. They have a membership of well over 4 million here early in Q2 and 4 million at the end of Q1. We think that we're on with something pretty good here. We think that the program is distinctive and is the best in the industry. It has been a win for us in terms of all the financial fundamentals. The sales lift has been good, the transaction growth has been good, we're seeing a bounce-back effect.","Matthew Jeremy Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And as you think about \u2013 understand that sales work \u2013 is there, just to make sure that we model it correctly. Is there some give back on gross margin? Obviously, the gross profit dollars have to be doing well for you to like what you see. But does the margin rate come down and does that build, or is there a cadence to that?","Charles E. Tyson - EVP-Merchandising, Marketing & Supply Chain","Yeah. Matthew, its Charles. Yeah, there is an impact from a gross margin rate. Obviously, the impact on sales and the growth we're seeing from that customer segment that have joined the Speed Perks program has a very positive gross margin dollar impact. So from a pro forma perspective, when we piloted this, we are exceeding our expectations from the pro forma that we set for ourselves for this year.","Matthew Jeremy Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great.","Bill Carter - Senior Vice President, Business Development and Integration","And, Matt, just this is Bill. Just to answer the question on the consolidation results. As George mentioned in his comments, we completed the early consolidation program as of the end of last year. That was focused on the 100 lowest-performing low-profit stores of Carquest. We are pleased with those profit and sales results from those. And we recaptured about 60% to 80% of the revenue that was associated in those Carquest stores, obviously some variability based on markets and how well we executed.","As we move into the broader consolidations associated with the market conversion plan that George outlined, we expect consolidation performance to improve and be at the higher end of that range versus the lower end of that range as we work with programs that are bigger and stronger in nature to start with and we do more meticulous planning of the customer transitions as part of the larger consolidations. So that's where we're performing at this point.","Matthew Jeremy Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you so much.","Michael A. Norona - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","And just as a reminder, sorry, Bill, 60% to 80% is in the commercial part of the business.","Matthew Jeremy Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And holistically, if you include DIY, I understand that DIY is kind of tiny for those for certainly the Carquest stores you're closing.","Darren R. Jackson - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. It's not a meaningful figure. It generally disperses. And especially for those, it absolutely disperses. So it wouldn't change that number appreciably.","Matthew Jeremy Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Higginbotham with SunTrust.","Robert Higginbotham - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning. I was hoping to get a little more color on what really surprised you in your integration process. Was it really that things were taking longer or were just tougher to execute, or was there a piece of there being a sharper reaction, if you will, from your customer base? And one thing I'm trying to get at is to the extent that you lost some share through these changes, do you expect to get that back, call it, immediately once you're done with those changes or you think you'll have to work harder, if you will, to win that business back?","George E. Sherman - President","Yeah, it's George. I'll start off with that and ask Bill Carter to make some comments as well. I think if you look at the work, again, I think if there's something that made an impression, it would be the cumulative effect. I don't think there's any one aspect of it that was more complicated than what we thought, and I think we're well in control of every aspect of the integration. It's hard work. I would call the combination, the one that has made things a bit more complicated. A lot of things falling into place at the same time, pricing changes, product changes. Any time we do a product replacement, you're relying on execution at multiple levels including the suppliers. We've had a couple of instances where it hasn't been the best first impression of a new part coming onboard because of the in-stock condition at the time.","I think when you look at the pricing work, again it's a multi-phase challenge. It's not just getting the pricing unified; it's getting the activation around that new price once it's done. And that takes time, getting the sales team out there into the shop to communicate that. So it's no one single thing; it's the combination of all of them landing at the same time.","Bill Carter - Senior Vice President, Business Development and Integration","It's the combination of the, to answer your question specifically, Robert, nothing took longer than we expected. I think it was just tougher when it all added up in Q1, change for our team, and as George mentioned change due to some of the product and pricing changes that the team and the customer worked through. So it was more of an amalgamation of them than any particular things sticking out as a surprise.","Robert Higginbotham - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","And on the customer reaction.","Darren R. Jackson - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Parts of it were terrific. So if I can go back to the cultural overlay and the field alignment, we asked our teams to go to 33 regions across the country and we combined (51:17) of our regional vice presidents come from Carquest, some of them come from Advance. They initially spoke a bit of a different language in terms of how they focus around the business, and that, one quarter later, has meshed together very, very well.","Robert Higginbotham - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. And in terms of winning back some of the business, I mean granted you're still growing commercial, but winning back some of the share that you presumably lost, do you expect that to happen kind of automatically, or will you have to do something incremental to get that back?","Darren R. Jackson - Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think while some of the change has been tough, and let's talk about the product brand alignment. Uniformly, we like where we're going. So when the work is done and when the work is behind us and we have this new house of brands that we think is terrific, our team is behind it, our customer is behind it, and we're very confident that we'll win back.","Bill Carter - Senior Vice President, Business Development and Integration","And we've experienced this in previous integrations when we did BWP and we had things disruptive. This year, it came back over time. Within a year, usually, but not instantaneously. It's not going to come back next week. So we feel good about the recovery. It definitely wasn't nearly as bad as what occurred in some of the previous ones. But that share comes back. We regain that share with customers and we do it over a reasonable period of time.","Robert Higginbotham - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Got it. That's very helpful. And my second question is really on your general pricing strategy. Historically, it seems like you've been pretty aggressive in the marketplace in commercial. As you harmonize pricing, is that a fair way of thinking about how you're currently going to market? Does price become less of a point of competition as you increase daily delivery and now have bigger muscle as a bigger enterprise?","Darren R. Jackson - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, I think that's absolutely the case. When we looked at the pricing continuum, as you'd expect, Advance was on the more competitive side and Carquest was on the higher side. We struck a point where we felt it was the right pricing strategy for the kind of commercial business that we are going to emerge as and that we've become. And that includes 5x delivery benefits. That includes a lot of the commercial know-how coming from Carquest that includes the Carquest Training Institute, that includes our TECH-NET programs, banner programs that have come out of this partnership.","Robert Higginbotham - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Got it. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Dan Wewer with Raymond James.","Dan R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hi. Thanks. Can you talk about the perspective of your commercial customer, what they saw differently from Advance and Carquest in the last quarter that resulted in the market share in your commercial channel I guess weakening a bit? Was it a disruption in your in-stock capabilities, your ability to hotshot a part within 30 minutes? Was it a change in the salesmen covering their account? If you can give us some clarity on that.","George E. Sherman - President","Sure. I'd be glad to, and I'll kind of give it to you from the perspective of if you were a district manager for, say, Carquest and some of the change that's happening right now. Those customers working with that team will have seen some product changes. Clearly, there have been changes in filters and in belts and in chassis and in gaskets and in batteries. So brands that you've been used to selling for many years, you're now in some cases selling a new one, and in all cases going forward you will be. So it's bringing the customer along on that journey and just showing and demonstrating the quality of the part, and I'd start it off right there.","I think the pricing part of it has been an impact as well where there is some interim period of time where again in a market Carquest and Advance have two different prices. And then we have a new one going forward. So for those Carquest customers, they're very often seeing lower pricing. And again, we have to activate and sell more when that happens, but that's a change.","Some of the systems tend to change for our team along the way. We try to make that as transparent as possible and protect our customers from change. So from a B2B standpoint, they're using the same systems that they always have.","So I think those are the major changes. And we have changed some of our sales territories and that's another part of it where we did not want to have a customer have an Advance commercial account manager come knocking on the door and then the Carquest commercial account manager came knocking on the door 10 minutes later. That appears to be disorganized and is confusing for the customer, and we've changed that.","So we have built new sales territories with a single representative representing both brands in some cases. But every customer has one commercial account manager only, not multiple. So in some cases, it's a new phase; in others, it's the same.","Dan R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Just following up on the previous question, I don't understand if a commercial is now, let's say, doing more business with O'Reilly or more business with NAPA, and perhaps Advance or Carquest drop down the first call list. If they're getting a good experience with your competitor, why are they going to toggle back to Advance two or three quarters down the road?","George E. Sherman - President","Well, I think we'll have converted all of our brand work. We'll have all of our availability in all of our brands lined up, our pricing lined up. I'll remind you, some of those of relationships go back for years and years. So there might be a period of time where part of our integration is showing up in a commercial shop, but we've been with these folks for a long, long time and that matters.","Darren R. Jackson - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, Dan. This is Darren. So part of the indicators I look at \u2013 because I think that's a fantastic question is that when we look at our strategic and national accounts, our growth slowed a little bit in the quarter, but you know what? The ones that had been leading the way continue to lead the way, so whether that's CarMax or whether that's DriveTime or others, we feel really good about that.","When I peer into the Carquest network, their banner programs, we grew that business in the quarter 7%, so those tend to be some of the large bay installers, and then we grew the TECH-NET customers specifically. Now there's only 6,500 of them, but we grew those double-digits in the quarter as well. And those tend to be a leading indicator of the best relationships and we built up \u2013 or I should say, the Carquest team has built up a lot of great equity in terms of those relationships.","Now, we did see a little bit of a pullback on the Advance side to some of that, weather always events out. But I think when we move the sales people, you know what? What happened is we are not able to give as much attention as we're going through the process and what we have to focus on and what we're monitoring is that quarter in and quarter out, Mike talked about a 300 basis point volatility in terms of touching customers. So each period, we've seen that volatility come down a little bit. And what is it? Is that we're touching customers again on a consistent basis. And so, that's how you win people back and then you augment it, as we've said, with getting the pricing right, the product brands and the consistency.","Dan R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","And just a real quick question for Mike, on your 12% operating margin goal for 2017, you talked about 100 basis points of cost reductions. I guess that equates to about $100 million. Is that going to be back-loaded primarily to 2017 or would you expect to achieve some of that $100 million savings either late this year or in 2016?","Michael A. Norona - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. The way to think about it, Dan, is we really started that once we put this acquisition together. Our operating margins were at 9.1%. Last year, we did some work on our costs. This year, we're doing some work on the costs. And I think you're right. It will start to accelerate into next year and then we'll probably see the biggest change hit us in 2017. I think we've talked about our cost before as we move to a lower cost, lower commercial model. We see opportunities at our support centers to take costs and make ourselves more efficient in those areas.","IT is an area as we get rid of duplicate systems. It's a big opportunity. And then, as we improve the profitability and productivity and the variability across our store base. So we think those are big opportunities and its work that \u2013 it will be very planful. It will be very thoughtful. And then part of also getting to 12% is keeping our sales going and growing the comps. So that's another important dimension.","Dan R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Right. Great. Thank you.","Darren R. Jackson - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question today comes from Chris Horvers of JPMorgan.","Christopher M. Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks and good morning. So question asked \u2013 maybe asked prior, but a little differently this time. So, I'm trying to dial in the impact of the integration impact on the Carquest commercial business versus the heritage AAP commercial. On Carquest, there was a lot of concern that the business had decelerated all year in 2014 and worries that something was breaking there on the integration. And then, heritage AAP commercial did very well last year.","So maybe can you share some insights on Carquest and the heritage AAP and maybe highlight regions that didn't have as much change impact and how those businesses performed and what the lift you're seeing from daily delivery in heritage AAP?","George E. Sherman - President","Yeah. I think if you look at, Chris, the change for the Carquest commercial business, I highlight one thing, the beneficiary of a pricing benefit. So, certainly, we're seeing that happen and, again, that activation piece of getting the unit velocity back is not immediate. So if you look at where that's happening more often than not, lower pricing is happening in the Carquest network. They're having to go catch up, get the velocity to drive the dollars above where it was before.","There really aren't many markets in the country where there is change to Carquest. The best indicator of that would be the BWP business. And again, as Bill said, there is a trough initially, but we certainly see ourselves come out of it and build upon the business. In the 5x markets, we've been very pleased with the lift and the most recent work that we've done was Lakeland, Florida to get the North Florida on the daily delivery. Very happy with our outcomes in Florida. And then, of course, we have a new Hartford, Connecticut facility that is at about 160 stores now and beginning to ramp up more and more, bringing daily delivery to the Northeast. And we're happy with those results too. And especially the way that just recently with a lot of the change behind us in the Northeast, that market we're pleased with.","Christopher M. Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC","So the daily delivery lift is basically, as you've rolled more DCs and more stores, it's been consistent with your prior experiences?","Darren R. Jackson - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. That's correct. Obviously, as George said, we've been very happy with the impact in our Lakeland facility. And our team did a wonderful job in executing that without any interruption of service to our customers. And we're beginning to see that flow through into our new Hartford facility. And we will complete more of that work as we move through the year this year.","George E. Sherman - President","Yeah. Probably the most, the clearest example we have is what's going on in Canada, right team? They went through a first, littlest changed, double-digit comps. And all the competitive set's different, but there are some pretty good competitors up there as well and the team is doing a great job. Worldpac continues just, it's a very nice business, growing above our early expectations, so they're doing a nice job. And the BWP market, certainly, less change there and they're a leading indicator to, yeah. We just have to power through it. And so we got to finish through the things we got to power through, and we got to manage to the integration plan that we set out there.","Darren R. Jackson - Chief Executive Officer & Director","And I'll also say that our Dallas\/Fort Worth market opening has been a great example, so we're very happy with the results in Dallas\/Fort Worth and how we entered a new market. And we used something close to what the go-forward model will look like. We used the Carquest distribution center. It is on daily delivery. We opened up super hubs geographically spaced across the DFW Metroplex. We've got a combined team. There will be some change still in those markets. It's not entirely on the go-forward plan, but it opened up well and certainly we like the outcome there.","Christopher M. Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And so two quick follow-ups. So A, what did your \u2013 what was the first quarter earnings below your internal expectations? And B, what do you attribute the improvement in the DIY business to because the compares are actually tougher. So was this actually the loyalty card helping? Thanks.","Michael A. Norona - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. I'll hit the first one, and I'll let Darren get the second one. I mean it's real simple. It was on the top line. We said it. The change that George put through \u2013 discussed, we believe those are shorter-term impacts. They had an impact on our field teams. And it impacted \u2013 and it primarily came through on our commercial sales. So that was really our shortfall. I think we were pleased with some of the things. Really pleased with our synergy work and what we did there. And so we're building momentum there, but really it showed up on the commercial sales side.","Darren R. Jackson - Chief Executive Officer & Director","On the DIY side, I think the single biggest change was the Speed Perks program; again, very happy with the membership base that's being built. I'll also add that we changed our marketing strategy and you'll see a shift in our marketing mix more toward TV. And on TV, you'll see them in places where car guys tend to watch TV, so a car-related show on Velocity TV, a NASCAR broadcast, and we're getting very, very good feedback on that and I think it certainly highlights what's different about our loyalty program.","Operator","At this time, I will turn the call back over to Zaheed Mawani for any final comments.","Zaheed Mawani - Vice President, Finance Planning, Analysis and Investor Relations","Thanks, Lisa, and thanks to everyone for participating on our first quarter earnings conference call. That concludes our call. Thank you.","Operator","That concludes our call today. You may now disconnect.

Jackson","Thanks, Joshua. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us and welcome to our second quarter conference call. Before I begin, I'd like to thank our 54,000 team members for their hard work and diligence as they navigated us through a challenging quarter.","As you have seen in our earnings release this morning, our second fiscal quarter reflected a near-term slowdown within the industry and in our results. Today, I thought it'd be helpful to provide some context and perspective on the drivers of the slowdown.","As we anticipated, the second quarter faced weak consumer demand in both DIY and Commercial with significant slowdown in our cold weather markets principally located within the Northeast and Great Lakes regions of the U.S.","From a consumer perspective, gas prices continue to weigh on demand. The average gas price increased nearly $0.10 a gallon over the first quarter of this year. The good news is the current outlook is for gas to be lower the rest of the year.","Macro environment continues to be stressed with high unemployment and low consumer confidence, which has constrained consumer spending. This was evident across retail and reflective of our business as consumers were only willing to spend the absolute minimum amount on failure-related parts and were willing to defer maintenance purchases. This slowdown in both failure and maintenance spending impacted both DIY and Commercial and led to a deceleration in sales growth versus the first quarter. The principal driver on the deceleration was a sequential quarter-to-quarter decline in the average ticket, while our transaction growth was down modestly. In the non-cold-weather markets, we saw transaction growth from Q1 to Q2 accelerate in the low single digits. The overall company transaction growth in Commercial still remained positive in the low single digits from a comparable store perspective. The average ticket decline reflects a combination of mix of products sold and our pricing position in the second quarter.","The industry is experiencing the impact of lower inflation in some key seasonal categories like air conditioning and the absence of escalating oil prices and the impact on the oil change special programs. In addition, there are pockets where the consumer is trading down in select categories in pursuit of savings. Finally, while price promotions are not having an immediate positive impact on the top line, we believe it will positively contribute to our growth in the future.","From a geographical perspective, we saw different results throughout the regions of the company with the greatest deceleration in our cold weather markets, again especially in the Northeast and the Great Lakes regions. Our performance in those 2 markets is reflective of the milder weather conditions during the first quarter, which impacted hard parts and pulled the business forward in the second quarter.","Our comparable store sales declined mid-single digits in these regions of the country, including our Autoparts International stores within those geographies. Conversely, we saw acceleration from the first quarter through the second quarter in our stores located in the western half of the U.S. Our comparable store sales continue to grow positively, and we're up low single digits in our western geographies, where only 10% of our stores are located, as they continue to be less impacted by severe fluctuations in weather.","As a result of the declining ticket and lower DIY transaction counts, our comp store sales decreased 2.7%, which was at the low end of our outlook for the quarter. Additionally, our operating income decreased $19.7 million to $169.2 million in the quarter. This was in line with our outlook for the quarter. Despite achieving our previously shared range of outcomes, we are not satisfied with our performance during the quarter. Yet, we remain encouraged by the fundamentals of our industry and have specific action plans to improve our performance for the balance of the year. As such, we continue to focus on growing Commercial and competing for the right to serve our customers.","The last few years have been focused on gaining a level of fundamental or basic competitiveness by implementing the table stakes of the Commercial business, which simply meant investing in the industry's best parts pros, sales team, delivery trucks and parts availability. We continue to focus our efforts in those areas but realize the next level will require us to move from being fundamentally better to providing our customers with even greater levels of reliable service, increased delivery speed and superior availability.","As a result, we continue to move forward with the in-sourcing of our Commercial credit function, the opening of our new DC with daily replenishment capabilities, rolling out our B2B e-commerce platforms, electric part -- electronic parts catalog and diagnostic tools for our Commercial customers. These key initiatives will fuel our growth over the next several years and allow us to aggressively grow in Commercial. Our field and sales teams are more focused than ever at running the business with excellence. Kevin will provide you with an update on our progress in the opening of our DC and other operations update.","As we start our third quarter and look to the back half of the year, we continue to anticipate sluggish consumer demand and choppiness in our business performance. I want to stress we view this as a moment of unevenness versus a longer-term downward trend in the industry or our performance.","In the upcoming quarter, and possibly for the balance of the year, we anticipate we will continue to see lower transaction counts driven by DIY, partially offset by slight improvements in our average ticket. However, in the second half of the year, we will continue to roll out our new Commercial program and make investments and focus our efforts in the following areas: improving our availabilities through the addition of new and converted hub stores and inventory upgrades, these availability investments will translate into roughly $60 million of increased parts inventory; we are increasing our traffic-driving advertising to stem the decline in transactions and increase the number of customers that visit our stores; we continue to grow our Commercial sales force and anticipate growing our team by roughly 5%; and finally, we will continue to maximize our in-store labor to meet our customers' needs and provide superior customer service.","We expect, but cannot guarantee, that the hot summer and more normalized winter weather will provide a lift as we enter the back half of the year. However, we remain cautious with our outlook as our current trends suggest that our comp store sales will be constrained. This view of our business is reflected in the outlook Mike will share a little later. Internally, we are working with a sense of urgency and taking steps to drive a better outcome than our trends suggest. Our efforts and our focus remain on generating positive comps for the balance of the year.","In closing, I want to share a story of how team members Alex Moore [ph] and Chris Webb recently showed what living our values looks like. Alex, [ph] from our store in Christianburg, Virginia, stayed well after closing one night to help a family who was stranded while driving from Connecticut to Florida. Their alternator and radiator had failed, and their car battery was dead. Chris, an instructional designer on our training team at the support center, who was passing by at 10:30 at night on his way home, saw the car in the parking lot and stopped to offer his help. Alex [ph] and Chris stayed well after midnight, helping our customers get back on the road again in their time of need. I would like to recognize and thank Alex [ph] and Chris for their compassion and their focus on service for the decisions they made to help create an Advance customer for life.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin Freeland, our Chief Operating Officer. Kevin?","Kevin P. Freeland","Thanks, Darren, and good morning. I'd also like to thank the team for their hard work during the second quarter. I'll provide updates on the work that occurred during the quarter, as well as update you on our initiatives to support our superior availability strategy and new store growth.","As Darren mentioned, our soft performance during the quarter does not overshadow the long-term fundamentals of both our business and industry. Our focus on increasing breadth and depth of our end market product assortment and availability remains and will continue to aggressively move forward with the availability initiatives we laid out at the beginning of the year. Those initiatives include: the expansion of our hub network, the continuous upgrade of our parts inventory at our non-hub stores, the opening of our new DC, and the continued growth and rollout of our B2C and B2B e-commerce platforms, Commercial diagnostic tool and our electronics -- electronic product catalog.","Hubs and inventory upgrades continue to be a vital component to our availability strategy as it allows us to provide superior end market parts availability. Due to the aging fleet of vehicles, both maintenance and failure parts have increased in order of importance for our DIY and Commercial customers. We continue to expect the demand for these products to increase as the average age of vehicles increase despite the current slowdown in demand due to unseasonably warm weather.","As a result, we continue to increase the number of hubs through new store expansion and upgrade of existing stores which have the space and are strategically positioned to operate as a hub. At the end of our second quarter, our total hub count was 320 versus 288 in the second quarter of last year. Additionally, we upgraded the inventory in 231 non-hub stores during the quarter.","As I mentioned, increasing our parts availability is critical to our success and growth. However, we've been working to ensure to free up capital to fund other parts of our business. As such, we continue to expand our accounts payable-to-inventory ratio, which increased roughly 784 basis points from 75.1% at the end of second quarter last year to 82.9%. As a direct result, we've reduced our owned inventory by 31.3% or 163.4 million from 521.6 million to 358.2 million.","As previously stated, our new Remington, Indiana distribution center was slated to start receiving product in the second quarter, and I'm delighted that we successfully achieved that milestone. Work is now under way to schedule the first outbound shipments in mid-September. We will ship product to our stores in phases, ramping up to 400 stores next year.","We're also excited about our ability to provide improved availability by providing daily replenishments to over 200 stores next year. Essentially, adding this new capability will allow us to provide greater coverage to the cars in the market and the customers we serve.","We continue to focus on growing our business through our expanded penetration of our B2B capabilities to our Commercial customers as well as through successful new store openings. During the second quarter, we opened 10 stores, including 3 Autopart International stores. Year-to-date, we've opened 35 stores, including 6 Autopart International stores. As of July 14, 2012, our total store count was 3,692, including 203 Autopart International stores. We remain on pace to open approximately 120 to 140 stores this year.","Our gross profit rate increased 16 basis points to 49.9 versus 49.7 during the second quarter of 2011. The increase was primarily driven by improvements in shrink and supply chain expenses due to labor productivity and lower fuel costs, partially offset by increased promotional activity and a higher mix of Commercial sales. Year-to-date, our gross profit rate was 50.0, a 14-point-basis decline over the same period in fiscal 2011.","Again, I'd like to thank the team for their hard work during this challenging environment. We remain confident in the priorities we've laid out, and our teams are working diligently to ensure our focus does not get diluted and that we execute our initiatives and the fundamentals of our business flawlessly. Now let me turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Norona, to review our financial results in more detail.","Michael A. Norona","Thanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start by thanking all of our talented and dedicated team members for their commitment to serving our customers as we navigated through a challenging second quarter.","I plan to cover the following topics with you this morning: one, provide some financial highlights from our second quarter of 2012; two, put our second quarter and year-to-date results into context with our expectations and key financial dimensions we use to measure our performance; and three, provide some insights on the remainder of 2012.","During our first quarter earnings call, we shared that we were tempering our second quarter expectations given our slow start to the quarter. We ended up coming in at the lower end of the outlook range we shared for the quarter. We believe our softness is a function of the tough economic environment that is taking a toll on our customers, as evidenced in our maintenance categories, and the lingering impacts of this year's milder winter. This latter point is evidenced by the significant softness we experienced in our cold weather market such as the Northeast and Great Lakes areas. This softness drove weakness in both our DIY and Commercial businesses and our Autopart International stores. While we are disappointed with our second quarter performance, we also know our relative underperformance can be partially explained by the fact we have more stores in colder weather markets.","For our second quarter, our total sales decreased 1.3% to nearly $1.5 billion driven by a comp store sales decrease of 2.7%, partially offset by the net addition of 65 new stores over the past 12 months. Year-to-date, our total sales increased 1.2% to $3.4 billion, and our comp store sales are flat.","As Kevin mentioned, our second quarter gross profit rate increased 16 basis points to 49.9% versus 49.7% in the second quarter of 2011. The increase was primarily driven by improvements in shrink and supply chain expenses due to the labor productivity and lower fuel costs, partially offset by promotional activity and a higher mix of Commercial sales. Our Commercial mix represented 38% of our 2012 sales versus 37.2% in 2011. Year-to-date, our gross profit rate decreased 14 basis points to 50% versus 50.2% over the same period last year.","Our SG&A rate of 38.3% increased 135 basis points versus the second quarter of 2011 primarily due to expense deleverage as a result of our 2.7% comp store sales decline and a planned shift of expenses from first to second quarter, partially offset by lower year-over-year incentive compensation expenses. Year-to-date, our SG&A rate decreased 56 basis points to 38.5% versus 39.1% over the same period last year.","All in, our second quarter operating income dollars decreased 10.4%, and our operating income rate decreased 119 basis points to 11.6% primarily driven by the planned SG&A shift from first to second quarter and the SG&A deleverage from the lower comp sales. While our diluted earnings per share decreased 8.2% to $1.34 versus $1.46 last year, roughly $0.08 was due to the SG&A shift. The planned shift in expenses, which was previously communicated during our first quarter conference call, was driven by our annual general managers' meeting and some strategic investments. Through the first half of 2012, our operating income dollars increased 5% to $393.8 million, and our diluted EPS increased 12.5% to $3.14.","Year-to-date, free cash flow was $265.4 million, down 7.6% over the same period last year. The decrease was driven by increased accounts payable as a result of the in-sourcing of our commercial credit program and lower deferred income taxes due to the lapse of certain corporate tax legislation, offset partially by continued reductions in our owned inventory.","As Kevin mentioned, our owned inventory decreased 31.3% from second quarter 2011 driven by our continued efforts to increase our accounts payable-to-inventory ratio, which now stands at 82.9% versus 75.1% in the second quarter of 2011. We are maintaining our previously communicated annual free cash flow outlook to still be a minimum $400 million, which includes our previously communicated increase in accounts receivable of $80 million to $100 million, with a full year from in-sourcing our commercial credit program. We are excited about this new capability as it will allow us to provide a higher level of customer service to our existing Commercial customers, help fuel our Commercial growth as we increase our credit penetration with customers and allow us to build deeper relationships with our customers at lower costs.","At the end of the second quarter, we had $448.6 million of cash and $600 million of long-term debt on our balance sheet. Our adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2.1x, which is well below our previously stated ceiling of 2.5x. Our average diluted share count was 74 million shares at the end of the second quarter.","While we're not meeting our expectations as we go through this soft period, we remain confident with the solid industry fundamentals, the commercial market opportunity and our team's ability to improve our performance.","We continue to measure our performance through the financial dimensions of growth, profit and value creation. As we have consistently communicated, we prioritize growth as our primary use of capital to increase shareholder value, which includes growing our business through our strategic investments, our operational performance and looking for future growth opportunities or strategic capabilities that capitalize on the market growth opportunity.","While we see growth as our primary focus to increase shareholder value, we will continue to use share buybacks opportunistically. At the end of our second quarter, we have roughly $500 million left on our share repurchases authorization. While there will be moments in time where investors will attempt to read into our share repurchase activity, we want to remind investors that we take a long-term, disciplined approach to share repurchases, and we measure our success over years and not over quarters. We continue to maintain the same disciplined approach with respect to share repurchases, which is focused on creating long-term value, not short-term earnings. While this can have a tendency to frustrate short-term shareholders, this philosophy has allowed us to purchase over 41% of the company at an average price of roughly $43 since 2004.","Turning to profit. We continue to improve our profitability, which is reflected in our operating income per store and our trailing 4-quarter operating income rate of 11%, which is up 100 basis points from 10% during the second quarter last year. We have been able to invest in both Commercial and availability while preserving our in-store service levels by maintaining the same levels of labor hours in our stores. We've been able to fund these investments by managing our cost structure through our continued focus to build a more efficient, competitive and profitable operating model.","As we look at value creation, we continue to maintain our disciplined approach to capital, which is reflected in our return on invested capital of 19.9%, which increased 140 basis points over the second quarter of last year. Our ROIC has increased over 600 basis points over the past 4 years. We're also pleased with our 82.9% AP ratio, which continues to lower our owned inventory, and we believe we can get our AP ratio to 100% over time.","Turning to the balance of the year. While we are not satisfied with our second quarter performance, we believe that the long-term industry dynamics and -- are solid, and our commitment is unwavering to continue our strategic investments at the same pace as we originally planned, which are focused on Commercial, availability, supply chain and e-commerce. These are foundational to our future growth, and thus, we will not slow or change the timing of them.","That said, our business trends continue to be soft with a challenging consumer environment. This, coupled with industry growth decelerating and more challenging second half of 2012 comp sales compares, particularly in the fourth quarter, which historically has been our most volatile quarter, require us to take a more prudent approach to our annual outlook. As a result, we now expect our annual comp store sales to be flat to slightly down for 2012. We continue to expect our gross profit rate will improve modestly for the full year, as previously shared in our outlook.","We will make the appropriate adjustments in our variable expenses with the changed comp outlook, and we'll maintain our disciplined focus on managing our discretionary and administrative support costs. As a result, we now expect our SG&A per store will be down 1% to 2% for 2012. With these changes, we now anticipate our fiscal 2012 EPS to be in the range of $5.25 to $5.35 per share.","In closing, I would like to thank our talented team members again for their resolve and focus to serve our customers during our challenging second quarter. We have confidence in our team as they have shown many times that when faced with adversity, they always respond with character, resiliency and competitive spirit. We expect to rise to the challenge to improve our performance. Operator, we are now ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Gary Balter with Credit Suisse.","Gary Balter - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","My question relates to, obviously, the results. When you analyze what's going on, obviously your numbers -- everybody slowed down in the sector, and Darren, you talked about that. But if you look at the disadvantage that you have because of the fact that your delivery -- I mean, you mentioned you're going to have the hub working soon or you're going to have the delivery center working soon, but what's the disadvantage caused by that? Have you adjusted labor hours at the store that's maybe hurt you? Do you -- why do you feel you lost momentum in Commercial? This has -- it looks like it was negative. But how do you address those? And what are you doing to deal with those on a near-term and long-term basis?","Darren R. Jackson","Yes, Gary. Absolutely the right questions. Maybe a little bit of context. When we look at our overall Commercial business in the second quarter -- as we said, when we look through it and ask the question, \"Are we still driving the business as measured by transactions?,\" our transactions across the company were up low single digits. As a matter of fact, many if not all, of our non-weather-affected markets, they were up better than mid-single digits. And so when I look at the help [ph] of being out there, are we delivering the parts, are the teams making the sales calls, are we improving in terms of our relationships with customers, I think transactions are a better proxy. What we see then is that we saw a lot of pressure on ticket, and we are seeing a little bit of trade down in the categories. And in my comments -- and you can look across the industry. We have some great customers up in the Northeast. One of them is a public company. We saw those same challenges in the weather-affected parts of the business, principally in our maintenance categories and that include categories like brakes. When we get down to the next fundamental question, you said we're expanding our hub network, we're doing daily replenishment, maybe a way to think -- maybe a way to answer that question is that we have 315 hub stores today. Those are big Commercial programs for us, many of those well over $2 million in terms of their productivity. And what we're finding is that as we go across the country, we use those hubs to supplement some of the local stores in terms of their availability. If we could flip a magic wand and convert all of our DCs to daily replenishment, we would. But in lieu of that, what we've been doing over the course of several years is just slowly marching up our hard parts SKU count at the local store level and at the hubs. So we still see an opportunity in the existing network, and we still have some of the largest stores in the industry, I mean, not by thousands of square feet but certainly hundreds, to continue to add hard parts at the local level. We know when have the hard part at the local store, our close rates are darn near 100%. And so when we said we're going to invest $60 million in the back half at the hubs and local stores, we're essentially doing the same. We're going to add thousands of hard part SKUs to those local stores across the network. Hubs aren't ideal, but by themselves, they're a great return. Our first replenishment facility comes online later this fall. We've inked our second replenishment facility. And over the course of several years now, what we've done is through a balance of custom mix technology by store and actually getting rid of what we'd say some of the slow-moving product, we feel like we're in a, certainly an improving position each year. But I'll be -- is it ideal? Not ideal in terms -- ideal is closer to a daily replenishment model, but we certainly have tools. And we certainly are focused by not worrying what we can't control but what we can in terms of adding to that availability. As to labor hours, in the first half of the year, our labor hours were up just modestly on a per-store basis. So it's not a case that we pulled back. We made a little bit of a bet in the second quarter, a little bit on pricing and a little bit in terms of traffic driving. And my takeaway is, is that when we start to snap back in some of those cold weather markets, they should start behaving more like some of our non-weather-affected markets, which really gives us -- and I don't know if the word is hope, but confidence that the business will come back overall. I think what you heard on our call is that we see the back half. Our teams are absolutely focused in our internal targets and plans to drive positive comp store sales. That is absolutely the expectation here. And we're also realistic that we see trends in terms of that hot weather that we just experienced is -- generally positions us well. And the benefits of that come when it gets cold, principally in places like batteries, first and foremost. So we're trying to both send a message that we're being balanced in terms of what we see immediately in the consumers. But more importantly, in the short term, give us a little cold weather in those cold weather markets, I'm certain we'll see some of those businesses absolutely snap back. And it doesn't change the fundamental pieces of our industry of 240 million cars on the road. They're out there. And the consumer, from our point of view, are making choices today where they're just stretching it out a little bit longer principally in the maintenance categories in order to manage their checkbook a little bit better.","Gary Balter - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And just for my follow-up and I won't ask -- Mike kind of scared us off from asking the buyback questions, so I'll stick to something else. I'll do it with somebody else on that one. Do you think that -- all 3 of you kind of said the weather has had an impact. A few years ago, business wasn't that strong because -- and then, all of a sudden, all this deferred maintenance started getting spent on and comps picked up a lot for everybody. I think we're just past that stage where the deferred maintenance kind of caught up and this is more normal. Or do you think the weather really is the difference right now?","Darren R. Jackson","Yes, you're right, Gary. Back in 2008, I remember having one of these conference calls. And with ourselves and the industry, we're all kind of shaking our head and it was essentially flat comps for the industry but down a couple of places. And then 180 days later, we were all high-fiving   because the comps were closer to 10. I think if you look at some of the AAI data and other data, it's said the deferred maintenance still out there at any one point in time is not less than $60 billion. So it's still a big number that sits out there in those vehicles for us. So I think it's certainly out there. I think the way the consumer is managing their dollars right now is that, we've talked about this time and time again, that gas price from our vantage point, I think, is every $0.01 move is $1 billion of discretionary income. As that comes down, and we can see it in some of our markets where there's a little more gas price relief, those tend to be markets that are doing a little bit better. And as you said, and I'll reinforce that, we have markets where, quite frankly, they -- the difference, and these aren't small markets from the Northeast the parts of the South, are literally 15 points difference in terms of how they're performing. And so I don't think the economies are that different between the 2 markets for sure. But I certainly pin back to win those markets, and competitively, they're comparable too. So I do think we have a little bit of a stretch-out period going on in some markets. In other markets that were less impacted, they're behaving the way we expected them to behave.","Operator","Our next question comes from Greg Melich with ISI Group.","Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I had 2 questions. First, on the sales trend. I mean, Darren, clearly the focus is getting those comps back to positive, and you listed how things are doing. But also, the guidance infers that it's negative in the back half. Could you just give us some insight as to how it's been since the end of the quarter? I assume it's still negative but maybe better than they actually were in the second quarter. And you mentioned in your release, the second part of that, that the last period of the quarter was better. Can you just describe what that period was?","Darren R. Jackson","Yes. So as we -- a couple of things, Greg, to your direct question. Since the beginning of the quarter, it's been a little choppy. And so what I can see, and we've talked about this in the remarks, I mean, this is through our final period, which is -- let's talk about mid-July. Our comps absolutely turned positive in the final period. And it was low single digit, low, low single digit, but they turned positive, which was a turnaround from what we experienced early in the quarter. And if you said what was driving it, it certainly -- we all saw the heat come back into the market. That helped drive some of the seasonal categories. And we have that lift. I mean, the thing that tends to benefit from that, as you know, is -- you take air conditioning. That was a principal driver. It didn't help as much this year because, as we saw, that was one of the categories from an inflation point of view that was literally down 50% this year. In some cases, we could have been up 38% in units but still down 12% in comps because the inflation effect went against us this year and we saw a little bit of that in the ticket. But all that being said, I think the read you should take away from that when we bounced back to, I'd say, more seasonal trends. And in many of our markets, it went beyond seasonal trend. It was just plain warmer than it ever has been. The business reacted appropriately. When we look to the back half of the year, and what we can see is that our confidence -- we're no good at predicting the weather, I'll just tell you that. But what we are good at predicting is that if we have more normalized weather patterns, the heat that we just experienced will certainly manifest itself in some of our stronger categories of business that sits in the starters, alternators and battery categories. That -- I think the difference between a strong positive in the second half and a more challenging business trend like we're experiencing in the first half is literally, if we find our way back to the more normalized patterns.","Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then a second question in terms of capital allocation. You guys are running with more cash than ever before, and I think I heard your comments mention a second daily replenishment facility. I'm wondering, are you considering another new DC like Remington? Or is there some other spending there? I mean, we've seen some acquisitions like Quaker City that came up. How do you think about allocating that cash? Or is that the new level you need to run at given the commercial credit program?","Darren R. Jackson","Yes. Yes. So 3 things. Greg, you're right. We're at an all-time high level of cash. I did say that as we look out, we've penciled a new agreement for a second daily replenishment center. I'd like to actually not get into the details of where it is for competitive reasons, but everything that we see certainly says that to take -- to further build on the momentum we built in the last 4 years, we're taking the next steps competitively in the Commercial segment. And we believe that's where the future is. Mike did talk about commercial credit. For years, I mean, it was just lower on the priority list. We had that outsourced to a third-party bank. It was principally a retail bank. What we know is that we're going to spend $100 million, which is comparable to our competitors, to bring it into the business. We feel that by bringing that in, we're going to actually be able to provide a better level of customer service. More importantly, only about half of our business is done on commercial credit today, which is a fraction of where the industry is or even AI. So we think it's not only a great customer service tool, but it also is a sales generation tool for many of our customers that, quite frankly, could benefit from that credit, particularly in difficult times. So that's 2. As we look to next year, our store count -- and we have purposely -- and I think this is, I've said this before, is challenging some of our comps relative to others in the competitive set. We have slowed store growth to about 100 stores a year. We'll be 125 this year. Next year, that number will be closer to 200. And the bright spot of our performance this year has really been this class of new stores. So we've been spending time re-architecting the store model to be a more commercially driven store model, a much lower cost model for us in terms of the cost to build it and where we place it. As we go into next year, we see a great opportunity to begin to up the store count in terms of many of the markets that we see, in part because of the commercial potential. And 4 years later, we feel like we have a commercially oriented new store program that is worth investing more dollars into for sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Lasser with UBS.","Michael Lasser - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","On the distribution center, is there any way you could quantify the potential benefit that you might see on the sales side as that facility comes online?","Kevin P. Freeland","Yes, this is -- Michael, this is Kevin. The -- essentially the center will totally service over 400 stores, and approximately half of those will be within a range close enough to the facility to receive daily replenishment. We do -- or actually have quite a bit of work on what the lift will be. And it's a good change as it improves the availability of those stores. Quite frankly, in a fleet of 3,700 stores, changing 200 to a better availability will have a somewhat of a modest impact on the overall company. Yet, as that program rolls out, then it would be a more pronounced impact on the company as a whole.","Michael Lasser - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","All right, that's helpful. And my second question is what is the appetite to potentially take your leverage ratio beyond the 2.5x guardrail if you saw opportunities either on the acquisition front or the ability to accelerate the pace of new distribution center openings to really improve the positioning of the business over the long term?","Michael A. Norona","Yes, Mike. We have, at this particular point in time, no appetite to take our adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio above 2.5x. And we believe actually we can grow our business and do the things that Darren talked about and Kevin talked about and operate our business and grow our business and make the investments in our strategic initiatives and keep within that. So -- but at this particular time, we have no plans to do that.","Darren R. Jackson","Yes. And Mike, you would say that -- Mike, you asked the question about our daily replenishment centers. Maybe to put that a little bit more into context, in order to make those things happen, you have to replace warehouse management systems, and that's complete. We've got to open the first one and honestly work the bugs out. These are complex centers. We're excited about what we see right now in terms of how that center's operating, in terms of the phase that we're in. And I would say this, is that we have absolutely capital and cash. If that proves to be what we believe it will prove to be, we are not constrained both in terms of dollars and leverage ratio to go a lot faster on that. What we are doing, and we think it's responsible, is that we certainly want to work the bugs out on it because if you speed in this area, and the supply chain pays the price. 3,600 stores pay the price. And so you shouldn't read anything into our comments that we will be timid in terms of our ability to invest in the business provided, and I'm confident the teams will figure this out, we get the results.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dan Wewer with Raymond James.","Daniel R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","So Mike, I think maybe just to become a little bit more direct on the buyback issue. I understand your response on looking for reinvestment opportunities. I understand that you use a conservative DCF model to determine when to buy back shares. But we're also looking at the company running with $400 million more cash than a year ago; stocks off about, what, 27% from its peak; free cash flow yields up to about 10% now. But I guess the bottom line is what are we waiting for?","Michael A. Norona","Yes, so Dan, the good news is you listen to our pre-remarks, and you understand our philosophy hasn't changed in that our first priority with capital -- and Darren said it is to invest and grow in the business. And quite frankly, that's where we prioritize and, quite frankly, we're not growing at our level of expectation at this particular point in time. So the balance of the year, we're focused on reversing the trends. We're going to continue to invest in the business and generate positive comps. And buybacks don't create sales. So the -- I think the most important thing is we believe that investing in the business and growing our business is what creates long-term value, and buybacks also show our confidence in doing that. And we've done them over the last few years. Since 2004, we bought back about 41% of the company at an average price of $43. So we think that has created good value. However, it doesn't create sales. And I think the most important thing is, is that we get the question a lot. And we're focused on creating long-term value, not short-term earnings. And we also take it very seriously about what we're going to do with the cash. So I think, to Greg's question and to some of the questions earlier, what you're going to do with the cash, we typically don't talk about that. We don't talk about buybacks before we do them. We don't talk about the other things before we do them. But just know that this management team takes very seriously what we do with the cash. And whatever we do, do with that cash, we'll make sure that we get a good return and we drive long-term value.","Daniel R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then a just question about CARQUEST, Darren, speculation that its ownership may change hands. Can you remind us the difference in CARQUEST's position in the commercial market relative to Advance and AI? And also, if there are certain potential buyers that would create more of an issue, more of a headwind for Advance than other potential buyers?","Michael A. Norona","Yes. Dan, I'm going to just start first. First of all, we don't comment on specific opportunities that may exist out in the marketplace. And Darren -- if Darren, if you want to give a few insights to his question around comparisons.","Darren R. Jackson","Yes. Dan, both your questions are understandable, and I understand why you're asking them. And I would say this, is that -- the following. We -- the market right now, as you know, there was another public company that was out there for sale that was sold and then put back. And so there are things shifting in the marketplace right now. Part of that is that who knows? I couldn't speculate at this point whether CARQUEST gets sold or not or it doesn't get sold. I can't speculate who buys them or who doesn't buy them. The most recent evidence we do have is one of the companies in our industry got sold and then it was unsold. And so I think we'll have to watch how that plays out versus at this point us speculating as to what the outcome will be. No doubt that, as you know, and you've watched this industry longer than most. I mean, it is a B2B WD model. And you know what? That may be attractive to some and it may not be attractive to some. So instead of trying to lead you down a path of speculation, I think we'll all sit back and see how that unfolds over time.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matt Fassler with Goldman Sachs.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I have one follow-up on capital allocation and then another on traffic. First of all, on capital, you spoke about reinvesting in the business. If you think about the level of CapEx for this year but also the prospective level CapEx going forward given expansion and any other reinvestment that you're contemplating, could we think about a hike in aggregate capital expenditures from your prior run rate or prior thought process?","Michael A. Norona","Yes on that. I think what we said in our outlook is that we're going to be spending this year $275 million to $300 million, and we still believe we're going to be in that range. The big areas that we're investing in capital this year, obviously, first and foremost in terms of growth, is our NSOs [ph]. That's one big pocket. And the maintenance that goes into maintaining those. The second pocket is supply chain. Kevin's been really clear around it. And we're very excited about the Remington facility and the daily replenishment test that we're going to be doing. I think it's going to be a fantastic opportunity. And the first one is always more expensive, so that's a big part of our capital. And then the third area, obviously, is IT, IT and our systems. Kevin's talked about some of the -- our electronic parts catalog, and that's going to be a fantastic tool for our teams in our stores to enable them to serve our customers faster. So those are the 3 big pockets. Darren did talk about, well, as we look out, we haven't given an outlook for the out years. But just to be clear, we're going to continue to invest in Commercial, we're going to continue to invest in availability, we're going to continue to invest in supply chain and we're going to continue to invest in those parts that will grow our business. So -- but I can't comment at this particular point in time as to whether we're going to increase that. But we're comfortable with the capital at this particular juncture.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And...","Kevin P. Freeland","[indiscernible]","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Sorry.","Darren R. Jackson","Matt, I was going to say if you look back 2 years ago, we -- it was roughly a $200 million run rate. We've taken it up last year. It was $300 million again this year, principally supply chain driven. I mean, next year, you can infer from our comments taking our store count from 125 to closer to 200. That will drive it up. The other thing that we've been spending capital on, quite frankly, is our acquisition of and MotorLogic [ph] and DriverSide. And the other piece of capital, though it runs through working capital, is commercial credit. And so again, we're trying to stay on strategy and, unfortunately, strategy and financial results and 90-day windows are 180-day window as we're trying to take that next step in terms of capabilities, daily replenishment, commercial credit, diagnostic tools. In the fall of this year, we'll begin the process of our new electronic parts catalog being rolled out for our stores in order to enable the commercial sales as well as retail hard parts sales to be able -- to be affected in a more customer friendly but more team member friendly way. And those all sit in the capital buckets. Usually, about the back half of this year, we get even more precise as to what the dollars are. So I agree with Mike, we're not going to give you a forecast now. But we're in that in-between period where many of the larger investments that are positioned to grow, I would say, our position in Commercial with a larger base and larger customers, we're in that transition to the capabilities. I think we just started in July with internal credit on our own books. We start in October this year shipping daily replenishment. We wish it would go faster, and the teams are working their tails off to make it go faster. As that comes through, it informs just how fast we can go, and then they'll get translated into dollars and projects with the team going forward.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And just as a follow-up, I assure that I ask you this question in the spirit of your intro with a long-term focus in mind. The last big buyback push from the company was late 2010 or early 2011. And you bought back a lot of stock in the low to mid-60s, and you've been smarter than most about thinking about intrinsic value and picking the right spots. Is there any reason to think that your view of the intrinsic value of the business has changed over the last 12 to 18 months as we think about at what levels this might be too good of an investment for you to pass up?","Darren R. Jackson","No. No, Matt. Not at all.","Operator","Our next question comes from Peter Keith with Piper Jaffray.","Jonathan N. Berg - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","This is actually Jon on for Peter. You guys have done a great job stabilizing shrink now this quarter and had just turned it into a benefit. Based on what you lost in shrink in the last 3 quarters of last year, do you think you're going to be able to recapture that in the second half of this year?","Michael A. Norona","Yes, it's Mike. Yes, I want to really compliment our teams on what we've done with our shrink trends. And the answer to that is yes. Our trajectory that we were on last year was going in the wrong direction. We've reversed that, and we're going to get back. And by the end of this year, we'll be almost to those levels that we were at prior to our decline.","Jonathan N. Berg - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay, great. And as my follow-up, as we think about your Remington distribution center and the margin impacts for both the remainder of fiscal '12 and then going into fiscal '13, should we be assuming a drag to margin now for the -- continue to assume a drag to margin in the second half and then margin expansion in 2013?","Kevin P. Freeland","Yes, this is Kevin. We've had leverage essentially coming from the supply chain this year, and it's through predominantly efficiencies that we've been driving through the centers and some smart decisions that we made on forward purchases of fuel. As we turn the distribution center on, obviously the investments that we've made begin to depreciate. But we'll begin to operate the facility. But the actual operating cost to the facility are lower than any of our other centers. So it's actually a significant change in the way that we're operating the level of automation that we've put into the center. So essentially, we get a headwind and a tailwind at the same time. I think when it's all said and done, we'll see a relatively muted impact of that from a margin perspective. And predominantly, what we'll see is an impact on sales.","Operator","And our final question comes from Bret Jordan with BB&T Capital Markets.","Bret David Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Just a quick question. In the prepared remarks, you talked about your pricing position in the second quarter. And I guess my question is really sort of what the promotional environment is looking like right now and whether the comment was a positive or negative pricing position relative to peers.","Kevin P. Freeland","Yes, this is Kevin. We essentially keep our ear to the ground on DIY and Commercial prices every day of the week. And we try to manage in a very tight range of plus or minus 1% of the prevailing prices in the market, and we -- we're benchmarking all of our key competitors. I would -- as we got into the second quarter, in that plus or minus 1% range, to be honest, we've managed the low end of that range purposely. As we were hitting tough sales, we wanted to make sure that it was not being driven by being improperly priced in the market. And it would be our intention to stay in that position until such point as the sales turn around. So I think what you're seeing in our numbers is in fact what you would likely see in the quarters ahead.","Bret David Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Okay. And one follow-up. On the Commercial pricing, as a couple of these large players become a bigger piece of your Commercial business, is there price deflation? As they wield that clout, are you seeing some compression in Commercial pricing through those contracts?","Darren R. Jackson","Yes, Bret, a -- to build on Kevin's point but specifically to answer that one, as you build more national accounts, of course those come with -- they come with both lower margin rates, but the truth is they come with greater consistency and growth in the margin dollars for sure. So as we grow that, there will be, and there has been for 4 straight years, just more pressure in our business inherently because Commercial gross margins are lower. So I think to your -- just to put an exclamation point or a period on your other question, when we look at our performance in Q1 to Q2 in terms of the deceleration in our business, what we really saw is that if you broke it down into 2 things, really 3 quarters of the deceleration in our comps came from ticket. And in that ticket, you can see both the combination of -- and you would expect this from us, that we saw lower transactions. We certainly went out and, I would say, used more promotional vehicles in terms of radio and in terms of direct mail in order to drive traffic in our stores. That's what you do in these times. And what we also saw is a consumer trading down in certain categories of the business. I think that reflects some of the economics. And so as we look out, we continue our -- to kind of just manage and assess that balance between driving the promotional activities, traffic into our stores, traffic to the Commercial accounts and that balance with ticket in the back half of the year. And you know what? That's how you go back and just fight to get the business back.","Bret David Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","As you look at -- and to this -- not really a third question, I guess responding to that. As you look at your online pricing, which is pretty aggressive, is that compounding the ticket compression because people are buying online, they're picking up in-store and they're getting what is running sort of like a 20% discount from the online ticket?","Kevin P. Freeland","Yes, this is Kevin. We do have a more promotional stance online. It's more similar to what we do through our direct mail program. So those 2 are relatively aligned. And the honest answer is the -- while that business has grown very large percentages over the past several years, it is a very small part of our business today and not large enough to materially move the company's gross margin.","Operator","Thank you.

I'm joined this morning by Tom Greco, our CEO and Mike Norona, our Chief Financial Officer. Tom and Mike will open the call with prepared remarks regarding the quarter and will be available to answer questions.

And welcome to our second quarter conference call. I joined Advanced Auto Parts four months ago and I am even more energized today than I was when I started. We are conducting a deep dive into our business to fully understand the challenges we faced over the past few years. ","I am finding many areas for significant improvements based on actions and strategies that are well within our control. I have no doubt we will address these challenges. In fact we\u2019re developing a long-term strategy to put this behind us, to accelerate growth, and to drive profitability. We need to always put the customer first. This is essential to drive growth. We must earn and retain the trust of our customers which can only be achieved through outstanding service every single day, every single time. ","As you saw from our release our comp performance in the quarter was a disappointing negative 4.1%. These results are certainly not acceptable given our potential. They are in line with the near-term expectations we provided last quarter. This is in part because we have been spending our time working on the real changes required to put us in the leadership position we expect. We\u2019ll execute better with more accountability in the near-term. ","In parallel we\u2019re working on material and significant change for the long-term, specifically identifying issues and opportunities while creating a sound winning strategy for Advance which we can execute flawlessly. We know we have work to do. I remain extremely confident in our ability to address the current challenges we face which largely have been self inflicted. ","In terms of profitability our adjusted operating margin rate of 10.8% and adjusted EPS of $1.90 reflect the impact of lower than expected gross margin performance in the quarter, higher supply chain expenses, and operating deleverage. There were a couple of drivers of sales and profit performance in the quarter. First of all, our customer service metrics were just not where we need them to be. ","In Q2 we conducted significant primary research with both our commercial customers and DIY consumers. We now know in excruciating detail what's important to them. We know where opportunities exist to better serve customers for Advance as well as for our competitors. Of course consistent product availability is at the very top of the list. It is table stakes in our business. Our performance against the availability metrics that matter to customers were just not where we need them to be and that cost us in Q2. ","As in Q1 we experienced availability challenges in several key markets. There are clear areas for improvement here and we\u2019re addressing them today and we know that they are fixable. At the same time while inventory was down slightly on a sequential basis over Q1, inventory still grew 7.3% over last year. As indicated on our Q1 call, inventory growing faster than sales without the requisite improvement in availability is inconsistent with our objectives. We have dedicated a team against this challenge and they are focused on ensuring the improved inventory productivity and consistency of product availability, while improving working capital and ROIC going forward. ","Secondly, another factor in our P&L flow through in Q2 was a sizable insurance adjustment. Mike will explain this in a few minutes. Finally, our performance in the quarter was disproportionately impacted by results in the North East in Great Lakes region. In retrospect we just didn\u2019t adequately plan for a transition to daily replenishment in these markets. We moved too far too fast significantly burdening our DCs with unnecessary complexity over the past few months. And we didn\u2019t sufficiently prepare our DC and field leaders for the substantial changes we\u2019re asking them to execute. Not only did this materially increase our supply chain cost in the quarter this initiative negatively impacted our fill accuracy in the North East. ","As a result the stores that were being serviced by these DCs were actually experiencing much worst availability as a result of the move to daily replenishment. Obviously increasing cost and complexity with inconsistent availability is just not acceptable. Since my arrival in April, we have been intensely analyzing our supply chain and distribution processes. And we\u2019re currently working on near and long term changes to improve order and fill accuracy and ultimately availability to best in class levels. ","What's most important to customers is the reliability and consistency of our service. They have to be able to trust us to have the right part at the right time. Therefore our primary objective is to provide best in class service to our customers by delivering high quality, great value parts accurately, reliably, and consistently exactly when our customers need them. That is the goal. DC to store delivery frequency is not our goal. ","We have been carefully analyzing our asset base and processes and we are confident we can leverage our assets in a manner that enables us to efficiently deliver best in class customer service while lowering cost and the inventory. The great news is we are already seeing a positive impact on our performance from the initial steps we have taken. And we absolutely expect to see improvement in customer service metrics and inventory reduction in the second half of the year in these markets. I have no doubt we can do a much better job leveraging our assets in order to provide the best service for our customers while producing the best returns for our shareholders. ","To sum up Q2, we are not where we need to be. I know that and my team knows that. There is a heightened sense of urgency and accountability at Advance and we will drive it throughout the organization. Given where we are we do not expect to turn our performance around overnight. We simply can't. We will execute better but we need to make sure we focus on the material and significant step change opportunity in front of us and make certain we execute these changes flawlessly versus trying to fix aspects of our existing strategy that are flawed in the current state. ","Our goal at the present time is to build a rock solid foundation for future growth and we won\u2019t compromise on this goal to prop up short-term results. Therefore our annual comp store sales estimate remains unchanged in a range of down 3 to 5 for the year. Accelerating growth and transforming our business is an exciting opportunity. Changes necessary to win are well within our control and there are no structural impediments to our success. While we now know many of the areas where we can improve, we cannot rush. We need to be thoughtful and disciplined as we transform and create a growing platform for the future. ","That said, today we are taking decisive actions to deliver near-term improvements in two key areas, commercial growth and execution. Allow me to talk first about how we are going to accelerate commercial growth. Our commercial business accounts for approximately 60% of our business and will be an area of growth for years to come. Getting our structure and people right in commercial is foundational to improved performance and position us for longer-term growth and market leadership. ","As you saw in today's release we named Bob Cushing, formerly President of WORLDPAC to serve in the newly created position of Executive Vice President, Commercial. Bob is going to oversee all of the company\u2019s commercial operations including Advance, Carquest, Autopart International, and of course WORLDPAC. As I look at the organizational structure of Advance today it\u2019s clear we need a unified leader for the entirety of our commercial business. ","As we consider the leadership skills necessary to accelerate growth, we have to start with the customer therefore we need a leader who puts the customer first always. We need a leader who deeply understands customer service and customer intimacy and finally, we need a leader with a track record for driving growth, improving profitability, and building industry leading capabilities. Fortunately Bob Cushing is the perfect person for the role as he is uniquely qualified to spearhead this effort. ","Bob is an exceptionally talented industry veteran with over 30 years of experience, has been the driving force behind WORLDPAC's tremendous growth and market leading position. He has a proven track record of delivering results and he is an industry pioneer who long ago recognized the role of technology and e-commerce in better serving customers. Last but not least Bob is competitive. He is going to be relentless on driving out numbers and he will expect nothing less than the best as he instills a high performing culture and ensures we execute and we win in the marketplace. This is a significant first step in the transformative process to leverage all of our assets, to create the leading commercial organization in North America which provides the absolute best service to customers. ","Secondly, I will comment on the importance of improving execution. Two weeks ago we flattened our organizational structure when we announced our three division field leaders as well as others who will now report directly to me. These changes will facilitate faster, more efficient decision making and I am confident this change will elevate operating intensity, drive greater accountability, and improve execution across the organization. ","To summarize these actions we\u2019re moving thoughtfully and swiftly to improve the trajectory of our business. In addition to driving near-term performance these changes are important steps in strengthening our foundation for the future. To that end we\u2019re hard at work in constructing a comprehensive five year strategic business plan with a goal of delivering industry leading performance. As we outlined for you last quarter, the focus of the plan is around three value drivers; growth, productivity, and people. ","We\u2019re excited with our progress and our potential. With respect to growth as I indicated earlier, we\u2019ve conducted a deep dive into the drivers of demand for our business and we\u2019ve collected volumes of customer insights that the organization has never had before. We\u2019re laser focused on customer needs as well as future trends to help guide us on how we position the business for tomorrow. The drivers of demand are key inputs for our growth agenda and will inform us on our holistic supply chain and availability strategy. ","In terms of supply chain we\u2019re doing considerable work on improving the consistency of part availability, dedicating disproportionate resources towards addressing this massive opportunity for Advance. The goal is clear, get the right part to the right customer at the right time; accurately, reliably, and consistently. We\u2019ll be making changes in how we distribute, assort, and deliver parts to our customers and we\u2019ll do it faster, more accurately, and more consistently than we do it today. ","We\u2019re testing multiple solutions to address these opportunities and we have several pilot programs across the country to assess alternative strategies to improve product assortment, reduce delivery time, and to reduce inventory. While it is early, our results from the pilots are extremely encouraging and will drive growth going forward. That leads us to our second area of focus, productivity. ","We\u2019re being a clearly defined productivity pipeline aimed at improving margins and profitability for building new capabilities to fuel our future growth agenda. This includes establishing productivity targets for our DCs, network, fleet, procurement, and stores. We\u2019re looking across our entire supply chain and we\u2019re challenging each discrete cost. We\u2019ve identified multiple projects which will yield savings in 2017 and beyond. ","In the second quarter we also launched zero based budgeting. I know many of you are familiar with zero based budgeting and the proven track record this approach has had in other companies and other industries. We plan to move as fast as possible on ZBD [ph] for remaining mind fold that we cannot affect service to our customer. In fact the plan is to drive out unnecessary costs, such that we can invest in better service for our customers. I believe the productivity opportunity in Advance is significant, and will fuel our growth for years to come. ","Finally, people and culture are a major component of our strategic business plan. We\u2019re in the process of developing a comprehensive people strategy to support our business strategy. In Q2 we established HR as a separate function. It was previously combined with our legal team. We subsequently hired a talented and experienced Senior Vice President of HR, Natalie Rothman. Natalie joins us from PepsiCo following a highly successful career there. Natalie and the team are also hard at work developing our people strategy. ","Specifically we\u2019re making sure that we have the right talent to succeed, the right culture to attract and retain a diverse and high performing team, and the right capabilities to compete at the highest level that differentiate us and to win with our customers. You will hear more about growth, productivity, and people when we provide an overview of our strategic business plan later this fall. With that allow me to turn it over to Mike. ","Mike Norona","Thanks Tom, and good morning everyone. Total sales for the second quarter decreased 4.8% to $2.26 billion principally driven by our comp store sales decline of 4.1%, the store closures we executed in 2015, and the effect of our Carquest consolidations. The declines were partially offset by positive growth at WORLDPAC, our store conversions, and new stores opened. Tom also talked about some of our internal challenges on availability and in certain geographies earlier. ","In our commercial business the comp store sales declines were more pronounced in our North East and Great Lakes markets. Within DIY, the declines were primarily seen in our undercar, brakes, and wide control categories offset by higher wiper blade sales due to the weather conditions in the South East during the early part of the quarter. Our gross profit rate declined at 110 basis points, was primarily driven by supply chain expense deleverage due to the comp store sales decline and higher supply chain expenses driven by our move to daily replenishment. ","Our adjusted SG&A expenses were down nearly $35 million versus our second quarter last year. Despite this, our second quarter adjusted SG&A rate increased 17 basis points year-over-year driven primarily by fixed cost deleverage due to our comp store sales decline. We also experienced approximately $12 million of higher self-insurance cost of 56 basis points as we cycled roughly a $7 million insurance benefit from last year versus higher insurance cost this year. These costs were partially offset by lower incentive costs and our continued focus to reduce expenses. ","All in second quarter adjusted EPS decreased 16.3% compared to last year and adjusted operating income decreased 14.8% to $243.2 million, adjusted operating margin decreased to 127 basis points over the same period last year to 10.8%. Additionally we had a $7.7 million adjustment to our income tax expense related to a GPI income tax audit for time periods prior to our acquisition that inflated our Q2 tax rate. The majority of this adjustment was offset in other income below the operating income as this amount is recoverable under our GPI indemnification agreement. ","Operating cash flow for the second quarter was $192.9 million versus $330.8 million last year primarily driven by an increase in inventory versus last year and lower than expected sales. The increase in inventory was principally driven by our Carquest consolidations, store closures, new Dallas WORLDPAC DC, and lower than expected sales. We expect to reduce the inventory growth through the balance of the year and expect total inventory at the end of the year to be up low single-digits versus last year. ","Our adjusted debt to EBITDA was 2.5 times at the end of the quarter and remains within our maximum stated leverage ratio target of 2.5 times. We continue to be focused on improving our business performance while preserving our investment grade ratings. ","While we have not provided an annual EPS outlook, we did however want to give you some context to how we are thinking about the back half. Based on our current sales outlook we expect continued fixed cost deleverage of our SG&A and supply chain costs and are making some investments to improve our service and availability. Additionally as we reduce our inventory in the back half of the year as part of our ongoing efforts to improve our inventory productivity, we expect to experience gross margin headwinds driven by the expensing of previously capitalized supply chain cost. With that let's open up the call for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. The first question is from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Sir, your line is open. ","Simeon Gutman","Thanks, good morning Tom. The guidance last quarter negative 3 to 5 for this period, it seemed like you started out pretty negative I guess maybe at the low-end of that range. I grant the negative 4 is not that much of an improvement, just curious if things did get a little bit better or are they variable throughout the quarter and realize in the context of negative 3 to 5 for the rest of the year doesn\u2019t sound like much improvement but curious if you can talk about if North East at least has gotten a little better post the end of the quarter?","Tom Greco","Hey, good morning Simeon. First of all if you step back and look at our performance over the last 40 weeks, it is in the down 3 range so when you look at going forward I would say we are conservative with the down 3 to down 5. We finished better than we started but we are still working through a lot of things inside the company. We swept the P&L every Monday, we look at the execution metrics that matter, we are making some progress on those metrics. So, clearly I am feeling like some of those things are moving in the right direction but at the moment we feel it is important to be conservative with that guidance at the moment and that\u2019s where we are. ","Simeon Gutman","So my follow up is, it sounds like the business is still paying the price or just suffering from some of the integration things that have happened over the past year. I know a year ago we talked about the business might be at its maximum pain point and granted you weren't there at that time and there is a lot of change but I am curious why if there were fixes that were made to let's say address some of these issues, why things are getting worse, could it be a sign that customers giving up on the business or is it just going to take a lot longer for you to dig out of some of these setbacks?","Tom Greco","There is obviously a lot to your question. I mean we\u2019re building a strategy that we feel can win over the long-term. That strategy is going to incorporate the work that we had done on the integration. So it\u2019s a very comprehensive business strategy that spans the growth agenda, it has a very robust productivity agenda. It is going to align the people and culture behind the business strategy so we\u2019re building that strategy out. I think the performance that we\u2019ve had so far is reflective of a strategy that really hasn\u2019t been as comprehensive and holistic as the one we are going to have going forward. And the execution against that strategy was not where it needs to be candidly. So we\u2019re confident that we have a strategy going forward but where we are now is we are still trying to address some of the fixes from the previous approach. ","Simeon Gutman","Okay, thanks. ","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Seth Sigman with Credit Suisse. ","Seth Sigman","Hey guys, thanks, good morning. My main question relates to the store and consolidation strategy. The consolidation of Carquest, it went from a benefit to a negative in the quarter, can you elaborate on what changed with the strategy and why that reversed and if there is a way to quantify how much of a negative that was to the quarter that would be helpful?","Tom Greco","The consolidation programs themselves, the CCR itself we\u2019ve taken a step back step from those and we\u2019re looking at what elements of the CCR initiative actually worked in our favor and which ones were not necessarily lined up behind the original estimates that were done. And we have pluses and minuses there. Consolidations, we didn\u2019t really hit the goals that we set for ourselves in consolidation so we have stepped back on that one and we have reduced the number of consolidations that we have going forward. Other aspects of the CCR strategy have worked better than we anticipated and we\u2019re accelerating those. So we\u2019re looking very carefully at that and that will be folded into the broader strategy going forward.","Seth Sigman","Okay, thanks and then Mike you mentioned some investments and service unavailability planned for later this year. Can you elaborate on that and maybe help quantify it? Thanks.","Mike Norona","Yes, we\u2019re looking at the fourth quarter Seth in terms of how do we make sure we ramp up the top line. We really need more growth as you saw in the quarter. The deleverage was the single biggest driver of our profit shortfall and obviously we\u2019re focused on retaining momentum on the top line and with our customers. We\u2019re making very selective investments and how we drive the top line and that spans across multiple different lines. I am not going to get into specifics but we feel really good about our ability to stimulate more growth in the fourth quarter.","Seth Sigman","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you, our next question comes from Matt Fassler with Goldman Sachs. ","Matthew Fassler","Thanks a lot and good morning. My first question relates to daily replenishment and it seems like the execution of that strategy was a big challenge for you during the quarter both sales wise and cost wise. Can you try to dimensionalize for us the impact, how many stores or percentage of the chain made that shift, what kind of dollar excess on the distribution cost side that is did you see as a result of this process not going quite the way you wanted?","Tom Greco","Obviously Matt, our customers trust us to have the right part at the right time and that means making sure we\u2019re delivering high quality great value parts accurately, reliably, and consistently and when they need them. So that\u2019s the goal. Our customers really don\u2019t care how we get them the part as long as we get them the part when they need it and that\u2019s an important learning we\u2019ve had. Replenishment delivery frequency to the stores is just one element of the supply chain. It is not the goal itself. ","So we\u2019re looking carefully at our entire supply chain and how to provide the absolute best solution for each store and it\u2019s customers. And we are making sure that every aspect, whether it is the fill rate from our DC, the quality of our assortment in the market, the order accuracy, the consistency and speed of our delivery throughout the supply chain are grooved. And we had some markets as you referenced, where we moved a little bit too quickly to a solution that didn\u2019t make sense for those markets at that time. And it did impact our profit flow-through in the quarter. ","We have addressed that immediately. In fact we are beginning to see some progress already from the actions that we have taken in those markets. I am not going to get into specifics on the number of stores or DCs but they were in the North East and Mid West and we have taken the appropriate actions there. ","Matthew Fassler","That is great and my follow-up question relates to customer relationships. I think there was a question that alluded to this earlier and we are getting a lot of questions on it. that are concerned about the permanence of potential share loss given the stickiness of commercial relationships, is there any way to quantify customer defection, customer losses obviously from a - the same store sales are under pressure, is that reduction in sales per customer, is that a reduction in customer count on the commercial side, just to get a sense as to decomposing out of that sales decline on the commercial side and thinking about how easy it is to win some of that business back or not?","Tom Greco","Well I have been around customers for 35 years and I can tell you that it is a very dynamic situation with customers, you are either getting better with those relationships or you are getting worse. And I can tell you we are going to get better. We put Bob Cushing into that big role today overseeing all of commercial. He is maniacally focused on customer service and getting the right part to right place to the right time. I have tremendous confidence that we will build those relationships back. We are focused on all aspects of the customer agenda, how many customers we are picking up, how many we are losing, whether we are gaining share inside each customer. So all of those aspects are being considered at the moment Matt and we do have to build the execution muscle inside of Advance so that we make progress against that. I am pretty confident that with Bob\u2019s appointment we are going to really start to make material changes on that. ","Matthew Fassler","Thank you so much. ","Operator","Thank you, our next question is from Chris Bottiglieri with Wolfe Research. ","Chris Bottiglieri","Hi, thank you for taking my call. Quick question on the distribution strategy, a while back you had alluded to some mega hubs that you were introducing. Just trying to figure out where that kind of fits into your strategy going forward, kind of preliminary result to me have seen and how those may differ from the PDQ facilities you have used in the past?","Tom Greco","Well, I am really stepping back Chris on the supply chain in total. We want to look at every aspect of it. We are working through this transition as Bob comes into commercial. We want to make sure that we are focused on the right metric. So, I mean everything is on the table in terms of how we support the supply chain. We need to transform it and make it much more customer friendly so that we are delivering the part when the customer needs it. So, you will hear more about that in the fall but it is really more of a holistic approach to the supply chain than we have had in the past. ","Chris Bottiglieri","Okay, then one brief follow-up kind of related. You seem very metric driven, accountability focused, can you talk about how that kind of fits into compensation plans. I think the previous management team had alluded to test some markets to change the compensation structure, can you maybe just talk about how that two relate and kind of how you look at that going forward? Thank you. ","Tom Greco","Yeah, obviously critical. We want to make sure that once we have got alignment to the strategy and we picked the right metrics to drive against that strategy the incentive systems are directly lined up against those. So, that applies up and down the organization alright, Chris. We look at the Senior Executives team and whether those metrics are lined up to deliver, sorry, the incentives are lined up to deliver the metrics right down to the front line organization. And we want to make sure that people are incented to go after the metrics that matter the most. And I think in the past we did shift around a little bit in terms of what we challenged our large field organization to do and we want to get really grounded on a very small, limited set of metrics for them to focus again and we will incent them and reward them for achieving those goals.","Chris Bottiglieri","Okay, great. Thanks a lot and good luck with the turnaround. ","Operator","Thank you, the next question is from Michael Lasser with UBS. ","Michael Lasser","Good morning, thanks a lot for taking my question. So, you outlined several factors that are going to pressure your profitability in the back half but also sounds like sales remain pretty sluggish. So how should we think about your margins in the third quarter and the fourth quarter particularly in that last quarter of the year where you can be facing a very easy comparison. So are your margins going to be down year-over-year in both of those quarters?","Mike Norona","Hey Michael, good to talk to you. No, I think Tom laid it out well. Our focus in the back half is improving our service and our availability and getting that top line going. So I\u2019d say there are three drivers is how we\u2019re thinking about the back half. We\u2019re not giving an EPS annual outlook but I did give you a little bit of context that would be helpful to how we\u2019re thinking about the back half of the year financially. Based on that down 3 to down 5 for the full year, we\u2019re going to continue to see SG&A and supply chain deleverage. Our model needs sales and with an 80% roughly fixed cost model you just deleverage. That will be the largest driver of our operating margins in the back half. ","Second of all we are going to make investments in service and availability that Tom talked about earlier and then third is we\u2019ve got as we and you could see our inventory in the second quarter was up 7.3%. We are planning on our inventory being up low single-digits by the end of the year. There is some capitalize supply chain cost that will be a headwind as we go into the back half of the year. So those will be the three drivers. So yes, we would anticipate some strain on our margins but that\u2019s all I am going to say because we\u2019re not giving an EPS annual outlook. ","Michael Lasser","Understood, Tom now that you have had time to digest and diagnose the company\u2019s problem, how long do you think it is going to take to generate a positive comp?","Tom Greco","We\u2019re obviously not giving a specifics beyond the balance of the year on the comp but I am pretty optimistic that we can accelerate our sales going forward. I think the idea of really getting this entire organization focused on the customer Michael, is going to benefit us. I can feel it when I go out into the field. People want to win. We\u2019ve got great leaders that run our field organization. The general managers want to drive the top line. They are very competitive. They just need the tools to go out there and get it and we have to enable that by looking carefully at our supply chain and figuring out how to do a better job getting them the part they need when the customer wants it. So we\u2019re optimistic about this. Very optimistic we can drive the top line. I can't give you a specific timeline but we are making a lot of progress on the things that need to be done in order to accelerate growth.","Michael Lasser","Tom, maybe another way to ask it is if you look back in the second quarter in your mind do you have a sense for how much of the comp decline or the underperformance was due to self inflicted factors and how much was due to weakness in the market particularly in the geographies that Advance Auto is levered to?","Tom Greco","You know I think if you look at our comparative performance you would say the majority of it is self inflicted, right. I mean just look at the relative performance. I mean we -\u2013 our goal is to perform above the top performers in the industry. So for us to do -- to achieve that\u2019s a significant gap. There was some geographic softness which has been called off by others. But relatively speaking it\u2019s a small percentage of our opportunity. As we start to improve on some of the basic metrics that are important to execute against it in the marketplace we can grow significantly.","Michael Lasser","Very helpful, thank you so much. ","Operator","Thank you the next question is from Ben Bienvenu with Stephens, Inc.","Ben Bienvenu","Yes, thanks, good morning. You talked a lot about improving availability in service levels. I am curious, as you look across the industry and in places where you are winning back share, is it purely on account of availability and service levels or maybe said in another way given the level of service of some of your peers do you think that\u2019s solely enough to win back share that you've lost or do you see it more as a story of winning share from the consolidation of the industry and indefinite operators in the space?","Tom Greco","Ben, we did a pretty deep dive as I mentioned in the prepared remarks on what matters most to our customers, whether that\u2019s on the commercial side or on the retail side. And we have got a pretty clear idea of the table stakes that matter the most. We have got an idea on specific jobs in terms of where we can make a difference. So it is obviously not as simple as I am describing it but getting the right -- in the right place is really, really foundational to success. And we have not done as good a job on that as we -- as some of our competitors candidly and we have got to elevate our gain there. So we are very focused on solution that will enable us to do that. And we have got some very, very promising pilots that we are testing out there in the marketplace. They are giving us confidence that going forward we can provide solutions that are as good as or better than our competition out there in the marketplace. ","Ben Bienvenu","Understood, and then looking at the balance sheet a bit, AP to inventory ratio ticking down a little bit, I will be curious to get your sense of in the backdrop of some of the changes that you are making, what you expect the opportunity to look like there and can we think about that as another lever to pull to improve shareholder returns over time?","Mike Norona","Yeah, absolutely. And Tom talked about it, I mean improving our working capital is another large opportunity and it will be a byproduct of our improved performance. So, and I would say there is two big drivers; one, as Tom has talked at length about the need to improve our performance and that would drive free cash flow and that will drive obviously an ability to return back to shareholders. The second biggest opportunity we have and the opportunity that drove our AAP ratio little bit lower than last year was our inventory management. And there is a very large focus around that. Tom talked about it in his remarks. ","We are going to see in the back half some of that movement happen as we move through the transitional inventory particularly in our Carquest brand of stores from the consolidations we have done on the closed stores. Obviously at our AAP brand of stores there are going to be some improvements there. We are making investments in availability and we have got some new stores but also we are getting more productive with our inventory and we are looking at areas that we can get better in AAP. And then the third one is WORLDPAC. One of the drivers of our 7.3% increase was WORLDPAC and WORLDPAC's inventory growth was up about 15% and the reason is that we have got a new Dallas DC for WORLDPAC. So, what we anticipate is inventory management is going to be a big driver of the opportunity to improve the free cash flow and as you return and obviously the return back to shareholders. ","Ben Bienvenu","Okay, great, thanks so much and best of luck. ","Operator","Thank you, the next question is from Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities. ","Seth Basham","Thanks a lot and good morning. My first question is just if you could give some more detail on the relative performance in terms of basis points gap between the North East and Great Lakes versus the rest of the chain?","Tom Greco","Seth, we had a big gap. There is no question about that and I mentioned the challenges that we had in some of those distribution centers up there that really hurt our business in the short-term that we have corrected. So, the gap is pretty sizeable. I am not going to give you a specific number but it was a pretty sizeable gap in the quarter and I am confident that changes that we have just initiated, in fact we just reviewed the performance in the first week yesterday. We are confident that we are going to make some pretty big progress up there. ","Seth Basham","Okay, that is helpful. And then secondly you are making a bunch of changes to investments you are talking about. As you look forward to 2017, obviously without providing any guidance, would you expect your operating margins to rise versus 2016 or do you think there will be investments that will offset those improvements?","Tom Greco","Well, obviously over time the market expansion opportunity is massive here. There is no question about that, I haven\u2019t talked on the Q&A much about the productivity agenda but I am really excited about the work we are doing on productivity. We are going throughout our entire organization bucketing the cost the way that I feel we need to in order to get at the discreet real productivity opportunity, sustainable multiyear productivity opportunities that are out there. We are leading that throughout each function. We have got a cost base that we have laid out. We have got targets for our distribution centers, distribution centers to stores, inside the stores, stores to customers. We are very focused on zero based budgeting. All of those things will give us sustainable margin expansion opportunities and also enable us to invest back in growth. ","So, there is little doubt in my mind that we will expand margins overtime. I think it is early for me to say whether that will happen in 2017. We should be in a position to talk to you about that sometime in November once we have finished our strategic planning process and we sequenced our investment profiles and got ready for all of those tradeoffs right that need to be made between top line growth and productivity. ","Seth Basham","Good, look forward to it. Thanks a lot. ","Operator","Thank you, the next question is from Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets. ","Scot Ciccarelli","Good morning guys. I know you have had a bunch of questions around this but when you do think about that margin expansion opportunity I think you just used the word massive from a productivity improvement, etc. But Tom you\u2019ve also mentioned investments need to be made so when you think about kind of 2017 versus 2016 can you provide some color on how you guys are thinking about the margin profile, just call it one or two years out like what is the general cadence is going to be even if it is not specific numbers?","Tom Greco","Sure, first of all Scot, when we think about constructing the productivity pipeline that I just described we obviously want more than just necessary to expand margins. So we\u2019re targeting to have enough cost takeout that we can invest back and expand margins at the same time. So we have to self fund our growth and given the first pass we have had on this we\u2019ll be in a good position to do that in 2017. The question is how much investment is going to be required to stimulate the top line in 2017 but overtime we\u2019ve done the five year. There is no question that we can build this business with sustainable top line growth and expand margins at the same time. ","Scot Ciccarelli","Okay, that\u2019s helpful and then one other thing I think you mentioned on the last call was you are out meeting with a lot of vendors who some of that lean vendors in the community can you just share the general feedback that you have had from the vendors that Advance tried to kind of rework how it\u2019s historically worked with that vendor community?","Tom Greco","Sure, we\u2019ve had really good discussions with our vendor partners. They are central to our success over the long-term. We\u2019ve had several meeting with them, we got several meetings coming up with them. They\u2019re all in, they really want to be part of a growth story within the industry. I mean I think from their standpoint they look at us as perhaps the biggest growth opportunity they have. So, we are spending a lot of time with our vendors and they are working collaboratively with us on solutions that can help differentiate us in the marketplace. ","Scot Ciccarelli","Got you, alright, thanks guys. ","Operator","Thank you, the next question is from Matt McClintock with Barclays. ","Matt McClintock","Yes, good morning everyone. Tom earlier you said -- you talked about consolidations, you mentioned historically that it hit the goals and you've reduced that plan going forward. Have you ever given any of us size of that reduction? And just as a second question on that, previously you were decided to consolidate some stores, what does that mean about the profitability profile of the stores now that you are not going to consolidate them? Thank you.","Tom Greco","Well in terms of the versus what we originally planned, I think we ended up roughly two thirds is where we ended up in terms of the go forward strategy, in terms of what we originally. We originally planned x number of stores and we probably have about two thirds of that. So essentially we have stepped back and looked at the performance and candidly as we went through the process the first stores we did were stronger than the more recent ones. I mean that\u2019s a reality of it. You cannot go to the ones that are let's say the lowest hanging fruit from the beginning. And then as you move along the business case, the economic case isn't as attractive and when we are giving back significant amount of market share the tradeoff on profitability just isn't worth it over the long-term. So I think that\u2019s where we ended up. ","Matt McClintock","Thank you very much. ","Operator","Thank you the next question is from Kate McShane with Citi Research.","Christopher Lane","Hi, this is Chris Lane on for Kate. Regarding the slipping acquisition with the replenishment, can you quantify how much you take this cost you in comp and also on the integration side can you also quantify the sales transfer rates that you are seeing from consolidations and with sales retention in the converted stores?","Mike Norona","First of all on the would it cost us in the stores impact I am not going to give you a specific number Chris but it was a significant number. We moved rapidly, we challenged our team to get something done that was very difficult for them to do. And in the end I mean I spent a lot of time in those DCs in the marketplace with those general managers and they dealt with a pretty tough set of circumstances for a period of time. So, our ability to correct that for them which as I mentioned earlier we have just done is a welcome change. And we had just a great discussion about it yesterday. I am very excited about how the team feels about it because we did respond to something that was important to them. Can you repeat your second question again, I want to make sure I understand it.","Christopher Lane","Yeah, it is just on the consolidation side, what you are seeing on the sales transfer rates from consolidated stores in the existing market and the stores are looking good I guess, what kind of sales retention are you seeing in those stores?","Mike Norona","Yeah, the converted stores we are pretty excited about. I mean we have seen some nice growth on the conversions and in fact those we have actually increased. The consolidation source, we had a percentage of sales that we wanted to retain going into it. We started the flip below that percentage and that is why we pull back on it. ","Christopher Lane","Okay, and just a quick one, in the past you have mentioned some impacts are retaining talent as a result of the merger and other factors, has that improved in recent months then, I guess how are you approaching the retention of talent?","Tom Greco","Yeah, we are all over retaining our top talent. There is nothing more important in this company than the front line organization that faces our customers every single day out there in the marketplace. And I am really proud of the way our team has rallied against this issue. I mean a couple of months ago we declared a crisis in this area and we have got very focused on how are we going to retain our general managers, our commercial parts pros, our commercial account managers out there in the field. And we have actually started to see positive performance year-on-year on retention. So, you can count on us to be very focused on our front line organization. It is incredibly important for our business. They have to face our customers day in and day out and we are going to do everything we can to enable them to succeed in the marketplace. And that includes giving them the tools, the training, the technology, and the incentives to go out and win in the market. ","Christopher Lane","Alright, thank you. ","Operator","Thank you, the next question is from Mike Baker with Deutsche Bank. ","Michael Baker","Thanks, so in some of your customer survey work I am wondering, so obviously availability is most important, how important is price to customers and then can you square the answer there with some of the investments you said you are making in the fourth quarter, how much of that and even into 2017 how much of that investment is going to be in price to drive demand and again how does that rate to what the customers tell you they place the importance on price?","Tom Greco","Yeah, it came up. I mean, I am not going to skirt that one Mike. I mean value is important. You can't ignore value. At the same time I think you have heard from others, it isn\u2019t the number one thing that comes up. It is on the list but it is not on the top couple of things that are important for them. So, we can't ignore it. So, they have to look and we just did this yesterday. And we go category by category, part by part. We benchmark versus competition, we look for opportunities surgically. But we are not looking at some kind of broad-based pricing action as a company. The investments that we need to make are going to be made to identify quality of our assortment, our fill rate, our order accuracy, the consistency of our delivery, our overall service proposition to the customer. That is where we are looking at making investments.","Michael Baker","Okay, thanks. That is helpful. Just as a follow-up to some of the other comments that you have made, so in the Great Lakes and the North East you have changed some things around and things seems to be getting better. My sense is you are not going to quantify that for us but is there any way to dimensionalize it if things going from negative cost to positive cost or anything along those lines where we have made those improvements, something to sort of point to what the -- possible could be over the current quarters?","Tom Greco","Well that would be quantifying it I think. But I will try to answer that, I mean we are definitely seeing improvements, okay and based on where we were I think we should see pretty substantial improvement in those stores that were impacted. Keep in mind it is not a huge number of stores across our network but in the stores that experienced some of those difficulties they should see a substantial improvement in their performance. ","Michael Baker","Okay, thanks for the color. Appreciate it. ","Operator","Thank you, our next question is from Greg Melich with Evercore ISI.","Michael Montani","Hey guys, good morning, it is Mike Montani on for Greg. I just wanted to ask if I could Tom, can you talk about last quarter you guys had said 260 million to 280 million of CAPEX, can you just provide an update there and then as we move forward the next few years, how are you all thinking about what that number could become if you were to do all the different initiatives that you have potentially untapped?","Tom Greco","Well first of all Mike we\u2019re right smack dab in the middle of our strategic planning process and we\u2019ve had a couple of discussions with our Board on this topic. We\u2019re continuing to narrow the list of priorities that need to be done, sequencing them appropriately over the strategic horizon. CAPEX is essentially an output of all of that work. So at the moment we\u2019re really not in a position to say where we\u2019re going there. We\u2019re looking at multiple places to drive value for the corporation, that includes across our supply chain, information technology, new store openings, geographic expansion. All of those things are on the table but eventually we\u2019ve got to narrow that list and come up with the most appropriate mix of growth related capital, productivity related capital, information technology, and we have not completed that yet. So the working hypothesis is kind of continuing with the number that you had, that\u2019s what we are working with at the moment but it is more to come. ","Michael Montani","Okay, great and then if I could just follow up for the quarter, can you provide any incremental color about traffic versus ticket split on the negative 4 and then also just on store growth and square footage growth for the back half of the year how should we think about consolidations and closures versus new openings?","Tom Greco","Well first of all I mean you have to split out the outlier commercial. But broadly more of a traffic issue than a ticket issue at the moment. And on store growth in the back half we\u2019ll have to get back to you on that one, I don\u2019t have that right off the top of my head. ","Michael Montani","Okay, thank you. ","Operator","Thank you the next question is from Dan Wewer with Raymond James. ","Dan Wewer","Thanks. Mike, you reminded us that you\u2019ll have higher capitalized supply chain cost in the fourth quarter as you began to draw down your inventories, will that headwind continue through the first three quarters of 2017 until you anniversary the inventory reduction?","Mike Norona","No, not necessarily, Dan. I mean, it really depends because we haven't given the outlook for 2017 I mean the big driver obviously in the back half of the year is we\u2019re going to see a significant fall off. Typically our inventory growth and lead down is a little bit smoother but we\u2019re with the moves we\u2019re making in the back half of the year and again they are very planful. But I can't say that because really our plan is to get a big driver of that is the sales. So as we start to position ourselves and when we give that outlook on how we\u2019re thinking about 2017 we\u2019ll be in a better position to give you a holistic picture because there is other things that impact that.","Dan Wewer","I was just thinking with the Unicap accounting rules for inventory that would be the headwind because you would have pure units but you say that may not be the case? ","Mike Norona","Yes, that may not be the case, you are correct. I mean obviously as you continue to bleed down the inventory with lower sales yes, that will be a headwind especially if your supply chain cost are increasing. But our plan is to get the top line going, get rid of some of this inventory that\u2019s transitional, and then obviously we\u2019re going to be buying inventory. And as Tom said we\u2019re going to be improving the efficiency of our supply chain. So there is a lot of moving pieces there.","Dan Wewer","Tom, I want to follow up with you on the consolidations. So what happens going forward if there is a Carquest, the company owned Carquest store and an Advance store in the same market but you decide not to go down the consolidation path, are you thinking about a dual branding strategy in that same market and the reason I am asking because I thought the original plan was to only use the Carquest brand in the independently operated locations?","Tom Greco","Yes, we\u2019re still not complete in our assessment of that Dan. Obviously the independents which are critical parts of our business and one that potentially we see further opportunity to grow going forward, we have got a great group of independent operators out there who operate under the Carquest brand and we want to continue to drive growth with. That\u2019s going to be central to our strategy but we haven't aligned on the role of the two different brands as we go forward. We\u2019ve got some markets where it\u2019s exclusively Carquest. As you know we got others where it\u2019s exclusively Advance and where we have the two of them. We do believe that we can have them coexist in the same market, we just got to figure out how those two banners can operate in a way that are incremental and play a different role, and that\u2019s where a lot of the work that we have done on demand and the specific jobs that are relevant to our customers. We can focus Carquest on a certain part of the business, we can focus Advance on another part of the business and make sure that it\u2019s incremental for the company. That\u2019s the trick in terms of making sure that they work together. ","Dan Wewer","You also noted that you were right in the middle of the strategic planning process and you also had multiple pilots for a supply chain changes that you are testing as well. How long do those pilots need to continue before you can finalize your strategic plan, I think you mentioned November but I was thinking it would take longer than that to analyze the results?","Tom Greco","We\u2019re going to move fast. We\u2019ve got the pilots in flight as we speak. We do have phases to the pilots and we are working against those phases but we\u2019re obviously going to take the learning's from the pilots and the ones that can be applied immediately and leverage those. Other aspects are going to take longer but the pilots are really exciting for us. I mean their design to at the same time provide greater availability for our customers improve the quality of the assortment and make sure that we\u2019re delivering parts faster and most more consistently to our customers while we\u2019re taking cost out of our supply chain and reducing inventory. So it has really the triple benefit of doing all three. We\u2019re measuring against a very, very detailed dashboard that looks at all of those metrics in tandem. And we\u2019re iterating as we go but the early results are very good. So I feel like we can move faster than perhaps you may have indicated. You won't be able to role everything out at once. I mean again given its phase once we get past the first checkpoint there is other things that we want to explore. But I guess what I am saying is, you go through the first phase of a pilot, we can roll that -- those aspects that make sense into the marketplace and then test phase two as we go. ","Dan Wewer","Would you ever be comfortable having one distribution facility supporting WORLDPAC, Advance and Carquest and perhaps AI as well?","Tom Greco","Well clearly the move with Bob today is designed to really look horizontally across our organization, commercial organization. I don\u2019t think that we\u2019re going to get to that particular dimension right out of the gate but we are going to look at it. Clearly on the customer side we\u2019ve never had a holistic strategy between Advance and AI and WORLDPAC. We\u2019ve had multiple organizations going out there selling to commercial customer admittedly with different products. But as import vehicles are growing, private label is becoming increasingly important which is Autopart International specialty. We do see an opportunity to look across and clearly leverage some of the capabilities more broadly. ","On the supply chain itself, I mean I think there are elements of the supply chain where it could make sense. As an example we have an Advance store close by here the office that gets eight deliveries a day from the WORLDPAC branch and yet we\u2019re also delivering from the Advance store going to the WORLDPAC branch. So integrating the transportation management systems of those supply chains can help us reduce cost and be more efficient. And there is many other things that Bob is going to look at. ","So we are very excited about this change. Bob is a terrific leader. He has got -- they built this online capability out there in WORLDPAC that is really as good as anybody in the industry. And with the growth in online coming up in the future years, our intention is to leverage their online and ecommerce capabilities more broadly across Advance. ","Dan Wewer","Okay, thank you. ","Operator","Thank you, the next question is from Bret Jordan with Jeffries.","Bret Jordan","Hey, good morning guys. Quick question, I guess as you are talking about the IT and the pilot programs have you stopped rewriting the APEX [ph] system and are sort of evaluating how you\u2019re going to consolidate the systems behind distribution or are you still sort of looking for one common backbone to that? And I guess a piece of the same question, where are you on point of sale consolidation and then the read through, you talked about North Eastern and Mid Western supply chain problems in the quarter, are those around the DCs that run Red Prairie or is that something different?","Tom Greco","Well first of all on APEX we just had a review on Friday. We\u2019re making some really good progress there. Our field team members are at several stores Bret. They are up and running in the pilot with any change and when you\u2019re talking about a change to your catalog and how people work every single day it does take some time to make sure that it\u2019s absolutely performing on a level that our people love it. And we still got some work to do there. So the short answer on APEX is it\u2019s proceeding along the timeline that we had but we want to make sure when we roll it out that it is really driving our top line and the efficiency of our team members. And we\u2019re continuing to refine how we approach the APEX roll out because we want to make sure that it is absolutely group when we roll it out. We\u2019re continuing to work through the POS consolidation. Essentially that continues on the timelines that we\u2019ve talked about there. I don\u2019t know that it was entirely Red Prairie related in the North East, it\u2019s a factor. But there is just not Red Prairie, there was other distribution centers impacted that do not use Red Prairie.","Bret Jordan","Okay, thanks and then one follow up question, you talked about some of the high profile branded parts that have been taken out of the merchandise mix possibly coming back, could you give us any color sort of where we are on sort of how you think about some of the branded products that were important to commercial customers?","Tom Greco","You know Charles and his team are doing a pretty thorough review of where we are on hard parts and how we benchmark versus our competition. For the most part we feel pretty good about our assortment but we are looking at some things that -- we actually got the meetings coming up next week on this topic. So there is nothing specific to report right now Bret, but we are you know look very closely on our hard part assortment because we\u2019ve got to have something that is competitive across every single category.","Bret Jordan","Great, thank you. ","Operator","Thank you, the next question is from Caroline Jolly with Gabelli.","Caroline Jolly","Oh great, thanks for taking my question. So I guess in regards to WORLDPAC I know a couple of quarters ago you mentioned some cannibalization in comps in one of the branches or DCs, is there any more or do you have any details on relative WORLDPAC comps year-over-year or any deceleration or acceleration?","Tom Greco","Just to clarify when you say cannibalization what are you referring to sorry?","Caroline Jolly","So when they open some of the new branches initially I think they also mention that that some cannibalization from branch to branch?","Tom Greco","Branch to inside WORLDPAC. ","Caroline Jolly","Yes, right.","Mike Norona","So let me hit that. So, first of all at the highest level WORLDPAC had a -- continue to grow their business and I think we mentioned it in our remarks they were one of the bright spots in the quarter for us. So they continue to grow. And then in terms of cannibalization, I think it\u2019s a little bit different for a commercial only business when they all open up a -- because almost 90% of their business is controlled by a systems, meaning their customers order online. When they actually open another branch they actually move those customers that were serviced out of one branch and they move them to another branch. So they actually \u2013- so cannibalization is actually -\u2013 they are actually changing their systems. So we don\u2019t view that as a bad thing. What typically happens is when they open up a new branch that was close to where another branch was, they see cannibalization of the original branch because they deliberately move the customers because they can give them better service by servicing amount of a new branch and then what happens is both branches grow. So the cannibalization is if you look at their total growth and I think that\u2019s a better way to view the WORLDPAC business, their total business is growing as they are opening up new branches. And that cannibalization if they see in the original branch that just grows back as the businesses grows back and it actually grows back strong in both branches. ","Caroline Jolly","Great, thanks for detailing and just to make sure I understood what you said initially, did you mention or were you able to say if there was some acceleration in the WORLDPAC growth?","Mike Norona","They had -- I did see acceleration but they had another -- they were one of bright spots for us in the second quarter and their top line grew for the last year.","Caroline Jolly","Great, thank you. ","Operator","Thank you, our final question today comes from Craig Kennison with Baird. ","Craig Kennison","Thanks for taking my question. Tom you opened three super hubs in Atlanta in June, is that an all representative of the type of DC investment you want to make on a national basis?","Tom Greco","Well, Craig we are -- again we are stepping back on the supply chain, right. I mean we have a number of things that were implied before I got here. But we are really looking carefully at how to transform our supply chain in future fit of that structure for the marketplace that we see is going to happen in the future. And I think the things that we have done there will be many things that we incorporate into that overall growth strategy. Some of them we won't. So, it is just a question of is Atlanta what we are going to do, the answer is I don\u2019t know yet. Because we are having stepped back on the whole strategy that we have had, because it hasn\u2019t produced the kind of results that we desire to have. There will be elements of things that we have done that we will incorporate in but we are testing some new and very different approaches to how we service our customers and efficiently get product to the marketplace. So, aspects of it yes, but it is specifically Atlanta, I don\u2019t know yet. I am not sure. We are going to have that laid out in more detail as we get into November. ","Craig Kennison","Thanks, and then with respect to the deep dive survey you mentioned, do you have any sense of how often your customer that is not choosing Advance today, how often that customer is choosing a national competitor that maybe hard to displace versus a smaller competitor over what you would seem to have a scale advantage if your service levels are improved?","Tom Greco","Yeah, the answer to that question is yes. We do. ","Craig Kennison","Got it, thank you. ","Operator","Thank you. At this time there are no further questions. I will turn the call back to Tom Greco for any final comments. ","Tom Greco","Okay, well thank you everyone for joining us. Q2 was a difficult quarter for sure but we do know the issues. I want to reinforce that the issues are absolutely fixable. There is no structural impediments to us addressing those issues. I feel great about the progress that we are making and I couldn\u2019t be more excited about our future. You can count on us to dramatically elevate our focus on the customer and the top line, to transform our supply chain for the future. We are going to dial up the intensity against our execution and we will have a robust productivity pipeline. The Board and the leadership team are aligned and prepared to take decisive actions and really create the value we need for shareholders over time and we are eager to get back to work and look forward to sharing our progress with you later in the year. So thanks for joining the call and this concludes the call for today. ","Operator","And that concludes our call today, you may now disconnect. Thank you for joining us.

The company intends these forward-looking statements to speak only as of the time of this conference call, and does not undertake to update or revise them as more information becomes available. Now let me turn the call over to Jack Brouillard.","John C. Brouillard - Executive Chairman","Thanks, Zaheed, and good morning, everyone. Before I turn it over to the team to review the quarter, I want to take a few minutes to discuss this morning's announcements regarding changes we are making to our leadership team and our board. Earlier today, we announced that George Sherman will assume the role of Interim CEO of Advance Auto Parts following Darren Jackson's planned retirement from the company and the board at the beginning of the next fiscal year in January. In addition, the board has named me Executive Chairman, and we have appointed John Ferraro, who joined our board earlier this year, as Lead Independent Director.","Since joining us nearly three years ago, George Sherman has been instrumental in our efforts to expand our commercial business, improve our operations, and integrate GPI. Through all these efforts, George has demonstrated the breadth of skills, customer relationships, and leadership capabilities that make him the right choice to lead Advance during this transition period.","On behalf of the board and the entire company, I want to express deep gratitude to Darren for his many important contributions to the success of the company over the last 11 years, and particularly the last eight in his role as CEO. Under Darren's leadership, Advance has doubled in size, successfully developed a leading presence in Commercial to complement our DIY strength, and made critical investments in capabilities to drive efficiency and performance. In short, Darren has guided Advance well as we have transformed the company and positioned Advance Auto Parts into a clear industry leader. Collectively, these efforts have resulted in increases in market value of over $10 billion and positioned Advance well strategically, operationally, and financially to capitalize on the opportunities that lie ahead. As Darren retires from his role as CEO, he leaves behind a great legacy and a company with a bright future.","In my new role as Executive Chairman, I look forward to continuing to lead the board, while also working closely with George and his management team during this transition period as we continue to execute on our strategic objectives. In addition to the new roles that John Ferraro and I will play on the board, we also welcome Jeff Smith of Starboard Value as a new board member. We've had the opportunity to engage with Jeff and Starboard as a major shareholder, and we are aligned around the opportunity and the need to deliver improved operating results to drive increased shareholder value at Advance. Jeff will be a valuable addition to our board, and we look forward to working closely together going forward.","Jeff, John, and I will lead the search for Darren's permanent successor. George will be considered as part of that process, which will also include an evaluation of external candidates, as we look for the best leader to take the company forward. As we work through this transition, the board is confident that we will not miss a beat in the execution of our strategy to deliver improved operating performance. In addition to Jeff joining the Advance board, Starboard will designate two additional independent directors to the board as soon as practical. We have also agreed that the nominating and corporate governance committee will name two additional independent directors for election at our next annual meeting in the spring. We expect that following the 2016 annual meeting, the board will have 12 to 13 members, which will include Jeff and these four new directors.","I know we have provided you with a lot of information this morning, so let me step back and provide you with a bit of perspective before I turn the call over to Darren and his team. Under Darren's leadership, we have made tremendous strides in positioning the company strategically, operationally, and financially. Advance has a solid foundation upon which we will continue to build going forward. We remain focused on delivering improved operating performance and increased shareholder value. The board, including Jeff and the management team, are aligned around that effort and focused on redoubling our efforts to achieve those objectives. With that, let me turn the call over to Darren.","Darren R. Jackson - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Jack. George and Mike will cover the quarter, but I'd first like to echo some of Jack's comments. George and I have worked closely together over the last several years, and he has a deep understanding of our business and the needs of our customers, and he has earned the respect of our team members.","I have absolute confidence in his ability to lead this company. Second, despite the near-term challenges we face in the business, I have the utmost confidence in the company's ability to deliver on the improved operating targets we have previously outlined, and to continue to increase shareholder value in the years ahead.","Third, retiring at this time is something I've been intending for, for some time and have discussed extensively with our directors. During my tenure, we have doubled sales, significantly grown our store count and team members, and transformed our business to be a leader in serving both the installer and do-it-yourself customers; ultimately, growing our earnings per share and increasing our price per share six-fold. It has been a privilege to work with such a tremendous team, and I'm extremely proud of what we have accomplished together. Finally, I want to thank all of you for your ongoing support over the years. I'm confident that the company is in a great position to build on its past success and deliver even greater value to our customers, team members, and shareholders going forward. Now let me turn it over to George Sherman.","George E. Sherman - President","Thanks, Darren, and good morning, everyone. First, I'd like to acknowledge the significant contributions that Darren has made to Advance Auto Parts over his more than 11 years with the company. Darren has strategically positioned this company for leadership in the auto parts aftermarket while creating value for our shareholders over that period of time. He has lived the company's values to inspire, serve, and grow, and has always partnered with the community and charitable organizations to give back, as he saw that as a fundamental responsibility of the company and consistent with his personal values. I thank Darren for all his support and leadership over the years.","Before I begin my prepared remarks, I'd also like to thank all of our team members for their continued focus and commitment to customer service in the quarter. Looking ahead, I welcome the opportunity and look forward to working with our teams to realize the full potential of this company. We are on a course to combine as one company, and we're on the right path. However, we must have a relentless bias for action and that means pushing forward and finishing the things that we've started. It also means focusing on doing fewer things better and measuring ourselves by the outcomes we deliver and expecting higher levels of accountability at Advance Auto Parts.","Turning to our third quarter, overall, despite some optimism for incremental progression coming out of Q2, our third quarter performance highlighted the challenge of navigating the integration work, while simultaneously rationalizing parts of our business. We underestimated the cumulative effect of integration change, and while we are disappointed with our results and are not currently where we expected to be within our integration, we believe in where we are going and have confidence in our plan. I gain confidence from seeing pockets of performance from some of our regions that have gone through integration and are delivering with strength. Seeing some of our product categories come through the product changes and delivering with strength, and the knowledge that while we still have work to do, we're going to anniversary significant parts of the integration change from last year as we head into 2016. We will discuss this in more detail shortly.","We are well into our integration and have a number of work streams in flight. We're focused on finishing these activities as quickly as possible to position the two businesses to begin operating as one, focused on operational execution. That means moving faster on capabilities such as our daily delivery expansion, accelerating our store consolidations and our store profitability work, and by growing our Speed Perks and TECHNET membership programs at a determined pace to name a few.","During the quarter our sales grew a modest .3% to $2.29 billion. The comparable sales were up .5%, led by Commercial with our DIY business essentially flat. On a constant currency basis, our comparable sales were up roughly 1%. Earnings per share on a comparable basis grew 3.2% in the quarter on top of last year's 27.7% growth. Plainly said, we are not satisfied with these results. They're unacceptable to me and our entire team. My upcoming remarks will address the actions we are taking in the areas of inventory availability, sales execution and our integration in order to drive the sales outcomes that we expect. As we mentioned on our second quarter call, our core business had an encouraging start to the quarter. However, comp trends began to decelerate towards the middle of the quarter. The integration has continued to have a more prolonged impact on our core Commercial business, resulting in lower sequential Commercial comps this quarter compared to our second quarter. This was partly due to continued sales softness within our CARQUEST U.S. stores, as the teams in those stores continue to work through a heavier share of the integration change coupled with some category sales softness. Our DIY business in contrast once again showed sequential improvement from our second quarter, delivering roughly a flat comp as we continue to focus on our Speed Perks program and our sustained marketing investments.","We're encouraged by the continuing improvements in our DIY business. Notably our Canadian business and import focus businesses continue to deliver good overall results. Additionally, there are a few ongoing headwinds to our comp performance in the quarter, specifically an approximate 47 basis point impact from foreign currency related to our Canadian business and roughly 36 basis points of impact from Worldpac due to transferring of existing customers from legacy branches to newly-opened branches that are positioned to serve them more efficiently. This was partially offset by consolidation favorability. The first half of the year for Worldpac was accretive to our comp performance, with a second half resembling more of a comp headwind, as we realized the full effect of these new branch openings.","Looking the other comp trends, we saw a good performance in the Southeast and Texas markets. Conversely our Upper Midwest and Great Lakes markets underperformed in the quarter, partially driven by weather, while our Puerto Rico market experienced continued softness as a result of economic uncertainty. From a product standpoint we saw continued strength in our Brake and Battery business across the company with some softness in our Undercar business. Regionally, however, our results continue to be uneven, as our teams work through the integration. Not all our stores are where we need them to be. While we are disappointed with our sales progression in Commercial, we also believe these disruptions are temporary and addressable. I say this for two reasons. First, during my store visits this quarter I saw just how hard our teams are working. They are progressing through their individual learning curves and I'm confident that each quarter they will get stronger in their roles. Second, to help with some context run on comp performance, less than 10% of our store base accounted for approximately 120 basis points of sales shortfall. Part of this shortfall was our team members working through the integration changes, but part of it is clearly addressable through performance management to deliver the expected outcomes which we're actively doing as part of our store assessments and profitability work that is well underway.","Industry fundamentals continue to remain positive including vehicles and operation, gas prices, miles driven and a steadily improving economy. With respect to our key customer segments, our TECHNET customer marketing program continues to grow at a solid pace with over 7300 members pacing double-digit sales growth year-to-date and mid-single-digit growth for the quarter. The program is also experiencing record program retention rates. These results are a great example of our commercial sales team recruiting solid new members that find value in the program's marketing, training, business management and other key components.","The Speed Perks loyalty program continues to grow and we have now surpassed the 8 million member mark, so we're about 80% of the way toward 2015 member acquisition goal. We couldn't be more pleased with this outcome and it is having a tangible impact on our business as we have now seen our third quarter of sequential improvement in our DIY comps since we began scaling Speed Perks in January. Moreover, we're excited about entering 2016 with an established loyalty program and having a member base that's tenfold what we had coming into 2015 and still growing.","We have also now started to rollout Speed Perks to our converted CARQUEST stores and have the program in several new markets including Dallas, Portland and Salt Lake City. Additionally, these CARQUEST locations are now able to participate in our buy online and pick up at store program. This is significant as it raises the profile of those stores from what was historically an underpenetrated DIY and B to C profile prior to our store conversions. We continue to see very nice results in Speed Perks enrollment through our B to C channel since we launched that last quarter.","Our key focus with Speed Perks program has been to drive acquisition and service with a broader objective, which is membership. Membership is how we will build true loyalty to the brand and deliver unique tailored customer service experiences to our membership base.","Lastly, we continue to see a good hard parts balance of sale accompanied by improved frequency of visit and a larger basket size. We're very pleased with the program performance and believe there is still significant runway for us to engage with the customer and we intend to capitalize on that.","Turning to our integration, our commentary at the end of the second quarter suggested the effects of the integration were expected to abate. While we did see abatement in certain areas of the business, it was not as broad as we expected. That said, we still absolutely believe we will continue to make progress in the near term. We can already see progress in markets where we were able to complete our integration work. Both our Texas and Maine markets have gone through the integration changes earlier this year, and we are seeing third quarter comp performance improved by roughly 400 basis points and almost 900 basis points, respectively, in those markets versus the pre-integration performance.","With that in mind, I'd like to share the status update with you across the five integration areas that we've been focusing on this year. First, as I mentioned last quarter, our Support Center consolidation is complete, as the team member moves have been made and we are not introducing any new changes to the teams. However, we are not yet executing at the same level we were prior to the consolidation for a couple of reasons.","First, virtually all of our Support Center departments have new team members resulting from those consolidation efforts. On some teams as many as 40% of the team members are new to the organization. Second, many key capability areas are also contending with dual legacy systems that won't talk to one another until we ultimately move over to common platforms. We absolutely expected our teams would need to operate dual systems for a period of time. However, we didn't expect to have as many new team members based on our initial retention rate assumptions. One challenge we faced was hiring team members for a legacy system that is not a mainstream application, ultimately requiring new hires additional time to learn the nuances of the systems; thus, the combination of newer team members managing complicated dual legacy systems has increased the slope of the learning curve for our team members. That said, our teams are working incredibly hard and making progress with each quarter.","Second, and similar to our corporate teams, our field operations and sales teams also continue to settle into their routines and work through their new roles and aspects of the integration. These are large organizational changes and we're past through the initial change and are now working for the settling-in process. Many of our store general managers are new in role or new to managing with dual model. We can see that because our stores that have more tenured GMs are generating much stronger comp performance. In our CARQUEST operations, our field leaders are getting more accustomed to running a dual model environment with both commercial and DIY responsibilities. This is different than just running a predominantly commercial box in the past. We are definitely making progress, and as I referenced earlier, time and role matters and our team members are progressing through the learning curve at different paces.","Third, turning to our store consolidation, conversion and relocation work. In the third quarter we successfully completed 83 store integration projects across three markets. The markets completed were Portland, Indianapolis and Memphis. The results to date have been very good and we are pleased with the latest round of projects. The fourth quarter is slated for approximately 110 total projects between conversions, consolidations and relocations across four markets. Execution in these markets is already underway and initial indications are that performance is trending as expected. As I mentioned earlier, we are focused on finishing aspects of our integration as quickly as possible to get our teams into a rhythm where they can operate seamlessly across our entire store base. One opportunity is to accelerate our consolidations and we will be pulling forward between 60 to 70 CARQUEST consolidations originally planned for further in 2016 to now being completed in Q1 of 2016.","A fourth priority is our product changeovers. We continue to execute the remaining lift and replace product alignment work and expect to have this completed in the first quarter of 2016. That said, the lift and replace transition continues to provide some temporary headwinds relating to our thorough execution on certain product lines. We are intensely focused on working with our suppliers and our collective supply chain teams to execute to the level we expect for our customers and we expect to see continued improvement.","Conversely, as I mentioned earlier, we're pleased with our strong brake category performance. This product category was not subject to a supplier change and incurred only in minor re-label and repackaging work. This provides us the ongoing confidence that our other brands more heavily impacted by the product changeover will emerge with strength as we work through the integration changes. Our battery business was another strong transition category that has moved through the change quicker than other product lines and is delivering goods sales performance.","Additionally, as we mentioned last quarter, we continued to work through the retention efforts for those customers that continue to have an affinity for certain brands that we no longer carry. Changing long-standing buying habits and building confidence with those customers is not an overnight process, but we are actively engaged in retaining those customers or replacing their business. We are proud of our product line-up and believe we have an industry leading line-up that positions us to serve our great customer base well into the future.","As I've also mentioned, our Commercial price alignment work is effectively complete. As we discussed last quarter, the impact of price movement takes time to drive sales unit velocity to make up for the impact where we decreased prices.","Our fifth key priority focuses on our systems and supply chain integration efforts. As mentioned previously, we continue with the development work for a common catalog and we're on pace to be in pilot by Q1 of 2016. The catalog will be a key enabler for our integrated replenishment project where we expect to begin the integration of the CARQUEST and Advance PC networks in the second half of next year.","Finally, we're making good progress on the third of the core IT integration priorities and that is our new point of sale system for our stores. We are moving the development along (22:36) and expect to have the new POS system in pilot by Q4 of 2016.","Turning now to our efforts to expand our daily delivery program. At the end of the quarter we had 804 Advance Auto Parts stores being serviced daily and are on track against our minimum objective of 1,000 stores. However, I've challenged the team to accelerate the rollout in the fourth quarter, and as a result, we now expect to exceed our objective and service approximately 1300 AAP stores by the end of the year. On average, those stores being serviced on a daily basis now have access to all the SKUs carried by the servicing DC, which typically translates to over 100,000 SKUs on a next-day basis. Also, our stores are able to access between 35,000 to 55,000 SKUs on a same-day basis from our over 400 in-market hub stores. Overall, the benefits we are seeing from our stores on daily delivery are in line with our expectations, and we are focusing on accelerating the rollout.","Moving on, we continue to focus on our base business execution in support of our profitability goal of 12% comparable operating income by 2016. As I mentioned in our last call, the number one building block of our performance culture starts with sales. Consistently delivering on our sales and service objectives is the highest priority for the team. We continue to focus on our sales execution and making those necessary changes to our business as we move to a field-led organization. We continue to take steps to simplify our business and allow our teams to focus on taking care of our customers while continuing to empower our teams to take intelligent risks and make those local decisions that will serve their customers best.","In the spirit of taking steps to build a solid, sustainable sales culture and structure, we'll be implementing the following changes. First, we have begun the transition over to a single selling environment in our stores. Our current approach with staffing and labor management divides commercial and DIY into two distinct teams within our stores, with little cross-capability leverage between the teams. A single selling environment now organizes our stores so that each team member plays more broadly to serve all our customers, not strictly front room or strictly back room. Every team member must be able to play all roles and operate cross-functionally. A single-selling model is more efficient because it requires less labor in the store, and it also provides our field leadership with more flexibility in how they schedule and staff the store, so that customers receive the best possible service.","Second, in early October, we began piloting a new compensation plans for key field positions. The pilot centers on a more variable compensation plan to support our growing commercial sales model, and provides more emphasis on growing compensation by growing the business and having a closer alignment to the organizational objectives and profit expectations. This change also fosters the strengthening of our internal bench of sales-focused, objective-driven team members.","We're still very early in the pilot, and we'll have better insight on our fourth quarter call on the results and the timing of the rollout. We believe this change is another step forward in strengthening our sales culture, but we won't move forward until this is proven and absolutely right.","We spoke on our last call about our broad work to review the profitability across our store base. We continue the work of looking at those stores that are chronic underperformers and take up a disproportionate amount of our field leaders' time. Our assessments are still ongoing, but we are aggressively addressing the poorest performing stores within our bottom 10%. Consequently, we've made the further determination to close another tranche of 30 stores that Mike will provide further financial detail on. We will be continuing with our assessments and examining performance across our store base; as we said previously, where necessary, we'll adjust our footprint accordingly.","In closing, 2015 can best be characterized as a building year, essentially building Advance and CARQUEST into one business, from our people, products, and offices through systems, supply chain, and stores. In hindsight, our agenda was aggressive, and has temporarily slowed our core commercial business. That being said, we're doing the necessary work to combine these two companies into one. These are foundational investments in changes we are making this year, and are confident they will begin generating results for our business in 2016 and beyond. It is important for us to take meaningful steps towards finishing our integration as thoughtfully but aggressively as we can, in order to get back to a business as usual environment with a more intent focus on operational execution, with a higher degree of accountability that positions the company to achieve our 12% comparable operating profit target by 2016.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Mike Norona, our Chief Financial Officer.","Michael A. Norona - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, George, and good morning, everyone. I'd also like to start by thanking all of our talented team members for the commitment to serving our customers in our third quarter. In my remarks today, I plan to review the financial highlights from our third quarter and provide insights on the remainder of the year. Moving to our third quarter, our operating results we delivered comparable cash EPS of $1.95, which was a 3.2% increase from our third quarter of 2014.","Included in our comparable cash EPS was $9.2 million in incremental synergy realization. On a GAAP basis, our third quarter EPS was $1.63, which included $9.7 million of intangible asset amortization associated with the acquisition of General Parts, and $28.6 million of one-time integration expenses related to General Parts and one-time support center restructuring costs.","Our comparable store sales were led by our commercial business, together with our third consecutive sequential improvement in our DIY business, offset by the net 47 basis point impact from foreign currency. Our gross profit rate decline was primarily the result of higher inventory expenses related to the product integration, modest supply chain de-leverage due to the lower comparable store sales growth, partially offset by lower product acquisition costs, inclusive of the company's ongoing cost synergy savings.","Our comparable SG&A improvement was the result of lower incentive costs, overall lower administrative costs and synergy savings, partially offset by expense deleverage as a result of our lower comparable store sales growth. All in, our third quarter operating income dollars on a comparable basis increased 2.9% to $243.8 million, and our operating income rate increased 28 basis points over the same period last year to 10.6%. Our AP ratio for the quarter was 76.8% versus 78.4% at the same time last year. This decrease is principally driven by transitional inventory growth resulting from our product integration work, the CARQUEST consolidation work, and by our accelerated Worldpac growth. We expect the inventory growth to abate throughout 2016.","At the end of the third quarter, we had approximately $1.29 billion of debt on our balance sheet, and our adjusted debt to EBITDAR was 2.5 times. During the quarter, we paid down approximately $160 million of debt and are slightly ahead of our planned timeline to get back below the 2.5 times leverage ratio and maintain our strong investment grade ratings.","On our last earning call, we outlined our accelerated plan, as well as actions we have begun taking to grow our comparable operating income to 12% by the end of 2016. We remain very focused on this near-term objective. As a reminder, getting to 12% comparable operating profit requires capturing the balance of our $160 million of cost synergies, delivering an additional 100 basis points of cost reductions through a combination of 45 basis points to 55 basis points of G&A cost reduction initiatives and 45 basis points to 55 basis points from our store productivity and profitability work, and additionally driving gross margin improvements.","We continue to make good progress against our G&A initiatives as we execute broad-based reductions across all our non-selling functional areas and aggressively cut discretionary costs across the enterprise, including simplifying our administrative cost structures, reducing professional services and travel costs, and essentially targeting all nonessential expenses. Our third quarter expense management affirmed our focus on disciplined G&A, cost control, delivering cost leverage despite a softer top line. We continue to work on improving the productivity and profitability across our store base and, where necessary, removing non-performing assets from our business.","In the third quarter we continued our ongoing assessment of serial underperformers within our store base and we have made the decision to close an incremental 30 stores by the end of 2015. The onetime costs associated with these additional 30 closures are estimated to be between $10 million and $15 million. As a reminder, we announced the closure of 50 stores last quarter, now bringing our total store closures relative to our store profitability work to approximately 80 stores this year. We are also improving our store productivity and profitability by implementing a single selling model and piloting our new store compensation program. The savings generated by these initiatives will largely be realized in 2016 and are already contemplated in the 45 basis points to 55 basis points of store productivity and profitability expense leverage that we've previously outlined as part of our pathway to 12%.","As we head into 2016, we expect to continue expanding our gross margin rate. We recognize, after adjusting for our business's structural differences including business mix and customer mix, we have further opportunity to improve our gross margins through leveraging our size and scale to improve our purchasing and grow our private label in global sourcing programs. Additionally, we are concentrating on value drivers such as competitive pricing programs as well as driving efficiencies in our logistics and transportation programs and managing our inventory.","We also expect benefits from our supply chain initiatives longer term, led by our daily delivery program expansion. Shorter term, we expect to offset the incremental costs and investments to expand our daily delivery through initiatives such as greater efficiencies across our logistics capability and improvements in supply chain productivity. We have already begun taking actions on these margin improvement areas and while we are slightly behind where we expected to be overall, we expect these initiatives to contribute towards our objectives in 2016.","We continue to focus on our working capital and are concentrating on those opportunities to improve our AP ratio through better terms and improved inventory management as we progress through the product conversion and supply chain work. As I mentioned earlier, as of the end of our third quarter, our leverage ratio was 2.5 times. We stated that once we got back to a sustained leverage ratio of 2.5 times, we would revert back to our previous capital allocation strategy. We will continue to maintain a disciplined approach to capital deployment to maximize shareholder value.","Turning to the balance of the year, and given our third quarter results and the continued sales softness in our fourth quarter, we are revising down our annual comparable EPS outlook. We expect to see continued impact from our integration activities, as evidenced by a softer than expected start to our fourth quarter, which is our lowest volume and most volatile quarter of the fiscal year, given the holiday season which can result in lower demand for parts and unpredictable weather patterns. We have factored these considerations together with our third quarter earnings shortfall into our revised full-year outlook.","Additionally, last year was a 53-week year with an additional week in the fourth quarter that included the New Year's Day holiday. This year the New Year's Day falls in our fourth quarter, and on a comparable basis will lower our sales approximately $15 million to $20 million. Taking all these factors into account, we now expect our comparable store sales in the fourth quarter to come in flat to slightly negative. Our gross margin outlook incorporates the revised lower sales estimate and we also expect the margin softness from Q3 to continue through the balance of the year while we work through our integration.","We expect our fourth quarter gross margin rate to be roughly flat year-over-year. Also, as a reminder, we will anniversary lower incentive compensation expense from our fourth quarter last year, estimated to be an approximate $5 million impact to our fourth quarter this year. All in, we now expect our full-year comparable cash EPS outlook to be $7.75 to $7.90. Our synergy estimates remain unchanged at $45 million to $55 million for the full year, and we expect our full-year estimate of onetime cost to increase from between $91 million and $105 million to now be between $101 million and $120 as a result of the 30 additional store closures announced today. Finally, due to softer operating performance and higher owned inventory, we have made reductions to our capital expenditures and expect to maintain our free cash flow estimate of a minimum of $475 million for the full year.","As we look out to 2016, our priorities will largely remain unchanged. It starts with driving good top line growth, and that must translate into bottom line profit as we focus on delivering against our 12% comparable operating income objective. Despite the current softness in our business, we remain confident as we will begin to annualize many of the significant integration changes from 2015, such as the office consolidations, the field integration changes, the brand and product changeovers and the price harmonization changes.","Also, our G&A and store profitability efforts are in progress as we enter 2016, and we are well-positioned to deliver against our plans. We will be going into the year with stronger availability resulting from our accelerated daily delivery expansion and we're expecting our conversion and consolidation stores to begin hitting their stride. We expect our top line growth to be led by our Commercial business, new store openings, membership programs, as well as continuing to steadily improve our DIY business and focus on continued improvements in our inventory availability. We expect the favorable industry tailwinds experienced this year to largely hold steady in 2016. As outlined previously, we are committed to growing our comparable operating profit to 12% in 2016 by improving our gross profit rate, delivering on our G&A cost reductions, and store productivity improvements in achieving our remaining cost synergies. We will provide a more detailed annual outlook on our fourth quarter call.","In closing, while our third quarter results were unfavorably impacted by the continued demands of the integration, we remain focused on completing the integration and making the necessary changes to the business in order to achieve our objectives. I would also like to take a moment to acknowledge the meaningful contributions that Darren has made to our company over the past 11 years and the commitment he has shown towards driving value for our shareholders, customers, and team members. I would like to finish by thanking our team members once again for what they do every day to serve our customers, inspire our team members, and grow our company.","Operator, we are now ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question comes from Mr. Michael Lasser from UBS. Sir, your line is open.","Michael Louis Lasser - UBS Investment Bank","Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question, and best of luck with everyone on the next phase. My first question is on the disruption that you're seeing from the integration. If you look at your trend \u2013 your comp trend even includes use of the hit from that \u2013 that you saw from excess and compare it to some others in the industry. It appears that the disruption you saw from the integration was greater this quarter than you've seen in the last few quarters, despite the price harmonization being under your belt for several periods. So, what got worse this quarter and how long should we expect that this is going to weigh on the business? Because usually it is more difficult to win business back once you've lost it than it is to lose it?","George E. Sherman - President","Michael, it's George. Thanks for the question. I'll start off with the first portion of the question, which is, what was different this quarter? Was it more difficult from an integration standpoint than previous? And no, not entirely. I think we did see abatement of some of the activities in some areas. It just didn't slow down as much as we thought it was going to do. We have markets under physical construction now as part of the consolidation conversion relocation work. We did have some fill-rate issues that really stems from some systems complexities combined with some new folks working on those systems, and that predominantly was the impact that we had during the quarter. We gave a lot of context on what's happening with the integration, new team members, product lifts. I want to be clear. The integration is not an artificial entity out there hurting Advance Auto Parts. It's our integration. We did it. An integration is entirely about process, pacing and execution. And we control all three of those levers. It's our process that we're executing right now. We've had to change it, we've had to go back to certain areas and redevelop our processes to have less impact on our stores. Where the construction portion is concerned, we feel we've done that. We feel we've made nice progress and that we're doing better market conversions now as we go forward.","From a pacing standpoint, that's an area we're going to have to give some attention to as well. In some areas, like consolidations, we're going to have to go faster in some cases. A CARQUEST store that was not particularly sound beforehand is not going to become so because we bought the company. We need to move those consolidations forward faster, but there's going to be clearly areas that we have to slow down on as well.","We took on an awful lot and I think it's fair to say that it was disruptive to us and perhaps too aggressive in some areas. And then in terms of execution, once again, that's something that we control and that we need to do a better job of. So it really was a combination of in-stock and disruption from the physical aspects of the integration work, but that, again, is something that we own fully. If you look at the \u2013 I'm sorry, Michael. Go ahead.","Michael Louis Lasser - UBS Investment Bank","I was just going to ask how long will it take to have some of these integration challenges alleviated.","George E. Sherman - President","Yes. We certainly expect that we're going to begin to have some significant progress under our belt as we go into 2016, and we're going to cycle some that are going to be significant as well. We're now moving past that period where we made pricing changes. We're about to enter into the period where we began the product lifts. We're about to enter into the period where we began the relabeling. We're about to cycle that time period where we change sales territories. We're about to cycle the timeframe where we changed our leadership structure and our sales territory, so that's coming up very quickly. And again, we can't wait. We're making improvements now on the physical process portion of this and on in-stocks. Certainly, if you find where we have fill-rate issues and get that fixed, it's something that we believe we've already done, as we've seen particularly in the case of CARQUEST fill-rate begin to cross the level of now being better than last year.","I think the other thing, Michael, that gives us a lot of confidence is those markets that are fully through the integration. All the market work is done, the product assortment work is done, they're now finished and have very good results. We're very encouraged by our major markets in Texas, Dallas-Fort Worth, San Antonio and Houston and we've seen pretty significant increase in their comp performance as they've now cleared the major aspects of the integration. And the same is true with Bangor, which has historically been a poor performing market that is now running some high mid-single-digit comps because they're finished with the integration work as well. So our confidence level that when you're through the integration change management you're going to see good business outcomes, that we control aspects of this and can correct quickly, and that we're going to cycle some major events next year, has us optimistic.","Michael Louis Lasser - UBS Investment Bank","Okay. And my quick follow-up is as you look towards next year with a the12% operating margin, how much of that goal is dependent on your sales? So you outlined some productivity metrics and G&A metrics, measures that will get you there, but it sounds like there are elements of achieving that goal that are sales dependent, so to what degree could that be at risk? Thank you.","George E. Sherman - President","Our sales assumptions were modest. And we did that just to make sure that we had a fully achievable goal. So, we did not have aggressive sales assumptions, they were very modest, and we will hit our 12% objective, and that is still well within our sights. With that said, we expect to see revenue growth next year. We certainly expect to see putting more 5X \u2013 stores on 5X delivery, putting more inventory in. Having 10 million Speed Perks members versus less than a million last year at this time. All are going to have an impact on our revenues and we're going to get that back on track.","Michael Louis Lasser - UBS Investment Bank","Okay. Best of luck. Thank you so much.","George E. Sherman - President","Thanks, Michael.","Operator","Our next question comes from the Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Simeon Ari Gutman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks. Good morning. So, there appears to be EBIT margin upside for this business over time. Where that is, I think, is very debatable. But there seems to be some upside. So, given the underperformance that we've seen over the course of this year, especially this quarter, why is 12% in the near term attainable? And in thinking about building something for the future, and I think, George, you mentioned a lot of things about strengthening culture, et cetera, isn't there a risk that you make some near-term decisions here just for the sake of getting to this target in the very near term?","George E. Sherman - President","Simeon, we're very confident in the 12% objective. Again, we do not have aggressive sales assumptions in there as part of it intentionally. And again, I have to repeat, we expect to see revenue increases come. So, we certainly expect to see all the things aligned that we need to get to 12%, and frankly we need to begin to look beyond that as well. So, we're very, very confident in that aspect of our plan.","Michael A. Norona - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yes, Simeon. And let me do this \u2013 let me give you a couple of the buckets that give us confidence. First of all, we talked about our SG&A, and there's two big components of that. There's 45 basis points to 55 basis points of just G&A takeout, nonessential costs, furthest away from the customer, and we started that work and the fact that we leveraged SG&A on a pretty low comp tells you that we're making good progress and we're going to continue that work. That's one bucket.","The second bucket is our store profitability and productivity work, where we're closing stores, we're closing down the underperformers. That will help us improve our operating margins. We're going to close 80 stores by the end of the year and performance-manage those other stores that aren't performing at the same rate and get their rates up. So, that's the second one.","And then the third component is gross margins. We'll leverage our size and scale, get better purchasing synergies, more competitive pricing, global sourcing, private label. We've talked about those areas. And again, those are all areas directly within our control, that we can do to give us confidence that we can get to 12%, building off of what George said.","Simeon Ari Gutman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And my follow-up is, how do you assess some of the temporary market share losses? I think it was a comment mentioned that maybe in some of the transfers from CARQUEST, maybe there was some friction there. So, if you're not retaining that business at the same level, or if you're losing some business, how can you assess that it's temporary? Maybe there was a disruption in service or availability, versus that business going out the door and then getting sticky at some other place?","George E. Sherman - President","Yes, Simeon, some of that loss is just inherent in the consolidations that we're doing. When you have a customer that is doing business with both Advance Auto Parts and CARQUEST, which historically have had different product lines, and you converge those two businesses, and you converge the product lines as part of it, not every customer is comfortable. There are certain lines, certain brands they have done business with their entire careers that they still have an affinity towards. And we know that when those consolidations happen, that there is some share loss potential, and that we have to maximize retention. But not in every case can we get them over the hump to make them move from one product brand to the other. We try, we keep working with that customer, we try to replace that revenue. But that certainly is some share at risk. We're not retaining 100% sales, obviously, when we consolidate those two stores. Some of it is going to the market.","Simeon Ari Gutman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks. Good luck, Darren, and the team.","George E. Sherman - President","Yes. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Horvers of JPMorgan. Sir, your line is open.","Christopher Michael Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks. Good morning. So, one follow-up on the 12% margin target. So, maybe this is a question for Jack. So, that 12% target, which you're expressing a lot of confidence in the management team is, what precludes a potential external CEO from coming in and changing this outlook as we think about next year?","John C. Brouillard - Executive Chairman","Well, thanks for your question, first. We view the 12% as a step along the way to higher performance. And we're confident that we can get to the 12% or beyond next year. It's premature to speculate what somebody who is not here would do. George is here, and George is going to get us to the 12% next year.","Christopher Michael Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Understood. And then, George, question for you. So, as you sit here today, are there strategies that aren't being executed, or tactics or culture changes not being executed, that you think are necessary to accelerate the performance, or is it \u2013 is your view that, basically, what you're doing here today is the right strategy, and it's just a matter of sticking to it and following it through?","George E. Sherman - President","Yes, thank you. I think there's a \u2013 if you look at the integration work, I think we have the right work streams. Again, I think we're very open-minded to the possibility that we went too aggressively on some of them, and created too much competing work streams at the same time. We're going to look at that, we're going to make the appropriate changes.","I also think that, as you look at our organization, and I've said this before, we have to become more and more of a field-led organization. I believe Advance operated on a corporate-out basis for many years, and that, especially as a commercial business, we have got to revolve more around our stores, have more local autonomy, have great local leadership, and have a support center that supports stores and customers every single day. So, that is a cultural shift that we are making, and I think that's a very important one.","I also want to say, and this really goes back to a bit of \u2013 one of Simeon's follow-on questions \u2013 if you look at the 12% plan, we're not going to make foolish decisions to get to 12%. We're not closing stores for the sake of closing stores, for instance. We're closing stores that are full loss positive, that are just a drag on the overall profitability, but frankly, they're a drag on our field leadership. There's a lot of time that's spent exception-managing stores that in some cases, just aren't going to get there.","And then, the last thing I'd say, which I think is very important, and this is a change, we're just going to do fewer things better. We're going to do fewer things better, plain and simple, and we're going to finish them, get them all the way to done. We have sometimes taken on too many projects, had too big of an appetite, and just not executed everything to its full extent. We're going to do fewer things better, and we're going to get them done.","Christopher Michael Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Understood. And then last question. So, just a clarification. That $15 million impact from the New Year's shift, that impacts comp this year, so about 70 basis points. Also now that you're at 2.5 times, do you anticipate starting to execute on the buyback? Thanks.","Michael A. Norona - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yes. So, maybe, I'll take that. Yes, so, the holiday that was in the 53rd week last year, it falls into the 52nd week and it will be a headwind and, yes, it will impact comp. And then, I think your question was on buyback. We've mentioned, at the end of the third quarter, our leverage ratio was at 2.5 times. We stated in the past that we get back to a sustained leverage ratio of 2.5 times, we'd revert back to our previous capital allocation strategy. What we're most proud of is, we got back to 2.5 times, and we got back there. We said we were going to do it, we did it. And we did it a little bit earlier than we had planned. This now puts us in a position to revert back to our previous allocation policy. Historically, we prioritize growth as the first use of our capital, and we've also effectively used buybacks to create shareholder value. So, we'll consider these options as part of our capital allocation as we go forward. And, most importantly, we'll continue to maintain our disciplined approach to capital deployment to maximize shareholder value.","Christopher Michael Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Understood. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Greg Melich from Evercore ISI. Sir, your line is open.","Greg Melich - Evercore ISI Institutional Equities","Thanks. I want to follow up on supply chain and getting in-stocks improved and some of the things I think you mentioned in your prepared comments, George. If I remember correctly, you have combined about 50 DCs, and there was meant to be a plan later last year as which ones to consolidate and when. Then you had some changes there. Do we have a plan now as to how many DCs we're going to have and where they're going to be, as we are starting to figure out which stores to close?","George E. Sherman - President","Yes, we do, Greg. And we continue to work through that. And the long and short of it is that, we have some landlord issues with some of the legacy CARQUEST distribution centers. The negotiations with those landlords will continue at least through the end of the year. That impacts our ability to make some of the changes that we've wanted to. What I can tell you is, we have signed a lease for a new facility in Nashville, so we'll be opening up what we consider to be our go-forward state-of-the-art DC in Nashville in 2017. But, we're still working through some works and negotiations that will \u2013 and at that point, we'll be able to be a bit more transparent on what the exact changes are.","Greg Melich - Evercore ISI Institutional Equities","And then, I guess a follow-on to that would be, you found 50 stores about three months ago, and now found another 30. Understanding that it's hard to identify what the stores would be, sort of conceptually, from the top down, should we be thinking that if 10% of the stores were over 100 bps of the comp miss, I think I heard that, that ultimately the number of stores that we should be rationalizing measures \u2013 it could be like, say, 500, given that's about 10% of the store base. Am I thinking about that the right way?","George E. Sherman - President","No, I wouldn't make that linear connection. I think if you look at that group of stores, 400 and some odd stores, clearly some of them are going to fall into the consolidation work that's been accelerated. Some are going to be closures and some are simply going to be exception-managed. So not all stores are bad stores on that list, they're just not performing correctly. So, yes, some of them will be addressed via actions we're taking in the fourth quarter; all will be addressed by some level of exception-management by our field team.","Greg Melich - Evercore ISI Institutional Equities","Great. Well good luck there, George and Mike. Hope you enjoy retirement Darren and good luck. Look forward to following up.","Darren R. Jackson - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Greg.","Operator","Our next question comes from Seth Basham of Wedbush Securities. Your line is open.","Seth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Thanks a lot and good morning. First of all, good luck, Darren. It was great working with you.","Darren R. Jackson - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Seth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","My first question revolves around what's going on with brands in the stores. George, you alluded to brands that weren't resonating with commercial customers. As you go forward, do you think you have the right set of brands? Do you think you'll make some significant changes?","George E. Sherman - President","Yes, Seth, we're very confident in our brand mix, and really we don't have any brands that are being questioned. Broadly, we're happy with the house of brands that we've built and broadly, but more importantly, our customer base is as well. That doesn't mean 100% agreement. There's always some outliers there. We switched from KYB to Monroe in ride control in CARQUEST stores. There's always going to be some KYB loyalists out there, but they're the minority. So, by and large, we're very, very pleased with the brand selection that we've built, but there's going to be some outliers.","Seth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Okay. Fair enough. And then following up on Greg's question regarding the 10% of stores that were pretty impactful to your comps, was there a common theme among them besides just weak performance? Was there some regional concentration, some systems issues, some distribution issues associated with those?","George E. Sherman - President","Yes. I mean, the most common theme, Seth, is Midwest. The majority of them tend to be concentrated in the Midwest. Now there's a mix of rural and urban. They're generally older stores, a few of our new stores that are in the seven, eight year range are in there as well. But that's the most common thread is that they're Midwestern by nature and just a combination of both CARQUEST and Advance stores. And if you look at the closures, it's almost a split.","Seth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Got it. Okay, thank you very much and good luck.","Darren R. Jackson - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scot Ciccarelli of RBC Capital Markets. Sir, your line is open.","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi, guys. Two questions. First, Mike, can you explain what you mean by higher inventory expenses that impacted gross margin? I'm not sure if there's a nuance there. And second, I guess this is for George. George, can you give us an example of why commercial disruption would have been more severe in the third quarter than say the first when the changes were already implemented? Because in theory, you would think the integration disruption should be moderating and not accelerating. I guess I'm just not following why we've seen that deterioration.","Michael A. Norona - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yes. Hey, Scot. I'll start. So what we mean by that is as we've talked about, we're doing lots of product changeovers and we're doing consolidations and conversions. And whenever you do that, you're moving a lot of inventory around. And what we mean by inventory expenses, there's a couple of areas as we had some core value adjustments in relation to some of our vendors and we also had some defective inventory. We think those are short-term items as we work through some of those items, but we think they're short-term, and our outlook reflects that in Q4, but we believe those are short-term.","George E. Sherman - President","On the commercial side I think we're just seeing a lag impact here that's been building during the course of the year. So we're now in full stride in terms of doing the market work, so there's a bit more going on market by market. And again, we've mentioned that there have been some fill-rate issues that certainly is the business that we're in, but it's on the rise now and we believe we're working our way through it.","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Mike, just a follow-up. You talk about defectives, inventory, et cetera. Whether you know it or not initially, are you guys sitting on a bunch of inventory that needs to get marked down, cleared, sent back to vendors, et cetera?","George E. Sherman - President","No.","Michael A. Norona - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","No. What I would tell you, Scot, is whenever you're doing a lot of inventory movement, you're going to run into a few issues. With defectives you're going to run into returns back to vendors. We don't go into our programs with vendors on the phone here. But we ran into a few issues with defectives, higher than we planned, and I think that's what it is. It was a little bit higher than we planned. But we'll work through that. And the other thing that impacted our gross margin is we had about $5 million when we annualized the Hartford costs that weren't there last year.","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Right. I'll follow-up after. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mr. Matt Fassler of Goldman Sachs. Sir, your line is open.","Matthew Jeremy Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks a lot and good morning. My first question relates to the move to a common platform, presumably common systems platform at your corporate offices. If you could talk about what the challenges in getting that finalized have meant tangibly for the business, what your people have a harder time doing, and once that's fully addressed, how you think that will enhance operating results, please.","George E. Sherman - President","Yes, Matt, I had a couple of things that are the three biggest projects that we're working on right now. We have two sets of catalogs across our store operations. As you know, the Commercial business works out of a catalog day in and day out. Advance's has been more of a legacy system and we don't have shared communication between those two catalogs yet. We'll pilot that in Q1 of next year towards the end of the first quarter. The biggest one is the integrated availability project which connects the inventory and sales systems between the stores and the distribution centers. That's our work in progress and that's what keeps us on two different sets of both merchandising and replenishment systems. So the biggest impact from that is you have two replenishment teams effectively, one work a legacy CARQUEST system that's proprietary and one work a more mainstream replenishment system. Obviously, the latter is easier to staff for. We can go find folks that have worked on these systems before. It's fairly commonplace. For the CARQUEST system, it's not. So it is difficult from a training standpoint, a little bit of a longer ramp-up for the team. So the change going forward is when we complete that work we will migrate to one replenishment team across the whole company. We'll be on systems that are plainly understood by anybody in replenishment business we'll be in a much, much better place.","Matthew Jeremy Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.","What is the timing for getting those issues resolved in your view?","George E. Sherman - President","There's a domino effect in terms of how these initiatives have to be sequenced. The catalog, again, begins in Q1 of next year. The point-of-sale system launches, which is the dependency as well, in the third quarter of next year toward the second half of next year, and at the same time we're ready to start the pilot integrated availability project.","Matthew Jeremy Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. By the way a follow-up on this point very quickly, I know this has come up a bit before. It sounds like the complexity of what you're trying to do is very significant. How do you drive that with taking G&A dollars out of the organization above and beyond the synergies that you initially contemplated associated with the deal? Presumably you hit a lot of the obvious redundancies there. Does it make it harder to tackle this degree of difficulty if you're simultaneously trying to take out more head count?","George E. Sherman - President","No. There's a small impact. I will tell you that if you look at where dual systems impact staffing or impact G&A, it is pretty simple. It's on our accounting team, it's on our replenishment team and, to a small degree, it's on our IT team. That's the extent of it. So that is a measurable, fairly finite, relatively in the overall scheme of things small amount of G&A. And we have a large opportunity. So we are able to do what we said we were going to do with the 12% work, cut our costs back. We're keenly aware of that. We're very focused on it. We've made good progress on that but we have more to do. But we have a pretty good handle on when the timing is that we can take that additional G&A out and how much it is and it's not overly material.","Matthew Jeremy Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. One very quick other question on the numbers. So there's a bit of noise from Worldpac this quarter. There's FX, obviously the CARQUEST business is under some pressure. I'm not sure if we're able to look at the business this way anymore, but if you were to isolate legacy Advance stores and think about the underlying same-store sales local currency that you think you're generating from the parts of the business that are least impacted, least damaged certainly, by the work that you're doing, any sense as to where those might be running?","George E. Sherman - President","Yes. If you look at the better performing elements, it is the Southeast and Northeastern U.S. and certainly markets that we mentioned, like Texas, that have improved and done a good job. They're either \u2013 in the case of Texas, you're through the integration. In the case of the Southeast, you really haven't begun too much of the heavy lifting of it yet. So, those are markets that are all performing from a comp standpoint better than the rest of the organization.","As for Worldpac, Worldpac was a tailwind to comps for the first half of the year, and really for the better part of the first two quarters almost entirely. That is just the buildup of new branches. So, we said we're going to open up 12 new Worldpac branches this year. In the first quarter, that number was small enough that they were still able to drive some good comp growth. By the end of the second quarter, and now the third quarter, you're up to nine branches opened. So, the movement of customers has become much more significant. The growth story is tremendous. But, it's become a bit of a headwind in terms of comps.","Matthew Jeremy Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Thank you. And, Darren, all the best to you.","Darren R. Jackson - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Matt.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dan Wewer of Raymond James. Sir, your line is open.","Dan R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thank you. Jack, I wanted to ask you about Starboard's position. What was the thought process in their receiving three board positions, given they own less than 4% of the company?","And then, second, as part of their presentation on September 30th, they called it unlocking value. They make a case for selling the Worldpac division, given that it's getting lost in the Advance organization. Now, with Worldpac beginning to see cannibalization impacts on same store sales, what are your thoughts about their proposal of perhaps putting that business up for sale?","John C. Brouillard - Executive Chairman","Well, let me start with the second part of your question and thanks for your question. Worldpac is a strategic asset of the company and one of the highest potential growth vehicles that we have. So, there is no current feeling that we should not keep Worldpac and grow Worldpac. As far as the involvement now with Starboard and Jeff on the board, we've had a number of meetings and conversations with Jeff and his team and personally our entire board has been impressed with Jeff's approach to business. And he has a definite commitment to excellence and, importantly, he's willing and able and going to learn our business in a deep way, to the point of visiting stores and getting to really know the business. All of that is going to bring a fresh perspective to us. And we think it's going to be good for the company and all of our shareholders.","Dan R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our final question today comes from Mike Baker of Deutsche Bank. Sir, your line is open.","Mike Baker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thanks. Couple of questions. Just to clarify. So, this year, it looks like you're reducing your implied margin guidance by about 40 basis points to 50 basis points from what it otherwise would have been in your previous EPS guidance. Yet, you're keeping the 12% for next year. So, is the implication there that you just think the issues right now are timing and that you're going to make it all back up at some point next year? Is that the right interpretation?","George E. Sherman - President","Yes, it is, Mike.","Mike Baker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, well, then I guess to follow-up on the timing question, I heard a couple things. In some ways you said you went too fast, so you have to slow things down. Bit off more than you can chew. On the other hand, there are a couple of instances where you are talking about accelerating the pace and going even faster. So, I'm trying to reconcile those two things. Some areas you went too fast, some areas not fast enough? Can you help me put those together?","George E. Sherman - President","Yes, that's correct. And I'll give an example of an area where we think that going faster might be the right thing to do for the business. We've laid on a consolidation timeline that goes for several years. If you look at some of the stores that we're scheduled to consolidate in the later half of 2016, they're just not performing well. They become a drag on the business, and they're just \u2013 we knew that they would have a good financial outcome when they consolidated, but right now as a stand-alone business, it's a drag on comp, it's a drag on profitability and it's, again, tough on our field leadership team. So, we're pulling those things forward. We think that's a healthy change for the business and we know that we have a team that can do that consolidation work. It's not construction, this time. You're now moving the team into another store and shutting down the building that we're capable of taking that on and taking some destruction out of the system. On the flip side, there's some more process-based work that centers as well as the stores that we think we can back off the pacing on.","Mike Baker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, that makes sense. One more, if I could ask. You spoke about understanding or acknowledging there's some \u2013 I guess Mike specifically spoke about acknowledging there's some structural issues between you guys and the other guys in terms of mix, customer mix, et cetera. In your internal thoughts, what do you think the structural differences are and can you quantify that? In other words, maybe you can't get to the other guys 18% to 19% margins, but where ultimately do you think you can get?","Michael A. Norona - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","We're going to build a view internally of where we think we can go as an organization and work our way backwards. Clearly, I think you know some of the structural differences. There's differences in our leased versus owned versus some of our competitors that has a difference. We acknowledge we have a ways to go in terms of closing this gap. We've set 12% out there as the first objective to begin to get there. We know that there's space well beyond that. We're going to come to our own internal conclusion on what that number is and again work our way backwards.","Mike Baker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thanks for the time on the call and the color. I appreciate it.","Operator","At this time there are no further questions. I will turn the call back to Zaheed Mawani for any final comments.","Zaheed Mawani - Vice President, Finance Planning, Analysis and Investor Relations","Thank you, Cheryl, and thanks to the audience for participating in our third quarter earnings conference call. That concludes our call. Thank you.","Operator","That concludes your call today. You may now disconnect. Thank you for joining us."],"622":["Advance Auto Parts, Inc.

I\u2019m joined by Tom Greco, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jeff Shepherd, our Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer.

The content of this call will be governed by the information contained in our earnings release and related financial statements.","Now, let me turn the call over to Tom Greco.","Tom Greco","Thanks, Elizabeth. Good morning. And thank you for joining us today to discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2018 results.","This was an exciting year for Advance, and I want to personally thank the entire Advance team and our network of Carquest Independent for their unwavering commitment, focus and dedication to deliver meaningful progress toward our long-term strategic objectives throughout the year.","In the fourth quarter, net sales increased 3.3% to $2.1 billion and comparable store sales were up 3.4%. Our adjusted operating income margin of 6%, increased 45 basis points, compared to the prior year quarter, and our adjusted earnings per share increased 51.9% to $1.17.","Regarding our full year 2018 performance. Our net sales increased 2.2% to $9.6 billion, and we delivered 2.3% increase in comparable store sales, our strongest annual growth rate since the acquisition of GPI. Adjusted operating income margin increased 51 basis points year-over-year to 7.8% and our free cash flow was $617 million, an increase of $206 million year-over-year. Jeff will speak to our financial results for the quarter and the full year in more detail, shortly.","The continuous improvement we delivered throughout 2018 would not have been possible without our more than 70,000 team members, truly living our cultural beliefs everyday and reinforcing our mission, Passion for Customers, Passion for Yes! The hard work we've completed to-date is building the foundation we need to win over the long term. Specifically, in the fourth quarter, I'm very pleased with the consistent, balanced improvement throughout AAP on nearly every metric. Both our north and south divisions delivered positive comp sales with geographical growth led by our Mid-Atlantic, Carolinas, Gulf Coast, Appalachian, and Northeast regions.","From a category perspective, we saw strong sales in brakes, engine management, oil and filters and undercar. As we discussed last quarter, we're seeing meaningful improvements in key metrics across the enterprise, driving growth in both our professional and DIY businesses. In the fourth quarter, for the first time in recent history, our DIY business outcomped the professional business as our omnichannel initiatives continue to strengthen our customer value proposition for DIYers.","Turning to professional, we delivered growth across all professional businesses in both the fourth quarter and full year 2018, led by growth in Worldpac and our Carquest independence. We remain focused on our commitment to deliver our best-in-class experience for our professional customers. With this objective front and center, we're building new capabilities to strengthen our partnerships with customers, ensuring future success for both their business and AAP. For example, with the launch of our unified professional portal, MyAdvance in August, we're integrating multiple formally disparate online tools in a one stop shop. This includes our AdvancedPro catalog, eServices suite, training resources, customer support, and many other value added tools for professional customers.","As a result, usage of this platform increased over 50% in Q4. This unique Advance tool differentiates us from our competitors and provides a single location for our industry-leading product assortment as well as training and business solution advice.","Expanding on our DIY omnichannel performance, we made significant investments in our online engagement and fulfillment platforms to further enhance the customer experience. We improved customer engagement by increasing page load speed, streamlining search capabilities and increasing customizations based on customers\u2019 vehicles and search inputs.","We're also leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning tools to improve our online attachment selling as well as product assortment. The significant investments we're making in our website are enabling improved customer confidence and that they are getting the right part for the job.","If they buy online and pick up in store, our knowledgeable team members are available to provide trusted advice to our customers and ensure they have the complete and correct parts to get the job done.","Aligned with our omnichannel focus, we're excited about the progress we've made with our recently announced Walmart partnership, which will significantly extend our reach to DIY customers and help drive market share growth for AAP. We've appointed a senior leader to lead the partnership, and we're building a talented team to work together with our Walmart partners to launch and grow this business. We're off to a strong start with the AAP and Walmart team members working all together and focused on delivering a compelling value proposition for DIYers.","We're on track to begin rolling out our plans in the first half of this year. This will include the launch of a broad assortment of our industry-leading parts. Customers will be able to have the part shipped to their home in the first phase of the rollout, while phase 2 will enable buy online and pickup today in an Advance store.","Finally, last year, we introduced three key elements of our end-to-end supply chain and footprint optimization strategy, first, a market-by-market approach to drive share; second, repurchasing our in-market store and asset base; and third, optimizing our distribution centers. Overall, I'm pleased with the progress we've made to improve our footprint over the last year. We're improving share performance through a market-by-market approach which in 2018 included 14 new Worldpac branch openings. We expect to continue this momentum in \u201819 to further strengthen our customer value proposition and gain share.","In addition, we closed and consolidated 101 stores during 2018. Consistent with previous quarters, we are approaching store closures very differently than in the past. Most importantly, our team is laser-focused on retaining our top-performing team members and ensuring that we maintain sales through the transfer to other AAP locations.","Regarding optimizing our distribution centers, I'm pleased with our team's successful execution in closing our Gallman and San Antonio distribution centers in 2018. We're in the process of closing our Columbia, South Carolina Distribution Center and are on track to complete this in the first half of 2019.","We're thrilled with Reuben Slone joining our leadership team as we continue to make progress on supply chain. While we have significant opportunities to improve supply chain execution, we did increase transparency and collaboration between supply chain and other functions such as store operations and merchandising.","We also rolled out, new tools and technology in the fourth quarter, including our delivery dashboard, which leverages telematics and improves accuracy and reliability of pro delivery for our customers. In summary, I'm confident in the supply chain team's ability to further improve execution in 2019 and deliver on our long-term goals, including the optimization of our entire distribution network.","Finally, I'm pleased to report we published our inaugural Corporate Sustainability and Social Report in December and posted it on our website. This report highlights our progress in three primary areas within our ESG agenda, people; planet; and community. Once again, we made progress on people and culture in 2018 as we further increased diversity representation in leadership roles. We continued to invest in frontline team members through our field of frontline incentive program with more than 15,000 grants to-date.","Fuel the Frontline remains a unique program within our industry and broader retail. There is no question that this has been a driver of increased retention of our top performers in key store operations positions.","We also appointed a world-class environmental, health and safety leader, Mike Miller. Mike's built a talented team and launched several safety initiatives driving meaningful improvements including a 10% reduction in the number of reportable incidents and an additional 13% reduction in our collision frequency rate.","In terms of environmental, we reduced our greenhouse gas emissions by 7%. Long-term, we expect our environmental health and safety agenda will drive significant productivity. In terms of community, we elevated our involvement in our communities by playing leadership roles in national organizations such as JDRF, the American Heart Association, and Building Homes for Heroes, an organization who constructs new homes for veterans and their families returning to the U.S.","While we\u2019ve delivered progress in each of these critical areas to-date, we\u2019ve recognized we have responsibility to do more. I look forward to continuing our momentum ensuring future updates on these efforts.","In summary, performance improvements across the enterprise in 2018, translated to accelerated growth. As we\u2019ve said previously, we continue to be encouraged by the improving macro indicators for the auto parts industry and are confident in our ability to deliver top-line growth, margin expansion and strong cash flow in 2019.","With that, I'll turn it over to Jeff for details on our financial performance and our 2019 outlook.","Jeff Shepherd","Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. I want to begin by thanking the entire Advance team for their dedication throughout 2018. In Q4, the team\u2019s discipline enabled meaningful improvement across the business. Our adjusted gross profit was $930 million, an increase of 6.4% from the prior year quarter. On a linked basis, our adjusted gross profit margin of 44.2% improved by a 127 basis points from the prior year quarter. The drivers of this increase were the result of productivity initiatives including MCO, inventory efforts to better position existing inventory throughout our supply chain and reduce shrink. These improvements were partially offset by commodity and tariff headwinds versus the prior year quarter.","The good news is, we see minimal impact on units as a result of commodity and tariff related cost increases. And to-date we've been successful passing on any increases through pricing actions.","We continue to work closely with our supplier partners to negotiate pricing and minimize impact to our customers. Our adjusted SG&A was $802 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of $43 million year-over-year. As a percentage of net sales, our adjusted SG&A increased by 82 basis points to 38.1%. The majority of this increase was driven by higher bonus expense, which we expect to normalize in 2019.","We also increased spending related to our new marketing campaign, including an acceleration of digital capabilities. Additionally, our last mile delivery expenses were higher due to increased fuel and transportation expenses, which include increased costs related to cross-banner visibility. While this capability is clearly enabling stronger top-line performance, we have significant opportunity to improve efficiencies.","And finally, third-party services and contract fees were higher in the quarter, directly correlated to the increased capital spend. These headwinds were partially offset by further reduction in our insurance and claims expenses due to improved safety performance as well as lower rent and occupancy costs.","Adjusted operating income in the fourth quarter was $127 million, an 11.7% increase from the fourth quarter of 2017. Our adjusted operating income margin increased 45 basis points to 6% in the quarter. Consistent with the quarterly ramp in capital spending throughout 2018, our CapEx in Q4 was $89 million, bringing our full year spend to a $194 million.","More than 65% of Q4 spend was related to information technology and supply chain projects. Our IT initiatives include critical system investments, addressing longstanding integration opportunities and lack of capabilities. We've officially started the integration of all banners and moved to a single payroll system on January 1st. Our finance team also launched our ERP project to integrate our back office systems, which will happen over the next two years. As Reuben and his team work to improve existing supply chain operations, we invested in network upgrades, including wireless access and handheld scanners to improve accuracy and efficiencies within the distribution centers.","For the full year 2018, net sales were $9,581 million, an increase of 2.2% compared to 2017. And comp sales were 2.3%, a significant improvement over our 2017 performance. Adjusted gross profit for the year increased 3.5% to $4.2 billion and adjusted gross profit margin increased 53 basis points to 44.1%. Adjusted SG&A for the year increased 2.3% to $3.5 billion. On a rate basis, our full-year adjusted SG&A was 36.3%, which was flat year-over-year and in line with previously discussed expectations.","We delivered a 9.3% increase in adjusted operating income for the full year to $750.2 million. Adjusted operating income margin was 7.8%, an increase of 51 basis points. Full-year operating cash flow increased by $210 million to $811 million and free cash flow improved by $206 million to $617 million.","Because of several factors, we increased inventory more than originally planned in 2018, resulting in free cash flow slightly below our November projection. The primary drivers for the increase year-over-year in addition to higher sales were first, as we are beginning to implement dynamic assortment, we found some gaps in our current coverage. Consistent with our commitment to putting the customer first, we increased inventory purchases in Q4 to mitigate these gaps and potential risk for the successful rollout of dynamic assortment in Q1. Dynamic assortment will significantly improve how we forward deploy inventory and expect that when fully implemented, will enable higher turns. Second, as sales trended higher, we were focused on improving store in-stocks, resulting in higher purchases to ensure replenishment capabilities throughout our supply chain. Third is related to 14 new world-class branches that were opened in 2018 as well as purchases to support planned openings in the first quarter of 2019.","With all that said, we remain committed to optimizing our inventory over the next several years, while maintaining our customer first focus and improving our assortment across the enterprise.","Our disciplined approach to managing cash and delivering on our capital allocation priorities this year resulted in an AP ratio of 72.7% to end 2018, an improvement of 329 basis points year-over-year. In addition to this notable progress, we delivered a 13.8% return on invested capital, which was a 90 basis-point improvement compared to the prior year. In line with our financial priorities to maintain an investment grade rating, investment in the business and opportunistically return capital to shareholders, we repurchased a $153 million worth of Advance stock during the fourth quarter. We're confident in our ability to generate cash flow from the business and committed to the opportunistic return of cash to shareholders. As such, subsequent to year-end, we repurchased $127 million worth of Advance stock at an average price of $159.65. Our guidance and forecast do not include any additional repurchases at this time.","Additionally, last month, we announced the early redemption of our $300 million 2020 notes using available cash on hand. We're confident in our ability to generate cash flow from the business and drive shareholder value, while keeping to our financial priorities.","We are pleased with what we were able to deliver in both the fourth quarter and full year, but recognize that we still have work to do to capitalize on the significant opportunity ahead. As we continue with disciplined execution of our strategic objectives in 2019, we're confident we will deliver further improvements this year.","In 2019, we expect to deliver net sales or 9.65 to $9.8 billion with comparable store sales in the range of 1% to 2.5%. We expect adjusted operating income margin expansion in a range of 20 to 60 basis points, which includes operating expenses related to a continued ramp in investments in IT, supply chain and marketing in a range of 80 to $120 million in 2019.","We estimate our CapEx in the range of $250 million to $300 million this year, of which more than two-thirds is focused on technology, e-commerce and supply chain investments. In line with our continuing transformation agenda in 2019, we estimate integration and transformation expenses of 80 to a $100 million this year, which includes approximately $15 million related to further optimization of our store footprint. Our 2019 tax rate is expected to be 24% to 26%. Finally, we remain disciplined in our cash management and focused on improving cash flow. For 2019, we expect to deliver minimum free cash flow of $650 million.","In summary, from a financial perspective, we're pleased with where we ended 2018, but as Tom said, we need to continue our momentum and remain laser-focused on flawless execution in the short term while making the appropriate investments at both CapEx and OpEx to deliver our long-term objectives. We're optimistic about 2019 and look forward to sharing future successes as we continue executing on our strategic plans. ","With that, let\u2019s open it up to addressing your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Xian Siew","Hi guys. This is Xian Siew on for Simeon. So, guidance sounds maybe a little bit conservative, and you've talked about mid teens EBIT margins over time, which would represent significant gains from here. A range of 20 to 60 is encouraging. But we were just kind of wondering, is the journey maybe taking -- going to take a little bit longer to reach over time or should we expect faster progress some point soon?","Tom Greco","Good morning. We feel pretty good about the progress we made in 2018 in driving top-line growth and expanding margins at the same time. This is something that the old AAP had difficulty with and we're happy that we were able to do both, last year. The productivity focus in \u201818 drove margin expansion in \u201818, and we feel that the material cost optimization, supply chain productivity and zero-based budgeting will continue to help us at the productivity. There are some offsetting investments in 2019 which will limit margin expansion. And we feel these investments are critical to our success. And they're going to really differentiate us over the long term. They'll do one of two things. They'll either unlock future cost savings or drive top-line growth.","And in our prepared remarks, you heard Jeff talk about a range of $80 million to $120 million of OpEx investment in 2019. That by itself is around a full point of margin expansion in \u201819 that we're reinvesting back in the business in order to drive long-term growth. They are focused in three areas, the OpEx investments, first of all, technology and e-commerce; secondly, in our people, primarily in supply chain; and third, in marketing. And I'm happy to go deeper into each of these areas, but the net of it is, in 2019, we'll drive significant productivity and expand margins and drive our top-line growth, while making important necessary investments to drive the long-term growth of the company.","Xian Siew","Thank you. And then, just to follow up on that. Can you just remind us where the biggest upside will come from? Longer term, what's the biggest kind of opportunity, is it inefficiency on the margins or more of the sales productivity?","Tom Greco","We obviously have both. I mean, we think we can drive shareholder value through a combination of performing at or above the rate of growth of the industry, which is very healthy right now in that 3% range. And we also believe we can drive significant margin expansion. So, both of those play a key role in the overall trajectory of our financials.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Horvers with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open. ","Chris Horvers","Thanks. Good morning, guys. Can you talk about the margin guide for this year? How should we be thinking about the cadence? Do you think it's going to be more front half versus back half weighted? You have to annualize some investments and expenses from last year, this past year as well. And in terms of the components, how should we think about gross margin leverage versus SG&A?","Jeff Shepherd","Yes. Hey, good morning, Chris. As we think overall for the year, the margin is going to be -- we're going to see steady improvement throughout the year. In terms of the margin breakdown between SG&A and gross margin, we think we're going to be flat on a rate basis on our SG&A. So, as you recall, in 2018, we came in at 36.3%. Right now, we're modeling with those OpEx investments that we talked about in both prepared remarks and in the color we just gave on the previous question that that will keep us flat on a rate basis. So, that's the way we're thinking about it.","Chris Horvers","Understood. And then, in terms of the share repurchase opportunity. Can you sort of square up how you think about that use of free cash flow? You have the debt pay down coming, $300 million in the first quarter. How do you think about the opportunity for share repurchases in 2019?","Jeff Shepherd","Yes. And just to remind you, our capital allocation priorities have remained unchanged from 2018, which is to maintain that investment grade rating, reinvest in the business. We talked about the increase in the capital expenditures we expect in 2019. This is going to be a range of $250 to $300 million. And then, opportunistically repurchasing shares are giving excess cash back to our shareholders. Since we had our revised repurchase plan, we repurchased $400 million worth of shares. And we're going to continue to be opportunistic with that. We don't have anything in our guidance currently, but we're going to continue to be opportunistic and look at those opportunities to return excess cash to our shareholders.","Chris Horvers","Understood. And last question, Tom, can you talk about how you're thinking about the supply chain integration? You have multiple phases, I think, three phases going on currently. How do you think about the time to complete those different supply chain projects? Thank you.","Tom Greco","Sure, Chris? Well, Reuben Slone, as you know, came in, in the fourth quarter, and Reuben was on our Board. He's brought a new dimension to our thinking. He was very familiar with what we were doing. I think, he's really building momentum to ramp up execution in our supply chain. He's focused on a very rigorous standardization of the core processes. So, it's important to note that I feel really good about the progress we're making on the execution, just the basic blocking and tackling within our supply chain.","The three big elements of our supply chain strategy haven't changed, to your point. The first one is building a market by market DMA plan. And I think, we've completed a thorough review of every market in the country. We plan to leverage really the entire enterprise\u2019s supply chain infrastructure. The goal here is to drive share obviously, expand our margins, drive cash flow for each market, based on the size of the opportunity going forward within our existing footprint.","Secondly, you heard us talk about DC optimization. We have more DCs than we need. We're in the process of executing our pretty disciplined plan to optimize the network. We completed the closures of our Gallman and San Antonio DC at the end of 2018, and we're on track to close our Columbia, South Carolina DC during the first half of 2019, and you'll see us continue this optimization work going forward.","Finally, in terms of our in-store, in market store and asset optimization. This is also well underway and it\u2019s performing very well. Here, we look at the entirety of the in-market asset base including Advance and Carquest DCs, Advance Super Hubs and hubs, Worldpac branches, AutoPart International stores, and of course, our Advance and Carquest stores, both corporate and independent. And once we're clear on with the entirety of this asset bases and how to best to sort and connect these assets, we then look to optimize. And with this as a backdrop, we did a great job executing store closures last year. We're exceeding the goals we established across the board. And in 2018, we closed and consolidated and 101 stores and opened about 14 Worldpac branches. So, we plan to take a similar approach in 2019. And I feel really good about how we're executing. I'm confident it's going to get better under Reuben\u2019s leadership.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Lasser with UBS. Your line is open.","Michael Lasser","Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. As you look out over the longer run, do you expect that DIY and CISM business to be more similar in terms of growth rate? Why do you think -- what drove the difference this quarter?","Tom Greco","Well, first of all, from an industry standpoint, Michael, we expect professional to outperform DIY. The industry leading indicators are really strong this year, as you know. The big ones that we found GDP being positive, the car park is going to go up, vehicle miles driven is growing. And then, of course, vehicles in the sweet spot is the big one that we're seeing growth this year, will be up a couple of points this year on vehicles in the sweet spot. Of course, that vehicle is in that 6 to 11-year old population. And that's a real positive for the industry overall. That number, as you know, was down in 2017 and then roughly flat last year. So, we're seeing a positive trend in the vehicles in the sweet spot. And that tends to benefit the professional side a little bit more. Obviously with cars getting more complicated, that benefits the professional size. So, we expect professional to grow a little bit above the rate of growth of DIY, call it 4% to 5%, and DIY in the low single digit range.","All that said, we're really pleased with the performance of our DIY business in the most recent quarter. It is the first time, as we said in our prepared remarks that DIY outcomped our professional business. Our advertising, Think Ahead, Think Advance helped us for sure. Our field team is executing well in the stores; we're driving units per transaction. And obviously, the omnichannel effort is helping us. So, all of those things are helping our internal performance on DIY on a macro level, though we would expect professional to perform higher than DIY over time. And that's how we\u2019ve modeled our own business as well.","Michael Lasser","And to start the quarter as the weather has been really funky, can you give us some sense how the business performed quarter-to-date?","Tom Greco","We feel great about where we are year-to-date. Obviously, it's winter, and it's been volatile. The tax refunds are little bit late but we clearly like our performance on a year-to-date basis. And I really like the progress on our execution. If you consider our professional business, we're seeing a close rate go up; our cross-banner sourcing continues to gain momentum; on the DIY omnichannel side, we continue to drive awareness so we Think Ahead, Think Advance, we\u2019ve seen a nice uptick there. And then, we're getting better and managing the cost side of things as well. So, all of those things are positive for us on a quarter-to-date basis.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Scot Ciccarelli","Good morning, guys, Scot Ciccarelli. Question about the incremental OpEx you guys outlined. Do you envision the investments that you highlighted as really just a 2019 event or is it recognition that you need to continue to invest in the business to position it where you want to be over the longer term?","Tom Greco","Let me start and I'll take it over to Jeff to talk about the longer term. But, first of all, in \u201819, there is a couple of areas that we're investing in, Scot. If you talk about technology and e-commerce, that's by far the biggest investment that we're making. It's over half. Examples here are largely integration related. So, getting to one payroll system, getting to one back office system, getting to a single warehouse management systems. These are large technology-related platforms that we're implementing across the enterprise, and really simplify the business and reduce complexity in our cost base. In these cases, we have IT, OpEx expense in 2019 without the commensurate cost takeout as we design and implement the new system. So, we fully expect to remove these costs sometime in the future, obviously when we're able to retire the old way of doing things, whether that's our payroll or our ERP system.","Secondly, in terms of people, you'll recall, we had a crisis in terms of turnover on our frontline organization and store operations a couple years ago. We've now addressed that; our turnover is down. And this year, we're making a similar wage investment in our supply chain team to do the very same thing in our distribution centers to drive the turnover down there. And then, third, in marketing, we've been building our brand, both in DIY and professional. I talked about the advertising campaign. As we continue to see the marketing campaign drive our comps and obviously lift our sales growth above the industry average, we're going to continue to invest. If we don't like the returns there, we can certainly meter it back. But, these three areas represent the vast majority of our OpEx investment in \u201819.","And I\u2019ll let Jeff talk a little bit about the future.","Jeff Shepherd","Yes, sure. And just in terms of that detail that Tom just provided, some of those clearly have longer tails than others. But we do think this type of investment we're going to see not only in \u201819 but also in the in the 2020. And then, we\u2019d expect these to normalize after that.","Scot Ciccarelli","Got it. Okay, very helpful. And then, just a housekeeping item. Can you tell us what the impact of inflation was in the fourth quarter?","Tom Greco","Yes. It was about 2 points on a per unit basis, Scot.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Dan Wewer with Raymond James. Your line is open. ","Dan Wewer","Thanks. First question I had relates to transformation charges. How many additional years beyond 2019 will you continue to set up a line item farthest? And does it continue until the Company reaches that 14%, 15% EBITDA rate?","Tom Greco","Yes. Hey, Dan. In terms of the transformation, you are seeing it start to ramp down. But again, as we continue with the integration, we just talked about on some of the previous questions, we'll will certainly going to see it in \u201819, and I would expect to continue to see it into \u201820. After that, I think it would be fairly de minimis at that point.","Dan Wewer","And then, a second question, you talked about the acceleration and your do-it--yourself revenue is exceeding commercial. I know that you seem to be a little more aggressive with a 20% off promotions on your e-commerce offer. Can you talk about what that\u2019s contributed to your do-it-yourself sales growth?","Tom Greco","Well, we're certainly seeing strong growth in our e-commerce business. About 70% of the transactions whether they're DIY, online or retail then start on a mobile device now. So, you really have to be there for the customer when they're doing their initial searches and investigating what they need to do for the job. So, we're very excited about that. We've made a lot of progress, improving the quality of our website, the page load speeds, all of those key variables. And it's going to be an omnichannel effort. That whole journey involves online search each time. So, we're going to continue to drive our online business, we're going to continue to drive our retail business when customer gets there. We're going to make sure they have all the parts they need. It's essentially adapting to really leveraging our asset base, including our online assets and our physical assets in the stores.","Dan Wewer","And Tom, you sound really excited about the Walmart partnership. Can you discuss how that benefits your guidance for 2019 for sales and for operating margin rate?","Tom Greco","Yes. Well, first of all, the guide itself, we believe this is going to be a great year for the industry and for AAP. So, clearly, we want to see an acceleration of our performance versus last year. Walmart, the initiatives that we have for Walmart as we said in our prepared remarks, really kick in towards the back end of this year. There's a couple of phases, the first phase is really to put a broader assortment of parts on to the Walmart website for ship to home purposes. And then, the second phase is to get really stand up, what we call, pick up today where the customer can enter into the Walmart website; it will be a branded online presence that we\u2019ll have there on the Walmart website, and they'll be able to pick up the part in an Advance store and that will be towards the back end. So, there isn't a lot of incremental sales contemplated, Dan, in that sales guide. We believe that will be all upside to the sales guide we have.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. ","Brian Nagel","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on a nice year. I've got maybe a couple of questions. First off, just from a bigger picture perspective. Your comments here and then obviously a lot of indicators throughout the industry have suggested a nice and improving tailwind within the business. If that happens, and you\u2019re looking at your turnaround at your efforts, do you have an opportunity to accelerate your efforts or would you -- or will you more or less just let -- tailwind from a sales perspective fall to the bottom line?","Tom Greco","Well, it's good question, Brian. I mean, clearly, there's a high fixed cost base that we have that incremental sales helps us a lot. So, we're going to make sure that we're making the investments we need to make for the long term, as we said a few minutes ago. There are a couple of areas that we feel we have to address. And eventually, those costs come out in pretty big chunks. If you think about getting to a single payroll system we currently have for, we've moved to a new payroll system, we need to retire those old systems, getting to a single ERP system, we currently have four of those, we want to get to a single system there and retire those systems. So, all of the investments we're making this year in the technology space largely pertain to the simplification and the integration of the Company.","On the other side of the coin, we're driving the top line. The top line is very important. We want to be competitive in the marketplace. We want to strengthen our customer value proposition whether that's on the professional side or on the DIY side. And there are some things that we're doing there to drive our business. We believe that the things that we're doing are making us much more relevant. I think, if you look at the back half of last year at our actual performance, it was strong relative to the industry. And that's the goal on an ongoing basis. So, we're going to continue to drive the top line hard. To the extent that we exceed the sales guide that we\u2019ve provided this year, we\u2019ll make those decisions as they come. But, clearly, the industry backdrop is very good. We feel very good about where we are on a year-to-date basis, and we're going to continue to make those decisions as they come along.","Brian Nagel","That's very helpful. Then, the second question I had. You'd mentioned in the prepared comments the dynamic assortments and your efforts on inventory. So, with that, a couple of questions. One,","is inventory where it needs to be now, or should we expect to see a continued build from here? And then, second, is there a way to look at this effort and maybe parse out just in and of itself how much that has held back sales? So, to the extent that we get inventories into a better position that again -- this alone should be a driver of sales?","Tom Greco","Well, first of all, we clearly see opportunities to continue to optimize and reduce our inventory. There's a couple of things that we're doing there, Brian. We plan to start the implementation of cross-banner replenishment between Carquest and Advance in the back half of \u201819. So, essentially, when that's completed, we'll be able to ship parts from legacy Advance distribution centers to legacy Carquest stores and vice versa. Obviously, this will enable us to reduce stem miles and further optimize inventory throughout our DC network.","Secondly, we're also integrating the Worldpac in AutoPart International supply chains. And those two supply chains are starting to come together, we\u2019re assorting together. Bob Cushing is leading all that work. So, if you thinking about those first two big work streams, cross-banner replenishment and Advance and Carquest and then of course Worldpac and AI, as those two big initiatives are completed, we're moving from four supply chains down to two. So, that should help us reduce inventory.","And you mentioned dynamic assortment. What we're learning there, and I think you know this. We've evolved from the old way of assorting, which we used to call, probability to sell to a new way of assorting that is founded in machine learning tools, called dynamic assortment. And this is showing us that we can actually increase our turns throughout the supply chain by replacing slow turning skews with more relevant, faster turning skews, pretty basic stuff. But, we're very excited about the early returns on dynamic assortment, and you're going to continue to see us optimize our inventory going forward. And I think your point about have we -- our sales been held back a little bit because of our inventory assortment, I think, the answer to that question is yes, because as we make these changes, we're seeing the close rate go up. So, just by essentially using the dynamic assortment tool that we have, changing out the assortment we have in a category like spark plugs or anything else, we're definitely seeing the close rate improve. So, we see opportunities there.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities. Your line is open.","Seth Basham","Thanks a lot and good morning. My first question is around the top trends in the fourth quarter. Could you give us a little bit more color as to the degree of outperformance of DIY relative to DIFM? Was it 20, 30 basis points or was it 200, 300 basis points?","Tom Greco","Yes. It was it was pretty slight, Seth. We don't break that up specifically, as you know, but it was slightly higher. The trends through the quarter were similar to what you've heard from others. Our period 11 and 12, which is essentially October, November was strong, and December slightly positive. So, not as strong as November and October, but slightly positive in December. So, -- but the comparative at DIY and Pro was relatively similar.","Seth Basham","That\u2019s helpful. As you think what the drivers behind that inflection of DIY out comping Pro, was it more in the market, weather, et cetera or was it more around some of your initiatives with advertising or something else?","Tom Greco","Well, we definitely feel we're performing better in DIY omnichannel than we had been. Obviously, we do see some syndicated on that -- syndicated data on that topic that would corroborate that. I do think that we're executing better in the stores. I think that the advertising health, we see the awareness numbers; they went up nicely; they\u2019re still way too low in our view. But, the awareness numbers did go up behind the new advertising. Our buy online, pickup in store execution is improving. All of those things are factor. So, I think our relative performance is stronger in DIY, and I think that's why we're performing better.","Seth Basham","Got it. And just one last housekeeping question. You mentioned the impact of inflation in the fourth quarter, but what is it embedded in our guidance for comps in 2019?","Tom Greco","It's similar to what we said on a per unit basis, it's a couple of points obviously that there is still some uncertainty there, Seth, surrounding tariffs. But, based on what we see today, that's what we have in there.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Bret Jordan","Hi. Good morning. Yes. On that inflation question -- on the inflation question I guess, it sort of seems that maybe we\u2019re expecting a couple of points of inflation in 2019. And that's -- you expect inflation represents the majority of your comp and you're not really seeing a lot of unit pickup or maybe some better color on that?","Tom Greco","Well, again, I think, Bret, our guide itself is in line with our full-year performance last year. I can tell you that everybody in the Company is focused on exceeding that sales guide. We think it's going to be a strong year for the industry and for Advance for all the reasons that I've said. I think, from our standpoint, we're building the guide -- sorry, we're building our fixed cost base around the sales guide as we did last year. Our goal is to exceed that sales guide. All we're trying to do is make sure that we're able to deliver the overall financials of the Company. So, the goal is to beat the sales guide.","Bret Jordan","Okay. And then, a question on the Walmart relationship. Is picking up at Walmart not going to be an option, are you either going to ship to home or pick up at Advance?","Tom Greco","At some point, we do plan to have it available to pick up at Walmart. We're rooting this entire partnership and the customer. And what the customer wants is what we're going to do. So, we're going to make it as easy as possible for the customer. Obviously, we do believe that the convenience of coming to an Advance store is advantage and along with the trusted advice our employees can provide. But, we'll -- Walmart is a terrific partner on this. And they've got a great leadership team. We're excited to work collaboratively with them. We've got one of our top people, Nicole Jefferies, is working on this initiative. She's dedicated to the partnership; she's building up the plans. And I know the Walmart team is very excited about it. So, more to come.","Bret Jordan","What do you see that relationship impact on margin being in 2019? Obviously, you got some cost built into the development as well as maybe some revenue share with Walmart. But, if you\u2019d sort of carved out how much that might cost you on the front end?","Tom Greco","We haven't broken that out, Bret. I mean, obviously, we're going to do this in a thoughtful way and do it in a way that has a positive impact on our overall financials.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Bottiglieri with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. ","Chris Bottiglieri","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I was hoping that you could update us on material cost savings, how far along are you in that process? And then, as you think about kind of the impact of inflation in 2019, how do those conversations change in this type of environment, would you still expect to get those benefits?","Tom Greco","Yes. Sure, Chris, in terms of the material costs, I think, one of the things is as we go through this cycle is I\u2019ll call it phase 1, we're probably about 80% of the way through these material costs categories. But, it doesn't really stop there. We're going to be going back and revisiting categories. The first round we really focused heavily on AAP CQ. As we go back to certain vendors, we're now incorporating Worldpac and AI. So, it's an ongoing negotiation. Certainly with the uncertainties around tariffs and other commodity headwinds, we continue to work closely with our vendor partners. So, we've talked about inflation in 2019 and it's something that we're actively working on with our supplier partners.","Chris Bottiglieri","Got you. And then, I was hoping to quantify what the LIFO reserve was this quarter, what the impact on gross margin was, and how -- like, given the inflation we're seeing, how should we thinking about that in \u201819?","Tom Greco","Yes. That\u2019s something we saw in the fourth quarter here, was actually a headwind. You'll see when we publish our 10-K here later on today it was about a $15 million headwind. But again, we were able to more than offset that with other actions, including productivity measures. So, while it wasn't headwind, to your point, with the increasing costs, the commodities, the tariffs, we are able to more than offset that.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Seth Sigman with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Seth Sigman","Thanks. Hey, guys. Good morning. I wanted to talk a little about cross-banner visibility and just the progress there, any indication on how much that may be helping the comps currently and how you see that ramping? And then, on the cost side, I know that\u2019s had some negative implications in the short term, if you could quantify the impact in the fourth quarter and then just the potential for greater efficiencies next year. That would be helpful. Thank you.","Tom Greco","Sure. It\u2019s a big factor in terms of our comp improvement. When you consider -- let me break it down this way. If you look at our 2018 comp and you compare it to our 2017 comp, we improved by about 430 basis points. We think that at least half of that is related to overall industry improvement, if you think about the comparison to our primary competitors. So, what's remaining, there's about 100 or 200 and odd -- 205 points or whatever that number is, all of that is around three big things, cross-banner visibility, our DIY performance, and then just general execution. So, we would attribute about 80 bps to cross-banner visibility, and it's a very strong gaining momentum initiative that we have inside the company, very excited about it, and our team is very excited about it.","The cost to optimize it, it's relatively small, but it does cause us to drive around a little bit more than we'd like to, to get the part. And we're going to continue to work at that.","Seth Sigman","Okay. Thank you. And then, on the gross margin outlook, which I think is implied to be up 20 to 60 bps for the year, can you just walk us through some of the key drivers of that? I think, you touched a little bit on the material cost reductions. But, maybe specific on the supply chain, which has been a headwind, a lot going on there, as you start to close some distribution centers. Any more color on how to think about that as a headwind or potentially less of a headwind in 2019?","Tom Greco","Yes. I think, actually you touched on a number of those, in terms of supply chain, in fact in the fourth quarter, it was relatively flat on a rate basis as we're lapping those two distribution centers that we opened last year. So, we're overcoming some of those headwinds with the initiatives that we've been talking about in terms of supply chain. We hope to get some productivity out of that. Obviously, there's some investment that comes along with it, but we think we can get some productivity there. Material cost optimization, to your point, is going to be ongoing. We\u2019re still confident we can see improvements there. And then, other productivity measures, including shrink and better managing our slower moving inventory as we continue to use things like dynamic assortment, we think that\u2019s going to help us be more efficient and will drive those 20 to 60 basis points of improvement.","Operator","Thank you. And I'm currently showing no further questions. At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Tom Greco for closing remarks.","Tom Greco","Well, thanks to all of you for joining us. We've completed our second year now in our transformation agenda. And my leadership team and I are extremely proud of the team's execution in \u201818 and their continued focus to begin \u201819. So, as you've heard today, the diligent efforts and strategic investments we made over the past two years are beginning to bear fruit in our improving results. And while we have a lot of work ahead in our transformation journey, I'm confident we're on the right path with the right plan, and we have the best team members in the industry to help us capitalize on the significant opportunity ahead for AAP. We look forward to discussing our first quarter results in May. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for participation.

Jackson","Thanks, Joshua. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us and welcome to our fourth quarter conference call.","The fourth quarter brought to a close a very challenging year, yet we reached several important strategic and operational milestones. Our achievements during 2012 are a direct result of the hard work and dedication of nearly 54,000 team members. I want to say thank you to our Advance team for their continued diligence and commitment.","Our bottom line results in the fourth quarter were better than expected. That being said, we are never satisfied when comparable store sales and EPS decline. Our fourth quarter results reflected sequential improvement from last quarter in sales, gross margin rate, SG&A expense control and operating profits.","As we had forecasted during the third quarter call, we anticipated that the market would be challenging, and demand would continue to be weak for the fourth quarter. Our focus was to build on the third quarter sales trajectory, while materially improving our operating results in the face of near-term decelerating trends of our industry. As a result of our efforts, our market share gains were greatest in the fourth quarter, while achieving a record high operating profitability. I'm encouraged that our comparable store sales sequentially gained 30 basis points in the quarter when adjusted for the holiday shift. Our improvement was driven by both commercial and our DIY business.","Quarter-over-quarter improvement in market share was driven by commercial, with consistent comp-store sales growth in each period during our quarter when adjusted for the holiday shift in December for our Advance stores. Our Commercial Business had positive trends in both transactions and average ticket size. Our DIY comps sequentially improved from Q3 to Q4, driven by an increase in the average ticket size. The increase was driven by mix of products sold and better in-store customer engagement and staffing on the weekends. The uptick in overall average ticket was principally driven by the mix of products sold, namely the impact of failure category sales. Further impacting the average ticket growth has been the increasing cost of components driven by the ever increasing complexity of vehicles and the cycling of last year's escalating oil prices.","From a geographical perspective, we continue to see weakness and volatility in our cold weather markets, especially in the Great Lakes and the Northeast regions. Our performance in those 2 markets continue to be impacted by the lingering effects of the unseasonably warm weather. These regions' comparable store sales continue to trail our total company average by several hundred basis points. However, we've seen our comparable store sales stabilize in these regions over the last 2 quarters, which is very encouraging as we enter 2013.","Finally, we continue to pose low-single-digit comparable store sales growth in our western markets, where we only have 10% of our store base. As you recall, during our third quarter, we invested more heavily in the sales and service elements of our business in an effort to reignite demand and drive more customers through our doors, over our phones and onto our e-commerce website. Our investments in these areas improved our sales and market share results, but reduced our profitability in the third quarter. We expected our sales and service driving investments in the third quarter would carry over and benefit the balance of the year. The improved sales momentum, combined with our focus on improving our gross margin and cost management, resulted in higher profitability in the fourth quarter. Overall, the improvement in our operating profitability was modest, increasing to a record 8.5% for the quarter. More importantly, it sets the right focus and tone as we enter 2013 to leverage higher levels of profitability on modest sales gains.","For the year, our operating income rate decreased 18 basis points to 10.6% of sales, and our earnings per share increased 2.2% to $5.22. Mike will provide more specific highlights of financial performance a little later in the call.","As I reflect on 2012, we achieved some critical strategic and operational milestones. Strategically, we opportunistically entered the boroughs of New York through the acquisition of 21 former Strauss Auto Parts stores and 6 Steinway Auto Parts locations. Collectively, we opened 137 stores in 2012, which is the high watermark in the last 5 years. Importantly, it is our best performing class of new stores in nearly a decade. Our success in our 2012 new store performance positions us well as we expect to open nearly 200 stores in 2013. Competitively, it will close nearly a 300 basis point annual sales gap with some of our key competitors that has impacted our total and comparable store sales over the past several years.","Strategically, our greatest accomplishment was the acquisition of BWP, which closed on December 31. Certainly, BWP helps solidify our position in the very large and competitive Northeast market. More importantly, the Stockel family and BWP team as a whole are extraordinary leaders in the commercial industry. We gained proven leadership, an outstanding team and first-class customer relationships that will provide a significant opportunity to learn and improve our Commercial Business in the short and long term. We are excited to welcome BWP to the Advance organization and confident that we have one of the most preeminent commercial players on our team.","Operationally, our focus on related achievements were in    execution fundamentals and completing industry-leading commercial capabilities. The commercial capabilities include the launch of our in-house commercial credit program; the opening of our new daily replenishment distribution center in Remington, Indiana; reaching double-digit penetration of our new B2B ordering platform; and continued hub store expansions. These milestones are significant steps, which will allow us to more effectively compete in the larger and faster growing commercial market.","Our better execution of the fundamentals including improved delivery times, more effective weekend staffing and record-low shrink, which enabled record in-stock levels, will position us well heading into 2013.","Turning to 2013, we are cautiously optimistic about our outlook. Our optimism is based on several external and industry factors. Obviously, it starts with a return to more normal weather patterns, which alone will provide much-needed strength for our business. The industry is expecting a gradual increase in the number of vehicles 7 years and older, coupled with a record level of deferred maintenance in 2013. Finally, gas prices, though very volatile, are forecasted to decline, which has historically provided nice tailwinds for the industry.","Internally, our opportunity still lies within the fact that we have a very small commercial market share. The investment I mentioned earlier, along with our developing capabilities, such as our B2B e-commerce site and MotoLogic, our new diagnostic tool set, along with our rollout of a new electronic parts catalog to our stores later this year, will strengthen our ability to compete and allow us to continuously increase our commercial market share, while speeding up and improving the reliability and execution of our service at the shop and store level.","Our guarded view is related to a couple key macrodevelopments that temper our optimism. First is the increase in the number of people purchasing or contemplating the purchase of a new vehicle. Undoubtedly, this will be good for us in the long term. However, it will cause short-term volatility in the industry as customers are more concerned about what they invest in maintaining their aging vehicle.","Second, our economy continues to be lurching with high unemployment and wavering consumer confidence. The level of financial stress on our core customer will become more acute with the most recent payroll and other related tax increases that took effect at the start of the new year. The silver lining is that this is an economy of necessity, where consumers will continue to seek value from their local aftermarket garages or perform needed repairs and maintenance themselves.","My final comment on the industry and customer outlook is whether we are at a structural inflection point or simply a cyclical moment. Clearly, I believe the long-term structural drivers of our industry remain very strong. Cyclically, consumers have a renewed interest in new vehicle purchases, home investment and other select big-ticket purchases. The weather cycle will even out over time. Structurally, parts proliferation, parts complexity, aging vehicle reliability and extended import part failure rates all underpin a fundamentally sound outlook for the industry. The roughly 250 million vehicles on the road today that are over 11 years old, like human beings, are lasting longer and requiring more care. In 2012, the industry may have caught a cold, which simply needs to run its course.","Our recent 2013 regional leadership and sales team meetings conveyed one simple objective for the year, which is a company of one focused on fundamentals. The expected outcome is simple, which is to make the day in terms of our customer experience, sales and profitability. Pragmatically, that means we will stay the course on a few key initiatives that will drive our growth and improve our profitability including: One, growing our Commercial Business through improved levels of delivery speed and reliability, increased customer retention and share of wallet with our national and regional accounts; two, relentlessly improving our local market availability through hub expansions, tailoring and intensifying key store availability and leveraging our supply chain infrastructure; three, expanding our new store pipeline to grow at a run rate closer to 200 stores a year versus 100, while successfully capitalizing on our BWP acquisition; four, continuing our in-store execution excellence through scheduling effectiveness, on-hand accuracy, add-on sales training and customer engagement; five and finally, increasing our efficiency and effectiveness throughout the support areas and through a more integrated store operating model. Clearly, our company priorities have a more intense operations and execution bias than years past. Strategically, our agenda remains the same as years past. Operationally, our focus has moved from building key capabilities to driving results through outstanding execution.","In closing, I'd like to share one example to illustrate the points I've been discussing. Partnership is key to commercial excellence. And since last February, our new commercial credit team has become a partner that more than half of our commercial customers rely on. Financial Services Director Bill Corey and his team provide our customers seamless personalized service with flexibility that meets their needs. Advance commercial credit is creating an improved customer credit experience, while helping our team better serve their customers. This team works closely with our customers from the minute they purchase from Advance to the time they are issued credit and receive statements. The feedback has been overwhelming. Our customers love talking to the same knowledgeable people and the program's simplicity, like getting credit within minutes instead of hours. Thanks, Bill, to you and your team for all you are doing to bring services our best part to life and drive excellence at Advance.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin Freeland, our Chief Operating Officer.","Kevin P. Freeland","Thanks, Darren, and good morning, and thanks to all of our team members.  Even though 2012 was a challenging year, their efforts and milestones reached have made 2012 a pivotal year in our profitable growth journey.","As I begin my prepared remarks, I'd like to go into a little more detail on these accomplishments and provide an update on our progress on the key priorities that support our superior availability strategy and new store growth. As I've mentioned on our previous calls, our focus with respect to superior availability is on providing our customers with the best-in-market availability and consistency of service, both in order accuracy and delivery speed. The areas of priority continue to be the expansion of our hub network, the continual upgrade of our parts inventory at our non-hub stores, the opening of our new DC and the implementation of our daily replenishment capability, the growth in new stores and the continued growth and rollout of our B2C and B2B e-commerce platforms, commercial diagnostic tool and our electronics part catalog.","In our fourth quarter, we continued to expand our hub network through new store expansion and the upgrade of existing stores, which have the space and are strategically positioned to operate as a hub. As a result of this work, we added 11 additional hub stores, bringing our hub store count to 339 versus 294 at the end of 2011. We also upgraded the inventory at 211 non-hub stores during the quarter. Including our hub store conversions, we've upgraded the inventory to over 1\/4 of our total store base. This was no small effort by our inventory and store teams, and this work positions us to provide the products our customers need when they need them.","Our fourth quarter also marked our first full quarter where our Remington DC was fully operational. The opening of this new DC was critical on 2 fronts: One, it gives us much needed additional capacity as the result of our store growth over the past 5 years and will relieve a great deal of pressure on other DCs; two, Remington will be a model for us in the future in terms of automation, which we expect will greatly improve our productivity and efficiency and allow us to replenish our stores daily. We'll continue our rollout of shipments to stores within Remington's service area in phases, ultimately ramping up to over 400 stores this year. The initial rollout of daily replenishment has been going well, with all 195 stores receiving daily shipments at the end of 2012. Our initial results are promising as the potential to provide best-in-class availability is one of our top goals. Once this new DCs begin servicing its entire market, we expect it will begin to improve our supply chain costs and strengthen our gross profit rate.","As a result of our store-level upgrades, the opening of Remington and a higher mix of parts inventory, our total inventory increased 13% to $2.3 billion. This increase is in line with our expectations and will position us well into 2013. We anticipate our total inventory will continue to grow in 2013 as we focus on increasing the overall breadth of our parts assortment, improving our position with larger commercial customers and integrating BWP. However, our growth in 2013 will likely be at a slower pace than 2012.","That being said, we continue to work aggressively to free up capital to fund other parts of our business and improve our return on invested capital through our supply chain financing program. Our work in this area translates into expanding our accounts payable to inventory ratio, which increased roughly 700 basis points from 80.9% at the end of 2011 to 87.9% this year. Our own inventory decreased 28.5% or $111.2 million from $390 million to $278.8 million.","Over the past year, we've been working aggressively to improve our e-commerce capabilities to better compete within our industry. To that end, we turned our efforts toward increasing the amount of our Commercial Business that's transacted online. We expect to continue to increase the B2B penetration rate over time. This will position our company to strengthen our relationship with larger and more national commercial garages, as well as improve both the frequency and retention rate of our existing commercial customers who utilize this capability.","In April of last year, we had our full debut of MotoLogic, which we acquired in October of 2011. MotoLogic provides the best-in-class repair and diagnostic capabilities. We're still in the early stages of our rollout, but our initial customer response has been great.","Our B2C site continues to make great progress, and we achieved new levels of performance. As I mentioned last quarter, we now have the #1 multichannel site in the markets we serve. Our B2C team ended the year with record sales and achieved $1 million in daily sales twice during the fourth quarter. This progress is fantastic and is only a glimpse of the possibilities our mobile and electronic capabilities can provide.","Turning to our new store openings. We added 67 new stores, including 2 new Autopart International stores and Autopart International's acquisition of 6 former Steinway stores. This has been a record quarter for new store openings, and our teams have done an excellent job ensuring that the quality in which we open stores is at the highest standard. For the year, we added 137 new stores, including 21 Autopart International stores and closed 5. As of December 29, 2012, our total store count was 3,794 including 218 Autopart International stores. Our 2012 class of new stores continues to perform very well meeting our internal expectations of sales growth and overall sales productivity. As I mentioned last quarter, our 2012 class of stores is proving to be our most successful in terms of sales productivity, and the pace of their weekly sales ramp.","As Darren discussed, we acquired BWP at the beginning of fiscal 2013. We're very excited about this affiliation, as BWP is one of the strongest commercial-only distributors within the markets they serve. This is a great opportunity for us to learn and integrate the best of Advance Auto Parts with the best of BWP and expand what they do to the rest of our commercial programs. On day 1, BWP will have a positive impact on our performance. We expect them to add $170 million to $180 million of sales to our business this year in incremental operating income dollars. We plan to integrate and convert the 124 BWP stores to our systems and branding over a 2- to 3-year period. We will continue to give you updates on any material developments as we work to convert these stores. As a result of this conversion process, we anticipate the net impact of the acquisition will be slightly dilutive to operating income for the year.","Finally, I want to provide you a brief update on our progress to improve our gross profit rate. As you might recall, our goal after our second quarter 2012 results was to stabilize our sales trends, reverse our decelerating trends, while improving our overall gross profit rate. Through our efforts to better safeguard our inventory, maintain our disciplined approach in pricing, partnering more effectively with our suppliers and better managing our promotional activity, our gross profit rate increased 87 basis points to 49.9% versus 49.0% during the fourth quarter of 2011. For the year, our gross profit rate was 49.9%, which was up 19 basis points versus 2011. As we look ahead, we continue to see modest improvements in our gross profit rate for 2013 as we improve our product acquisition costs, generate increased supply chain efficiencies and continue to maintain our disciplined pricing strategy and shrink management. The improvements will be partially offset by the continued supply chain investments.","Now let me turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Norona, to review our financial results in more detail.","Michael A. Norona","Thanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start by thanking all of our talented and dedicated team members for their commitment to serving our customers as we navigated through a challenging fiscal 2012. I would also like to welcome our new BWP team members.","I plan to cover the following topics with you this morning: One, provide some financial highlights from our fourth quarter of 2012; two, put our fourth quarter and year-to-date results into context with our expectations and key financial dimensions we use to measure our performance; and three, share with you our financial outlook for 2013. 2012 was a challenging year for our business in the markets in which we operate. Our fourth quarter performance and full year results were primarily driven by the ongoing softness in our colder-weather markets. In addition, our results were impacted by fluctuating gas prices, high unemployment and a tough economic environment with more uncertainty, which decreased consumer demand for auto parts. As Darren mentioned, our focus all year has been to influence the things that are in our direct control. And we continue to be focused on achieving our longer-term growth and profitability goals by maintaining our strategic focus, executing on the fundamentals and simplifying our operations.","While we are disappointed we did not achieve our growth and profitability expectations, we are encouraged by our improved sales performance trends versus the market and generating positive operating income growth in our fourth quarter. This improvement translated into a fourth quarter sales increase of 0.1% to $1.3 billion, despite a comp store sales decrease of 1.9%. Adjusting for the impact of the calendar shift in Q4 where we lost a couple of selling days as Christmas fell on a Tuesday this year versus a Sunday last year, our comp store sales decreased roughly 1.5%. Offsetting our comp store sales decline was the net addition of 132 new stores over the past 12 months.  Our total sales for fiscal 2012 increased 0.6% to $6.2 billion, and our comp store sales decreased 0.8%.","Our fourth quarter gross profit rate increased 87 basis points to 49.9% versus 49% in Q4 of 2011. The increase was primarily driven by continued improvements in our shrink performance and supply chain efficiencies, driven by the increased volume of inventory handled during the quarter, partially offset by investments in our supply chain driven by the opening of Remington and increased new stores. For the year, our gross profit rate increased 19 basis points to 49.9%. Year-to-date, our commercial mix represented 38.1% of 2012 sales versus 37% in 2011.","Our fourth quarter SG&A rate of 41.4% increased 79 basis points versus the fourth quarter of 2011, primarily due to the expense deleverage as a result of our 1.9% comp store sales decline, increased new store openings and costs associated with our acquisition-related activity during the quarter, partially offset by lower incentive compensation. For the year, our SG&A rate increased 36 basis points to 39.3% versus 39% over the same period last year. The increase in our SG&A is principally due to our fixed costs deleverage as a result of our 0.8% comp store sales decline.","All in, our fourth quarter operating income dollars increased 1.1% to $113.2 million, and our operating income rate increased 9 basis points over the same period last year to 8.5%. This was on top of a 182 basis point improvement in fourth quarter 2011 over fourth quarter 2010.  Our diluted earnings per share decreased $0.02 to $0.88 during the quarter versus $0.90 in the fourth quarter of last year.  For the year, our operating income dollars decreased 1.1% to $657.3 million, and our diluted EPS increased 2.2% to $5.22. Our average diluted share count was 74.1 million shares at the end of Q4.","For the year, free cash flow was $412.3 million, down $94.9 million over the same period last year. The largest driver of the decrease in free cash flow was our planned increase of $89.9 million in our accounts receivable as a result of the in-sourcing of our commercial credit program. Our inventory increased 13% primarily in car parts categories driven by the opening of our Remington DC, our investments in hubs and store-level inventory  upgrades, more new stores and to position the company for a strong availability in 2013. Our investments in inventory continue to be enabled by reductions in our owned inventory, which decreased $111 million compared to the end of 2011, and was driven by our continued efforts to increase our accounts payable to inventory ratio, which now stands at 87.9% versus 80.9% in Q4 of 2011.  At the end of the fourth quarter, we had $598.1 million in cash and $604.5 million of long-term debt on our balance sheet.  Our adjusted debt-to-EBITDAR ratio was 2.2x, which is well below our previously stated ceiling of 2.5x.","We continue to measure our performance, the financial dimensions of growth, profit and value creation. Our approach in philosophy has always been to prioritize growth as our primary use of capital in order to increase returns and drive shareholder value. Our investments over the course of this year have been centered on accelerating our commercial growth and stabilizing our DIY business by improving our availability through our hub store openings, inventory upgrades, supply chain investments and strengthening our market position with increased new store openings. We are very proud that in our fourth quarter, we implemented our first wave of daily replenishment, entered the boroughs of New York and finalized our commercial credit in-sourcing.  We are also excited about our acquisition of BWP, one of the leading commercial players in our industry. This acquisition closed at the beginning of 2013 fiscal year.","While we prioritize growth as our #1 use of capital, share buybacks have always historically been a part of our capital allocation. We made the deliberate decision to slow our share buyback program in 2012 to preserve capital as we explored growth opportunities, including the acquisition of BWP. Looking ahead, we plan to continue our historical practice of opportunistically repurchasing shares in a disciplined manner in 2013 and beyond. Currently, we have roughly $492 million left under our share repurchase authorization at the end of Q4.","Turning to profit. We remain committed to improving our profitability, which requires both delivering on our sales growth goals, primarily driven by commercial, and developing a more cost-competitive operating model. While we are not satisfied with the progress we made to our profit model in 2012, our plans in 2013 and beyond are focused on improving our profit model, which I will cover shortly in our annual outlook.","As we look at value creation, we continue to maintain our disciplined approach to capital, which is reflected in our return on invested capital of 19.4%. ROIC decreased modestly from our fourth quarter last year, driven primarily by our planned increase in accounts receivable due to our commercial credit in-sourcing and lower operating income. Our AP ratio at the end of fourth quarter was a record 87.9%, and we remain focused on achieving an AP ratio of 100% over time.","Turning to our outlook for 2013. Our performance will be driven by continued growth in our commercial sales, improved availability, increased new store openings, improved execution, modest improvement in gross profit rate and improvements in our cost structure. We expect the industry dynamics to remain favorable and anticipate to return to more normal weather patterns. These will be somewhat offset by continued volatility in the economic environment with more uncertainty impacting the consumer, such as increased taxes, relatively high unemployment and continued volatility in gas prices. As a result, we anticipate our comp store sales to grow low-single digits driven by stronger commercial comps. We plan to open 170 to 190 new stores and work to integrate the 124 BWP stores we acquired at the beginning of the fiscal year. We anticipate BWP to add approximately $170 million to $180 million of incremental sales in 2013. As a reminder, BWP will not be reflected in our comparable store sales calculation until fiscal 2014.","We anticipate our gross profit rate to modestly improve, driven by merchandising capabilities and global sourcing, offset by competitive headwinds, the integration of BWP, which has a lower margin rate, and an increased mix in commercial sales. We anticipate our SG&A to deleverage, driven by increased new store growth, more normalized incentive compensation, the annualization of new stores from 2012 and approximately $0.15 to $0.20 of onetime integration costs for BWP. These costs will be somewhat offset by improved labor productivity, more effective marketing spend and improvements in our non-customer-facing support costs. All in, we anticipate our SG&A per store to increase 3% to 5%.","We anticipate our quarterly operating profit for our first quarter of 2013 to decline mid to upper single digits given the current industry softness, tougher sales comparisons, the annualization of 2012 new stores along with the heavy concentration of stores opened in the fourth quarter of 2012 and higher incentive compensation.","Turning to capital expenditures. We expect to invest approximately $275 million to $300 million, driven by new store development, supply chain investments and store systems. We expect free cash flow to be a minimum of $375 million, excluding the acquisition costs of BWP, which was approximately 1x BWP sales.","Finally, we estimate our 2013 annual operating EPS outlook will be in the range of $5.45 to $5.60 per share, excluding onetime integration costs of BWP of approximately $0.15 to $0.20. On a reported basis including the BWP onetime integration costs, our EPS outlook is expected to be $5.30 to $5.45.","This annual outlook reflects a weighted average share count of approximately 74 million outstanding diluted shares. Consistent with our historical practice, our outlook does not reflect any anticipated share repurchase activity. As we have previously shared, we plan to continue our historical practice of opportunistically repurchasing shares in a disciplined manner, which could possibly impact our 2013 annual EPS outlook.","In closing, we are disappointed we did not deliver on the financial expectations in our fourth quarter and in 2012. We remain committed to improving our performance in achieving our longer-term growth and profitability goals by maintaining our strategic focus, investing in the key areas such as commercial and availability and executing on the fundamentals. We also have great confidence in our team's ability to improve our performance based on their talents, character and competitive spirit. Operator, we are now ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from Gary Balter with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Gary Balter - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","One question and one follow-up. You talked about Remington and what it's doing for you. Could you -- I don't know if you could quantify in the 195 stores where you said you've already rolled it out, the type of impact you're seeing from that. And then past Remington, could you talk about the rollout of further distribution centers into this year and following years?","Darren R. Jackson","Gary, I'll frame it and Kevin will give some of the details. Maybe I'll start with the back half of that question. So as we look at the daily replenishment opportunity long term, right now as we've said before, we're going to start with Remington and understand the lift. And we're delighted with the first set of stores that we've seen, and Kevin will give you a few more details on that. We've committed to a second center in the Northeast, in part because of the expansion in the Northeast and also in part because of our initial optimism that we had been -- that we had seen in some of our tests in terms of daily replenishment as well. I think longer term, what we're trying to balance is that these are not cheap facilities. We have found a number of ways through the process now to get the costs down. So after we get done with Connecticut, there are a few other places in the country we'd look to go to next. But I -- what I found is that if you get too far ahead of yourself in terms of kind of the disclosing where those are, for competitive reasons, that's not good, and making sure that the theory that we see on paper turns out in reality. And right now in Remington, at least the initial stores that we're seeing the lift numbers from the stores that are receiving daily replenishment, we're pleased with. Kevin, what would you add to that?","Kevin P. Freeland","Sure, Gary. So as I said in my remarks, there were 2 reasons why we opened Remington. One was it's the first DC we've opened in many, many years, first DC I've opened in the 5 years that I've been here. And just based on store growth and comp store gains over the years, it was needed just to keep up with the demand. Second is obviously, it's a different facility with a different role. In the lifts that we're seeing, we essentially built a pro forma that was based on 2 things: It's less costly for us to run that facility because of automation and then it lifts because of better in-stocks in our stores. And essentially, the lifts that we're receiving today are ahead of that pro forma. And we're still in the early phases of kind of the shakedown cruise of the new DC. As Darren said, we -- and that would be -- essentially became our ninth DC. We've secured a 10th DC in Connecticut, and work is underway to replicate that work up there. One of the things that's highly sensitive here is how far can we deliver the product based on the sales lift and the humble assumptions we began with suggested 150 miles. At this point, essentially the question that we have is based on the sales lift, can that get pushed to 200 miles. And we'll have a better sense of that over the next few quarters. Assuming that in fact, that becomes the case, most all of our stores are within 200 miles of the 10 DCs we would then have. And what we have is a new capability that can be deployed into those DCs. So I think the future of this is to play out over the next several quarters. But it has a lot more to do with just leveraging what we've already done more so than a significant change of the facilities that we previously owned.","Gary Balter - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So just following up on that. The -- ignoring, let's say, like the DCs that are on the outskirts like in Kansas. But in the other ones, could you reformat them to take a lot of what you have in Remington? Or do you have to build new facilities?","Kevin P. Freeland","The existing plan today is inordinately weighted to leveraging the 8 legacy DCs that we have.","Gary Balter - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, great. And just following up, we've written about the polar vortex and the impact of the weather on sales. And we're getting a big storm right in your market this weekend, which I'm happy about, but other people may not be. When do you think we'll see -- assuming that it was weather, and clearly, your results point to that given the difference between the weather impact of markets or not. When do we start seeing the benefits of the snow and the cold that we're getting this winter?","Darren R. Jackson","Yes, Gary, our best estimate, as Mike highlighted in his comments is, as we look at our business, Q1 is our longest quarter with 16 weeks. We would be looking in terms of the wear and tear is going to continue to occur through the first quarter. As we begin the second quarter and the balance of the year, that's where we see the uptick. As we said in our comments, we're cautiously optimistic. One of the pieces in the caution is that our Northeast business early on in the year last year was still pretty strong. It really felt the effects of the winter as we got into, say, that later in that March, April and beyond time period. So when I step back, we have such a large footprint in that Northeast and Great Lakes region. Great Lakes was equally a good business, and we're looking for both of those regions to see that bounce back as we head into Q2 and the balance of the year.","Operator","Our next question is from Michael Lasser with UBS.","Michael Lasser - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","You alluded to share gains that you experienced in the quarter, can you talk about those in a little bit more depth? And is there a way that you could tie the share gains to some of the actions that you may have taken earlier in the year?","Darren R. Jackson","Yes, Michael. When we refer to that, what we're doing is looking at the NPD data in aggregate. And what we can see is our fourth quarter was by far our best quarter in terms of commercial share gains. We continue to give up some DIY share in the quarter. Just to be clear, just to highlight one thing, over the last several years, we made a deliberate decision to slow down new store growth in favor of focusing on our commercial capabilities. When we did that, we've been running at a rate of about half of some of our competitors in terms of new stores. And principally, the way you grow DIY share these days is through new store growth. And so we expect that share gap, particularly as we go into 2013, to close. And what you should take away from that too, the new stores that we are adding, we have been over last 2 years focusing on how do we position those to better serve the commercial customers, while delivering a DIY experience that certainly we'd be proud of. The New York class that we have now, this is the best class that we've had in nearly a decade. So we're upbeat about -- we're staying on strategy in terms of commercial -- in terms of commercial growth, while being able to reposition the DIY business for share gains in the future again.","Michael Lasser - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And  then given the performance of those new stores, the most recent class, do you get, you mean just a modest lift to your comp as those fall into the comp base?","Darren R. Jackson","Oh, absolutely. Yes, absolutely. Our estimates over the last several years, and I've talked about this before, is that versus some of our known competitors, it's probably about a 300 basis point gap that we've been experiencing. Certainly, you can see it in the totals, but the way these store models work, you experience significant comp store benefits in year 2, 3 and 4. Usually, it's about 4 years before you ramp to a maturity level in the stores.","Michael Lasser - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","That's super helpful. One last question, maybe for Mike. On the 3% to 5% growth in SG&A per store, how does that going to break down? Or is there any way you could just provide a little more detail on the nature of those -- to quantify the nature of those investments that you're going to be making in the upcoming year?","Michael A. Norona","Yes. There's a couple that are the big drivers of that. So one of the drivers that's in that 3% to 5% SG&A per store increase is we acquired BWP. That's over 1\/2 of that increase. And that -- their SG&A isn't growing. We just put their SG&A now on top of our SG&A. So that's 1\/2 of it. And then the other big driver -- 2 big drivers are our new stores. So we've accelerated our new stores. And we again look 170 to 180 and more normalized incentive compensation. So those are the 2 drivers. And then the offset to that is improved labor productivity, improved marketing effectiveness. And then obviously we're going to continue our cost work around pulling out costs furthest away from the customer.","Operator","Our next question is from Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","My first question is about the buyback. And to your point you had abstained from buying back stock last year. How do you think about value? You talked about being opportunistic. What criteria do you use? And in that vein, you talked about your buyback through 2012. Have you bought back any stock year-to-date?","Darren R. Jackson","Yes, so Matt, maybe I'll do your last one first. We don't comment on our buyback before we do it. So I won't comment on that. We did say that we did kind of pull back on our buyback program last year as we preserved capital to look at sales growth opportunities including buying BWP. And what I will tell you is our philosophy on buyback hasn't changed. So you ask, what do we do? We look at value. And the first use that we think about when we're deploying our capital is we prioritize growth, so investing in the business. And then we look at buyback as also another way to pay back the shareholder and create long-term value and we take a long-term disciplined approach. We do use a DCF model that we shared before. And the good news is, that can sometimes frustrate shorter-term shareholders that hold us for shorter periods of time, but longer term shareholders have benefited because we bought back 41% of the company at an average price of just under $42. So our philosophy hasn't changed. What did change a little bit last year is we were looking at those sales growth opportunities, and what we did say in our remarks, is we do plan to resume our historical practice of buying back shares in a disciplined manner as we've done in the past. And also as a reminder, in our annual outlook, we have not included any share repurchases.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Understood. And then second question if I could. So you've spoken about some high level enhancements that you expect to make over time to your fulfillment capabilities. You also spoke separately about your desire to increase your traction with some national accounts. And I guess my question is, if you think strategically about where you stand competitively in terms of your ability to provide optimal service to all sorts of commercial accounts, is there a class of business or a class of customer where you feel you've been underpenetrated from a market share perspective relative to peers? Or you think your ability to compete and maybe for first call is going to grow as a result of some of these logistics efforts?","Kevin P. Freeland","Yes, Matt. So let me put all 3 of those together because being about Advance Auto Parts 5 years ago, our Commercial business was $1 billion. Today, it's $2.3 billion. By and large, the growth has all come organically. So it's not about us simply adding programs to DIY stores. That was done a decade ago. And as we have taken that journey from a DIY exclusively focused retailer 15 years ago, our first step is that, I'll call it, the small mom-and-pop garages were just easier for us to deal with. In many ways, they looked like our DIY customers that we were comfortable serving. And I would say today, over the last 5 years we have grown significantly whether it's our relationship with Monroe, our relationship with Sears, our relationship with Goodyear and our relationship with Brakes Plus. All of those customers in some ways are helping us understand better what we need to do to be effective with them long term. Our push in availability specifically and import parts to bolster availability to the customer, daily replenishment is all reflective of the reality that serving these larger customers starts with availability. But it also includes, as Mike highlighted, our need to get into the commercial credit business. Our experience on that with our partner just was not what our larger accounts expected was one. And then two, we talked about our B2B platform. Two years ago our penetration on that was close to 0. We surpassed 10% this year, on our way to 20%. And the majority of those, as you would expect, are the larger bay garages in terms of reflecting those capabilities. I feel like we're in great shape today in terms of our sales force and how we're focusing them in terms of our platinum, diamond customers and their growth expectations. I feel terrific about what the teams have done in-store. We talked about our shrink results this year. Shrink is helpful because we see that in the P&L, but what's really helpful is the in-stock levels at the local store level. So organizationally, as I said, this has been a journey of 5 years to get to a set capabilities that those larger bay customers are an opportunity for us principally versus the traditional WDs for sure. I will tell you one of the benefits of BWP, when we look at their business, is that nearly 2\/3 of the business that they're doing are with customers that we weren't doing business with. And they tend to be larger bay customers. Neil Stockel, who is in the Stockel family, have been just fantastic. And we see them as real resource to help us understand how to penetrate and grow even deeper relationships with those larger bay customers.","Operator","Our next question is from Colin McGranahan with Bernstein.","Colin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","First, just on the BWP, focusing on that for a second. Can you give us a little detail on the integration and what those costs will be in 2013? Just looking at the EPS guidance, it looks like it translates to maybe $18 million to $24 million of actual integration expenses, which seems a little high at 10% to 14% of the sales of BWP. So maybe you can just give us a little more specificity on what those integration costs are, and how that integration is going to go?","Michael A. Norona","Yes. So, Colin, this is Mike. I will start that and Darren, you can add any comments. But first of all, we're not going to go into a lot of details on our integration costs from a competitive standpoint. But let me give you a little bit of a frame. We said that these are onetime costs whenever you buy a company. One of the things that was a little bit unique about the BWP business is they had the company-owned stores and then they had the independents. We don't have the independents. So part of the costs are kind of separating the DCs and moving the DCs to the GPI -- the DC and the GPIs. So there's going to be some costs associated with that. And then there's just integration costs. As you transition, as you make changes, as you move things around and convert things. So those are where the costs are. And I want to be clear, those are onetime costs, $0.15 to $0.20. Obviously, those are estimates right now, and our goal will always be to beat those numbers. But that's our best view right now. I think the more important part about that business is, and I think Darren said it, we're extremely excited about it as it gives us some access to some new capabilities, some very talented people, including the Stockel family and all our team members. And so far, we're off to a fabulous start in that business. And then we also said that if you net out and take away the integration costs of that business, the sales of $170 million to $180 million is actually accretive to our business. It's in the commercial space, so we're really excited about that.","Darren R. Jackson","Yes, I don't have much to add, Colin, except just imagine you have 3 DCs. Products co-mingle. There's going to be a fair amount of work on the front end just to realign all the products to support the company-owned stores, to support the stores that GPI will be taking as a part of this. And then there's repositioning in our own markets. There's going to be real estate related costs that drive a fair amount of that onetime costs. And then there's just the natural retention in people type of costs too. So our goal is to actually get those behind us, and always to try to achieve a lower level of integration costs than what it takes. But we thought it was just helpful to frame that for the outside world.","Colin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Great. That's very helpful. Just a second very quick follow-up on new store expansion. 2013 and even beyond, obviously you're starting to accelerate the expansion a little bit here. Can you geographically talk about where the emphasis and focus will be, contrasting existing markets, new markets? It sounds like New York City and then New England area might be a bit more of an emphasis? And then further west as well.","Darren R. Jackson","Sure. Kevin?","Kevin P. Freeland","Yes, Colin, this is Kevin. So essentially, there's 2 elements. The easy question -- or easy answer to your question is, what's our plan in 2013? And we have markets that were materially underpenetrated. And as we had in our prepared remarks, we entered New York City. New York City is just on the commercial side, over $1 billion in volume and it's a market we just entered last year. We, through the BWP acquisition, making a big bet in the Northeast. But the majority of our stores that we opened in 2012 were in the Northeast, and that will remain true as we go through 2013. So it's essentially storing out markets that we're underpenetrated in. We're also making a material push into Chicago, and that's another underpenetrated market. As you move forward to 2014 and beyond, you look at a map of Advance and it's an East Coast-based company. And we've commented on that and the impact of the weather. And the entire West Coast of the United States is essentially what we would be moving to over the next several years.","Operator","Our final question today is from Dan Wewer with Raymond James.","Daniel R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Darren, you noted a number of initiatives that further grow your commercial market share. But on do-it-yourself I believe the only catalyst is accelerating the number of new stores. But beyond that, is there anything in the works to improve the do-it-yourself productivity? And also I may have missed it, did you provide the do-it-yourself commercial sales mix in your prepared comments?","Michael A. Norona","Yes, Josh, will...what?","Joshua Moore","38.2% is our commercial mix for the year.","Darren R. Jackson","Yes. And we would see that grow into over 40% next year with BWP and our other commercial efforts.","Daniel R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Joshua, what was it for the quarter?","Joshua Moore","38.2%.","Daniel R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","That was for the year or the quarter?","Joshua Moore","Quarter.","Darren R. Jackson","Quarter. Okay. And then, Dan, on DIY, it was blended into the comments, but it's a great question. So within DIY, Kurt Schumacher, who has been in the industry 39 years, with us for 12 years, took over our store organization midyear, our field organization. I tell you, Kurt is just passionate about the simple fundamentals of the DIY business, including when you look how DIY trends work these days, Friday, Saturday, Sunday are the days for the business. He's put a lot of effort into simple things and the fundamentals, which include the weekend staffing is one. We've talked before about down to the team member, we can see that average basket each team member is moving in a store these days. We've put in a lot of effort in growing the average ticket. We've said for years, and others may disagree with us, the DIY business is a 0 to 1 grower in total. The focus we've all been challenged by ticket growth and their -- our transaction growth for years. What we realize as we benchmark, some of our average ticket in store were low. And so our efforts this year have a lot to do -- and as you travel our stores, as I know you do, is focusing on our add-on sales efforts. We talked about later in the year we're going to be rolling out our internal languages, find it fast, get it fast, our new EPC. So today, our EPC doesn't necessarily make it easy for someone without deep auto industry knowledge to be able to put together a complete solution for the customer. Others have that ability on the EPC to kind of put together a complete bundle. What we see as the opportunity as we roll out our EPC, what we're doing is transferring some of the knowledge in selling process in the electronic parts catalog and allowing that associate at the counter, that team member at the counter to be able to put together a complete break bundle, to put together a complete oil change offer, and to be able to measure it and give feedback on that as well. And so I am very optimistic. We had our catalog built by our best parts pros in our stores and our general managers. We're beginning the, as Kevin would say, the shakedown process for that. And making sure that when it does hit the store, it works as advertised. But that's where I see the growth coming in DIY is the combination of new stores and growing the average ticket, not through hope, but actually through the training process and ultimately supporting that through the new parts catalog as we get through the back half of the year.","Daniel R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","And then just one quick question for Mike. You're guiding first quarter operating profit to drop, what, 5% to 8%. Is the increase in the incentive comp, is that the key reason for that decline?","Michael A. Norona","Yes. Hey, Dan, before I hit that question -- and I know you always like to get to precision with your numbers, so let me give you -- so the Q4 mix of commercial was 37.9% and the annual mix of commercial was 38.1%. And then the drivers -- and then in terms of the drivers, there's a few of them. First of all, we're going to be anniversarying -- so we've got more -- if you remember, I think we took out about 221 basis points of costs last year of leverage, so we're anniversarying that. Two, is our new stores, so we're adding new stores. And last year, our new store mix was more at the back half of the year. This one is going to be spread out through -- evenly throughout the year. And then we have -- the third one component is the annualization of those stores. So typically, we opened 67 stores up in the back half of the year. As you know, the heavier costs are at the beginning of that, so that will be the third component. And then the last component is the incentive compensation. So as we know -- it's not increased incentive. It's just normalizing incentive comp, just given our lower performance last year just resulted in lower incentive comp.","Daniel R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Are you still thinking same-store sales are slightly negative in 1Q before flipping positive?","Michael A. Norona","Yes, we don't give out quarterly guidance around that, but you can read into Darren's comments. I think Darren gave a good frame of how we think about the quarter.","Operator","Thank you.

Our team members remained focused on our 3 outcomes: sales, service and profit and continued to drive improvement into the business.","Our total sales grew 50.6% in the quarter compared to the third quarter of 2013, primarily as a result of the acquisition of General Parts, new store openings and our comparable stores sales increase of 1.5% in the quarter. Our third quarter comparable cash earnings per share of $1.89 increased 27.7% versus our third quarter last year, driven principally again by the acquisition of General Parts as well as our base business performance. Despite an overall cooler summer season, we were very pleased to have delivered solid comparable store gains in commercial, with our DIY business experiencing some unevenness in sales trends driven by lower volume of seasonal categories.","The consistent strength of our Commercial Business was seen throughout our North American operations, including Advance Auto Parts, CARQUEST and the WORLDPAC locations. This is encouraging, considering our teams have come together in less than a year to collectively drive these solid outcomes and continue to fuel our growth through our Commercial Business. Further, we continued our momentum with our national account growth as our teams once again delivered double-digit growth within the quarter.","Looking at our comp trends, our Commercial Business showed consistent and steady strength throughout the quarter, with notable increases in both traffic and ticket, led by our strong sales increases in ride control, with particular strength in the brake category as well. Our DIY business experienced some mid-summer softness as we referenced in our second quarter conference call and remained choppy, but it did improve throughout the quarter.","From a macro perspective, our industry continues to show stability as average age of vehicles continues to hold, along with increases in miles driven, supported by favorable fuel prices. The uptick in new car sales is also a positive overall. Given steady scrappage rates, it should eventually put more cars into the system and result in a net gain for our industry. Consumer confidence continues to move in the right direction, albeit not benefiting all customer demographics equally. Macro indicators suggest an improving consumer confidence carrying into next year. But I would remind you the fourth quarter tends to be our most volatile, as weather and spending trade-offs do typically influence our business.","During the quarter, both our gross profit rate and our comparable SG&A rate declined. Gross profit rate declined 501 basis points to 45.2%, and SG&A improved on a comparable basis 367 basis points to 34.8%. This was primarily due to the acquisition of General Parts and our strong Commercial comp sales growth. Overall, both were in line with our expectations. Mike will be discussing the financials in more detail in a moment.","Turning to our integration. As I mentioned in the past we look at the integration story as having 3 distinct phases. Early in the year, we stabilized the business by first focusing on our customers and our team members by getting the teams aligned. We moved to the next phase where we began negotiation with our vendor partners while concurrently delivering quick wins to satisfy our customers by opening up availability through cross-sourcing initiatives. We are pleased with the cross-sourcing capability and have taken further steps within the quarter by expanding WORLDPAC access into roughly 3,000 Advance stores and progressing the launch of our TechNet and our CTI programs into Advance. Additionally, our initial CARQUEST store consolidations are on track.","The fourth quarter starts an exciting but intense phase of the integration work. Having now completed the vendor negotiations, we are very pleased with our product lineup. Our goal is to provide our customers with the parts that offer premium quality, proven reliability and world-class coverage. Beginning in early November and throughout 2015, we will undertake the work of initiating the product changeovers in our stores, which will include the introduction of new products and new brands for our go-forward lineup across the organization.","Alongside the product conversions, we have made changes to our field structure, creating an integrated field organization which will bring our Advance and CARQUEST U.S. operations together under one combined team. This integration of the organization will be hard work but critical to our long-term success. George will touch on this momentarily.","Looking ahead, the work on multiyear integration activities related to our supply chain infrastructure and the work of harmonizing our IT systems between CARQUEST and Advance is progressing as planned and will continue throughout 2015. We still have a long way to go with our integration work. We are undertaking one of the largest acquisition integration programs in our industry. We remain pleased with our steady progress and maintain high expectations from our teams, but recognize that the progress at times may not be linear as we get deeper into some of the really complex work streams.","I would like to take a moment to convey just how proud we are of our team members for their progress that they have driven thus far. They have worked tirelessly through the acquisition close and have come together seamlessly this year as one team to drive the successful integration outcomes thus far. Finally, as a result of all the great work by our integration teams in the quarter, I'm pleased to say we remain on track to achieve our 2014 synergy targets.","Overall, we are satisfied with our outcomes in the third quarter. We continue to stay on course based on the goals we set out at the beginning of the year. Our base business continues to be on track, and the teams continue to take steps against our goals, consistent with the execution, superior availability and service leadership goals that we had. The integration work is in its early stages but progressing as planned. Financially, we continue to be on track in our financial objectives as the team delivered a 27.7 comparable cash EPS growth in the quarter.","As we close out the fiscal year, we expect to continue our progress and deliver against our stated full year objectives. We remain confident in the strength of our Commercial Business and our ability to manage the consumer unevenness related to the DIY business. Historically, our fourth quarter is our most volatile quarter as consumers do make those choices with their discretionary spending. But this year could also have a disproportionate impact as we anniversary the benefits of last year's winter weather. That being said, we still expect to see a good selling season ahead of us as our teams continue to focus on consistent delivery against our key outcomes of sales, service and profit.","I'd like to close by once again thanking all of our team members for their tremendous hard work to deliver on our objectives and for always putting our customer first. I will now turn the call over to George Sherman. George?","George E. Sherman","Thanks, Darren, and good morning, everyone. First, I'd like to thank all of our team members for their contributions to customer service in the quarter and doing all the right things to show our customers that we put them first. At the heart of executional excellence is customer service, and our team members drove our success this quarter through their commitment to the customer.","With my prepared remarks this morning, I'll provide a view on our third quarter business performance, followed by a business update including key priorities within the quarter. Looking at sales, we are satisfied with our performance in the third quarter as the team delivered a comp store sales outcome of 1.5%. Our positive sales performance was led by strong performance in our Commercial Business and good execution by our field, merchant and supply chain teams.","Our solid comp sales performance in our Commercial Business was driven by our Northeast market leading the way, followed by our Great Lakes and Midsouth markets, and benefiting overall from both transactional and ticket growth in the quarter. Our B2B business continues to perform very well and continues to grow.","We continue to make good progress with integration of our Advance and CARQUEST commercial service programs by adding CARQUEST Technical Institute and TechNet customers to the Advance value proposition while adding Motoshop customers to the CARQUEST tool belt. The key with these programs is migrating and evolving the relationship with our commercial customer from one that is strictly transactional to one that is helping them grow their business and helping them be more successful, a greater sense of partnership and long-term loyalty that is a two-way street. This is another aspect of the integration that is immediately enhancing our base business.","Turning to our DIY business. As referenced earlier, our DIY performance was a little more uneven in the quarter. We continued to see softer demand this quarter in seasonal categories, partially offset by improvement in our average ticket. Our DIY business is very important to us, and we're making investments to further develop the depth of our value proposition. We are keenly focused on the heavy DIY customer as our core customer opportunity. We're aggressively accelerating our B2C capability, which continues to grow at consistent double-digit rates, and doubling down on the automotive systems training to deliver a greater experience to our core DIY customer.","Turning to our integration. I'll share a few additional insights from an operational perspective. This integration is still in the early innings, and it's going to be a lot of hard work over an estimated 3-year period. That said, we expect to see visible proof points of progress along the way that positively impact our base business. Our cross-sourcing initiative continues to grow, and this expansion of inventory availability positions us to say, \"Yes, we have the part.\" And in this business, if you don't have the part, you don't get to play. We're pleased with the continued progress on that front.","Leveraging the combined capabilities and the resources of both companies is at the heart of the integration. But make no mistake, it is not an aspirational or distant goal. It's real and it came to life in Dallas as we opened our first set of Advance stores last quarter. These stores are performing very well and were launched with the combined resources of both companies: The CARQUEST DC, the CARQUEST POS system and mixed field leadership team. We've leveraged Advance's super hub strategy to drive greater availability in these stores, and we will continue to leverage the combined resources and assets to drive more outcomes such as Dallas as we push forward with this integration.","As we look out over the hood towards next year, we'll be hard at work deploying the product and brand integration that Darren spoke of earlier. As we set our sights on being the best, our commercial customers are going to expect us to have the best parts and the best brands. Throughout much of next year, our teams will be focused on driving these product changeovers and bringing our customers and team members the strongest product portfolio we've ever had. Also as referenced, we have solidified our combined organizational structure for next year both in the field and at the corporate level, positioning us to operate as one unified company. While the mobilization of the teams under the combined structure cannot be measured like our cost synergies, it carries equally significant benefits of furthering the cultural and leadership synergies between the teams.","Lastly, I'd like to echo Darren's comments about how proud we are of our team members, the other reason why our integration has progressed to date as expected without any major surprises. Our team is putting its energy into making sure we lock -- making sure that we look after our customers and continue to run a strong base business.","Moving on, I'd like to update you on our supply chain initiatives. We've been methodically progressing against our supply chain objectives. The integration activities and our logistics optimization work continues to progress as expected. The work here is largely long term in nature, but as I mentioned earlier, we have quickly leveraged the CARQUEST distribution centers to open new Advance stores in new markets. And we will continue to balance the long-term supply chain foundational work with the opportunities to immediately add value to our base business -- and grow our base business.","Heading into our fourth quarter, our operational focus will be squarely set on furthering our end market availability and driving daily delivery capability and concentrating on the launch of deliveries from our Hartford DC early next year to keep moving the Advance network along to the next level of benefits.","Second, we continue to drive improvements of in-market availability through our hub store strategy. During the quarter, we added 5 hub stores through a combination of new stores and upgrades of existing stores. At the end of the quarter, our hub store count was 415, an overall increase of 45 from third quarter last year.","Third, as we look at inventory, our inventory growth was up roughly 60% year-over-year in the third quarter, primarily due to the General Parts acquisition, increased inventory assortments, our increase in new stores and hub stores and additional inventory to support the upcoming Hartford DC opening. We continue to be focused on our goal of having superior availability, the deepest assortment and investment in our strategy to get the parts closest to the customer.","Looking at our new store growth, during the quarter, we opened 47 new Advance Autopart International and CARQUEST stores. We consolidated 30 CARQUEST and BWP stores and closed 1 store, bringing the total company-operated store count to 5,305. We also added 3 WORLDPAC branches in the quarter, bringing our total branch count to 109. We are progressing as expected and continue to pace our new store openings to be in line with our guidance of between 120 and 140 new stores this fiscal year.","As I close out my remarks today, I'd like to again share how proud I am of the entire team. The integration work is difficult, and the teams have come together to keep our integration on track and more importantly, continue to deliver against our base business outcomes. Overall, we are satisfied with our business performance in the third quarter and remain on track against our expectations. We are, however, by no means content. We have far bigger ambitions for the business as we continue to take those necessary steps in the journey to becoming a continuous improvement company underpinned by a continuous improvement culture. We head into our fourth quarter with a positive outlook and the team's focused on delivering on our outcomes we set at the start of the year and continuing to stay rooted in our principles of ownership, customer focus and delivering results as rules of the road.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Mike Norona, our Chief Financial Officer.","Michael A. Norona","Thanks, George, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start by thanking all of our talented and dedicated team members for their commitment to serving our customers in the quarter and helping our company again deliver strong financial performance in our third quarter. I plan to cover the following topics with you this morning: one, provide some financial highlights from our third quarter of 2014; two, put our third quarter results into context with our expectations and key financial priorities that we use to measure our performance; and three, provide some insights on the remainder of 2014 and how we are thinking about 2015.","Before I begin my remarks about the quarter, I would like to remind everyone that unless otherwise specified, Advance will present its financials and supporting commentary on a consolidated enterprise basis and will also discuss results on a comparable basis, which excludes the impacts of onetime integration expenses related to the acquisition of both General Parts and BWP, along with any amounts related to the amortization of intangible assets resulting from the acquisition of General Parts. Also to serve as a reminder and as mentioned on our previous earnings calls this year, we refer to a conformity reclassification of supply chain costs from SG&A to gross profit and would like to reiterate this reclass continues to apply to these third quarter results and will also apply to the remaining fourth quarter of 2014. For the third quarter specifically, this reclassification was approximately 95 basis points, and year-to-date, this reclassification impact has been 85 basis points.","Moving on now to our third quarter operating results. We are pleased to report a third quarter comparable cash EPS of $1.89, a 27.7% increase from our third quarter in 2013. Included in our comparable cash EPS results in the quarter was $0.15 in acquisition synergy realization. On a GAAP basis, our third quarter EPS was $1.66, which included $0.08 of intangible assets amortization associated with the acquisition of General Parts, $0.14 of onetime integration expenses and costs to achieve synergies related to the integration of General Parts, and $0.01 in onetime costs associated with the integration of BWP.","Turning to sales. Our third quarter net sales increased 50.6% to $2.29 billion compared to our third quarter of 2013. This sales growth was principally driven by the acquisition of General Parts, the addition of new stores and our comparable same-store sales increase of 1.5%. For comparison purposes only, net sales for General Parts in our third quarter, after adjusting for selling days and holidays this year versus last year, increased approximately 2% overall to $728.9 million based on 83 days this year versus 90 days last year. For the same period, our company-operated General Parts locations grew at a rate slightly greater than 3%. Our positive same-store sales were driven by our strong performance in our Commercial Business and execution from our field and supply chain teams, partially offset by the unevenness we experienced in our DIY business driven by lower seasonal category sales. Year-to-date, our total sales increased 49.6% to $7.61 billion.","Turning to gross profit. Our gross profit dollars in the third quarter increased 35.6% to $1.03 billion from $763 million in our third quarter of 2013. Our gross profit rate of 45.2% was down 501 basis points compared to third quarter of 2013. This year-over-year rate decline was primarily due to the acquisition of General Parts, resulting in a higher mix of commercial sales that has a lower gross profit rate. Included in our gross profit results this quarter is the approximate 95 basis points conformity impact that I mentioned earlier, which was partially offset by 58 basis points of synergy savings in the quarter. Year-to-date, our gross profit rate decreased 480 basis points to 45.4% versus 50.2% over the same period last year as a result of the General Parts acquisition.","Turning to SG&A. Our comparable SG&A rate was 34.8% in the quarter, which was down 367 basis points compared to our third quarter of 2013. This year-over-year rate decline was the result of the acquired General Parts business having lower SG&A costs. SG&A also reflects the approximate 95 basis points of supply chain conformity impact mentioned earlier, partially offset by higher incentive compensation due to our sales performance versus last year. Year-to-date, our comparable SG&A rate decreased 371 basis points to 35% versus 38.8% over the same period last year, again principally due to the General Parts acquisition.","All in, our third quarter operating income dollars on a comparable basis increased 33.3% to $236.8 million, and our operating income rate decreased 134 basis points over the same period last year to 10.3%, primarily as a result of the acquisition of General Parts. Year-to-date, the company's comparable operating income rate was 10.3% versus 11.4% during the same period last year.","Operating cash flow through the third quarter was $540.3 million versus $398.5 million in the prior year. Free cash flow through the third quarter improved to $378.8 million versus $250.8 million in the prior year.","Our AP ratio for the quarter was 78.4% versus 83.5% last year. This decline was expected due to the acquisition of General Parts. And as previously shared, we see continued opportunities to improve our AP ratio as a combined company.","At the end of the third quarter, we had roughly $1.73 billion of debt on our balance sheet. And our adjusted debt to EBITDA was 2.8x and was in line with our expectations. During the quarter, we paid down approximately $133 million of debt and remained focused on our commitment to quickly pay down debt with our free cash flow to get back below the 2.5x leverage ratio and maintain our investment-grade ratings.","We continue to measure the performance of our business and prioritize our investments to achieve growth, profit and value creation. Our growth engine continues to be our Commercial Business, which again delivered solid growth in the third quarter, helping us deliver our fourth consecutive quarter of positive comps. We continue investing in new store growth and new market development and continue laying the tracks for growth from our investment in inventory availability. We also see growth from our service initiatives by relentlessly focusing on people investments through ongoing team member training.","Turning to profit. We are pleased with our 33.3% comparable operating income dollar growth versus the previous year and the 10.3% comparable operating income rate that we achieved in our third quarter. We see continued opportunities to improve our profitability, as measured by our operating income dollar growth, through consistent sales growth, leveraging our size and scale and improving our cost efficiency. We also remain on track to achieve our 1-year cost synergies of $45 million to $55 million on our way to achieving the total expected cost synergies of $160 million over the next 3 years.","With respect to value creation, the acquisition of General Parts provides us a compelling opportunity to drive shareholder returns through incremental earnings and strong cash flows. We saw this in our third quarter with a 27.7% increase in our comparable cash EPS. We continue to be focused on improving our free cash flow through our disciplined capital deployment, consistent operating results and working capital management, primarily in the areas of inventory management and AP ratio. We are pleased with the progress we made in these areas in the quarter. Our focus on free cash flow is enabling us to pay down our debt to get back to our previously stated leverage ceiling of 2.5x by the end of 2015. We continue to be on pace to achieve this outcome. Once our debt is paid down, we will continue to optimize our capital structure to maximize shareholder value.","Turning to the balance of the year. We are pleased with our outcomes through the third quarter and are on track towards achieving our full year objectives as we enter our fourth quarter. As a reminder, Q4 is our lowest volume and most volatile quarter as we compete with the holiday shopping season and seasonally lower demand for parts. Additionally, and as Darren referenced earlier, Q4 will see the anniversary of the unseasonably cold winter weather benefit the industry experienced last year. That being said, we expect our Commercial Business strength to continue. As a result, we are maintaining our sales comp guidance of low single digits for the full year and are maintaining our annual 2014 comparable cash EPS full year outlook of $7.50 to $7.60.","As we look to 2015, our priorities will largely remain unchanged. At the highest level, we will continue to focus on running a solid base business and successfully integrating General Parts. Financially, our objectives will be similar to 2014, with our focus on driving top line growth and growing bottom line profit as we enter our second full year as a combined company. We expect our top line growth to be fueled by continued strong Commercial comps, improved execution, new stores and continued improvements in our inventory availability. We look towards 2015 with industry fundamentals that continue to hold steady, and while there are some macro indicators that could lead to improved consumer confidence, we believe consumers will still be faced with choices for their discretionary spend.","We expect to improve our profitability of the combined company through our work to improve our gross profit rate and cost structure and remain committed to our 3-year goal of achieving $160 million in cost synergies. We will provide a more detailed annual outlook on our fourth quarter earnings call.","In closing, we are satisfied with our performance in the quarter and continue to be on track toward delivering our full year outlook. Our focus continues to be on our 2 key priorities of delivering on our base business outcomes and successfully integrating General Parts. We continue to be pleased with the improvements our teams continue to make each quarter with our execution in the spirit of driving consistent sales, service and profit outcomes. The integration is progressing as expected, with the team delivering on the planned synergy benefits.","I want to once again thank our 75,000 talented team members for what they do each day to serve our customers, inspire our team and grow our great company. Operator, we are now ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question today is from Michael Lasser with UBS.","Michael Lasser - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","On the comp result within the AAP business, if we look at a multiyear stack basis, it did decelerate a bit this quarter despite having more inventory across the company and more inventory availability through some of the cross-sourcing. Recognizing that DIY was a little choppier, maybe you can give us some more detail on what drove the deceleration this quarter.","Darren R. Jackson","Michael, you said it. When I look at the quarter and I look across North America, our West Coast locations, principally WORLDPAC, were closer to double digit. Our Canadian locations were closer to double digit. CARQUEST, we talked about the core CARQUEST-owned locations, that we talked about in our conference call script. AAP maintained its trends in its Commercial comp business. And DIY was the one -- we started slow and we signaled that at the beginning of the second quarter. And it was uneven. It strengthened throughout the quarter. It was principally seasonal categories. I think when you put it all into context -- and again, you could -- if you parse out our AI business was -- AI-owned locations, those were closer to flat. So that tends to drag on the core AAP comp overall. And so when I look at it, we continue -- and George, you may have a couple of comments on this, just the DIY plagued us this quarter a little bit in its unevenness. And for us, that's actually not a new story. What was encouraging is it did strengthen over the course of the quarter. Would you add anything?","George E. Sherman","Yes, not much to add, Darren. I think you said the key themes. It started early on at the very beginning of Q3, and we sequentially improved our comps throughout the quarter. And our business got stronger, including in DIY. The Commercial results were good throughout the quarter, and we remain very, very confident in our ability to execute our new Commercial value prop and get stronger there.","Michael Lasser - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. That's very helpful. And then my follow-up is it looks like you got about $13 million of gross margin synergies for the quarter. As you look forward, is that a realistic number that we can think about as a run rate? Or is there -- are you going to see a disproportionate benefit from the gross margin -- some of the purchasing stuff at the beginning, and then that's going to tail off over time?","Michael A. Norona","Yes, so it's Mike. You're right. We were just a tad over $13.3 million in terms of our gross margin benefits. It was about 58 basis points in the quarter. And I think what we said at the end of our second quarter is we expected quarter 4 to have a little bit more purchasing coming in. So we would expect that number to continue to be strong in the fourth quarter. We haven't broke out SG&A. We've talked about our synergy number. And I think what I would tell you on synergies is we expect our -- we expect to be at the high end of our synergy range that we've given you for the year, and a bigger portion of that will be our purchasing benefits.","Operator","The next question is from Greg Melich with Evercore ISI.","Gregory S. Melich - Evercore ISI, Research Division","I want to see how we're doing on the closing stores, so the incremental 30 stores, what sort of sales transfer rate we were able to achieve in the quarter? And then the follow-up would be, I know you talked about supply chain and some of the big changes there. Do we have the plan yet as to how many DCs will ultimately be consolidated or shifted? Or when should we expect that plan?","George E. Sherman","Greg, it's George. I think in the consolidation stores, they're very much in line with our expectations. So as we begin to consolidate stores, the sales are transferring over at the rate that we expected. There is a bit of impact to other stores where, when you're moving commercial customers and commercial accounts, they sometimes go to Strom [ph] and CARQUEST stores initially, and will ultimately make their way to the Advance store, but very much where we expected it to be. On the distribution center side, I'm just going to repeat where we've gone in the past on that one. Our logistics network optimization work is winding down. We are beginning to execute on that plan. But in terms of DC consolidations or closures, we'll communicate those internally first and we'll go from there.","Darren R. Jackson","Yes, and just to remind you, Greg, these first 100, both in terms of principally sales productivity, they were at the low end of the band. And if we don't transfer any sales, we'll still make a little bit of money. I mean, these were stores that, by and large, were borderline stores that we had to make a decision whether you'd close it or not. And again, part of it is these are going to be done at scale over the next couple of years, and with the teams learning their way through, how do you successfully transfer team members, transfer customers. And so what we're looking to achieve -- as George said, we're right on track. And matter of fact, we've learned a few things in terms of this first group of stores in terms of the transition of customers that will help as we go through the balance of the store transitions in the next few years.","Gregory S. Melich - Evercore ISI, Research Division","Could you remind us of the expectation? Was it 70%?","Darren R. Jackson","Well, I think I got in trouble last time, to be honest, because I said some of them are over 100. And that's a true statement when we create capacity and service levels. So some of them, we're seeing over 100. What we said in BWP is that if we get 60% to 70%, we feel really good about where we are. And as George said, we're on track with those numbers. I just don't want people to run away and assume that these first 100 are actually at the same productivity as the average of the chain.","Operator","The next question is from Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets.","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Can you talk about both the opportunities as well as the potential risks here related to some of the merchandising and product changes that you're making in the stores?","George E. Sherman","Sure, Scot. I think just starting off with the opportunity side, we think we have a great opportunity to put together a just fantastic house of brands. So when you look of the go-forward position of the combined CARQUEST-Advance entity, we've done some of that work already. We've introduced Monroe to the Canadian market, and we've seen some very nice results from that and are very, very pleased with the way that, that went. I think the risk side is this integration is hard work. And for the first year or so, we've done a very good job of separating integration rhythms and run the business rhythms. But ultimately, the manifestation of most of the work that we do in the integration shows up on the phone, in the shop or in the store, and that's happening now. So we are in the physical portion of the product hierarchy work, actually relabeling in stores. And we've -- we're happy with the early results on that one, and we think that we've mitigated risk in terms of any kind of distraction to the team.","Darren R. Jackson","Yes, Scot, the only thing I'd add is that our team members, they get excited about selling premium products and commercial-grade products. And when they have the focus on these changeovers, as George said, in our Canadian business, when they have a level excitement about it, they get their customers excited. And we've seen good results, albeit we're into the very first inning on some of these product changeovers. And so I think the opportunity for us, when it's all done, is across not just the 5,200 owned stores but including the independents, we're going to have a consistency of product offerings that really will be commercially led in terms of our Advance organization. They're very excited about the CARQUEST-branded products coming. They're very excited about some of the new brands that are coming. Let's say in terms of the CARQUEST organization, they're glad to see some of those brands come back. Some of them, they've had before. And I was with some independents in Las Vegas, and we're having great success in terms of the initial transition of some of those products. I'll tell you what the risk is, is that you're going to be reboxing, relabeling and repositioning, which is all activity, and those are activity in our stores. And what we have to balance in 2015, I mean we'll be a broken record on this, we got to get the product right and we have to get the people right. When we get product and people right, our business tends to work. And so that intensity of making sure that the excitement of new products, balanced by the reality of the work to get them in, doesn't end up disrupting our relationships with customers and take our eye off the ball in terms of the base business.","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Got it. That's very helpful. And then just a quick clarification. When you guys talk about strength in Commercial, I know you guys don't break out specific comps, but can we assume that's kind of a mid-single-digit number? That's how you would think of \"strength?\"","Darren R. Jackson","Well, we would think at least a mid-single-digit number constitutes strength.","Operator","The next question is from Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Two quick ones. First of all, from your commentary on DIY, it sounds like your DIY comps, probably on the whole for the third quarter, was below the second quarter level. Can you tell us how the third quarter Commercial comp compared to the second quarter Commercial comp?","Darren R. Jackson","Yes, so you're right, Matt. Our DIY comp was the principal driver of taking down the overall comp, and it was below the second quarter. In the third quarter, it was in line with the second quarter overall.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So then -- Commercial then you're saying was in line?","Darren R. Jackson","In line.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then second question, if you could just give us an update as to what you're seeing with your work on daily delivery and how those stores are faring and the impact that you're seeing on sales momentum, inventory utilization, et cetera?","George E. Sherman","Yes, Matt, it's George. We continue to be pleased with our daily delivery stores in terms of the overall sales results. I think if you look at the domino effect of that, what it will ultimately do is allow us to pull back in our maxis at store level and increase our SKU coverage inside the store. So that's kind of the work in progress and the work ahead of us. Most of our attention on daily delivery has turned to our Hartford DC. That began receiving in Q3, ships in Q4 and is going to have a pretty significant ramp up. So that is our next big footprint in the Northeast in terms of daily delivery, is opening up Hartford.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And George, now that you're deeper into Indianapolis and the work that you've done, any quantification of the benefit to a market when you make this change?","Darren R. Jackson","Yes. Matt, this is Darren. I think if you go back to what we've said publicly is that if we see -- initially, if we said a 3% lift in terms of the market relative to the control stores, then we're in good shape. We've been exceeding that, so we're very pleased with it. And as George said, Hartford I think opens up next week in terms of the business, and we think that will be real helpful for that Northeast part of our business.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And that benefit, just my final follow-up, that benefit comes primarily on the Commercial side?","Darren R. Jackson","It actually comes on both. It's more pronounced on the Commercial side, but we're seeing it on both sides of the business.","Operator","The next question is from Michael Baker with Deutsche Bank.","Michael Baker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I wanted to ask you about the program where you're putting the WORLDPAC products in 3,000 Advance auto stores. Can you discuss any early results there? What kind of comp lift you see in those stores? And I guess a follow-up to that, is that part of the broader re-merchandising that you're talking about for 2015?","Darren R. Jackson","Yes. Do you want to do it, George?","George E. Sherman","Yes, it's not part of the re-merchandising for 2015. It is simply an inherent benefit of our new enterprise. When we say 3,000 stores, please understand that's a rolling number. So some have been on it for a week or 2, and some have been on it for a couple of months. Where we see the benefit again, as we said in the script, is just saying yes to customers. And obviously, it gives us a level of import authority that we love having in our stores. So it's great from a cost standpoint in that we're looking with inside the company versus outside to second source, and another good reason to say yes, but it's not part of that overall assortment.","Darren R. Jackson","Yes.","Michael Baker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And I guess in the ones that have had -- the stores that have had that program I mean, is there a measurable lift to the same-store sales in those stores?","Darren R. Jackson","Here's what I would say, Michael. The lift that we're seeing in there, I wouldn't run out and put an extra point of comp in your model. And the reason I say that is it takes time. So in order to get access to the product, what you're doing is putting the system in the store called speedDIAL, that speedDIAL product gives you visibility into WORLDPAC warehouses that are around our locations. And what has to happen over time is that it's not an on-off switch. The customers, just the general repair customers, they're generally working on a lot of domestic vehicles, a lot of import\/Asian vehicles, some European vehicles. WORLDPAC's strength tends to be across all of import, principally European. And so those general repair shops first have to understand you have it. And then second, they have to get comfortable in terms of ordering it from you, and you build that business over time. It's not a light switch business. What it does for the Advance stores principally, and we saw this with the CARQUEST stores, it builds commercial credibility, is that part of our value proposition at Advance over time has really been this evolution from the perception of retail to the reality of being a commercial provider. So it's one more thing that gives us commercial consistency and credibility, and more than anything else helps us sell the balance of the products in the portfolio in those stores.","Michael Baker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","That makes sense. If I could just jump on a little more short-term issue. Just on the comps, you said business got better throughout the quarter. Do you look at that on a stacked basis? Was it better even on a stacked basis? And then -- you've given us some good granularity on the comps, I am wondering if you could tell us a fourth quarter expectation. I mean, do you expect comps to be positive against a tougher comparison?","Darren R. Jackson","Yes, I would say this, Mike, is that -- and this is a line George uses internally, is that we're pleased with our positive comp performance, but we're not satisfied. We'd be disappointed with comps that weren't positive. And so as we look at the fourth quarter, yes, it gets a little bit more difficult, principally right at the end of the quarter is when the cold weather really came into the business. And predicting that, we're just not in that business as to how the weather is going to be at the very end of the quarter. Our expectations with our teams and our goals for the teams are absolutely positive comps.","Operator","The next question is from Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities.","Seth Basham - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","My first question is looking at gross margins and the core business. If you try to exclude the synergies that you guys achieved this quarter, how are gross margins for that core business?","Michael A. Norona","Hey, Seth, it's Mike. So if you remember at the beginning of the year, we kind of gave you a range of, last year if you put these businesses together, in the range of 45.5 to 46. And we said that we expected the gross margins to be up modestly on the year. If you look at a year-to-date basis, and again, if you take that 45.4% number that we are year-to-date and you back out the supply chain reclass of about 85 basis points and the year-to-date synergies of about 48, we're modestly above that number. And the big drivers of that obviously are we've mixed in more commercial, and there's some good stories to that. Obviously, our national accounts are growing, so we're mixing in more of that. Some of the categories like tools and equipment are growing a little bit lower gross margin, so we expected some of that mix. So year-to-date, we feel good about the gross margin. And then obviously, over time, as our merchandising capabilities kick in, our global sourcing capabilities kick in, we expect that we will see some upside there. In the quarter, the average for the quarter was slightly below what our year-to-date was. So I think we came in at a 45.2%. There's a little bit of -- there's a little bit of noise in there from some inventory growth at AAP last year. In Q3 last year, I think our inventory grew about 12.3%. This year, it grew about 8.3%, so that's a little bit of a headwind. We got a little bit more supply chain cost this year caused by some of the daily replenishment. Hartford, we're starting to receive there. And then the last little bit of headwind we faced is whenever the DIY, we experience a little bit of softness in DIY, obviously, that impacts our gross profit rate. But in general, we're pretty well right on plan to where we expected to be from a gross margin perspective.","Seth Basham - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then my follow-up is just around AI. Can you give us some sense of what your plans are for that business in the future? Are you planning on closing the stores, consolidating them? How do we think about that?","Darren R. Jackson","Yes, well, our AI business, what are we, 200 stores now team in terms of that business. We have a lot to say grace over right now. And so what we've been doing with AI at this point is we have slowed their growth. And like last year, I think we added a few stores in the Panhandle last year.","George E. Sherman","We did. We closed -- consolidated some of the Panhandle, just as will again this year in North Florida. We'll look for ways to optimize the profitability of AI in their overall business results. And we understand it's a long distribution channel to come from Massachusetts to Florida for that brand. And the product mix changes pretty drastically when you move down to the southeastern part of the country, where AI really built a business around some great undercarriage categories in areas like exhaust, where they're very strong. So the mix tends to change.","Darren R. Jackson","Yes. And I'd say, you asked how we're thinking about it as we look out, I'll tell you one of the things that we see is that we have our WORLDPAC team working with our AI team. WORLDPAC's coverage in North America allows us to take some of that AI product, and we're doing this without giving away competitive markets right now. We see the opportunity to leverage some of their private label premium product categories into markets where we're not overlapped. And so we've asked that team to kind of build out the blueprint in terms of how do you get more leverage on the AI product brand through WORLDPAC in select markets.","Operator","Our final question today is from Chris Horvers with JPMorgan.","Christopher Horvers - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","There's a lot of questions on what's going on in Florida broadly right now with one of your big competitors pushing into that market. So can you talk about your delivery capabilities as they are now, what they will be and what they were prior and from a daily delivery perspective? And any comments on the performance of that market overall would be helpful.","Darren R. Jackson","Yes. Chris, when you helicopter up, overall, I think what we would say -- in our conference call we highlighted the markets that were real standouts. But we were pleased generally across all of our footprint, particularly with our Commercial Business. When you get into Florida, you could pick Florida, you could pick other parts of the country. We have competition showing up everywhere. And where we've positioned Florida in terms of daily replenishment is that -- principally in that Orlando market, Tampa market, parts of the northern Panhandle, we're using a manual type of process, increased to daily replenishment in those stores. It's not the most cost-effective way to do it, so over time we'll double back and improve kind of the system and processes to get that done. We see an opportunity to extend that all the way to markets like Miami, too. So we're working through that as we go forward. At this point, overall, we recognize -- I mean, it's like us going into Dallas. We see markets where we're understored. We expect our competition to see markets where they are understored and just keep growing. We know from history that tends to actually put pressure principally on the DIY business. Because you're taking a business that is essentially a very low grower and just splitting it amongst locations. And customers tend to go to stores that are closest to them in that business. And so if your question, are we feeling some of that pain when competition comes in? Yes. Is that new? No. We see that generally. And similarly in markets where we go in, I imagine you'd ask our competitors if they see the same thing and they would likely say, \"Yes, we do.\" And so we've prepared for it. We knew it was coming. And so now we just have to manage our way through it. We've done this in Atlanta, Chicago and many other markets. So we've seen it before. It's roughly a 2-year type of cycle and then we work our way through it. Anything else, George?","George E. Sherman","Yes, the daily delivery in Tampa and Orlando is new this year. It's something that we did in preparation for more of a competitive environment in Florida. And we'd naturally like to get that throughout the state. But as you look at Miami, it's some of our absolute best hub and super hub network build-out, and we're very, very pleased with our parts availability in that market. So will we get there with daily delivery? Yes, we will eventually as a matter of natural pacing. But we like our parts availability in Florida.","Christopher Horvers - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then -- and so in the core AAP stores, what percentage of the stores or number of stores have daily delivery currently?","Darren R. Jackson","Oh, we're probably -- what, almost 600 stores, George?","George E. Sherman","Yes, right in that ballpark or so.","Christopher Horvers - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then Hartford will add how many more?","George E. Sherman","Well, Hartford over time, eventually, up to 400.","Christopher Horvers - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then just an accounting question for Mike. As you think about the incentive comp pressure that you saw in the third quarter, any quantification there would be great. And with the 53rd week, how does that impact your margin structure? Where does more of the leverage come through in that '15, '16, '17 sense?","Michael A. Norona","Yes, so the -- I'll do your 53rd week. That's an estimate for us and quite frankly, it's a challenging one because it -- that 53rd week comes right at the beginning of the year, and you just never know what the weather is going to be. I almost wish it was in the middle of the year because there's less volatility the middle of the year than there is at the end of the year. But it's just -- it's projecting some sales. It's projecting a gross profit margin rate and it's projecting SG&A, variable SG&A and a fixed portion -- fixed allocation, so it's nothing more than that. And that's our best estimate. And the good news is it's a nice comparable week, so I don't think it will any impact, plus or minus, to how we think about the quarter or the outlook we've given. Obviously, our outlook does not include the 53rd week. And then in terms of your second question was incentive comp. The comment in the script was really designed about the year-over-year. Last year, I think we did a minus 2 comp. This year, we did a 1.5 comp. We pay our team members, from whether you're a General Manager or whether you're the CEO, to grow our sales and to grow our profits. And we did a better job this quarter versus last quarter -- sorry, versus last year Q3. And that's why we saw a little bit more incentive comp. So that's what the comment relates to.","Darren R. Jackson","Yes, principally, at store level.","Michael A. Norona","At store level, yes.","Operator","Thank you. And that does conclude the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back over to Zaheed Mawani for any final comments.","Zaheed Mawani","Great.

I\u2019m joined by Tom Greco, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jeff Shepherd, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Following their prepared remarks, we will turn our attention to answering your questions.","Before we begin, please be advised that our comments today may include forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

The content of this call will be governed by the information contained in our earnings release and related financial statements.","Now, let me turn the call over to Tom Greco.","Tom Greco","Thanks, Elisabeth. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today as we review our second quarter 2019.","Before we begin, I\u2019d like to thank our more than 70,000 team members and our network of Carquest Independents for their continued commitment towards our long-term goals.","In the second quarter, net sales increased to $2.3 billion and comparable store sales were flat. Our adjusted operating income margin of 8.4% decreased 40 basis points, compared to the prior year quarter. And our adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 1.5% to $2.","Through the first half of 2019, our net sales increased 1.6% with comparable store sales up 1.5%. Year-to-date, our adjusted operating income margin of 8.3% increased 7 basis points, and our adjusted diluted EPS was $4.46, an increase of 9.6%. While our Q2 results were below our expectations, we remain confident in our ability to capitalize on the significant opportunity ahead. We\u2019re relentlessly focused on the disciplined execution of our long-term strategic plan to enable sales growth, margin expansion and meaningful cash flow improvement.","As you saw in our press release, we updated our full-year guidance ranges, slightly narrowing our sales and adjusted OI margin ranges, while increasing our free cash flow expectations for the year.","Jeff will provide further details of our financial results momentarily. However, I want to spend some time reviewing our performance, both in Q2 and year-to-date. As we said in the past, the spring selling season startle our first and second quarter each year, which can impact performance between the two quarters. We saw this play out in our first half results. In contrast to 2018, when we had a soft finish to Q1, and a very strong start to Q2, the exact opposite occurred this year. In fact, during the last four weeks of our Q1 this year, comp sales were up mid single digits.","The week our Q2 began on April 21st, the weather turned cooler and wetter than historic norms and significantly cooler and weather than 2018. As a result, comp sales during the first four weeks of our Q2 were down, driven entirely by DIY retail. In fact, our first full month of the quarter was one of the wettest Mays on record with many parts of the U.S. also reporting below average temperatures. For these reasons, it\u2019s beneficial to consider our performance over the front half of the year to smooth out seasonal volatility from quarter-to-quarter. With this in mind, we delivered growth in the first half of the year with net sales up 1.6%, well within our full-year guidance range. While this is the strongest first half performance we\u2019ve reported since 2015 on both the one and two-year stack basis, it\u2019s clearly below our internal sales expectations.","As we look at the different channels of our business, our professional business delivered growth across all manners, as pro is less impacted by weather volatility. Compared to our stated goal of growing at or above market growth rates, our professional business performed well in both Q1 and Q2, and is building momentum. Importantly, professional grew in each of the three periods in Q2, and our two-year stack accelerated. Our team is focused on delighting the customer and driving continuous improvement every day.","We have the broadest assortment of parts in the industry, including national brands, OE and private label, which is critically important for our professional customers. Consistent with our ongoing integration efforts, we\u2019re strengthening the effectiveness of our enterprise catalog, AdvancePro, leveraging cross-banner visibility and integrating our enterprise assortment. In addition, during the first half of the year, we continued to roll out dynamic assortment. All of these actions are enabling us to improve stock and close rates and reduce order to delivery times and therefore say yes, more often. This is evidenced by double-digit growth in both strategic accounts and Technet customers in Q2.","In addition to driving growth across our professional business, we continue to make progress on our DIY omnichannel e-commerce platforms. During the second quarter, we enhanced customer notification capabilities on order tracking and executed multiple website upgrades to further improve the usability and functionality of our website for our customers. This drove a substantial year-over-year increase in online traffic, improved conversion rates, and resulted in double-digit growth for both online transactions and sales.","We\u2019re relentlessly focused on improving the omnichannel customer experience with further initiatives planned for the balance of the year. Stepping back to assess our DIY retail business, we\u2019re disappointed in our first half performance. We attribute this to both external and internal factors. There\u2019s no doubt the weather trends had an impact on our second quarter performance in DIY retail. We finished the last four weeks of Q1 up mid-single-digits and then gave nearly all of that back in the first four weeks of Q2.","Demand remained soft throughout the balance of May, and therefore, we did not begin to recover from this until very late in the quarter. This was reflected in the performance of our regions as our growth slowed significantly in Q2 versus Q1 in northern markets like the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, and Great Lakes regions, where we have a disproportionate concentration of stores. Our strongest Q2 performance was in the Carolinas, Midwest and West regions.","From a category perspective, we saw the highest growth in brakes, filters and batteries. Not surprisingly, cooling and engine management related products were down significantly in Q2, particularly in those same northern geographies. These categories are already recovering in the third quarter with the extreme heat impacting a large portion of the U.S. And the very regions that slowed down in Q2 are leading the improvement we\u2019ve seen in the early weeks of Q3. Given the improved demand we saw with more normalized weather late in Q2 and in the early part of our Q3, we expect comp sales growth in the back half of the year, resulting in an acceleration of our two-year stack. All that said, there are some internal factors that need to be addressed in DIY retail. We believe there\u2019s plenty of room for improvement in our retail business that is not weather-dependent, and we\u2019re committed to addressing those factors that are within our control.","According to syndicated data, following the share gain in DIY retail in Q4 of last year, our share in the first half of the year was down slightly. There are a couple of drivers we\u2019ve identified and are addressing. Part of our shortfall was concentrated in certain categories where our actions did not produce the desired results. Therefore, we\u2019ve taken the appropriate steps to address these opportunities and have already seen improvements.","In addition, we have a number of initiatives planned for both Q3 and Q4 to stimulate sales growth in DIY retail. First, we\u2019re laser-focused on improving retail traffic to accelerate growth, which requires us to improve the effectiveness of our marketing. In line with this priority, I\u2019m pleased to welcome Jason McDonell to the Advance team to lead our enterprise-wide marketing function as EVP and Chief Marketing Officer. Jason brings an extensive background in digital and brand marketing. He\u2019s already focused on driving traffic and improving the impact of our marketing investments.","Secondly, we\u2019re standardizing and significantly improving our buy online, pick up in store experience by reducing friction for our customers who make purchases on our website and come to our stores to pick up parts. We know they want to get in and out of the store quickly. We expect to accelerate our buy online, pick up in store growth in the back half, by providing a dedicated and convenient location in every store.","A third element of our DIY plan in the back half is to drive improved royalty. The key platform here is the launch of our new Speed Perks 2.0 program. Following considerable time listening to our customers and testing Speed Perks 2.0, we now offer the best rewards program in the industry. We tested our Speed Perks platform in two markets over a 20-week timeframe. In these lead markets, we delivered significant increases in both Speed Perks signups and average dollar spent per member versus control group source. We recently launched our new program nationally, and our field team is executing very well, driving double-digit increases in Speed Perks signups.","Finally, I\u2019m pleased to announce that we launched the first phase of our partnership with walmart.com, late in the second quarter as planned. We\u2019re being very-disciplined with this launch, which includes a select assortment of parts that will ramp over time to ensure all capabilities are functioning well and the customer experience is best in class. This includes standing up our online store within a store on walmart.com.","We expect our branded Advance Auto Parts store on walmart.com will drive incremental growth for our newly formed partnership. In the second phase, we expect to enable additional customer fulfillment options, including in-store pick up at Advance locations.","Together with Walmart, we have an outstanding team in place working collaboratively to deliver a world class online shopping and fulfillment experience for our mutual customers. We\u2019re excited about our progress so far, and will continue to strengthen our online platform to capture the omnichannel growth opportunity ahead.","To summarize our topline performance in the front half of 2019, we\u2019re pleased with our results on professional and DIY e-com with DIY retail, a work-in-progress. We\u2019re in the process of executing several back half initiatives in DIY retail that we expect will improve performance in an important channel for growth and profitability.","Moving on to margin expansion. The entire AAP team remains focused on the unique opportunity we have to drive increased profitability and cash flow through the four areas we\u2019ve discussed. First, in terms of driving sales and profit per store, we continued to optimize our footprint. In the second quarter, we closed and consolidated 21 stores, which brings our total to 59 stores this year. Over the past 52 weeks, we closed and consolidated 125 stores. Consistent with previous quarters, we\u2019re also capitalizing on strategic growth opportunities, which includes opening four new Worldpac branches in the second quarter, bringing our total to 7 new branches this year. The Worldpac team is executing very well. And Bob Cushing continues to leverage Worldpac\u2019s industry leading capabilities across all of AAP.","In addition, I\u2019m extremely pleased with our Independent team\u2019s unrelenting focus on growth. And I\u2019m excited to welcome 19 new independently owned Carquest locations in the second quarter. Our Carquest Independents have terrific momentum, and we continue to drive sales growth leveraging many of the new tools and technology we\u2019re deploying across the enterprise. Overall, we made progress in the first half in improving sales per store as we optimize our footprint.","One of our largest areas of investment this year is across our supply chain in DC wages, standardization and new technology. Our cross-banner replenishment initiative will enable us to ship parts from our legacy red or blue DCs to either red or blue stores. We\u2019re now making daily replenishment deliveries to a group of Carquest stores, including Independent locations from a legacy Advance or red DC, as well as a select group of Advance stores from a legacy Carquest for blue DC. We expect to scale these capabilities to other DCs and stores later this year in a market-by-market approach. Once this is fully rolled out, which we plan to complete by mid-2021, we expect improved product availability, increased inventory turns and significant cost savings. As part of this, we\u2019re reviewing ways to improve delivery speed for all customers.","While our in-store pick up option continues to be the preferred fulfillment method, we\u2019re committed to broadening our reach and reducing order to delivery times to further improve the customer experience. Rounding up supply chain, we announced that we will close our DC located in Armonk, New York, later this year.","Our actions in supply chain are gaining momentum. And we expect to leverage supply chain costs in the back half of 2019. In terms of category management, our merchant team remains focused on material cost optimization, improving private label as a percent of mix, and the implementation of strategic pricing actions, based on new analytical tools we\u2019ve built in conjunction with dynamic assortment. Our supplier partners are playing a critical role as we execute this plan. Collaborating together, we expect increased sales, improved margins and reduced inventory.","Our fourth margin expansion opportunity is within SG&A, where we have several integration and cost saving initiatives underway. A primary example here is the focus we placed on building a safety culture at AAP. I\u2019m thrilled that we once again reduced our total recordable injury rate by 15%. And our lost time rate, which measures our most severe injuries, improved 32% in the second quarter. Safety is just one example of how we\u2019re building a winning culture at Advance, with the goal of being the employer of choice for our industry. Targeted investments in our people, highlighted by our unique fuel the frontline stock ownership program, best in class industry training, as well as new tools and technology continues to reduce team member turnover. I\u2019m particularly happy with the progress we\u2019re making across the enterprise on team member retention. Our overall annualized turnover declined by 29% compared to the end of 2018, which includes a 17% reduction across our supply chain organization.","To summarize our performance in the front half of the year, the investments we\u2019re making to unlock long-term growth and margin expansion are on track. As we said before, this transformation will not be completely linear. We\u2019re laser-focused on executing our strategic plan. And as evidenced in Q2, we will not make short-term decisions that limit the long-term opportunity due to near-term volatility. We have a great team in place that\u2019s dedicated to the flawless execution of our strategy, building competitive advantage and driving substantial shareholder value.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Jeff for details on our financial performance.","Jeff Shepherd","Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone.","In the second quarter, our adjusted gross profit was $1 billion, a decrease nearly of 1% from the prior year quarter. On a rate basis, our adjusted gross profit margin of 43.3%, decline by 42 basis points from the prior year quarter, driven by product margin, which is primarily related to lower DIY mix, as well as planned investments in supply chain wages. These were partially offset by improvements in utilization and management of on-hand inventory. We also saw higher costs related to inflation and tariffs, which given our LIFO accounting methodology requires us to absorb these cost increases as soon as we receive the product at the higher price.","The good news is, we\u2019ve been successful in passing through these increases to-date through price. And the LIFO impact on cost evens out over time. Since we\u2019ve been anticipating the tariffs for months, we\u2019ve been working collaboratively with our suppliers to mitigate these cost increases. Where possible, we\u2019re using on-hand inventory in lieu of purchasing at higher costs.","Year-to-date, our adjusted gross profit was $2.3 billion, an increase of 1.7% from the prior year quarter. On a rate basis, our adjusted gross profit margin of 44% was in line with the prior year.","Our adjusted SG&A was $813 million in the second quarter, an increase of $1.4 million year-over-year, as our productivity efforts offset investments we\u2019re making this year. As we said previously, our primary investments are in technology, specifically professional services related to ongoing integration efforts, and in marketing, which includes e-commerce investments.","On a rate basis, our adjusted SG&A was flat compared to the prior quarter at 34.9%. Our adjusted SG&A through the second quarter was $1.9 billion, which increased 1.5%. On a rate basis our year-to-date adjusted SG&A improved by 5 basis points. Adjusted operating income in Q2 was $196.4 million, a 4.3% decrease from Q2 2018. Our adjusted OI margin decreased 40 basis points to 8.4% in the quarter, driven by lack of sales growth, as well as the channel mix headwinds we face in gross margin, which we highlighted previously.","Year-to-date adjusted OI was $440 million, an increase of 2.5% compared to the first half of the prior year. On a rate basis, the year-to-date adjusted OI margin of 8.3% was up 7 basis points compared to the prior year. Adjusted diluted EPS for Q2 was $2, an increase of 1.5% and our year-to-date adjusted diluted EPS increased 9.6% to $4.46.","In terms of capital spending, we invested $50 million in Q2, an increase of nearly $23 million, compared to Q2 of the prior year. Our largest investments were related to our next-gen network, as well as other IT initiatives to improve productivity within our stores, as well as our customer support center, such as our finance ERP is expected to be completed in 2020. Year-to-date, we\u2019ve increased our capital spending nearly $50 million to $111 million. As a reminder, many of our capital investments this year have corresponding operating expenses, which to-date are in line with our expectations for the full year.","Moving on to working capital, we made significant progress on our AP ratio. Notably, our AP ratio at the end of Q2 was 75.8%, an increase of nearly 600 basis points, compared to the prior year quarter. This continued progress together with our disciplined working capital improvements, enabled free cash flow for the first six months of $381 million. This was essentially flat year-over-year as improvements in working capital were entirely offset by the planned increases in capital spending.","Consistent with our capital allocation priorities of maintaining investment grade ratings, reinvesting in the business and returning excess cash back to shareholders, I\u2019m pleased with our leverage ratio of 2.1.","Building on our confidence to continue generating significant cash flow from the business coupled with disciplined capital allocation priorities, I\u2019m pleased to announce a new $400 million share repurchase authorization. As Tom mentioned, we remain incredibly disciplined in our approach to delivering our long-term goals. As we begin the third quarter, we\u2019re seeing an improvement in seasonal demand, and our team is capitalizing on this every day to delight our customers.","In the short term, we\u2019re absolutely determined to deliver the highest possible growth, expand margins, and drive free cash flow without compromising long-term success of our transformation, which is why we\u2019ve provided a heightened transparency on our plans for this year.","We remain confident in our ability to deliver results within the full year guidance ranges that we originally provided earlier this year. However, we recognize the top end of the comparable store sales and adjusted OI margin expansions may be challenging to achieve. Therefore, we slightly lowered the top end of our ranges. Our updated guidance includes net sales in a range of $9.65 billion to $9.75 billion, comparable store sales range of 1% to 2% and adjusted OI margin expansion of 20 to 40 basis points for the year. However, with the continued strength of our working capital efforts, we increased our free cash flow gains for the full year and expect to deliver a minimum of $700 million in free cash flow in 2019.","With that, let\u2019s open it up to addressing your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Chris Horvers with J.P. Morgan. Your line is now open.","Chris Horvers","Thanks, and good morning. So, first on the guide. So Jeff, are you essentially keeping the back half relative to where you had sort of embedded it, and the lowering is really related to the second quarter? And then, related to that, I think one of the big questions is obviously, you stare down this harder comparison in the third quarter. So, it looks to me like June, July was probably to 2, 2.5. Are we breaking two year stacks? Do you look at it that way? Do you like at it on a three-year basis? What\u2019s really driving the confidence into that guidance for the back half?","Tom Greco","Good morning, Chris. Let me give you some color on the guide. We have a number of initiatives in the back half that are incremental to the front half. It gives us a lot of confidence that we will deliver the full-year results in our range. Let me talk sales first, and for sure, you already called it out, but, the one and the two-year stacks, obviously we\u2019re looking at that, we do think it\u2019s relevant to look at the three-year stack, given what happened in the back half of 2017. So, for sure, we expect an acceleration in those two-year stacks in the back half. ","We indicated earlier that our pro and DIY e-com businesses are performing well. They have been building momentum throughout the year on both the one and two-year stack basis. And we expect that to continue.","In addition, DIY was the big challenge in the second quarter. And we\u2019ve got a number of new tools in our toolbox for DIY that are incremental to the back half, including Speed Perks 2.0, which we\u2019re really excited about, and improved customer experience for in-store pickup and the launch of the online store within a store at Walmart. So, given these initiatives, along with what we\u2019re seeing as an improved demand environment that we\u2019re already seeing in DIY, we expect to see that improve as well in the background.","Secondly, in terms of gross margin, as you know, we\u2019ve been aggressively going after DC optimization, we\u2019re going to have some benefit for that in the back half of the year, we expect to leverage supply chain in the back half. We\u2019ve also got managing the cost increases associated with commodities and tariffs very closely; we\u2019re watching that very closely. But, the gross margin line obviously will have some differences, particularly because of supply chain. ","And then, in terms of SG&A, while we\u2019re continuing to in initiatives that will help unlock our long-term margin expansion, we do have some things that we\u2019ll benefit from in the back half that are incremental. We\u2019ve got a new labor management tool rolling out in our stores, you\u2019ll see reduced rent and occupancy costs due to our ongoing footprint optimization and continued momentum on safety. So, the net of it is as we look at our stats on sales, we expect to build momentum there. And that combined with additional productivity, particularly in SG&A is going to position us to be well within our guidance for the year.","Chris Horvers","Understood. And so, maybe a little bit on the gross margin in terms of the follow-up. So, gross margin being down, and I understand the mix component, but can you maybe delve into how much LIFO was a headwind and how you expect that to play out over the year as you look forward. And underneath that, is there some sort of handoff, like in the last year and earlier this year you have material cost optimization benefits, you have some shrink benefits. So, are we just -- do we enter this valley in terms of some of the cost for good synergies, and now it\u2019s being passed off to the DC optimization and that reaccelerates?","Jeff Shepherd","Yes. Let me just give you kind of some color in general in terms of what happened in the second quarter related to gross margins. We saw benefits in MCO. Unfortunately, these were offset by other factors in the gross margin line, Chris. The single largest impact in the quarter was actually mixed. It was an 80 basis-point headwind in the quarter. And in particular, and we said this in our prepared remarks, but our DIY business was soft during Q2, in particular later April and all of May were just terrible. This impacts gross margin, not only from a rate standpoint, but just lack of sales leverage in general.","Your question on tariff and commodity related headwinds. These were actually more than offset by pricing activities. And as you pointed out, with our LIFO accounting, it required us to recognize these cost increases right away. So, we\u2019re covering these costs with pricing actions, but it makes it more challenging to expand margins in the shorter term. And then, we do also have the continuous supply chain wage investments in the second quarter. And as Tom said, we expect to see benefits in that in the back half. So, we actually think we will be leveraging in the back half, which would be the first time in many years.","Chris Horvers","So, you\u2019re expecting growth up in the back half?","Jeff Shepherd","In the back half, I think, the way to think about it is, first and foremost, nothing really changes for our long-term margin expansion plans. We\u2019re confident in our ability to capitalize on all these opportunities. We\u2019re focused on both gross margin and SG&A improvements. And I\u2019m pleased with the continuing investments this year and we\u2019re delivering better cost leverage within SG&A than originally planned, which we now believe could drive the majority of our margin expansion.","I expect we\u2019re going to continue to drive cost savings in the back half in the areas within labor management, rent, occupancy and safety, which Tom mentioned. So, in terms of gross margin, the back half of \u201819, we\u2019re going to expect to leverage supply chain, which as I said, first time in many years, but we incurred incremental cost increases and we\u2019re passing those on but we need to monitor them very closely, because these are meaningful increases for our customers, especially in the short-term for the more cost conscious DIYers.","With all that said, we look at the back half today, we remain incredibly disciplined n executing our long-term strategic plan, we\u2019re focused on delivering overall OI margin expansion for the full year. And this includes leveraging the cost that we can control.","Operator","And our next question comes from Michael Lasser with UBS. Your line is now open.Q - Michael Lasser","It\u2019s evident that the real swing factor in your quarter-to-quarter results and your longer term transformation is your DIY business. And you\u2019ve long stated that unit per transaction is where you lag behind your competitors in this regard. Also, it seems like DIY traffic is a source of challenge, recognizing that you\u2019re working on your loyalty program and your dotcom business. But, is that really enough to address these shortcomings? Also, isn\u2019t improving this segment really the key to unlocking your long run margin opportunity?","Tom Greco","First of all, you\u2019ve identified a couple of things that we\u2019re obviously remained focused on. UPT is critically important for us. We\u2019re going to continue to drive at that. The transaction was the big driver of DIY shortfall in the quarter. If you go back 2017, 2016, 2015, we were losing a significant amount of market share in DIY in those years, 100 to 200 basis points every year. Last year, we started to make progress. And by the fourth quarter of 2018, we actually gained share, which was the first time we gained sharing in DIY. As you recall, we did launch a new advertising campaign that helped us. In the first half of this year, we declined marginally. I want to emphasize that. It was a marginal share loss in the first half of this year. Jeff mentioned it earlier, but the last week of April, and all of May was just terrible. I mean, it was a very difficult period for all of DIY. And in that time frame, we were down pretty significantly in terms of our transactions.","So, the focus for us is obviously to continue to strengthen our overall value proposition in DIY. And that includes the effectiveness of our marketing. We brought Jason in. I\u2019m highly confident he\u2019s going to have a big impact on improving the effectiveness of our marketing, improving our loyalty. Speed Perks 2.0 is off to a great start. We are into our second -- last week was our second full week. We\u2019re signing up more people. Our average sales per Speed Perks member is going up. Our team is really excited about it. And then, there are some other initiatives, as I mentioned, in terms of taking friction out of the buy online, pick up in store experience that we\u2019re working on. So, we\u2019ve got a lot of things going on in DIY. I would still describe it as a work in process. We\u2019ve got to continue to strengthen our overall messaging and drive traffic into our stores. But, there\u2019s a lot of opportunity for us in DIY still out there.","Michael Lasser","But, that being said, Tom, how long is it going to take to generate an improvement in DIY traffic? And have you already started to see that early in this third quarter?","Tom Greco","Yes, certainly, relative to what we experienced in the second quarter, we absolutely have seen an improvement in traffic. And I think you will continue to see that through the back half of the year. The loyalty program that we launched was thoroughly tested. We had it in two markets for 20 weeks. So, we\u2019ve got a pretty clear idea on how that -- what that\u2019s going to do in terms of impact on our business. By early September, we\u2019ll be standing up a standardized in-store pickup location and our store will be communicating that and messaging that to our customers. We believe we can get a much higher share of wallet of our most loyal customers. So, we believe we should be able to see some impact in the back on DIY retail.","Michael Lasser","And then, just a quick follow-up on the gross margin. Given how relatively early you are in the transformation and how much opportunity you have, it would seem like the bias is still to the upside. And yet, given some of the normal challenges and fluctuations in the business, the gross margin being down, would provide evidence to counter that view. So, is this just now kind of a steady state gross margin for the business over the long run?","Tom Greco","We definitely see an opportunity to expand gross margins, Michael. I think, the big items in there are supply chain, obviously. And we\u2019ve talked a lot about supply chain. We\u2019ve got to optimize the network, we\u2019re going to start to see benefit from that in the back half of this year. We\u2019re rolling out cross-banner replenishment, which as we said previously, is about a year and a half piece of work, if you will. So, we\u2019re really working on that one hard. Reuben\u2019s driving execution in the supply chain. We\u2019ve got opportunities in last mile delivery that we\u2019re working. So, all of that is very robust. But, there are some lumpy things that happen there as we get into \u201820 and \u201821 from DC closures et cetera.","The other big one is the category management piece. We feel we have the best assortment in the industry. We\u2019ve got a great lineup of national brands; our national brand suppliers play an important role for us. OE parts, private label parts and our category teams are building plans that are multiyear to really get after the improved margin opportunities that exist there. But that that\u2019ll be a more gradual build. But, clearly, as we look at our long-term plan, gross margin plays a meaningful role in our overall plans to accelerate our margin expansion.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scot Ciccarelli, RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Scot Ciccarelli","I think, we probably all kind of understand the weather challenges in the quarter, but you did underperform your competitors, who have already reported. Calendar probably played a big role there. But, you -- Tom, I think, you also mentioned there were some internal issues in the quarter. So, I guess, I was hoping you could elaborate on what some of those issues were, maybe using an example, and why you think you\u2019ve fixed some of those issues?","Tom Greco","Sure. First of all, there\u2019s no question we had some opportunities of our own, Scot, to your point. I mean, we -- again, we really look at the front half. We don\u2019t want to just get hung up on the second quarter, given the timing of our quarter versus others. But, if I look at the front half and say we grew 1.6%, our aspiration, as we said many times is to be at or above the market, which we believe is in the 3 range. So, the part that we can control, largely DIY retail, as I just mentioned, there were a couple of things. Some categories inside of our DIY retail business underperformed. And as I said, we lost share in those categories. I\u2019m not going to go into a lot of detail on the specifics, but they were more assortment related decisions we made in certain categories around good, better, best. I\u2019ll leave it at that. But, we\u2019ve corrected those opportunities already. And we\u2019ve seen improvement from that. The second thing that I mentioned was the effectiveness of the marketing. We\u2019re seeing the benefits on awareness and some other consumer metrics. But, that\u2019s not necessarily translating to the traffic improvement that we like to see. So, those were the big areas of opportunity from the internal standpoint, and I\u2019m confident that we\u2019ve taken the right steps to address them.","Scot Ciccarelli","And Tom, on the category shifts that you made with good, better, fast, how quickly does it -- how quickly can you notice that there\u2019s a change -- a change is warranted in terms of the current merchandising strategy?","Tom Greco","Well, honestly, DIY retail, it\u2019s fairly easy, if it is measured. As you probably know, the syndicated data does not measure everything in DIY retail, it measures 29 categories. But, it happens to be in one of those 29 categories, which it is -- it was. We can see it. So, we\u2019ll stratify the category, we\u2019ll look at how we\u2019re performing in each of those segments, and we did see an opportunity there and we subsequently addressed it. So you can see it fairly quickly,, kind of once a period sort of thing.","Operator","And our next question comes from Seth Sigman with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Seth Sigman","I wanted to follow up on the full-year guidance. So, your EBIT margin now up 20 to 40 basis points. It sounds like the composition has changed a bit with SG&A may be tracking better, versus expected to be flat for the year previously. It doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019re really pulling back on investments, but maybe gaining more traction with some of the cost initiatives. Can you just elaborate on that? Where are you seeing some of that traction? And then, just given where you are in the improvement story, how do you think about reinvesting in that, redeploying that into some of the initiatives? Thanks.","Tom Greco","I think, we\u2019re seeing a lot of initiatives around the safety and we\u2019ve talked about that for a number of quarters now. We continue to see improvements in that area. In terms of the claims, the severity of the claims, the frequency of the claims are all improving favorably. And we\u2019ve really instituted the safety culture, and that\u2019s paying off. And we think that\u2019s going to continue to pay off into the back half. We\u2019ve been very judicious in the way we\u2019ve been closing down our stores. We\u2019ve closed over 50 stores in the first half of the year. And we\u2019ve got a much better discipline around that process of not only closing the store, but making sure we\u2019re getting it sublet, and in minimizing those costs, and that\u2019s being a lot more benefit.","We\u2019ve also implemented a new software solution for our labor management, called MyDay. And we expect to get leverage out of that in the back half. So, those are a lot of the improvements that we\u2019re seeing.","As far as the investments, we\u2019re very much on track, again for those three areas, IT, marketing, and people. IT, we continue to make those investments both on the CapEx side and the OpEx side. And we\u2019re going to continue to see those improvements as we unfold those programs. So, for example, the next-gen store network, we\u2019re on track, we expect all of the red stores to be completed by the end of the year. So, we\u2019re very excited about that. It\u2019s going to allow our team members to do their job much more efficiently. ERPs that we\u2019re putting in for our back office, so we go from four sets of books down to one, we expect that to be stood up in 2020, all very much on track.","And then, the investments that we\u2019ve made in wages, some of it\u2019s in supply chain, some of it\u2019s in stores, but we\u2019re beginning to see those improvements as well. So, we want to continue to do that. We\u2019re not going to take any short-term actions that\u2019s going to inhibit our long-term expansion growth.","Seth Sigman","Okay. Thank you for that. And if I could just clarify, you had talked about this year being an investment year, next year, also being an investment year, but maybe seeing a little bit more margin expansion. Just based on the performance year-to-date, I guess, what you\u2019re saying, there\u2019s no reason to believe that the investment plan really needs to change at this point. Is that fair?","Tom Greco","Absolutely not, Absolutely not. The investment plan doesn\u2019t change. We\u2019re excited about the investments that we\u2019re making. We have a very rigid structure in terms of the investments that we approved. All of them have a high ROIC. We look at these every other week. We\u2019re tracking them, not only the progress of implementation, but post implementation, making sure we\u2019re getting the right returns of the investment dollars that we make. We think we\u2019re making the right investments into our stores, into IT, into supply chain that\u2019s going to yield the long-term improvements over time.","Seth Sigman","Okay, great. Thank you. And just my follow-up question is on the DIY business. Tom, maybe can you talk a little bit more about the performance after the first four weeks of the quarter? How do we think about how that business may have improved in the latter parts of the quarter? And a lot of focus on the internal issues, but can you talk a little bit more about the external factors and your confidence level that it is just weather versus maybe sensitivity to price increases or something else more about the consumer? Thanks.","Tom Greco","Well, as I said, Seth, I mean, May was an extremely difficult month, at least for us, I think the whole industry, similar, again, certainly in those northern geographies. So, we saw just double digit declines and refrigerants and adherents, and the big the big categories that are impacted by rain, basically, it was a very rainy month, right, it was also a lot cooler than last year. So once we got past that, we started to see improvements. And as we got into July, when we had a heat wave kind of across the U.S., it\u2019s responded very nicely. So, as you -- I think you\u2019ve heard from others and heard historically that the professional business is much more smooth, it\u2019s much less impacted by this type of swings and seasonal weather trends, the DIY business is much more impacted. So, for sure, we\u2019ve seen improvement into July and into the third quarter. So, we feel it\u2019s back on to the more normal pattern that we would expect.","Operator","And our next question comes from Gregory Melich with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","Q - Gregory Melich","I just had one question on the actual quarter in the comps. What was the overall traffic and ticket and is it fair to say that DIY was probably down 2 or 3 and that pro was right at the similar or slightly better amount? Then, I had a follow-up on capital allocation.","Tom Greco","Yes. Good morning, Greg. Your numbers are in line with where we were. I mean, the transactions were the big driver of the DIY miss. Average ticket was up, but your numbers are pretty much in line.","Gregory Melich","Got it. And -- but average ticket in DIY was up a little bit. So, even if DIY comps were down 2 to 3, the traffic might have been a little worse. Like, I mean, I\u2019m trying to get to inflation, was inflation 100 bps on the comp or\u2026?","Tom Greco","Yes. I mean, again, it\u2019s tricky with inflation, because of all the factors. We look on it on a per unit basis, right, like units, Greg, so we take a basket of similar units. And that number was in the 2.9 range for the quarter.","Gregory Melich","And maybe as linked to that and Jeff, you talked about how LIFO and some of the other costs come in now, but the pricing goes through. Is it fair to say that what we\u2019re seeing now is the full impact of the 10% tariff? But presumably, the 25% is something that comes in, in the second half?","Jeff Shepherd","Well, I think we would have seen a little bit of both. For sure, we saw the full 10% but we did see aspects of the 25. And let me just give you a little bit of color on what we\u2019re trying to do there. We really want to make sure we\u2019re working collaboratively with our supplier partners to look for other sourcing arrangements. We\u2019re looking to exhaust the existing inventory that we had on hand, because once we start buying it, again, under our LIFO methodology, it requires us to recognize that full cost upfront. So, to your point, yes, for sure on the 10%; on the 25% -- excuse me, it did begin to bleed in, but we could see some additional impacts of that as we go through the balance of the year.","Gregory Melich","And then, lastly on capital allocation, the new $400 million authorization. How are you thinking about that 2.1 times leverage ratio, is it that you do not want it to go under a certain level, like 2, that the cash flow 700 million, should we think about that all coming back, could dividends go up a lot? How do you guys think about it?","Jeff Shepherd","Obviously, when we we\u2019ve talked about our capital allocation priorities, we stated 2.5. There are some contributing factors to that, why we\u2019re under -- we\u2019re using a different debt number versus the 6 times rent expense with the new lease obligations that are on our balance sheet. That was a contributing factor. And we did buy back the debt for $300 million. Right now, we did get the new authorization for the $400 million of share repurchase. We don\u2019t currently have this in our forecast. And we\u2019re not really going to comment on the repurchases throughout the year. But we\u2019re going to be very opportunistic and repurchasing shares, when we feel that the stock price is undervalued, and that\u2019s our focus right now.","Operator","And our next question comes from Chris Bottiglieri with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.","Chris Bottiglieri","I wanted to dig in a little bit on the channel shift comment of 80 basis points. I would imagine it\u2019s more than just DIY versus commercial and maybe includes online and Worldpac mix. I just want to confirm that. Is it -- just to run some math, it seems it could imply like tens of basis points of difference -- sorry, 10 points of -- like tens of points of differences between DIY and DIFM gross margin. So, I want to see if you can comment on that. And then two, if there\u2019s a rule of thumb we can use for the difference in gross margin rate between commercial and DIY?","Tom Greco","First of all, obviously, Worldpac is a professional business, right. For us, we do look at that as part of a channel mix shift. We are opening up Worldpac branches, which are very successful. Overall, it drives our profitability on the whole P&L. So, the biggest impact, as we said, was it was channel mix shift that we saw in the quarter. We didn\u2019t see that in the first quarter. Obviously, you saw our numbers in the first quarter. And as the DIY retail business comes back to a more normalized level, we expect that that will be improved.","Jeff Shepherd","I\u2019m sorry, the second question again, can you repeat it?","Chris Bottiglieri","Yes. It was just like how to quantify the difference in gross margin rate between DIY and commercial. Just back to that, it seems like your mix sort of change at most a 1 point or 2, between DIY and commercial. So, it seems like -- 80 basis points just seems extreme, just hoping if you could quantify that.","Jeff Shepherd","Yes. I mean, kind of just looking at gross profit, we sort of have a 15% change from DIY to pro. So, pro 15% lower than DIY.","Chris Bottiglieri","And then, just like want to clarify the impact of tariffs, like, it makes sense you\u2019re doing -- trying to use it, existing inventory on hand for this. But maybe stepping back, is this another way of just saying, like gross margins will go down once you find new inventory, or do you expect to push through pricing as you find inventory?","Tom Greco","Well, we\u2019ve always been very successful in passing on price to the consumers. It\u2019s not something we want to do. We want to find alternative methods to keep the prices lower for our customers. We don\u2019t see any concerns around being able to pass that price on. We were successful in the first quarter, we were successful in the second quarter. As I said, there were other factors, primarily mix, which we just discussed. But, I don\u2019t -- we don\u2019t see any concerns right now in the back half that would suggested that we can\u2019t pass on price.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities.","Seth Basham","Thanks a lot and good morning. My first question is just making sure we have some clarity around the moving pieces of gross margin related to LIFO. What was the impact in the quarter? And how are you thinking about the LIFO impact for the balance of the year?","Jeff Shepherd","So, the impact for the quarter in dollars was $16 million headwind, you\u2019ll see that come out when we publish our Q2 later this afternoon. For balance the year, we expect it\u2019s going to continue to be a headwind. We\u2019re still taking on the cost of these tariffs. We\u2019re seeing other commodity cost increases for nontariff products. And so for all those reasons, we think we\u2019re going to continue to see a LIFO headwind through the back half of the year.","Seth Basham","As it relates to capitalized supply chain costs, was that a moving piece to your gross margin this quarter? And how do you frame that up for the back half of the year?","Jeff Shepherd","On the actual capitalized costs themselves?","Seth Basham","Correct.","Jeff Shepherd","Yes. So, we did actually see some benefit from that on a year-over-year basis. So, we are seeing improvements there, as we said. In the back half, when you look at supply chain in total, we do believe we\u2019re going to get leverage in the back half. We\u2019re seeing the productivity efforts, the investments that we\u2019ve made in wages, the consistency that Reuben\u2019s put into the various supply chain DCs themselves are all beginning to bear fruit. And so we think we\u2019re going to see benefit in the back half.","Seth Basham"," Got it. So, putting the gross margin picture in perspective then, at the beginning of the year, it seems like you\u2019re expecting more improvement for 2019 than you now do. So, primary thing simply the second quarter mix shift from DIY to commercial, or are there other things that are moving to limit your confidence in improving gross margins as much as you did earlier in the year?","Tom Greco","Well, we talked about supply chain as a difference in the back half, Seth. So, for sure, we\u2019re going to see benefits there. We\u2019re also monitoring the cost increases that we\u2019re passing on, very closely. We\u2019ve got some meaningful increases for our customers this year as a result of, to some degree commodities, but certainly because of tariffs. And we\u2019re just going to monitor those very closely. We\u2019re going to make sure that we\u2019re being competitive in the marketplace. And it\u2019s a very much a short-term situation, given the LIFO accounting rules that we have here. We want to make sure we\u2019re competitive. So, really nothing is changed in terms of our long-term ability to go after that gross margin opportunity through supply chain in category management. We are getting benefits out of SG&A that we\u2019re going to capitalize on. So, that\u2019s really what\u2019s happened in the back half.","Operator","And our next question comes from Daniel Imbro with Stephens Incorporated. Your line is now open.","Daniel Imbro","Tom, I wanted to follow up on some on recent answers. I think earlier, you mentioned that inflation was up about 2.9% on a basket of goods. One, did I hear that right? And then, two, understanding the timing difference that seems higher than some of your public peers are reporting or discussing. So, as you think about the competitive landscape, has anything changed from a pricing standpoint competitively or is it promotional landscape changing at all? How do we reconcile those differences? Thanks.","Tom Greco","Yes. Again, I think, everybody looks at it a little differently, Daniel. I mean, we look at a light basket of items. So, it\u2019s the same item. You can\u2019t just look at average price per unit, because as job complexity evolves and different technology advances are made in repairing a vehicle, sometimes just the pure average price per unit is a little bit misleading, it\u2019s been going up for a couple of years, by the way, across the whole industry. So, started in 2017, again in 2018 and the front half of 2019, we see average price per unit increasing in both the DIY and the pro side of the business. So, the way we look at it is, we take the same brake rotor, same brake pad, whatever is comparable year-on-year, we look at the inflation on that and that\u2019s what we get at the 2.9%. So, whether that\u2019s at or above our competition, all I can tell you is we measure our competitive price versus our competitors, every single week. So, when we know how we index versus their pricing, and that hasn\u2019t changed a whole lot, but our inflation on a per unit basis looks like 2.9% in the quarter.","Daniel Imbro","And then, I just wanted to one touch on the supply chain consolidation you guys were talking about. You\u2019re expecting to see leverage in the back half. How successful so far have you guys been at retaining those sales dollars and in stock levels when you are closing stores? Are you running, if any, issues there? And is there any kind of feedback or early learnings from those initiatives as you think about gaining supply chain leverage in the back half?","Tom Greco","Sure. I mean, I think, we\u2019ve got the closure of DCs, Daniel, down pretty well. I think, it was hardened the process. And when we close the physical DC, we gradually migrate the stores over to the caching DC. So, we\u2019ve not seen any impact on fill rates or anything like that when we close the DCs. In terms of store closures, that keeps getting better. Improvement on","improvement on closing a store and retaining importantly the customer base that we have in that store when we close it is really the key to our success and what is driving some of the cash flow improvements that you\u2019re seeing for us. So, we measure down on a sales and profit per store basis. And we are seeing our sales per store go up, that\u2019s a big opportunity for us to close the margin gap. And we\u2019ll continue to execute against that. So, I think we\u2019re executing those initiatives very well.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.","Brian Nagel","Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. So, the first question I want to ask -- and I know we\u2019ve spent a lot of time on this call talking about weather, the weakness in sales that occurred in April and May. The question I have here is, as you look at that business, the weaker sales, how much of that business in your view was loss versus simply pushback, and maybe we haven\u2019t seen it yet? And then also, to what extent that weather we\u2019re discussing, particularly the rain actually -- could that actually help business, either now or in coming weeks, if some of the potential damage to cars?","Tom Greco","Well, first of all, in terms of how we looked at it, we\u2019re not happy with our Q2 results, to be clear, Brain. We\u2019re focused on our 2019 goals without compromising the long-term success. We modified the top end of our sales and margin guidance directly as a result of Q2. And we believe it\u2019s very much a short-term challenge. So, we haven\u2019t factored in recovering the Q2 shortfall into our updated guidance. You didn\u2019t ask that question directly, but I think that\u2019s what you\u2019re getting at. So, I mean, it really does reflect the Q2 shortfall that otherwise, we expect to be on our plan balance of the year which we feel very good about as we look into the third and fourth quarter.","In terms of impact on the vehicles themselves, and does rain drive incremental sales, obviously does in certain categories, like wipers, but historically for our business, it\u2019s not necessarily a good thing. You could miss a maintenance cycle, you could miss a cycle for chemicals, [ph] when that happens, and that\u2019s why we haven\u2019t necessarily factored that into the balance of year.","Brian Nagel","Go it. Thank you. And then, the second question I have, Tom, in your prepared comments, you discussed sales in particular, if I heard you correct, a shift in market share from the end of last year into this year where Advance was gaining share and then started to lose share per some data. So, I wanted to make sure I understood that correctly. How should we think about if you look at your business, the drivers of that that 2018, 2019 shift that happened before what we\u2019re discussing now in the second quarter?","Tom Greco","Sure. I mean, we obviously had been seeding market share to be clear, Brain, prior to that timeframe in \u201818. So, we\u2019ve been building up -- we\u2019re building, building, building here. We\u2019re trying to build a very strong customer value proposition, a better in-store experience for our customer, a better online experience of our customer. We have done a number of things or did a number of things in the early part of \u201818 to enable that. Our net promoter scores started to improve, our website traffic started to grow. We saw our awareness go from 28% to 32%. So, we were seeing progress, I would say in the fourth quarter. As we come into this year, that moderated. So, rather than gaining share, first quarter, we kind of slowed down a little bit. And if I look at the front half, we lost it. It wasn\u2019t a lot, 20 basis points of market share in the front half of the year. And we attribute that to some things that we did. We talked about some categories in the prepared remarks. You heard us talk a little bit about the effectiveness of our marketing, and those are the things that need to be shored up to regain our share momentum. The idea is, how do we gain share as we improve our efficiency and our footprint. So, essentially in the fourth quarter last year, we gained share with fewer stores, which we\u2019re very proud of. And that\u2019s what we have to continue to do.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Bret Jordan","Just to follow up, I guess, on the DIY share loss, you commented on, and we\u2019ve sort of beaten this a couple of different ways. But, is it product or price related in that period? You talked in your prepared remarks about some strategic pricing actions. And is there some increased competition in the market, or was it just an assortment on a temporary basis that impacted you?","Tom Greco","Well, just to cover off the pricing actions, Bret. As you know, we\u2019re rolling out what we call dynamic assortment, which is a machine learning tool. And it\u2019s an excellent tool that we\u2019re using to help manage our assortment, obviously, not just in the front room, but more so actually in the backroom. So, when we see our close rate starting to be either higher or lower, we can make bets, if you will, on pricing actions to improve our sales. So, that\u2019s essentially what we\u2019re talking about there. I think, in terms of the DIY side of the business and the share impact that we experienced, we attribute that to a couple of categories where we did some things that we\u2019ve had to refine. I would just leave it at that.","Bret Jordan","Okay. And then, I guess, on walmart.com launching in the late in the second quarter, could you give us a perspective, maybe how many SKUs or what percentage of your SKU count are available through that site?","Tom Greco","Yes. We\u2019re continuing to expand every week. Bret, on this one, I think, we\u2019re up to somewhere in the 10,000 range. We\u2019re very focused on brakes; you\u2019ll see brakes called out. Carquest particularly is a great brand. We\u2019ve got a great product on Carquest. It\u2019s a private label product that we can put on the Walmart website and they can go ahead and sell. We\u2019re seeing some really good improvements on how that website looks. It\u2019s going to be an ongoing journey there. We\u2019re going to continue to strengthen the impact of that online store within a store. Walmart\u2019s been a great partner. So, more to come. We haven\u2019t really factored in a considerable sales number for the back half of this year. We\u2019ve got to get the customer experience right before we really start opening up the marketing and everything that we\u2019re going to do around that. But, we\u2019re excited about it.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Kate McShane","Just trying to reconcile some of your comments around market share and marketing, just with regards to your spending on marketing during the first half the year versus maybe the back half of last year, and how should we think about maybe a new marketing campaign under the new hire you just made?","Tom Greco","Sure. I mean, first of all, we did say we are investing in marketing, Kate, which we have been, not just in the campaign, but in other online related, e-commerce related activities omnichannel, if you will. And you should expect us to continue to do that. We\u2019ve got to build our brand; we\u2019ve got to be smart about how we do it, obviously; we\u2019ve got to improve the effectiveness of our marketing, but we\u2019re going to continue to build our brand. We only have 32% awareness nationally. In fact, one of the things that happened recently as we opened up our walmart.com site, we had a person order about $600 worth of parts off the Walmart website. We actually called the person to talk to the person to see what they\u2019d ordered and better understand them. I mean, they were in one of our markets and they never heard of us. So, we\u2019ve got to get our name out there and really start talking about Advance Auto Parts. And Jason is an expert at that. He\u2019s going to come in. He is looking at all aspects of our marketing mix. He is looking at all of the brands that we have and I\u2019m confident that he is going to have a meaningful impact on our business relatively soon.","So, marketing is an important part of our agenda. We\u2019ve got to build our brand, we\u2019ve got to differentiate our brand, and we\u2019ve got to drive traffic to our stores. And all of those are -- driving traffic is number one on his list right now.","Kate McShane","And if I could just follow up on your comment about benefiting from reduced rents and occupancy costs in the second half. Is this incremental to what you did in the first half?","Tom Greco","Yes, I mean, it is. I think, year-on-year in the back half, we\u2019ll be down over 100, right, Jeff? So, Kate, we\u2019re continuing to close stores, as you know. So, we announced our overall footprint optimization in early part of this year. So, as we continue to close underperforming stores, I think we\u2019re down to about 300 that are less than 1 mile apart from each other. So, we still have work to do there, but the team is getting very good at retaining those sales, as we say and obviously we get out of the rent obligations.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Simeon Gutman","Hey, Tom. I know we\u2019ve talked a lot about weather and good parts of the quarter and the tougher ones. Did you quantify -- can you quantify what you think the weather impact was, so we can get a sense of what the underlying run rate would have been? And then, related to comps. I don\u2019t know how you think about them longer term, the mix, whatever number you think you can grow at, whatever it\u2019s two or three, what do you think the right level of growth is or expected growth from your commercial side and your growth from your do-it-yourself side?","Tom Greco","Sure. Well, first of all, if I look at the syndicated data, Simeon, that\u2019s really all I can do to give you the -- how much of it is us versus the market. The syndicated data would say that the industry comps slowed by about 400 basis points in our Q1. And that\u2019s an important point. Our Q1 started April 21st, it did not start April 1st. Now, the first three weeks of April were gangbusters. So, April 21st, from then on to the end of our Q2, the overall syndicated data says 400 basis-point deceleration. So, that\u2019s why we look at the front half. And then, we say how much of it is really us versus external factors in the front half. And we\u2019ve got to own part of the front half performance, 1.6% is not where we want to be, which leads me to your question. We want to be at or above the market. So, our goal is to be north of 3% over time. Now, clearly, we think that professional is going to outperform DIY and the marketplace, we think we\u2019re well-positioned in professional. Bob\u2019s got a lot of great things going on there to accelerate our performance and drive margin expansion inside of the professional business as we grow that. That said, we also want to see DIY growing. And obviously, we look at that as an omnichannel business. So, it\u2019s not just DIY retail but DIY omnichannel in total. So north of 3%, professional higher than DIY.","Simeon Gutman","My follow-up is on gross margin. And I wanted to put it to you this way. If you knew ahead of time, and I\u2019m not saying you did, but if I\u2019m telling you that you knew ahead of time do-it-yourself would have had a tough quarter and that the mix could have gone against you. Is there anything you could have done different on gross margin to mitigate the impact that that was at this quarter?","Tom Greco","Yes. I don\u2019t know that we would have altered our plan knowing that there is going to be one bad month in the second quarter. I mean, clearly, our overall agenda is to make sure that we\u2019re building this thing for the long term and we\u2019re driving significant improvement in our comps, we\u2019re being more competitive, we\u2019re expanding our margins, and we\u2019re generating a lot of cash. So, I don\u2019t know that knowing that May was going to be the way it was, we might have done a few things a little bit different, I can\u2019t imagine then it would have made a material difference, other than what I\u2019ve already said, those categories inside of DIY where we lost share. We probably would have done something different there.","Simeon Gutman","And just to clarify, because someone mentioned online mix, posted as a question, is that -- that\u2019s not part of the channel, the channel mix as well or was it a headwind, the fact that -- because you mentioned that DIY e-commerce did well, relatively well, was that not a headwind as well?","Tom Greco","Well, relative to retail, it is lower. So, it is a headwind. It is part of the headwind.","Simeon Gutman","Fair enough, okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And I\u2019m not showing any further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to Tom Greco for any closing remarks.","Tom Greco","Well, thanks again to everyone for joining us this morning. As you\u2019ve heard from us today, we\u2019re very committed to our long-term strategic initiatives. I\u2019m very proud of the work that our team has demonstrated in our transformation thus far. We are building the best team in the industry here at Advance. And I\u2019m confident that we\u2019re going to deliver value for our shareholders.","On a personal note, I\u2019m very appreciative of all the support we\u2019ve received for our American Heart Association campaign so far this year. Team Advance will once again be leading in the Triangle Heart Walk here in Raleigh. And we look forward to once again exceeding our fundraising goals for this important cause. I look forward to sharing more on the success of our campaign together with our third quarter results in November.

Darren?","Darren R. Jackson","Thank you, Zaheed. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us, and welcome to our first quarter conference call. I'd like to start off by thanking all of our team members for their hard work and commitment to better serve our customers and to grow our business. Joining me on the call today is our President, George Sherman, who will update you in our business operations; and Mike Norona, our Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss our financials.","I'll begin my prepared remarks today, updating you on our first quarter performance, including our business priorities, followed by an overview of our integration of General Parts. We are pleased with our start to 2014. We continue to build on our momentum from the fourth quarter finish.","Our team members remain focused on our 3 core outcomes and continue to drive improvements into the business. The base business improvements, along with the ongoing benefits from the favorable winter weather, enabled solid first quarter results.","Our total sales grew 47% in the quarter compared to the first quarter of 2013, primarily as a result of the acquisition and our positive comparable store sales increase of 2.4% in the quarter. Our first quarter comparable cash earnings per share of $2.25 increased 35.5% versus our first quarter last year, driven principally by the acquisition of General Parts and the base business performance.","Specifically, we delivered low single digit comparable store sales gains in DIY and mid-single digit gains in commercial, both showing acceleration from our previous quarter.","Entering the first quarter, we saw steady customer demand due to the extreme weather. We experienced some volatility early in the quarter from weather-related store closures, yet we capitalized on opportunities, including double-digit sales increases in batteries and antifreeze, as well as a strong wiper business.","Sales in all markets accelerated from the fourth quarter, with our cold weather markets accelerating at a faster pace. In particular, our Northeast and Great Lakes markets benefited the most from the extreme winter conditions.","The consumer continues to be targeted with their spending, as they perform needed repairs resulting from part failure or safety to ensure vehicle reliability in tough winter conditions.","Our customers likely benefited from timely tax refunds and stable gas prices versus a year ago to pay for these unexpected repairs. Overall, there has been more consistent day-in and day-out customer traffic in 2014. During the quarter, both our gross profit rate and our comparable SG&A rate declined. Gross profit declined 446 basis points to 45.6% and SG&A improved on a comparable basis 383 basis points to 36%. This was due to the acquisition of General Parts and it was in line with our expectations. Notably, our continuing SG&A focus on the base AAP business remains on track. Mike will be discussing the financials in more detail shortly.","In 2014, we have 2 very clear overarching priorities: First, ensure delivery of our base business outcomes; and second, the successful execution of the year 1 deliverables of the multi-year General Parts integration plan.","Within our base business, consistency is critical through building on our operational and execution achievements. We will continue to invest in those areas that drive our sales growth, customer service excellence and profit outcomes.","We remain focused on driving sequential improvement in our sales of our DIY and our Commercial Business. In DIY, we are increasing our sustained investment in training, including the company rollout of a new automotive systems training, driving productivity improvements and leveraging our parts availability to meet our core customer needs.","In commercial, we continue to strengthen our existing and build new ones, our relationships and focus our efforts on moving up the call list. We are growing the national accounts and our portfolio of larger bay accounts through consistent service and the strongest in-market availability.","We are introducing CARQUEST TechNet, CARQUEST Technical Institute and WORLDPAC to existing Advance customers while attracting new customers with the broadest set of capabilities in the market.","An example of a high-impact initiative is our cross-sourcing, which is gaining strong momentum between CARQUEST and Advance with over 5,000 CARQUEST and Advance stores currently ordering from each other. I'll discuss this more shortly.","We are also focused on serving approximately 1,400 independents across the U.S. and Canada. Over the last few months, our organization has put forth tremendous effort to plan for and support the growth of this important business, and we are focusing on the needs of these individual business owners.","We are always working to strengthen our core customer service proposition and the outcomes. We have been seeing visible improvements from our investments in training, simplification and creating a principle of ownership in our field, where our team members and our store GMs are leading by example and empowering our teams to deliver the service our customers have come to expect. George will speak in more detail about this in a minute.","Turning now to our integration. I'd like to update you on our progress so far. At the outset of the integration planning process, we embraced the following 4 principles as part of our operational framework: Number one, prioritize and drive the day-to-day performance of the base business and make decisions in the best interest of our customer; two, bring the best from both organizations; three, focus on capturing the expected synergies, including efforts to achieve economies of scale and enhanced efficiency; and finally, balance the delivery of long-term value, while establishing integration momentum and rapid execution on specific activities.","Overall, we are pleased with our initial progress we have made in the first 4 months of this integration. We are still in the early days of a multiyear integration process, but we're off to a start that we expected.","The important activities out of the gate were, first, to align our leadership and begin integrating our teams, followed by communicate it early and often to our independent customers. Notably, we are pleased and confident in the operating leaders from General Parts that are taking key leadership roles in the combined company, including David McCartney, Bob Cushing, Al Wheeler, Steve Gushie and others. Subsequently, we began focusing on early quick win opportunities, while commencing some of our longer-tail activities.","One of the first quick win opportunities for our customers was to leverage our leading inventory availability by launching cross-sourcing capabilities between Advance and CARQUEST stores. We are beginning to see good early results with cross sourcing, enabling our teams to say yes to our customers more often.","Our independent customers are also leveraging this advantage to drive increased same day in-market availability and to access new products. This and other efforts have positioned us for a good start with our important independent partners, and we are pleased to report that our independent growth and retention rate is roughly similar to that experienced by CARQUEST prior to the acquisition.","In addition, we have successfully introduced WORLDPAC sourcing into Advance Auto Part stores in selected markets. We believe this is an opportunity to expand the distribution of WORLDPAC products by leveraging into thousands of Advance Auto Parts points of distribution as we look to improve our service levels and assortment to the import customer. The program is off to a good start, and we anticipate continuing to expand the program throughout the year.","Our cost synergy work, which is expected to realize between $45 million and $55 million this fiscal year is well underway and it is progressing as expected in the first quarter.","We have also begun parallel planning work on our long-tail activities, including our comprehensive supply chain network assessment, our store consolidation and conversion strategy and integration to a common set of processes and IT systems. As we progress through this early planning work, the knowledge we are gaining reinforces our confidence in driving the long-term value from the acquisition and achieving our 3-year synergy target of $160 million.","The planning work is revealing adjacent benefits by providing us insights from General Parts on how to more effectively execute future store conversions.","We will provide more updates on these longer-term activities as they progress. Overall, we are pleased with our start to the year. I am encouraged by the progress we are making with our operational execution. Our teams are focused on the importance of driving consistent sales outcomes and building upon our comp momentum generated over the past 2 quarters. The simplification work and training has strengthened our field team's ability to execute on the fundamentals and maintain our customer focus. The early integration progress suggests it will allow us to leverage our breadth of capabilities, build market-leading positions with our commercial customers and enable us to capture scale economics from this acquisition.","Our growth and profitability is on track. Our first quarter comparable results generated a 35.5% comparable EPS growth, a step in the right direction.","Looking ahead to Q2, we are encouraged by the sales momentum resulting from the weather and the sustained execution of our team to meet that demand. We are very pleased with our integration efforts and these related benefits that they are delivering. Together, our operational and integration momentum position us to expect a very solid year. I'd like to close by once again thanking all of our team members for their tremendous hard work and good start to the year.","I will now turn the call over to George Sherman. George?","George E. Sherman","Thanks, Darren. Good morning, everyone. First, I'd like to thank all of our team members for their contributions to customer service in the quarter and doing all the right things to show our customers that we put them first. At the heart of executional excellence is great customer service, and our team members drove our success this quarter to their commitment to the customer.","With my prepared remarks this morning, I'll provide a view on our first quarter business performance followed by a business update including our key priorities within the quarter.","Looking at sales, we're pleased with our performance in the first quarter, as the team delivered a same-store sales outcome of 2.4%, a sequential acceleration of 230 basis points from our fourth quarter and 100 basis points on a 2-year basis.","Our positive sales performance was attributable to solid execution by our field, merchant and supply chain teams, combined with a continued customer demand on the frigid winter conditions that persisted throughout much of the first quarter. Notably, we did experience weather-related sales disruptions at intervals in the quarter, which kept some of our stores and distribution centers from opening or operating under normal hours. Overall, we're pleased with our sales performance in the first quarter. We'll continue focusing our efforts on a greater outcome.","As a result of the acquisition, our newly combined commercial mix now stands at 56%, with our Commercial Business continuing to grow disproportionately. We generated good comp acceleration in our Commercial Business, with the cold weather markets in the Northeast and Great Lakes leading the way, benefiting from both transaction and ticket growth in the quarter.","As Darren mentioned, we're focused on growing our strategic accounts, and we're making progress on that front as we saw double-digit sales growth in the quarter with key accounts.","Our B2B business also continues to perform very well, with approximately 40% growth in the first quarter.","Other areas we're starting to leverage in order to drive continued commercial growth include our TechNet program, a business that creates a partnership with independent repair shops to drive their sales and retain their customers. It's already over 5,000 locations strong and primed for acceleration.","Another area we're very excited about is the CARQUEST Technical Institute, which is a sales, technical and management training program for Advance Auto Parts professional and CARQUEST Auto Parts customers.","Looking at our DIY business, we're pleased with our positive comp performance. Similar to commercial, our cold weather markets led the way with comps leveraging the increase in ticket growth due to higher-priced battery sales.","This was a good outcome for our DIY business, but we aspire for more. Make no mistake about it, DIY is critical to our mission to be the best. While commercial is the company's growth engine, DIY remains a sizable and highly profitable part of our business. We're intensifying our efforts to improve DIY and what it takes to win. We're launching new advertising campaigns, piloting a customer rewards program on a test-and-learn basis in select markets and accelerating our B2C business that continues to perform very well, with over 80% of e-commerce customers leveraging our site to buy online and pick up in store.","As I've mentioned previously, we're on a mission to reignite our focus on sales, great customer service and profitability. The structural changes we've been making to our field organization have been taking root, and I can say with confidence the focus is working. Our efforts around simplifying our business model and taking steps forward to a field-centric operating model are beginning to drive the outcomes that we're expecting.","I now want to touch on the area of customer service. Our customer service scores are on the rise. We're working from the customer back, and we're relentlessly focused on fine-tuning our current capabilities. And where we have gaps, we're closing them. We continue our quest of having the best team in the business through sustained investment in our training programs. The training is resulting in team members having improved counter knowledge, enhanced by a deeper technical understanding. Our robust automotive systems training program is giving them the confidence to serve our customers better than ever.","We're not stopping there. We're speaking to our customers. But more importantly, we're listening to them. We're asking how we get better, and they're telling us. We're then taking that feedback into actionable improvements. Overall, I'm pleased with how our customer service and customer-focused initiatives are starting to come together, and we're getting stronger.","I've previously talked about disciplined execution and accountability as keys to success. Our field leaders are building more muscle definition here and are more than ever focused on being accountable to the outcomes rather than the activities. They're focused on the key financial drivers of their respective businesses and are exhibiting owner-operator mentality on key outcomes, such as strong expense control.","Improving sales execution is not an overnight process but a series of building blocks, and we continue to lead up [ph] and see many positive signs as we look ahead to the balance of the year.","Turning to our integration, I'll build on Darren's comments and share a few additional insights from an operational perspective. As mentioned, our integration efforts are underway, and we're progressing as expected. The second source quick win is a visible proof point, displaying the tremendous cooperation and sense of team across the enterprise and it builds more confidence with our field teams and our commercial value proposition.","Second source is a culture of looking to partner internally versus looking outside the company and driving the benefits of a stronger in-market availability and speed of delivery for our customers. This availability improvement is enabling our teams to say yes to our customers on the critical question as to whether or not we have a part in stock.","The impact of the WORLDPAC introduction in the AAP stores is another significant quick win. This capability should further strengthen Advance's position as the import authority in the automotive industry.","Continuing on the topic of integration, but changing gears slightly, I'd like to update you on our BWP integration process. During our first quarter, we successfully consolidated or converted another 35 BWP store locations. Those stores continue to perform well and generate results that exceed our expectations.","With regards to our remaining BWP store conversions, we've deliberately decided to extend the time line for completion. We've determined there are aspects of the BWP conversions that are best done alongside the CARQUEST integration program, enabling us to leverage the strategy, integration strengths and efficiencies of a larger reference [ph]. We now expect the BWP conversions to be complete by the end of the fiscal year.","Moving on, I'd like to update you now on our supply chain initiatives. Looking first at our distribution centers, we continue to see good performance of our Remington facility and are now servicing 442 Advance locations. We continue to progress our daily delivery capability, and now 282 Advance stores receiving 6x delivery between both our Remington and Lakeland distribution centers, with the majority of CARQUEST stores also receiving 5x daily delivery out of the 34 CARQUEST DCs. As previously stated, our comprehensive distribution network optimization study is in flight and is expected to conclude around midyear. We'll keep you updated on that.","Second, we continue to drive improvements of in-market availability through our hub store strategy. During the quarter, we added 31 hub stores through a combination of new stores, upgrades of existing stores and the addition of 15 hub stores as a result of the acquisition. At the end of the quarter, our hub store count was 405, an overall increase of 57 from the first quarter last year.","Third, as we look at inventory, our inventory growth was up over 60% year-over-year in the first quarter, primarily due to the General Parts acquisition and our increase in hub stores. We continue to be focused on our goal of having superior availability, the deepest assortment and continuing to invest in our strategy of getting parts closest to the customer.","Looking at our new store growth, during the quarter, we opened 20 new Advance and CARQUEST stores and closed 9 stores, bringing the company total store count to 5,276. We also added 2 WORLDPAC branches in the quarter, bringing our total branch count to 105. We're progressing as expected and continue to pace our new store openings to be in line with our guidance of between 120 and 140 new stores this fiscal year.","As I close out my remarks today, I'd like to share one aspect that is gathering momentum at our company from a cultural perspective. We are clearly seeing a reinvigoration and pride across the organization. From our support center taking pride in how they support our stores to our field leaders in stores working together to develop market plans, drive business outcomes and taking pride in the sales performance. Being the best is a journey. And our next steps are to channel our investments and our energy in a pattern of habitual winning.","That pride and spirit was evident in our first quarter performance, and we're excited to continue taking strides forward and progressing against our mission in Q2.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Mike Norona, our Chief Financial Officer.","Michael A. Norona","Thanks, George, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start by thanking all of our talented and dedicated team members for their commitment to serving our customers in the quarter and helping our company deliver solid financial performance in our first quarter.","I plan to cover the following topics with you this morning: One, provide some financial highlights from our first quarter of 2014; two, put our first quarter results into context with our expectations and key financial priorities that we use to measure our performance; and three, provide some insights on the remainder of 2014.","Before I begin my remarks about the quarter, I would like to remind everyone, Advance will present its financials and supporting commentary, unless otherwise specified, on a consolidated enterprise basis, inclusive of General Parts' results. We see our combination with General Parts as an integrated expansion of our commercial assets and capabilities to grow with our existing customers and attract new ones. In addition, we will also include results on a comparable basis, which excludes the impacts of onetime integration expenses related to the acquisition of both General Parts and BWP, along with any amounts related to the amortization of intangibles resulting from the acquisition of General Parts. The company believes this non-GAAP information is significant to understanding trends and is important in analyzing the company's operating results and earnings.","Coming into 2014, we completed the transaction of General Parts and began the work of integrating the 2 companies. Another significant work stream that kicked off was purchase accounting assessment. We have completed our preliminary evaluation of the opening balance sheet and the evaluation of accounting policies and conformity with regard to the acquisition of General Parts. Included in the accounting conformity was a reclassification of approximately 70 basis points of supply chain costs from SG&A to gross profit in the first quarter. This adjustment had no impact to operating income.","We are pleased to report a first quarter comparable EPS -- cash EPS of $2.25, a 35.5% increase from our first quarter in 2013. The first quarter results reflect a continuation of the sales momentum from our strong finish in the fourth quarter. Our sales momentum was driven by sustained progress on our operational execution improvements, as well as the continued consumer demand. In addition to sales momentum, other notable drivers include $0.07 in synergy realization in the quarter and $0.05 in onetime favorable tax audit settlements.","On a GAAP basis, our first quarter EPS of $2.01, which included $0.11 of intangible asset amortization associated with the acquisition of General Parts and also included $0.10 of onetime expenses to achieve synergies related to the integration of General Parts and $0.03 in onetime costs associated with the integration of BWP.","Turning to sales, our first quarter net sales increased 47.3% to $2.97 billion compared to our first quarter of 2013. This sales growth was principally driven by the acquisition of General Parts, our comparable same-store sales increase of 2.4% and the addition of new stores. As a reminder, sales from General Parts are not included on our comparable sales calculation. As I mentioned earlier, our positive same-store sales was driven by strong execution from our field and supply chain teams to meet consumer demand.","Moving to gross profit. In the first quarter of 2014, our comparable gross profit dollars increased 34% to $1.35 billion from $1.01 billion in our first quarter of 2013. Our comparable gross profit rate of 45.6% was down 446 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2013. This year-over-year rate decline was the result of the acquisition of General Parts resulting in a higher mix of commercial sales that has a lower gross profit rate, the approximate 70 basis points of supply chain reclass, I shared earlier, offset by 24 basis points of synergy savings in the quarter.","Turning to SG&A. In the first quarter, our comparable SG&A rate of 36% was down 383 basis points compared to our first quarter of 2013. This year-over-year rate decline was the result of the acquired General Parts business having a lower SG&A cost structure, the approximate 70 basis points of supply chain reclass and cost leverage from our 2.4% comp store sales increase, offset by increased occupancy costs due to the severe winter weather and higher incentive compensation due to our better sales performance.","All-in, on a comparable basis, our 2014 first quarter operating income dollars increased 38.2% to $284.4 million and our operating income rate decreased 63 basis points over the same period last year to 9.6%, primarily as a result of the acquisition of General Parts.","Our operating cash flow for the quarter was $81.1 million versus $135.3 million last year, driven by an increase in owned inventory, partially offset by higher net income in the quarter. The increase in owned inventory was driven by our continued efforts to improve our availability. Our total consolidated inventory increased 61.4% versus 2013, driven by the acquisition of General Parts, and we expect our inventory growth to flatten as we progress throughout the year. Our free cash flow for the quarter was $20.1 million and in line with our expectations. Our accounts payable to owned inventory ratio for the quarter was 76.1% versus 86.7% last year. This decline was expected due to the acquisition of General Parts. And as previously shared, we see continued opportunities to improve our AP ratio as a combined company.","At the end of the first quarter, we had roughly $2.07 billion of debt on our balance sheet and our adjusted debt-to-EBITDAR was 3.1x, driven by the acquisition of General Parts and was in line with our expectations. As previously stated, we are committed to quickly paying down debt with our free cash flow to get back below the 2.5x leverage ratio and maintaining our investment-grade ratings.","We continue to measure the performance of our business and prioritize our investments to achieve growth, profit and value creation. Our growth engine continues to be our Commercial Business, and our acquisition of General Parts has positioned us to accelerate our commercial customer growth. Growth will also come from our new store development, including WORLDPAC, as we see significant opportunities to increase our geographic footprint. Finally, we expect to continue to improve our operational performance and execution through investments and availability, supply chain, store systems and team member development.","Turning to profit. As a newly combined company, we are pleased with our 9.6% operating income rate that we achieved in our first quarter and see continued opportunities to improve our profitability. We remain on track to achieve our year 1 cost synergies of $45 million to $55 million on our way to achieving the total expected cost synergies of $160 million over the next 3 years. We're also focused on improving our profitability by growing our sales to better leverage our new size and scale and improving our cost efficiency.","With respect to value creation, the acquisition of General Parts provides us a compelling opportunity to drive shareholder returns through incremental earnings and strong cash flows. We see this -- we saw this in the first quarter with a 35.5% increase in our comparable EPS. As a combined business with General Parts, we expect to drive strong operating cash flow, which will enable us to rapidly pay down our debt to get back to our previously stated leverage ceiling of 2.5x within the next 2 years.","Once our debt is paid down, we will continue to leverage our capital structure to maximize shareholder value.","Turning to the balance of the year, we are pleased with our start to 2014 and the momentum we have. We shared this morning in our press release that we have raised our full year annual consolidated comparable EPS outlook to be in the range of $7.30 to $7.50.","Historically, we have not raised our outlook this early in the year. However, we are now 120 days into our combination with General Parts and have learned more about their business through our integration efforts. This, coupled with our business momentum, has allowed us to increase our outlook.","As George shared, we now expect our BWP conversions to be complete by the end of 2014 versus our prior expectation of completing the conversions by midyear. We still estimate the BWP integration cost to be between $12 million to $15 million for the full year. As previously shared, we had a favorable onetime tax settlement within the quarter. Consequently, our first quarter tax rate is not representative of the rate for the balance of the year due to this onetime event. As such, we expect to maintain an effective tax rate of 38% for the balance of the fiscal year.","Finally, we estimate the 70 basis points reclass between SG&A and gross profit that I shared earlier will have approximately the same impact to the remaining quarters.","Turning to phasing. We're on pace to deliver our first year cost synergies. However, we expect the majority of these synergies will occur in the back half of the year.","In closing, we are pleased with our performance in the quarter and are off to a good start to the year. Our focus is still squarely set on our 2 key priorities of delivering on our base business outcomes and successfully integrating General Parts. The integration is progressing as expected, with the team generating some early quick wins while delivering the synergy benefits we expected. We continue to see team momentum and incremental progress in our efforts to simplify our business and are pleased with the progress we continue to see with our operational execution.","I want to once again thank our over 74,000 talented team members for what they do each and every day to serve our customers, inspire our team members and grow our great company.","Operator, we are now ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question today is from Gary Balter with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Gary Balter - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Darren, when you were talking, you were talking about sourcing and the first initiatives of WORLDPAC sourcing going into the markets, could you or George expand on that a little bit? And as part of that, how does AI fit into the picture?","Darren R. Jackson","Yes. WORLDPAC, a couple of things. One, their speed-dial system, which is their online ordering system, for a long time, they've had those installed in the capability in the CARQUEST stores. What we've done is taken a version of speed-dial and put it in 2 markets right now that allows our parts pros to be able to order the WORLDPAC products. So instead of going to maybe another competitor or dealer to get that product to deliver to our customers, what we're doing is offering a deeper selection of WORLDPAC product in our stores. We thought we'd test it in 2 markets. I got to tell you, it is an outsize piece of the second source business we do today, which means there's a group of customers out there that WORLDPAC has an industry-leading reputation, but there's still other customers that desire it that may not get as much access because they don't do enough volume, but they want it. And what we're seeing in our stores, we're able to supply that. In terms of Autoparts International, right now, it's business as usual in that we have so much going on in the integration process. That team is heads down in terms of executing their business plan. And the small things they are doing with the integration include working with the WORLDPAC team to see other parts of the Autoparts International product offer that could be distributed to WORLDPAC. And I think we won't take that decision lightly. We want to make sure it works for the WORLDPAC customers, but Autoparts International has product lines like their exhaust lines, absolutely revered in the industry. And so if we can increase distribution of their products where we're not essentially stepping on each other, whether that's Canada, whether that's out west or other select markets, we think that's yet another opportunity, and the teams are sizing that amongst many of the revenue opportunities that we're still working through. Would you add anything, George?","George E. Sherman","Just a couple things, Darren. First of all, I mentioned in my comments that second sourcing is a practice of looking internally. That's obviously a counterintuitive statement. Normally, second sourcing is looking elsewhere to find the parts because we didn't have it. I say that because we are now seeing a significant portion of second sourcing happening within the family, the combination of Advance Auto Parts, CARQUEST, WORLDPAC and Autopart International. So they both play key roles in that. I further say that the test of WORLDPAC in Advance stores is giving us a very nice halo effect. We think that WORLDPAC is a dynamite service model and it's now bringing that into the Advance store.","Gary Balter - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And do you find -- like because you're bringing it into Advance, how do you deal with the potential conflict from the CARQUEST store that had that already?","Darren R. Jackson","Yes. So Gary, we are going to have a few places, again, where there's conflict overall. But what we're talking about is a level of volume that I think the overall relationship between the stores is -- the way we've tried to build up between all of them is that our first goal is to always serve the end customer. And the volumes that we're talking about at this level, I don't think are really creating any angst at this point. You're going to have some flare-ups for sure. But at this point, the customers that are -- have the increased availability are really giving us positive feedback for it.","Gary Balter - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","That's great. And then one follow-up, and then I'll get off. We keep on talking about $160 million of cost synergies. But I'm assuming that doesn't include like any of the benefits you're seeing, like it's purely cost that we're talking. So we're not talking about any benefits from cross sourcing or this WORLDPAC sourcing I just asked about. Is that fair to think about it that way?","Michael A. Norona","Gary, I think a better way to think about it is, we haven't included any sale -- type of sales benefits in there. But remember, the synergies fall into 3 buckets: purchasing synergies, supply chain synergies and then scale and leverage synergies. So that's what we've said, and that's $160 million. And we've given the guidance this year of $45 million to $55 million. So things that benefit our margins around costs are included in those synergies.","Operator","The next question is from Greg Melich with ISI Group.","Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I wanted to follow up, if you could give any color in terms of how underlying gross margins were in the business, given the -- obviously, the comparables sort of screwed up given the acquisition. And I have a follow-up.","Michael A. Norona","Greg, it was tough to hear you. I think your first question was how was the underlying gross margins, is that -- was that the question?","Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Correct. Yes.","Michael A. Norona","Okay. Yes. So yes, when you put these 2 businesses together, you can see that there was a decline on our gross margin rate of 446 basis points, and that was primarily driven by the purchase of GPI, which has a higher mix of commercial and a lower gross profit rate. When you -- if you look into the businesses, we met the expectations with respect to our gross profit rate in both businesses. So we were pleased on that front. Obviously, a driver was the synergies we started off of the gate, even though the majority of the synergies will come in the back half of the year. We did see some synergies in the quarter from our purchasing. I think in my remarks I talked about that was about 24 basis points. But I think we're pleased with the progress we've made. Some of the drivers are our global sourcing, some of the supply chain efficiencies in GPI last year. They made some changes to their supply chain. Those showed up in margin. And then the offset of that obviously is the higher mix in commercial. So both businesses met the expectations with respect to gross profit rate.","Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","And the expectations were for basically flat with some improvement from synergies, just...","Michael A. Norona","No. What we said is that the gross profit rate would be modestly up, and that did not include the synergies.","Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then the second was on inflation. Is there any out there now? And if so, are you passing it through? And how does that bake into your outlook?","Charles E. Tyson","Yes, Greg. I'd say we see very modest inflation. There's some indication on oil going out into Q3 and Q4. If and when that passes through, we haven't seen any resistance from a general market competitive standpoint of being able to increase ASPs. You go out and you do your own checks, you can see how that's moved up in the oil business on a year-on-year basis. We think from a commodity standpoint, it's moderate. And what we're seeing in Asia is very moderate pressure on pricing capacity is -- there's plenty of capacity. So it's going to be moderate, consistent with probably the last 12 months.","Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's great. And I had one last one for George. I know when you got there last summer, you made some changes to how store managers are compensated, incentivized, et cetera. Could you give us an update on sort of the traction those initiatives are having? And how you think it's helped or hasn't helped as much as you'd hoped, if it hasn't?","George E. Sherman","Yes, sure. I'll hit a couple of them. I think we said early on that there really was no on-off switch for sales. It's a building block process and it's a series of steps that I think are leading us in the right direction. So we're very, very happy with the commercial evolution of our business and how our general managers, how our district leaders, how our regional vice presidents have really rallied around and begun to think commercial first and really drive that business. The outcomes focus, we've done an awful lot of work to clarify the message to our teams. We've removed extraneous metrics and kept them focused on the key ones, which really drive around growing our sales, providing great customer service and the profitability of our businesses. And that has worked. I think that has really kept our team laser-focused on the outcomes as opposed to the process metrics, which are important, but come secondarily. We really try to and, I think, have begun to build a culture of accountability and have a deep sense of performance management built in. So we have expectations every day. We have quarterly rhythms with our teams where they come in and we had all our regional vice presidents from across the corporation in last week. And they go through their business for the entire quarter and they meet with the leadership team and are accountable for that. And I'm very proud of the way that they've risen to the occasion and have taken ownership for and accountability for their overall business. And our conversations, and I think the significance of the comp is we're much more focused on conversations around sales and barriers to sales as opposed to expense management. Expense management has been extraordinary. The team has done a terrific job with that, and that really is just happening automatically within the business, and we're leveraging. But the conversation around growing the business and the hunger around growing the business and the competitiveness around growing the business really has our team culturing in a new place. And that may be one of the most important things that we have to say this quarter is that we have a good, healthy, competitive environment in our stores, in our field structure and a team that is really focused on growing their top line, growing their comps. So all-in, that plus the whole idea of the field-centric environment, where our support center has really risen to the occasion and has taken a great deal of pride in getting individual or groups of stores better poised to go capture sales has been a big, big win for us. So I'm pleased with the progress, and I think it's become culturally very noticeable in Advance Auto Parts.","Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","And when do you expect to roll that out into the CARQUEST group? Or you don't want to throw too much into it right now?","George E. Sherman","I think right now, we've been very focused on assimilation of the CARQUEST team and just building great relationships with the CARQUEST team. We've said before that culturally we're cut from the same cloth. The companies followed very similar paths as they grew up. So our relationship with CARQUEST field leadership and CARQUEST overall leadership has been tremendous. And we've integrated some of those folks. Al Wheeler is our Senior Vice President of Commercial for our enterprise now. Al comes from the CARQUEST business. Dave McCartney, he's the President of CARQUEST but is deeply integrated in all of our business rhythms going forward. And that's kind of happening across the board where the teams are cross-pollinating more and more. So when we had that meeting last week, when I mentioned we brought our field leadership into Roanoke for a series of quarterly business reviews, that meant CARQUEST too. So those general managers and those divisional vice presidents were here and part of that process, and I think got a lot of it and enjoyed their time.","Operator","The next question is from Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities.","Seth Basham - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","So my first question revolves around WORLDPAC as well. It looks like you have some nice early wins there in your test markets. Would you care to quantify what type of revenue synergies you're experiencing in those test markets?","Darren R. Jackson","They're good.","Seth Basham - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Okay. Taking to the other side, WORLDPAC core growth, you mentioned plenty of opportunity to grow geographically with that business. Can you give us a sense of where you are now, penetration-wise, and where you think you could be in a couple of years?","Darren R. Jackson","Yes, Seth. This is Darren. So a couple of things. So WORLDPAC is on track this year to open at least 6 more branches. Literally, as George was saying, the week before, George, Mike and I and a few others were out visiting with Bob Cushing. Their team is heads down running their base business, and their base business grew very nicely this quarter, both top line and bottom line. What we've asked Bob to do is give us a view by the end of the second quarter, I'll call it an artist rendering, is how big WORLDPAC can get over the next several years. We think with the 106-plus branches that he has, he is still early in his growth. And I think it's key that we not ask Bob to do something new. His formula is working. So he's identifying markets where he can take his model and continue to accelerate what he's doing best. And so what we had believed initially in the acquisition thesis, I would say, we're even more encouraged based on what we see today in terms of growth profile. I think some of the pleasant surprises have been there continues to be some product overlap between WORLDPAC, take basic things like Dorman. And so those things fit into the synergy profile, which is nice. And we also see a nice synergy in terms of how they're working with our e-commerce team out in California. They're 20 miles away from each other, and our e-commerce team helps support our B2B platform. So it's so far, so good. It's early days. Growth, we like it. What we can see in synergies, we're encouraged by. And what we can see in terms of, I would say, capability around technology should be synergistic between WORLDPAC and the greater enterprise, too.","Seth Basham - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","That's really helpful. And just making sure I'm clear, you talked about you like what you see with GPI. I assume, obviously, that refers to WORLDPAC. But what about the core CARQUEST business? How did that perform in the quarter? And what do you -- what's different than what you were experiencing or thinking prior to the acquisition?","Michael A. Norona","Seth, it's Mike. Maybe I'll start and I'll pass it to George. We're very pleased with the business. We've got a lot going on in our company with the integration. And as Darren said, we're focused on the base business and integration, and that team did a super job and they met the expectations around their plan. So we were very pleased.","George E. Sherman","Yes. Not much to add, Mike. I think -- again, we gave a series of targets to the CARQUEST team. And much like the overall enterprise, they met them. So we're pleased with the overall business trend and we're pleased with the integration progress. We're pleased culturally that the teams are overlapping well.","Operator","The next question is from Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets.","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I think a little bit of a follow-up here. Can you just help us understand a little bit GPI's total contribution to sales and EBIT in the quarter? And since we don't really have year-over-year quarterly actuals, kind of what that year-over-year change was? I think we're just trying to get a little bit more clarity on that.","Michael A. Norona","Yes. So Scot, it's Mike. We're not going to break out the businesses. And as I said in the remarks, is we view this combination now as an integrated expansion of our commercial assets and capabilities going after and growing our existing customers and attracting new customers. So that's how we think about the business. That's how the organization is rallying around growing this business, both from a growth and profit standpoint. I'll help you out a little bit. If you remember at the beginning of the year, to help you think about the year -- and I think it's good to think about the year and look at the top line and look at the bottom line. There's going to be a little bit of noise in the year when you put these businesses together because the gross margins are a little bit different and the SG&A is a little bit different. But if you look at the top line and are we growing and you look at the profit that we're growing, I think that's a good way to look at the business. When -- at the beginning of the year, we gave you a little bit of a cadence. If the businesses hadn't been combined last year, we said the business would have finished off somewhere between $9.4 billion and $9.5 billion. The gross profit rate would have been somewhere between 45.5% and 46% and the SG&A rate would have been somewhere between 36.5% and 37%. So that's what we said. And then what we -- and that was without synergies. And what we expected is we were going to add some synergies roughly $45 million to $55 million in synergies that would go into that -- that would be additional to that number. And then we expected that both businesses would grow. I think the only change that happens now with respect to those numbers is we did have a reclass of supply chain from accounting conformity, primarily on the GPI side. That moves SG&A from SG&A to gross profit about 70 basis points. I anticipate that's going to be there for the entire year. So if you adjust that out, I think we're right on plan for growing off those base numbers of 2013. And that's how I would think about it.","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","All right. Sounds like we're not going to get more than that. Another question is, we may wind up hearing more about this in the June Analyst Meeting. But should we expect store consolidation plans? And could that wind up changing the cost synergy assumption you guys have laid out for everybody?","Darren R. Jackson","Yes. We could -- Scot, this is Darren. We are working through, I think, in my prepared comments, by the end of Q2, to have a clear view on number of consolidations, number of conversions. You can imagine, we have an artist rendering today of that, and we're working with field teams to make sure that the artist rendering and the blueprint make sense. What we see is you're going to get a couple of things is that in our initial $160 million, we had some estimates for what the benefit would be from some of those consolidations. What we're doing now is -- BWP's helped us refine those. It's also helped us refine what the DIY lift will be in the converted stores. And then the other piece that we're still working through is that when you consolidate a store, there is a benefit to the existing store because the customers served out of that Advance store end up with a higher service level. So the core customers in the store should benefit as well, and we have the team working through that, too. We haven't finalized the analyst materials for the Analyst Day. But naturally, we expect that talking about the store conversion strategy would be something that would be on your mind.","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","That's helpful. And just a clarification on that, Darren. You mentioned that the DIY lift, but I thought the $160 million didn't include any revenue synergies? So is that -- help me reconcile those 2.","Darren R. Jackson","Yes. So there's 2 things going on. We will lose some -- when you consolidate the store, you're going to lose some Commercial Business because you're not going to retain 100% of the revenue. When we convert a store, we'll pick up some DIY. So we've made some preliminary estimates, not final estimates, as to what that impact would be in the $160 million, but we viewed that -- the primary benefit you're going to get from that is you get to leave some costs behind, right, Scot? And so that's why we've said it's in the fixed cost savings and we kind of netted out some of the revenue. I would say at this point, we're encouraged by what we've learned from BWP. And as we refine those estimates, you know what, we'll provide some context to that.","Operator","The next question is from Dan Wewer with Raymond James.","Daniel R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","I wanted to follow up on the integration with BWP, even prior to the GPI acquisition. The pace of that integration was running slower than the original plan. Can you give us more information as to what was responsible for that, and then what are the implications when you think about the consolidation conversion of that 1,200 company-owned CARQUEST stores?","George E. Sherman","Yes, Dan. I think when you look back at the BWP conversion, that's pre-acquisition, our role was relatively static. So we took those initial BWP stores. We converted them over to our product line. We converted them over to our systems. We consolidated. And things have changed for us now. So that was a learning process for us, and it was progressing. And we were poised to go ahead and take that one all the way through to completion. As you think about it now, they're CARQUEST stores. They were BWP owned but they're CARQUEST stores. We now have a larger conversion and consolidation process that's going to get into motion here, and we have to be considerate of the brand hierarchy that we're going to roll forward with. We have to consider the systems architecture we're going to roll forward with. And we have to consider the supply chain strategy that we're going to roll forward with. So all 3 of those things really make a pausing on this, I think a good idea and folding into the broader conversion strategy going forward. We don't want to make stores and teams go through change management twice. So we're going to be very careful that going forward, we've got our go-forward planning, then we're just going to roll it into the broader consolidation. But I would say that in general, there are aspects of consolidation and conversion now that are easier. We run different POS platforms, we own both now. We had different brands, we have access to both now. We had one DC network, we have a shared DC network that we're going to begin to optimize going forward.","Daniel R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","But with the consolidation in the BWP stores, so the stores that you've consolidated, what is the greatest distance between an Advance and a BWP store where a consolidation would makes sense? Are we talking about a 20-minute drive, 10-minute drive time between the 2?","George E. Sherman","I think in general terms, you think in terms of a 3-mile ring. These locations were really fairly close together. If there's a chance to have incremental new store count, we're going to take that. But it just makes a lot of financial sense to consolidate these businesses. We're in that 1-, 2-, 3-mile range.","Daniel R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","And George, also I wanted to ask you a question on the process of achieving the buying synergies. I mean, this must be a really daunting process for your buyers, over 100,000 active SKUs within the Advance network. I'm not sure how many that CARQUEST was managing, but it could be a similar number, right? So for your buyers to touch every category through this product line review, are we talking about a 6-month endeavor, a 1-year endeavor?","Charles E. Tyson","Dan, this is Charles. Fortunately, we have team members on both brands that have actually done acquisitions before. And so when we get into the technical side of lining up our assortments, we're well down that path and we feel very confident the teams are actually slightly ahead of the deadlines that I'd set them to get that work done. In terms of making sure that we stay on track from a synergy perspective to drive the outcomes, yes, they've got to get in and do the negotiations with our vendors, and that work is progressing to the targets that we set the team. So yes, the sheer size of the number of SKUs can sound daunting, but we've got a very focused process and a cadence inside both buildings to make sure that we stay on track, and I'm very happy with the work that the team has accomplished in the first 90 days.","Daniel R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","And just the last question I have, will the -- this product line review process and the savings that you're achieving, are there any negative consequences on the vendor-financed inventory programs, such that we might not see the payables inventory rate that we might have been expecting before the acquisition?","Michael A. Norona","No, Dan, it's Mike. Actually, I think we're really pleased by the early work we're seeing. As you saw, our AP ratio kind of gets recalibrated now to 76.1%. And Charles and the team are, I would say, are right on track. And I think what we said is that we expect that AP ratio to continue now to grow in a new base, as we work with our vendors and partner with them. And the whole idea of growing our AP ratio is around growth, getting more inventory into our stores and having the availability in order to serve the customers. So -- but we're on track in terms of what we anticipate as we go forward.","Operator","Our final question today comes from Mike Baker with Deutsche Bank.","Michael Baker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So one question on the guidance, up $0.10, but you're not raising the synergies. So I'm wondering where it's coming from. Is it coming from sales? Although the sales up 2.4% seem to be in line with your guidance. So just wondering where that is coming from.","Michael A. Norona","Yes, it's Mike. Typically, we wouldn't adjust our annual outlook this early in the year, and I think we said it in our remarks. I think where it's coming from is we've learned a little bit more about the businesses. The teams are working great together. Both base businesses are off to a great start. So that's a factor. And then the other factor is we had a little bit of a beat in our first quarter, and it gave us some momentum. That's another one. I think we still think the same on the synergies. I think we're on track for the $160 million over the first 3 years and I think we still feel good about achieving our $45 million to $55 million on the synergies for the year.","Michael Baker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So it's maybe cost savings or better margins in the underlying business or something along those lines?","Michael A. Norona","Yes, and I think George talked about it. I mean, we've got out of the gates pretty strong here in terms of the business momentum from a top line, and our teams are doing a great job on both sides of our business converting it to the bottom line.","Michael Baker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. Two more quick ones. You didn't talk about the comp outlook. You were previously thinking flat to up low single digits. Is that still the case even as comparisons get more difficult? And then one last one is would you say your total sales number was in line with where you thought they'd be, given a 2.4% comp?","Michael A. Norona","So I'll talk about the first one and I'll let George talk about. We really didn't go into all our assumptions. Again, it's too early in the year. We finished one quarter. The reason we give an annual outlook because there's always pluses and minuses that come out with the year. Obviously, as we see more of the year, we get more comfortable with that. But it's just too early. And I think what we felt is the $0.10 we thought was a responsible and prudent thing to do, just given the start we had to the year. But we really didn't change any of the other assumptions.","Darren R. Jackson","Well, and it's fair to say, Mike, as you said in your prepared remarks, absolutely pleased with the 2.4% comp and we're pleased with the sales momentum as we start the second quarter. So I don't -- it's a different way of asking was the 2.4% in our plan a total sales number, and I think Mike answered that question that, Mike, we are pleased with sales momentum. That's what we'd say. And we've got ways to go to finish out the year and a lot going on in terms of the integration efforts. We're just pleased. In simple terms, there's been no bump in the night at this point. And the teams are doing a great job on the base business, which I'm encouraged by, and they're achieving their integration time line. And I think for us to kind of change a myriad of things at this point so early in the year would be -- it wouldn't be genuine to you guys and it wouldn't be consistent with how we're running the business today. But...","Michael Baker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Right. No, understood. What -- well, I'll tell you what I was really getting at in that question was at least relative to consensus estimates, the comp was better, the total sales number was a little bit lighter. It's tough for us to model, putting these 2 businesses together. So that's what I attribute that to. But I was wondering if there was something else that maybe didn't perform as well as you expected.","Michael A. Norona","No. I think from our standpoint, I can't -- I don't run all the other models. I just run our plan model, and we exceeded expectations on both our comp and on the total sales.","Operator","Thank you. And that's all the time we have for questions. I will turn the call back to management for any final comments.","Zaheed Mawani","Thank you, Wendy, and thanks to our audience for participating on our first quarter earnings conference call.
